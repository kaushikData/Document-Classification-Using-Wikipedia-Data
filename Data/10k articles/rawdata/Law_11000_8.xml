'''Amortisation''' (or '''amortization'''; {{small|see [[spelling differences]]}}) is paying off an amount owed over time by making planned, incremental payments of [[principal (finance)|principal]] and [[interest]]. To amortise a loan means "to kill it off".&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;{{cite web|title=amortize|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amortize|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accounting, amortisation refers to charging or writing off an [[intangible asset]]'s cost as an [[operational expense]] over its estimated useful life to reduce a company's taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=amortization|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/amortization.html|website=BusinessDictionary|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster/&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word comes from Middle English ''amortisen'' to kill, alienate in [[mortmain]], from Anglo-French ''amorteser'', alteration of ''amortir'', from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''admortire'' "to kill", from [[Latin]] ''ad-'' and ''mort-'', "death".

==Applications of amortisation==
*When used in the context of a home purchase, amortisation is the process by which loan principal decreases over the life of a loan, typically an [[amortising loan]]. As each mortgage payment is made, part of the payment is applied as interest on the loan, and the remainder of the payment is applied towards reducing the principal. An [[amortisation schedule]], a table detailing each periodic payment on a loan, shows the amounts of principal and interest and demonstrates how a loan's principal amount decreases over time. An amortisation schedule can be generated by an [[amortisation calculator]]. [[Negative amortisation]] is an amortisation schedule where the loan amount actually increases through not paying the full interest.
*In business, [[amortisation (business)|amortisation]] allocates a lump sum amount to different time periods, particularly for loans and other forms of finance, including related [[interest]] or other finance charges. Amortisation is also applied to capital expenditures of certain assets under accounting rules, particularly [[intangible assets]], in a manner analogous to [[depreciation]].
*In [[tax law]] in the United States, [[amortisation (tax law)|amortisation]] refers to the cost recovery system for [[intangible property]].
*In [[computer science]], [[amortised analysis]] is a method of [[Analysis of algorithms|analyzing]] the execution cost of [[algorithms]] over a sequence of operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Algorithms | edition=third | author = Thomas H. Cormen | author-link = Thomas H. Cormen | author2 = Charles E. Leiserson | author2-link = Charles E. Leiserson | author3 = Ronald L. Rivest | author3-link = Ron Rivest | author4 = Clifford Stein | author4-link = Clifford Stein | last-author-amp = yes | url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms | publisher=MIT Press and McGraw-Hill. | chapter=Chapter 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In the context of [[zoning|zoning regulation]]s, amortisation refers to the time period a non-conforming property has to conform to a new zoning classification before the non-conforming use becomes prohibited. For example, if the city rezones property from industrial to residential and sets an amortisation period of one year, all property within the rezoned boundary must move from industrial use to residential use within one year.
*In the context of Securitization the Joshua Curve relates to a unique amortisation profile that results in the innovative "horseshoe Shape" or "J Shape" weighted average life ("WAL") distribution. In other words, if the base case results in a WAL of 10.0 years, the stress case and performance case would both result in reduced WALs that are both less than 10.0 years due to accelerated amortisation.

The '''Australia–France Marine Delimitation Agreement''' is a 1982 [[treaty]] between [[Australia]] and [[France]] which [[boundary delimitation|establishes]] [[ocean]] [[border]]s between Australian territories and French territories.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). {{Google books|E7-menNPxREC|''International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas,'' pp. 60–61, 64|page=60}}; Charney, Jonathan I. ''et al.'' (1993). ''International Maritime Boundaries,'' Vol. 1, p. 905; Charney, (1998). {{Google books|o5ft2DfBJcIC| Vol. 2, pp. 1185–1194.|page=1185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty was signed in [[Melbourne]] on 4 January 1982. The treaty sets out two separate [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]]. The first is the boundary between Australia and [[New Caledonia]] in the [[Coral Sea]] (including the boundary between Australia's [[Norfolk Island]] and New Caledonia). It consists of 21 straight-line segments defined by 22 individual coordinate points forming a modified equidistant line between the two territories. For purposes of drawing the treaty's equidistant lines, it was assumed that France has sovereignty over [[Matthew and Hunter Islands]], a territory that is also claimed by [[Vanuatu]]. The northernmost point in the boundary is a [[tripoint]] with the [[Solomon Islands]]. The boundary runs in a roughly north–south direction and then turns and runs west–east until it almost reaches the [[170th meridian east]].

The second boundary established by the treaty is that between [[Heard and McDonald Islands]] (Australia) and [[Kerguelen Island]] (France) in the southern [[Indian Ocean]]. This boundary is also roughly equidistant and consists of seven straight-line segments defined by eight individual coordinate points.

The treaty came into force on 10 January 1983 after it was [[ratification|ratified]] by both states. The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement on Marine Delimitation between the Government of Australia and the Government of the French Republic''.

'''Battery cages''' are a housing system used for various animal production methods, but primarily for [[chicken|egg-laying hens]].  The name arises from the arrangement of rows and columns of identical cages connected together, in a unit, as in an [[artillery battery]]. Although the term is usually applied to poultry farming, similar cage systems are used for other animals. Battery cages have generated controversy between advocates for [[animal rights]] and industrial producers.

Battery cages are the predominant form of housing for laying hens worldwide.&lt;ref name="Horne Achterbosch 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Horne | first=P.L.M.

==Examples==
Battery cages also used for [[mink]], [[rabbit]], [[chinchilla]] and [[fox]]es in [[fur farming]], and most recently for the [[Asian palm civet]] for [[kopi luwak]] production of coffee.

==History==

[[File:Chicken coopbattery cages in the 1950s.jpg|thumb|A [[chicken coop]] from the 1950s]]
An early reference to battery cages appears in Milton Arndt's 1931 book, ''Battery Brooding'', where he reports that his cage flock was healthier and had higher egg production than his conventional flock.&lt;ref name="Arndt"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arndt |first=Milton |title=Battery Brooding |edition=2nd |publisher=Orange Judd Publishing |year=1931 |pages=308–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this early date, battery cages already had the sloped floor that allowed eggs to roll to the front of the cage, where they were easily collected by the farmer and out of the hens' reach.  Arndt also mentions the use of conveyor belts under the cages to remove manure, which provide better air control quality and reduce fly breeding.&lt;ref name="Arndt" /&gt;

Original battery cages extended the technology used in battery brooders, which were cages with a wire mesh floor and integral heating elements for brooding chicks. The wire floor allowed the manure to pass through, removing it from the chicks' environment and reducing the risk of manure-borne diseases.

Early battery cages were often used for selecting hens based on performance, since it is easy to track how many eggs each hen is laying if only one hen is placed in a cage. Later, this was combined with artificial insemination, giving a technique where each egg's parentage is known. This method is still used today.
[[File:56.000 kippen leggen 40.000 eieren per dag.ogv|thumb|right|Video advertising the system in the early history of the battery cage]]
Early reports from Arndt about battery cages were enthusiastic. Arndt reported:&lt;blockquote&gt;"This form of battery is coming into widespread use throughout the country and apparently is solving a number of the troubles encountered with laying hens in the regular laying house on the floor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the first edition of this book I spoke of my experimental work with 220 pullets which were retained for one year in individual cages. At the end of this year it was found that the birds confined in the batteries outlaid considerably the same size flock in the regular houses. The birds consume less feed than those on the floor and this coupled with the increased production made them more profitable than the same number of pullets in the laying house.&lt;ref name="Arndt" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of progressive poultrymen from all over the United States and some in foreign countries cooperated with me in carrying on experimental work with this type of battery and each and every one of them were very well satisfied with the results obtained. In fact, a number of them have since placed their entire laying flocks in individual hen batteries."&lt;ref name="Arndt" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967, Samuel Duff filed a patent for "battery cages" in patent US3465722.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents?id=ni1zAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Battery cages|author=United States Patent Office|year=1969|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of laying batteries increased gradually, becoming the dominant method somewhat before the integration of the egg industry in the 1960s. The practice of battery cages was criticized in [[Ruth Harrison]]'s landmark book ''Animal Machines'', published in 1964.&lt;ref name="washington post 2001"&gt;{{cite news  |title = Md. Egg Farm Accused of Cruelty  |publisher = ''Washington Post'' |date = 6 June 2001 |url = http://www.isecruelty.com/article.php |accessdate = 30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Indiapoultry.JPG|thumbnail|right|A simple battery cage system with no conveyors for feed or eggs]]
In 1990, North and Bell reported that 75% of all commercial layers in the world and 95% in the United States were kept in cages.&lt;ref name="North"&gt;{{cite book |last=North |first=Mack O. |author2=Donald E. Bell |title=Commercial Chicken Production Manual |edition=4th |year=1990 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |pages=297, 315 |isbn=0-87055-446-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By all accounts, a caged layer facility is more expensive to build than high-density floor confinement, but can be cheaper to operate if designed to minimize labor.

North and Bell report the following economic advantages to laying cages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. It is easier to care for the pullets; no birds are underfoot.
2. Floor eggs are eliminated.
3. Eggs are cleaner.
4. Culling is expedited.
5. In most instances, less feed is required to produce a dozen eggs.
6. Broodiness is eliminated.
7. More pullets may be housed in a given house floor space.
8. Internal parasites are eliminated.
9. Labor requirements are generally much reduced&lt;ref name="North" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also cite disadvantages to cages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. The handling of manure may be a problem.
2. Generally, flies become a greater nuisance.
3. The investment per pullet may be higher than in the case of floor operations.
4. There is a slightly higher percentage of blood spots in the eggs.
5. The bones are more fragile and processors often discount the fowl price.&lt;ref name="North" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Disadvantages 1 and 2 can be eliminated by manure conveyors, but some industrial systems do not feature manure conveyors.&lt;ref name="singer175"&gt;{{cite book |title= In Defense of Animals|last= Singer|first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Singer |year= 2006|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell|location= |isbn= 1-4051-1941-1|page= 175|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
{{expand section|date=September 2009}}

===European Union===
In 1999, the [[European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC]]&lt;ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"/&gt; banned the conventional battery cage in the EU from 2012, after a 12-year phase-out.  In their 1996 report, the European Commission's Scientific Veterinary Committee (SVC) condemned the battery cage, concluding:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is clear that because of its small size and its barrenness, the battery cage as used at present has inherent severe disadvantages for the welfare of hens".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The EU Directive allows enriched or "[[Furnished cages|furnished]]" cages to be used. Under the directive, enriched cages must be at least 45&amp;nbsp;cm high and must provide each hen with at least 750&amp;nbsp;cm² of space; 600&amp;nbsp;cm² of this must be "usable area" – the other 150&amp;nbsp;cm² is for a nest-box. The cage must also contain litter, perches and "claw-shortening devices". Some animal welfare organisations, such as [[Compassion in World Farming]], have criticised this move, calling for enriched cages to be prohibited as they believe they provide no significant or worthwhile welfare benefits compared with conventional battery cages.

Germany banned conventional battery cages from 2007, five years earlier than required by the EU Directive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciwf.org.uk/resources/publications/poultry_laying_hens/default.aspx|title=Species: laying hens - Compassion in World Farming|website=ciwf.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has prohibited enriched cages from 2012.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  Mahi Klosterhalfen of the Albert Schweitzer Foundation has been instrumental in a strategic campaign against battery cages in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vegan.com/podcast/2009/04/15/vegtalk-podcast-mahi-klosterhalfen-and-the-end-of-the-battery-cage/|title=VegTalk Podcast: Mahi Klosterhalfen and the End of the Battery Cage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
Switzerland banned battery cages from 1 January 1992; it was the first country to impose such a ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landwirtschaft.ch/de/wissen/tiere/gefluegelhaltung/haltung/|title=Haltung - Schweizer Landwirtschaft|website=www.landwirtschaft.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{US battery cage ban map}}
The passage of [[California Proposition 2 (2008)]] aimed, in part, to reduce or eliminate the problems associated with battery cages, by setting the standard for space relative to free movement and wingspan, rather than cage size.

Battery cages are also illegal in Michigan due to HB 5127, passed in 2009, which mandates that certain farm animals have enough room to stand up, lie down, turn around and extend their limbs, rather than being confined in tiny cages.&lt;ref name="HSUS on Michigan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mich. Gov. Granholm signs historic farm animal welfare measure|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2009/10/mich_gov_granholm_signs.html|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=12 October 2009|publisher=Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ohio, there is a moratorium on permits for the construction of new battery cages as of June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Landmark Ohio Animal Welfare Agreement Reached Among HSUS, Ohioans for Humane Farms, Gov. Strickland, and Leading Livestock Organizations | url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2010/06/landmark_ohio_agreement_063010.html | website=Humane Society of the United States | date=30 June 2010 | accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oregon SB 805 also banned battery cages and set forth a transition to enriched colony cages, doubling the space per egg-laying hen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oregon.gov/ODA/programs/ISCP/Hens/Pages/RequirementsInspections.aspx|title=Oregon Department of Agriculture: Requirements and Inspections|website=www.oregon.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2011R1/Measures/Overview/SB805|title=SB805 2011 Regular Session -  Oregon Legislative Information System|website=olis.leg.state.or.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law served as the model for a national agreement between the [[Humane Society of the United States]] and the [[United Egg Producers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.humanesociety.org/wayne/2011/07/landmark-egg-agreement.html|title=Landmark Agreement to Help Millions of Hens · A Humane Nation|date=7 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The 2009 'Code of Practice' permits the use of battery cages. A written commitment by the Federal government to review the practice was scheduled in 2010; there was no further communication.  During 2013 the state government of Tasmania was planning to phase out battery cages and budgeting for financial compensation for affected farmers but this was scrapped following the 2014 election.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-18/tasmania-to-ban-battery-hen-farming/4019200M ABC Tasmania to ban Battery Hen Farming&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tas government scraps free-range egg plan|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/tas-government-scraps-free-range-egg-plan/story-e6frfku9-1226894982657|accessdate=15 June 2014|publisher=News.com.au|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to change the law have been an object of contention; [[RSPCA Australia]] officially campaigns against cage eggs.

==Welfare concerns==
There are several welfare concerns regarding the battery cage system of housing and husbandry.  These are presented below in the approximate chronological order they would influence the hens.

===Chick culling===
{{main|Chick culling}}
Due to modern [[selective breeding]], laying hen [[strain (biology)|strains]] are different from those of meat production strains. Male birds of the laying strains do not lay eggs and are unsuitable for meat production, therefore, they are culled soon after [[Chick sexing|being sexed]], often on the day of hatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/info/laying.html#male |title=Egg laying and male birds |publisher=Vegsoc.org |accessdate= |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222091817/http://www.vegsoc.org/info/laying.html#male |archivedate=22 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of culling include [[cervical dislocation]], [[asphyxia]]tion by [[carbon dioxide]] and maceration using a high speed grinder.

Animal rights groups have used videos of live chicks being placed into macerators as evidence of cruelty in the egg production industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video Shows Chicks Ground Up Alive at Egg Hatchery|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,545540,00.html?test=latestnews|accessdate=8 September 2012|newspaper=The Associated Press.|date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maceration, together with cervical dislocation and asphyxiation by carbon dioxide, are all considered acceptable methods of euthanasia by the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avma.org/issues/animal_welfare/euthanasia.pdf AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712174941/http://www.avma.org/issues/animal_welfare/euthanasia.pdf |date=12 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/sep06/060915e.asp Executive Board meets pressing needs - September 15, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524214925/http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/sep06/060915e.asp |date=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers may also be appalled simply by the death of animals that are not subsequently eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = M.

===Beak-trimming===
{{main|Debeaking}}
To reduce the harmful effects of [[feather pecking]], [[Cannibalism (poultry)|cannibalism]] and [[vent pecking]], most chicks eventually going into battery cages are beak-trimmed.  This is often performed on the first day after hatching, simultaneously with sexing and receiving vaccinations.  Beak-trimming is a procedure considered by many scientists to cause acute pain and distress with possible chronic pain; it is practised on chicks for all types of housing systems, not only battery cages.&lt;ref name ="Sherwin et al. 2010" /&gt;

===Cage size===
[[File:Animal Abuse Battery Cage 01.jpg|thumb|Battery cage]]
At approximately 16 weeks of age, pullets (hens which have not yet started to lay) are placed into cages.  In countries with relevant legislation, floor space for battery cages ranges upwards from 300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per bird. EU standards in 2003 called for at least 550&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per hen.&lt;ref&gt;Chickens: Layer Housing, M.C. Appleby, Encyclopedia of Animal Science. {{doi|10.1081/E-EAS-120019534}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the current recommendation by the United Egg Producers is 67 to 86 in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (430 to 560&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) per bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uepcertified.com/pdf/2010-uep-animal-welfare-guidelines.pdf | title = Animal Husbandry Guidelines for U.S. Egg Laying Flocks | author1 = United Egg Producers | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The space available to each hen in a battery cage has often been described as less than the size of a sheet of [[ISO 216|A4 paper]] (624 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="washington post 2003"&gt;{{cite news|title=Animal Pragmatism: Compassion Over Killing Wants to Make the Anti-Meat Message a Little More Palatable |publisher=''Washington Post'' |date=3 September 2003 |url=http://www.cok.net/feat/article-wp.php |accessdate=30 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DIAXlvM8?url=http://www.cok.net/feat/article-wp.php |archivedate=30 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have commented that a typical cage is about the size of a filing cabinet drawer and holds eight to 10 hens.&lt;ref name="singer175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes 2002"&gt;{{cite news  |title = Advocates for Animals Turn Attention to Chickens  |publisher = ''The New York Times'' |date = 4 December 2002 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/04/us/advocates-for-animals-turn-attention-to-chickens.html |accessdate = 30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioural studies showed that when turning, hens used 540 to 1006&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, when stretching wings 653 to 1118&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, when wing flapping 860 to 1980&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, when feather ruffling 676 to 1604&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, when preening 814 to 1240&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and when ground scratching 540 to 1005&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Stamp Dawkins and Hardie, (1989)"&gt;Stamp Dawkins, M. and Hardie, S., (1989).

''British Poultry Science'', '''30''': 413-416. {{doi|10.1080/00071668908417163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A space allowance of 550&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; would prevent hens in battery cages from performing these behaviours without touching another hen.  [[Animal welfare science|Animal welfare scientists]] have been critical of battery cages because of these space restrictions&lt;ref name="Nicol and Dawkins, (1989)"&gt;Nicol, C.J. and Dawkins, M., (1989).  No room for manoeuvre. ''New Scientist'', '''16''' September 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and it is widely considered that hens suffer boredom and frustration when unable to perform these behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Appleby |first=M.C. |first2=J.A. |last2=Mench |first3=B.O. |last3=Hughes |year=2004 |title=Poultry Behaviour and Welfare |publisher=CABI Publishing |location= Wallingford and Cambridge MA |isbn=0-85199-667-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spatial restriction can lead to a wide range of [[abnormal behaviour of birds in captivity|abnormal behaviours]], some of which are injurious to the hens or their cagemates.

===Light manipulation===
{{further|Feather pecking#Light manipulations}}
[[File:Animal Abuse Battery Cage 02.jpg|thumb|Battery cages - note the low light intensity beyond range of the camera flashgun]]
To reduce the harmful effects of feather pecking, cannibalism and vent-pecking, hens in battery cages (and other housing systems) are often kept at low light intensities (e.g. less than 10 lux).  Low light intensities may be associated with welfare costs to the hens as they prefer to eat in brightly lit environments&lt;ref name="Prescott and Wathes, 2002"&gt;Prescott, N.B. and Wathes, C.M., (2002). Preference and motivation of laying hens to eat under different illuminances and the effect of illuminance on eating behaviour.  ''British Poultry Science'', '''43''': 190-195&lt;/ref&gt; and prefer brightly lit areas for active behaviour but dim (less than 10 lux) for inactive behaviour.&lt;ref name="Davis et al., 1999"&gt;Davis, N.J., Prescott, N.B., Savory, C.J. and Wathes, C.M., (1999). Preferences of growing fowls for different light intensities in relation to age, strain and behaviour.  ''Animal Welfare'', '''8''': 193-203&lt;/ref&gt;  Dimming the lights can also cause problems when the intensity is then abruptly increased temporarily to inspect the hens; this has been associated as a risk factor of increased feather pecking&lt;ref name="Green et al., 2000"&gt;Green, L.E., Lewis, K., Kimpton, A. and Nicol, C.J., (2000).  Cross-sectional study of the prevalence of feather pecking in laying hens in alternative systems and its association with management and disease.  ''Veterinary Record'', '''147''': 233-238&lt;/ref&gt; and the birds can become frightened resulting in panic-type ("hysteria") reactions which can increase the risk of injury.

Being indoors, hens in battery cages do not see sunlight.  Whilst there is no scientific evidence for this being a welfare problem, some animal advocates indicate it is a concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aact.org.au/battery_hens.htm Against Animal Cruelty Tasmania (AACT) - Battery Hen Campaign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920142107/http://www.aact.org.au/battery_hens.htm |date=20 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chooseveg.com/eggs.asp Prevent Cruelty to Chickens in the Egg Industry by Adopting a Vegan Diet | ChooseVeg.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125001410/http://www.chooseveg.com/eggs.asp |date=25 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furnished cages and some other non-cage indoor systems would also prevent hens seeing natural light throughout their lives.

===Osteoporosis===
Several studies have indicated that toward the end of the laying phase (approximately 72 weeks of age), a combination of high calcium demand for egg production and a lack of exercise can lead to [[osteoporosis]].  This can occur in all housing systems for egg laying hens, but is particularly prevalent in battery cage systems where it has sometimes been called 'cage layer osteoporosis'.&lt;ref name="SVCEC"&gt;{{cite web |author=Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Commission |year=1996 |title=Report on the Welfare of Layer Hens |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/oldcomm4/out33_en.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926222924/http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/oldcomm4/out33_en.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Osteoporosis leads to the skeleton becoming fragile and an increased risk of bone breakage, particularly in the legs and [[Keel (bird anatomy)|keel]] bone.  Fractures may occur whilst the hens are in the cage and these are usually discovered at depopulation as old, healed breaks, or they might be fresh breaks which occurred during the process of depopulation.  One study showed that 24.6% of hens from battery cages had recent keel fractures whereas hens in furnished cages, barn and [[free-range]] had 3.6%, 1.2% and 1.3% respectively. However, hens from battery cages experienced fewer old breaks (17.7%) compared to hens in  barn (69.1%), free-range (59.8%) and furnished cages (31.7%).&lt;ref name ="Sherwin et al. 2010"&gt;Sherwin, C.M., Richards, G.J and Nicol, C.J., (2010).

===Forced moulting===
{{main|Forced moulting}}
Flocks are sometimes force moulted, rather than being slaughtered, to reinvigorate egg-laying.  This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7 to 14 days&lt;ref name="Patwardhan and King, (2011)"&gt;Patwardhan, D. and King, A., (2011).  Review: feed withdrawal and non feed withdrawal moult. ''World's Poultry Science Journal'', '''67''': 253-268&lt;/ref&gt; or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%.&lt;ref name="Webster, (2003)"&gt;Webster, A.B., (2003).  Physiology and behavior of the hen during induced moult. ''Poultry Science'', '''82''': 992-1002&lt;/ref&gt; This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also reinvigorates egg-production.  Some flocks may be force moulted several times.  In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US.&lt;ref name="Yousaf and Chaudhry, (2008)"&gt;Yousaf, M. and Chaudhry, A.S., (2008). History, changing scenarios and future strategies to induce moulting in laying hens.  ''World's Poultry Science Journal'', '''64''': 65-75&lt;/ref&gt; This temporary starving of the hens is seen as inhumane and is the main point of objection by critics and opponents of the practice. The alternative most often employed is to slaughter the hens instead of moulting them.

==Improving welfare for egg producing hens==
The Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Commission stated that "enriched cages and well designed non-cage systems have already been shown to have a number of welfare advantages over battery systems in their present form".&lt;ref name="SVCEC" /&gt; Supporters of battery husbandry contend that alternative systems such as free range also have welfare problems, such as increases in [[Cannibalism (poultry)|cannibalism]], [[feather pecking]] and [[vent pecking]].  A recent review of welfare in battery cages made the point that such welfare issues are problems of management, unlike the issues of behavioural deprivation, which are inherent in a system that keeps hens in such cramped and barren conditions.&lt;ref name="Morris1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10806-006-9007-8 |last=Morris |first =M.C. |year=2006 |title=The ethics and politics of the caged layer hen debate in New Zealand |volume=19 |pages=495–514 |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Free range egg]] producers can limit or eliminate injurious pecking, particularly [[feather pecking]], through such strategies as providing environmental enrichment, feeding mash instead of pellets, keeping roosters in with the hens, and arranging nest boxes so hens are not exposed to each other's vents;&lt;ref name="Morris1" /&gt; similar strategies are more restricted or impossible in battery cages.

The '''Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment''', or '''Cape Town Treaty''' is an international [[treaty]] intended to standardize transactions involving movable property. The treaty creates [[international standard]]s for registration of contracts of sale (including dedicated registration agencies), [[security interest]]s ([[lien]]s), [[finance lease|leases]] and conditional sales contracts, and various legal remedies for [[default (finance)|default]] in financing agreements, including repossession and the effect of particular states' [[bankruptcy]] laws.

Three protocols to the convention are specific to three types of movable equipment: Aircraft Equipment (aircraft and aircraft engines; signed in 2001), railway rolling stock (signed in 2007) and space assets (signed in 2012).

The treaty resulted from a diplomatic conference held in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] in 2001. The conference was attended by 68 countries and 14 international organizations. 53 countries signed the resolution proposing the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| vauthors =| title =Diplomatic Conference to adopt a Mobile Equipment Convention and an Aircraft Protocol, Cape Town, South Africa, 29 October - 16 November 2001| work =| publisher =International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT)| date =| url =http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/mobile-equipment/conference2001/main.htm| archive-url =https://archive.is/20130416051029/http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/mobile-equipment/conference2001/main.htm| dead-url =yes| archive-date =2013-04-16| doi =| accessdate =2006-11-22}}

The Aircraft Protocol (which applies specifically to aircraft and aircraft engines) took effect on 1 March 2006 when it was ratified by 8 countries: [[Ethiopia]], [[Ireland]], [[Malaysia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Oman]], [[Panama]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[United States]].

==Signatures and ratifications==
As of 2018, the convention has been ratified by 77 states as well as the [[European Union]]. The railway rolling stock and the space protocols have been ratified by respectively three countries (Gabon, Luxembourg and Sweden), as well as the European Union, and no countries and thus have not taken effect. An overview of the status of the treaty and protocols is shown below:

===European Union===
The European Union joined the convention and the Aircraft Protocol as a [[Regional Economic Integration Organization]]. On the subject of the convention, both the [[Member states of the European Union]] and the Union itself have competence: e.g. while the [[substantive law]] regarding [[insolvency]] is regulated by the states, the [[conflict of law]]-rules (which county has jurisdiction etc.) is regulated by the European Union. According to the Government of the Netherlands the acceptance of the European Union in a member state which itself is not a party to the convention has no practical consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kst-32227-A.html|title=32 227 (R 1904) Verdrag inzake internationale zakelijke rechten op mobiel materieel en Protocol bij het Verdrag inzake internationale zakelijke rechten op mobiel materieel betreffende voor luchtvaartmaterieel specifieke aangelegenheden; Kaapstad, 16 november 2001|language=Dutch|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=13 March 2012|work=Government of the Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union ratified the Luxembourg Rail protocol in December 2014 as a [[Regional Economic Integration Organization]] on the same basis.

===Aircraft Protocol===
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}
The ''aircraft Protocol'' (officially: ''Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on matters specific to aircraft equipment'') was signed immediately with the treaty and the only protocol currently entered into force. It applies to aircraft which can carry at least eight people or 2750 kilograms of cargo, aircraft engines with thrust exceeding {{convert|1750|lbf|N}} or {{convert|550|hp}}, and helicopters carrying five or more passengers. The [[International Registry of Mobile Assets]] established to record international property interests in the aircraft equipment covered by the treaty is located in Ireland. Mediation cases for leasing disputes are to be heard in the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2008/05/11/story32799.asp |title=Aircraft leasing disputes to be heard in Dublin |work=Sunday Business Post |date=11 May 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the protocol has 73 contracting parties, which includes 72 states and the [[European Union]].

===Railway Rolling Stock===
{{wikisource|Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Railway Rolling Stock}}
The ''Railway Rolling Stock Protocol'', or ''Luxembourg Rail Protocol'', officially the ''Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Railway Rolling Stock'' was adopted on 23 February 2007 at a diplomatic conference in Luxembourg and applies to railway rolling stock (broadly defined as "vehicles movable on a fixed railway track or directly on, above or below a guideway").

The protocol establishes an international registry located in Luxembourg at which all international interests under the protocol will be registrable. The registry will also issue unique identifiers for rolling stock on request. Regulis S.A., a subsidiary of SITA, was appointed in November 2014 to act as Registrar. The protocol requires ratification by 4 countries, together with a certification by the secretariat to the Supervisory Authority that the registry is fully operational, in order to enter into force. Currently it has been signed by France, Gabon, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Mozambique, Switzerland, Sweden, the UK as well as the European Union, while it has been ratified by the European Union and 3 states: Gabon, Luxembourg and Sweden.

===Space Assets===

=== Mining, Agricultural, and Construction (MAC) Equipment ===
As of 2018, a fourth protocol to the convention was being developed to extend the convention's framework to mining, agricultural, and construction (MAC) equipment. A diplomatic conference to adopt the MAC protocol is expected in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unidroit.org/work-in-progress/mac-protocol|title=STUDY LXXII K – DEVELOPMENT OF A FOURTH PROTOCOL TO THE CAPE TOWN CONVENTION ON MATTERS SPECIFIC TO MINING, AGRICULTURAL AND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT|last=|first=|date=|website=UNIDROIT|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Conflict of laws}}
'''Characterisation''', or '''characterization''', in [[private international law|conflict of laws]], is the second stage of the procedure to resolve a [[lawsuit]] that involves foreign law. The process is described in [[English law]] as ''Characterisation''&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc [1996] WLR 387&lt;/ref&gt;, or ''classification'' within the English judgments of the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;C-359/14 and C-475/14 Ergo Insurance SE (2016) ECLI:EU:C:2016:40&lt;/ref&gt; It is alternatively known as ''qualification'' in [[French law]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

It is used to determine the correct [[choice of law]] rules based on the circumstances of the case, primarily relating to matters of property. This is to reconcile differences between laws of different legal [[jurisdictions]]. The objective of characterisation is to determine the nature of the action brought by the defendant in order to determine what relevant rules of applicable law apply. This may result in applying laws which differ from the ''[[lex fori]]''. Additional factors make this determination not necessarily a simple process as the [[incidental question]] and [[renvoi]] can make determining the initial point of reference difficult. The leading authority in England and Wales is [[Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (No 3)]] [1996] WLR 387

==Overview==
Characterisation is one of the key element in demarcating the choice of law and jurisdiction issues. The first stage is for the [[court]] to determine if it has [[jurisdiction]], if appropriate, to avoid [[forum shopping]]. Once the forum court decides that it has [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case, it must characterise or classify the cause(s) of action, this relates to [[choice of law]] matters. That is regarded as the most important and difficult problem in conflict of laws as trade and travel between [[sovereign state|states]] has become the norm. The effects of broken promises, defective goods, traffic accidents and marital squabbles are no longer confined to the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] territory of one particular state or nation. This is especially complicated because domestic laws usually operate to satisfy domestic interest. Various causes in actions and their respective remedies differ depending on the state. This derive from historical and political circumstances.  The addition of the [[Rome I Regulation| Rome I]] and [[Rome II Regulation]]s to the European Union conflict of laws regime is designed to determine the choice of law which applies to situations where commercial or civil matters of broken promises, defective goods, traffic accidents, etc with a party which is domiciled in a Member State. 

The role of characterisation within a international private law adjudication might be highlighted if understood within the simplest example of the sale of a bicycle by A to B. The transaction has both [[contractual]] and [[Ownership|proprietary]] elements. Different jurisdictions will characterise the matter in different ways depending on their own laws. As is crucial within the international private law context, it is the responsibility of the adjudicating court to determine the proper law and subsequently apply it. 

For example, in English law, two separate methods for characterising the cause of action exist. The first, are commercial and civil matters relating to contractual and non-contractual obligations. The [[Rome Regulation]]s determine choice of law rules in said matters by providing an allocative framework for characterisation. By contrast, the second method is that of the common law rules, applying to matters of property, marriage, and matters which fall outside the Rome Regulations. In ''Macmillan Inc. v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc'' [1996] 1 ALL E R 585, Auld LJ. accepted that "the proper approach is to look beyond the formulation of the claim and to identify according to the ''lex fori'' the true issue or issues thrown up by the claim and the defence". In both cases, characterisation depends on determining the applicable law to the set of facts in order to determine the choice of law. This is often done in reference to the ''[[lex causae]]'', the "law of the causes". However, the ''lex causae'' would, under certain circumstance, be problematic to determine the facts of the case. 


==Decision on law to be applied==
Although it may appear logical to allow the whole of the ''lex causae'', including its characterisation rules, to apply, it actually produces a circular argument: the ''lex causae'' is to apply to the process of characterisation before the process of characterisation has led to the choice of the relevant ''lex causae''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  Certain exceptions to the application of the ''Lex Causae'' are outlined below. 

Thus, the conflict rules of the ''[[lex fori]]'', the domestic law of the forum, (i.e. the court dealing with the case,) are usually applied even if, in extreme cases, the application of only the substantive provisions of the foreign law by the forum court could produce a judgment that neither the ''lex causae'' nor the ''lex fori'' would normally have produced.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Nevertheless,there are several cases when characterisation is not made by the ''[[lex fori]]'':
* choice of law clause ([[lex voluntatis]]), such as those regulated by Article 4 of the Rome II Regulation
* subsequent characterisation (which is a problem of the ''lex causae'')
* real estate or immovables (when [[lex situs]] applies)
* renvoi
* unknown legal institutions{{explain|date=April 2018}}
* law of nationality (when [[lex patriae]] applies)
* international treaties



==Process==
The court is required to analyse the [[pleadings]] prepared by the [[party (law)|parties]] and to assign each component element to the most appropriate juridical concept or category. The rules of any given system of law are arranged under different categories, addressing [[procedure (conflict)|procedure]], [[status (law)|status]], [[contract (conflict)|contract]], [[tort (conflict)|tort]], [[divorce (conflict)|divorce]], [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]] etc. For each category, there is one or more choice of law rule(s). Thus, for example, all questions as to the status of a person before a court (a [[minor (law)|minor]] or adult, [[legitimacy (family law)|legitimate, legitimated or illegitimate]], [[marriage (conflict)|married]] or not, mentally incapacitated or not, [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] or not etc.) will all be governed by the person's personal law, the law of [[nationality]] (the ''[[lex patriae]]'') or [[habitual residence]] in a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] state, or the law of [[domicile (law)|domicile]] (the ''[[lex domicilii]]'') in a [[common law]] state.

In English law, the complete application of Characterisation is limited in commercial and civil matters by the [[Rome I Regulation|Rome I]] and [[Rome II Regulation]]s which provides a framework for categorisation of said matters within the European Union regime. English common law characterisation has resultantly become limited to all matters which do not fall within Rome Regulations (matters which are not civil and commercial matters). This includes matters of property and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Pippa Rogerson, Collier's Conflict of Laws, Fourth Edition, Cambridge University Press, 377&lt;/ref&gt; Staughton LJ ''Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust''&lt;ref&gt;[1996] WLR 387, Para 391-392&lt;/ref&gt; sets out three stages {{Quote|In any case which involves a foreign element it may prove necessary to decide what system of law is to be applied, either to the case as a whole or to a particular issue or issues. Mr. Oliver, for Macmillan Inc., has referred to that as the proper law; but I would reserve that expression for other purposes, such as the proper law of a contract, or of an obligation. Conflict lawyers speak of the lex causae when referring to the system of law to be applied. For those who spurn Latin in favour of English, one could call it the law applicable to the suit (or issue) or, simply, the applicable law. It is presumably here that the Rome regulations intercede. Applying overtop the three stage processes.
In finding the lex causae there are three stages [...] First, it is necessary to characterise the issue that is before the court. Is it for example about the formal validity of a marriage? Or intestate succession to moveable property? Or interpretation of a contract? [...]

The second stage is to select the rule of conflict of laws which lays down a connecting factor for the issue in question. Thus the formal validity of a marriage is to be determined, for the most part, by the law of the place where it is celebrated; intestate succession to moveables, by the law of the place where the deceased was domiciled when he died; and the interpretation of a contract, by what is described as its proper law. [...]

Thirdly, it is necessary to identify the system of law which is tied by the connecting factor found in stage two to the issue characterised in stage one. Sometimes this will present little difficulty, though I suppose that even a marriage may now be celebrated on an video link. The choice of the proper law of a contract, on the other hand, may be controversial.
In an ideal world the answers obtained in these three stages would be the same, in whatever country they were determined. But unfortunately the conflict rules are by no means the same in all systems of law. In those circumstances a choice of conflict rule may have to be made[...]}}

This means that in England, the specific legal problem will be governed by the law of the connecting factors. The leading text of Dicey &amp; Morris formulates the question, using the example of the constitution of a corporation in the following manner:
{{Quote | [All matters concerning the constitution of a corporation(CATEGORY) are governed by the law of the [place of incorporation(CONNECTING FACTOR)]}}
Thus, the category, which is determined by understanding the substantive question at hand, is used to identify a relevant connecting factor. The first stage must be used to determine the "character" of the claim (hence characterisation). This is not necessarily the name of the action but the type. i.e. Not necessarily conversion but it is a matter relating to ownership of personal property. Lord Mance in ''Raiffeisen Zentral Bank'' expressed caution with relation to allowing the rules to control decision and emphasised the importance of determining the core matter which is sought to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;[2001] QB 825 at 841&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''MacMillan'', it was whether the parties were bona fide purchasers for value without notice. This  The second and third stages of this test are determined by the ''lex fori''. The  
Characterising laws as either procedural or substantive is necessary, but that part of the process can be abused by the forum court to maximise the use of the local law.

The generality of the characterisation process is not and cannot be wholly scientific. It is always a matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, how is the issue to be classified? One might say that any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the ''lex loci actus''. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the ''lex loci domicilii''. Also, it may be a matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of [[title (property)|title]] to land must be adjusted by the ''[[lex situs]]'', as the law of the place of the land. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action.

One of the most enduring solutions to this problem was proposed by [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]] (1779–1861). He argued that it was always necessary for the court to find the "natural seat" or "centre of gravity" for the case by identifying the largest cluster of "connecting factors" to a particular legal system. If all courts adopted such an international outlook, he reasoned, that would eliminate forum shopping by producing the same choice of law no matter where the case began. Unfortunately, the theory has not delivered the desired results. Forum shopping remains a problem, and neither legislators nor judges have been able to agree on characterisation issues, producing classifications that extend rather than reduce international divergences.

In an attempt to avoid obviously-unjust results in particular cases, some judges have created a number of public policy exceptions to justify decisions "on the merits". Ernest G Lorenzen commented that the strategy was a warning that there must be serious problems with the rules if policy exceptions were the solution.

==Under European Union Regulations==
Choice of law characterisation within the European regime relating to civil and commercial matters is determined by the [[Rome I Regulation]] and [[Rome II regulation]]. The Rome I regulation, succeeding the [[Rome Convention (contract)|Rome Convention]] regulates choice of law rules regarding ''contractual obligations'', meaning voluntary obligations between two parties, which uses the definition that is used for Article 7.1 of the Brussels Regulation: ''"An obligation freely entered into with regard to another, identified, person"''.&lt;ref&gt;C-29/91 Jakob Handte [1992] ECR I-3967&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the Rome II regulation covers non-contractual obligations, including Torts, delicts, and semi-delicts. The determination of whether a matter is contractual or non-contractual may, at first glance, appear straightforward but becomes complicated when one considers how to categorise pre-contractual obligations/libability&lt;ref&gt;Article 12(1)(e) Rome II regulation &lt;/ref&gt; and disputes, or fiduciary duties existing between contracting parties (which are neither non-contractual nor contractual obligations that may arise as a result of a contract). The question of characterisation becomes crucial to determining which regulation applies. The leading authority of ''C-359/14 Ergo Insurance SE (2016)'' outlined the distinction between when a contract, in this circumstance an insurance agreement, would be categorised as either contractual or non-contractual. The decision affirmed that the first stage of applying choice of law rules, particularly those in the European regime, must be determining the categorisation, or "classification"&lt;ref&gt;C-359/14 Ergo Insurance (2016) para 30&lt;/ref&gt; of the disputes. In the European context, 'contractual obligation' and 'non-contractual obligation' must be interpreted independently from national law. The concept of 'non-contracutal obligation' was determined broadly and by reference, at least in part, to the obligations which did not fall within 'contractual obligations' (as defined by ''C-375/13 Kolassa'' paragraph 39).

==Exclusion of foreign law==
Because the early system of connecting factors was mechanical and inflexible, the results could offend a court's sense of justice.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} For example, with the development of the motor car, the classification of the cause as tort required the application of the ''[[lex loci delicti commissi]]'' rule. In [[France]], the [[Court of Cassation]]'s insistence on the rule frequently barred or severely limited relief for French parties injured in states with no developed law for the compensation of such victims. The lower courts used a variety of judicial devices to avoid the injustice.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

'''English Method'''
In England, the common law of private international law applies the ''lex fori'' or encores any provision of the ''lex causae'' if the area of penal, even, and other public laws . This is a matter of justiciability, and not merely jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey &amp; Morris, Rule 3 Cf Adrian Briggs, 'Conflict of Laws' Third Edition, OUP, 200&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, not only does the English court hold that it has no jurisdiction in the matter, it is unable to hear matters relating to penal, revenue, or other public laws as the recognition of foreign states is one of [[Politics|statecraft]] and is a power retained by the sovereign, not with the courts.&lt;ref&gt;''USA v Inkley'' [1989] QB 255; ''Mbasogo v Logo (No 1)'' [2005] EWHC 2034 Cf Australian Cases of Attorney General for the United Kingdom v Heinemann (1988) 165 CLR 90&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning of the court in Australia through the spycatcher case was that complying with friendly foreign government decisions placed the courts in difficult positions in the future to determine matters which derived from the sovereign. This was confirmed in the UK through ''The Barakat Galleries v Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran''.&lt;ref&gt;[2007] EWCA Civ 1374&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of foreign penal laws or foreign revenge law is relatively straight forward, a foreign penal law is a law which imposes a fine and is paid to the state. English law considers this ''lex fori''.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington v Attrill [1893] AC 150&lt;/ref&gt; Payment to a private individual is unlikely to be considered penal, even if the payment is seen as a penalty or deterrent.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Conflict of Laws Ch4. Choice of Law: The lex fori, 201&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a revenue law is one which a party cannot opt out of, enforcement cannot be by action in the English courts. The English courts determine a foreign revenue law on the ground that a party may receive a hand back as evidence that the obligation to pay the state is not a foreign revenue law. The third category of 'other public laws' is traditionally one which relate to a claim in action in which only a state can claim, such as tort damages and costs of quashing a rebellion/revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Mbasogo v Logo (No 1) [2005] EWHC 2034&lt;/ref&gt; Any claim which is founded on a right which is uniquely governmental will not be adjudicated. 

English rules will also limit choice of law where matters offend English public policy. It overrides foreign ''lex causae''. An example may be of where a foreign government passes laws to strip certain parties of property wherein the property is not within the foreign government's jurisdiction. For example, Ruritania passes a law that all Ruritanian gold coins owned by a certain group are now owned by the state. If a Ruritanian citizen is living in London with possession of the coins in London, the English court will not recognise an action for adjudication by the Ruritanian government to recover the coins. This relates both to foreign law and to public policy because the foreign law is so repellent to English standards that even to know that it was made was unbearable.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer v Cattermole [1976] AC 249; Kuwait Airways v Iraq Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5) [2002] UKHL 19&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-commercial context, this will often apply to matters of divorce and marriage as well. A foreign law which allows marriage of uncle and niece will not be contrary to English Public Policy, however, if the marriage has nothing to do with England.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng v Cheng [1965] P 85&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, two thresholds of English Public Policy exist in limiting ''lex causae'', one which applies regardless and a second, higher threshold which only applies if issues have a real and substantial connection with England.&lt;ref&gt;Pippa Rogerson ''Collier's Conflict of Laws'' Fourth Edition, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''U.S. Method'''
Comparatively, in the US, the New York Court of Appeals set a national trend in ''[[Babcock v. Jackson]]'', 240 N.E.2d 279 (N.Y. 1963), which abandoned the ''lex loci delicti'' rule completely. Most jurisdictions have not been so radical and preferred to retain the framework of categories and choice of law rules but left [[public policy (law)|public policy]] in place, as an avoidance device. That exception provides that states will not apply any foreign law that offends the deeply held principles of the forum state's legal system. For example, it would be considered improper to give enforcement to a law that defined the status of a person as a [[slavery|slave]] or as in the [[possession (law)|possession]] of another, such as for the purposes of sexual exploitation. In cases involving alleged immorality or injustice, that rule has been criticised as susceptible to abuse, as a court could characterise almost any statute or rule as being offensive to the public policy of their state. Less controversial are bars to any cases that would give extraterritorial effect to laws which are [[confiscation|confiscatory]], seeking to collect taxes owing in another state, or [[penal laws|penal]]: laws that are designed to punish the party committing the ''wrong'', rather than those to compensate the party that suffered loss or injury. That can sometimes lead to a fine balancing act between claims for compensatory and exemplary [[damages]]. In the US, the concept of ''governmental interest analysis'' was developed by [[Brainerd Currie]] and is preferred by many American conflicts writers. Currie focused on each state's substantive rules, rather than on a metaphorical test, for the ''seat'' of the legal relationships and assumed that governments are less interested in what happens within their territorial boundaries than in the well-being of their subjects. The methodology that he proposed relies almost entirely on the personal nexus between the litigants and the states. However, there is no single test for this ''nexus'' at an international level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} {{clarify|date=April 2018}} Some states use the concept of domicile, others nationality, and the remainder citizenship; also, definitions of domicile vary from state to state. That methodology has thus never been accepted outside the US. Also, if the litigants are from different states, relying on one personal law rather than another may be arbitrary. To cope with that difficulty, Currie advocated that the ''lex fori'' should be applied whenever his method produced what he called a "true conflict".Critics have alleged that Currie's approach is nothing more than a complex pretext to avoid applying foreign law if there are two or more personal laws.

==Modern approach==
Since characterisation and the choice of law rules were operating inflexiblly,{{dubious|date=April 2018}} the solution has been to allow the growth of judicial discretion within both parts of the system. Hence, most legal systems{{Which|date=April 2018}} have opted for what English law calls the ''[[proper law]]'' approach: the identification and application of the law that has the closest connection with the cause(s) of action. It is accepted that the words have the same apparent spirit as the older approach, which requires some caution in their evaluation.

In theory, flexibility will preserve an international outlook and multilateral approach by the courts and in most places, the results are encouraging.{{by whom|date=April 2018}} {{dubious|date=April 2018}}{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the US, however, the test now adopted is termed the ''most significant contacts'' test or, in a slightly modified form defined in the Second Conflicts Restatement, the ''most significant relationship'' test. However, because different courts have interpreted these impressionistic phrases in different ways, there has been little judicial consistency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14319">"'''Compensation culture'''" (often shortened to "'''compo culture'''") is a pejorative term used to imply that, within a society, a significant number of claims for compensation for [[tort]]s are unjustified, [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous]], or [[fraud]]ulent, and that those who seek compensation should be criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Torts|first=Janice Elliott|last=Montague|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon|edition=10th|date=12 December 2012|page=49|isbn=978-0-415-52461-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compensation culture: Third report of session 2005-06|volume=2|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-215-02780-1|author=Parliament: [[Constitutional Affairs Committee|House of Commons Constitutional Affairs Committee]]|date=10 March 2006|page=Ev 188 ¶22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BRTF"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Better Routes to Redress|date=May 2004|publisher=Cabinet Office Publications &amp; Publicity Team|location=London|isbn=0711504571|author=Better Regulation Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe a "where there's blame, there's a claim" culture of [[Lawsuit|litigiousness]] in which compensation is routinely and improperly sought without being based on the application of legal principles such as [[duty of care]], [[negligence]], or [[Causation (law)|causation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Compensation culture: Fact or fantasy?|date=15 March 2013|publisher=Judicial Office Communications Team|location=London|work=[[Judiciary of England and Wales]]|author=[[Master of the Rolls]]|id=Holdsworth Club Lecture.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Walker [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] defines it as "an ethos [which believes that] all misfortunes short of an [[Act of God]] are probably someone else's fault, and that the suffering should be relieved, or at any rate marked, by the receipt of a sum of money."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Ronald|last1=Walker|first2=Sarah|last2=Veale|title=Compensation culture: myth or reality?|work=[[The Times|The Times Law Supplement]]|location=London|date=7 October 2003|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a compensation culture has also been conflated with [[Health and safety law|health and safety legislation]] and excessively risk-averse decisions taken by corporate bodies in an apparent effort to avoid the threat of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=I'll end health and safety compensation culture says PM|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=5 January 2012|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/ill-end-health-and-safety-compensation-culture-says-pm-7304754.html|location=London|first=Joe|last=Murphy|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title='Compensation culture' myth examined by Leigh Day: Lord Young announces review of health and safety laws|date=5 October 2010|url=http://www.leighday.co.uk/News/2010/October-2010/%E2%80%98Compensation-culture%E2%80%99-myth-examined-by-Leigh-Day|accessdate=29 July 2013|work=[[Leigh Day]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=13 May 2013|title=We are not amused...

The phrase was coined in an article by [[Bernard Levin]] in London's ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper dated 17 December 1993.&lt;ref name="Hand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hand | first1 = J. | title = The Compensation Culture: Cliché or Cause for Concern? | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6478.2010.00522.x | journal = Journal of Law and Society | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 569–591 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article, largely a [[polemic]] against the [[welfare state]], carried the sub-heading: "We may laugh at ludicrous court cases in America, but the compensation culture began in Britain and is costing us dear."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|authorlink=Bernard Levin|first=Bernard|last=Levin|title=Addicted to welfare|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=17 December 1993|page=20|issue=64829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media myth==
The term is especially used in [[tabloid journalism]] and by advocates of [[tort reform]] to describe a perceived legal climate with regard to torts in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]]. [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Lord Dyson]], the [[Master of the Rolls|third most senior judge]] in England and Wales, has dismissed the existence of a compensation culture in the UK as a false perception and a "media-created myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Compensation culture is 'media-created' myth - Dyson|date=25 March 2013|first=John|last=Hyde|work=[[The Law Society Gazette]]|location=London|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/compensation-culture-media-created-myth-dyson|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Hand, writing in the ''Journal of Law and Society'', observed that sensationalist stories about compensation awards "evidently make for good copy; national newspaper articles concerning the compensation culture have increased exponentially since the mid 1990s," while statistics conversely demonstrated "a broad decline" in the number of claims during the same period.&lt;ref name=Hand/&gt;

Research published in 2006 examined the data held by the Compensation Recovery Unit, a government agency which enabled the state to recover from tort damages any [[Department of Social Security|social security benefits]] paid as a result of an accident or disease. This found "no evidence that the tort system has been flooded with an increasing number of personal injury claims in recent years" and concluded that "the number of claims [had] been relatively stable since at least 1997–1998," the first year for which statistics were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Tort personal injury claims statistics: Is there a compensation culture in the United Kingdom?|first1=Richard|last1=Lewis|first2=Annette|last2=Morris|first3=Ken|last3=Oliphant|date=July 2006|volume=14|journal=Torts Law Journal|pages=158–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Monbiot]], a British writer and political activist, said: "Compensation culture has usurped [[political correctness]], [[Benefit fraud|welfare cheats]], single mothers and [[New Age travellers]] as the right's new bogeyman-in-chief. According to the [[Confederation of British Industry]] (CBI), the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and just about every newspaper columnist in Britain, it threatens very soon to bankrupt the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The risks of a killing: Compensation culture is a myth - ask the thousands who will die this year from asbestos|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1352227,00.html|last=Monbiot|first=George|authorlink=George Monbiot|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=16 November 2004|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Better Regulation Commission]] (BRC) report published in 2004 concluded that there was no compensation culture in the UK.&lt;ref name=BRTF/&gt; The commission also found that the myth of the compensation culture was largely perpetuated by the media.&lt;ref name=BRTF/&gt; [[Janet Paraskeva]], then [[The Law Society]]'s chief executive, commented: "Ironically, it seems that those who most decry the possibility of a compensation culture are probably responsible for perpetuating the belief that there is one – resulting in more and more of the bizarre decisions by schools and local authorities that journalists are so quick to mock."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Exploding the myth|date=18 November 2004|first=Janet|last=Paraskeva|authorlink=Janet Paraskeva|work=[[The Law Society Gazette]]|location=London|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/features/exploding-myth|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analyst put it more bluntly: "Loose talk of a 'compensation culture' no doubt helps to sell the very sorts of newspapers that purport to despise it most."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Kevin|year=2005|title=State of fear: Britain's "compensation culture" reviewed|journal=[[The Society of Legal Scholars|The Journal of The Society of Legal Scholars]]|volume=25|issue=3|pages=499–515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levin's 1993 article related the details of several personal injury claims which had succeeded in the United States, and warnings of 'American-style litigiousness' arriving in the UK were common in many articles in the domestic media during the late 1990s. This coincided with vigorous lobbying in the United States by special interest groups and business organisations in support of product liability reform which would place restrictions on laws allowing consumers to sue companies for damages caused by faulty products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Product-liability Limit Draws A Veto; Dole Points To Clout Of Trial Lawyers|first=Robert A.|last=Rankin|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=Philadelphia|date=3 May 1996|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-05-03/news/25626471_1_tobacco-companies-veto-president-clinton|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The hand that rocks the cradle|first=Jeanne|last=Brokaw|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|location=San Francisco|date=September–October 1996|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1996/09/hand-rocks-cradle?page=1|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Product Liability Reform: Boondoggle or Boon?|first=David|last=Hipschman|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|location=Boston|date=4 May 1995|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False perceptions and fear of litigation==
Kevin Williams, writing in the ''Journal of Personal Injury Law'', said: "The fact that there may be no objective proof that we live in an increasingly 'blame and sue' society is beside the point when an 'urban myth' to the contrary is said to have taken hold. Thus, whatever the actual likelihood of being the target of litigation, many increasingly believe themselves to be at heightened risk of being unfairly sued."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=K.|last=Williams|title=Politics, the media and refining the notion of fault: section 1 of the Compensation Act 2006|journal=Journal of Personal Injury Law|year=2006|pages=347–354.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 BRC report came to the same conclusion, stating that the myth of a compensation culture in the UK was "a commonly held perception" which created an exaggerated fear of litigation and led to organisations becoming excessively risk-averse and "over cautious in their behaviour."&lt;ref name=BRTF/&gt; However, research commissioned by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) in 2008 to assess "the extent to which disproportionate health and safety management occurs" found that "most organisations do not report the examples of excessive [health and safety management] quoted in the media" but still perceived "a problem with risk aversion" in the UK in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evidence based evaluation of the scale of disproportionate decisions on risk assessment management|first1=Michael|last1=Wright|first2=Catherine|last2=Beardwell|first3=David|last3=Pennie|first4=Rachel|last4=Smith|first5=John Norton|last5=Doyle|first6=Evangelos|last6=Dimopoulos|publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]]|date=June 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, according to Sally Lloyd-Bostock, a professor of Law and Psychology, demonstrated that even the "perceptions of the effects of perceptions" were not based on evidence but instead on what Marc Galanter, professor of Law at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], dubbed "anecdotes, atrocity stories and unverified assertions" perpetuated by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lloyd-Bostock|first=Sally|page=94|title=Anticipating Risks and Organising Risk Regulation|editor-first=Bridget M.|editor-last=Hutter|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=August 2010|isbn=978-0-521-19309-2|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Marc|last=Galanter|title=Real World Torts: an Antidote to Anecdote|volume=55|journal=[[University of Maryland School of Law|Maryland Law Review]]|page=1093|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Common Sense, Common Safety'', a 2010 report by [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|Lord Young of Graffham]] to the Prime Minister reviewing "health and safety laws and the growth of the compensation culture" also found "there is no end to the constant stream of misinformation in the media" and that the "overriding opinion" of the organisations questioned (including the [[Confederation of British Industry]], the [[Trades Union Congress]], [[Families Against Corporate Killers]], the [[Police Federation of England and Wales]] and the [[International Institute of Risk and Safety Management]]) was that "the health and safety agenda had been hijacked by the tabloid press, whose reports often contributed to misinterpretation and misunderstandings by regularly exaggerating and ridiculing instances which in reality have little or nothing at all to do with health and safety." The "broad consensus" of these groups was that "they did not believe there was a growing compensation culture in the UK" but that there was a "public perception of one that stifles opportunities and leads business to take an overcautious attitude when attempting to interpret health and safety regulations in the workplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Common Sense, Common Safety|date=October 2010|authorlink=David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|author=Lord Young of Graffham|publisher=Cabinet Office|location=London|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60905/402906_CommonSense_acc.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}
A '''copyright collective''' (also known as a '''copyright collecting agency''', '''licensing agency''' or '''copyright collecting society or collective management organization''') is a body created by [[copyright law]] or private agreement which engages in [[collective rights management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collective Management of Copyright|last=Gervais|first=Daniel|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2010|isbn=978-90-411-2724-2|location=Netherlands|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collecting societies have the authority to [[license]] copyrighted works and collect royalties as part of [[compulsory licensing]] or individual licences negotiated on behalf of its members. Collecting societies collect royalty payments from users of copyrighted works and distribute royalties to copyright owners.

Authors of literary or artistic works as well as holders of related rights enjoy exclusive rights to authorise or prohibit the use of their works. In cases where the rights cannot be enforced vis-à-vis individual members of the public or where individual management would not be appropriate, given the number and type of uses involved, right holders are granted a remuneration right instead.  These rights are typically managed by collecting societies.

The underlying idea of collective rights management, whereby copyright and related rights are managed collectively, is widely shared and collecting societies have a key role in all developed countries. Because of historical, legal, economic and cultural diversity among countries, regulation of collecting societies and the markets where they act vary from one country to another. In Europe collecting societies require their members to transfer them exclusive administration rights of all of their works. United States and Canada have less restricting rules as members maintain their rights simultaneously with collecting societies.  In the United States, a distinction is made between a copyright collective (which dictates prices and terms for the individual copyright holders it represents) and a collecting society (which allows individual holders to set those terms).&lt;ref name="Landolt"&gt;{{cite book | title= Collective Management of Copyright and Related Rights | last= Landolt| first= Phillip | year= 2006 | page= 313 | series= | publisher= Kluwer Law International | location= | isbn= 9789041123589 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W_N0ctyT10wC&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=%22copyright%20collective%22&amp;pg=PA314#v=onepage&amp;q=%22copyright%20collective%22&amp;f=false | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright collecting societies in the [[European Union]] usually hold monopolies in their respective national markets.&lt;ref name="monopoly"&gt;{{cite book | title= Copyright Law: A Handbook of Contemporary Research | last= Torremans | first= Paul | year= 2007 | page= 263 | series= Research Handbooks in Intellectual Property | publisher= Edward Elgar Publishing | location= Cheltenham | isbn= 978-1-84542-487-9 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;pg=PA263 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries create a statutory monopoly, while others recognise effective monopolies through regulations.&lt;ref name="monopoly"/&gt; In Austria, the Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers (''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft der Autoren, Komponisten und Musikverleger}}'', AKM) has a statutory monopoly.&lt;ref name="monopoly"/&gt; German law recognizes [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|GEMA]] as an effective monopoly, and as such, the burden of proof is on the accused infringer that a work is not managed by GEMA.&lt;ref name="monopoly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|[[:de:Urheberrechtswahrnehmungsgesetz|Urheberrechtswahrnehmungsgesetz]]}} (Copyright Administration Act), 9 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societies' tasks ==
A copyright collective, once established first needs to acquire the right to license from copyright owners, creating as large a collection as possible. This acquisition is guided by the legal regime of the country - some jurisdictions create legal monopolies (Hungary, for example&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2011/12/07/the-legal-monopoly-of-hungarian-cmos-will-be-abolished/|title=The legal monopoly of Hungarian CMO’s will be abolished - Kluwer Copyright Blog|date=2011-12-07|work=Kluwer Copyright Blog|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while ''de facto'' monopolies arise in others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Supra note 1, at p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Once rights are acquired, the copyright collective then has to collect data of uses of copyrighted works. The processing of this data will enable the copyright collective to discharge its functions, including the detection of unauthorized use, negotiation of licenses, collection of remuneration and distribution of collected remuneration amongst the members of the copyright collective on the basis of collected data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, copyright collectives may dedicate a portion of their collected remuneration towards encouraging creativity in their respective sphere. 

Collecting societies can sell '''blanket licences''', which grant the right to perform their catalogue for a period of time. Such a licence might for example provide a broadcaster with a single annual authorisation encompassing thousands of songs owned by thousands of composers, lyricists and publishers. The societies also sell '''individual licenses''' for users who reproduce and distribute music. For example, [[Apple Computer|Apple]] must submit the download reports for the [[iTunes Store]], which are used to determine their royalty payments.

In the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]], when dealing with works that are performed (such as music) these groups are called [[performance rights organisation]]s or PROs. Other organizations such as artist rights groups license and collect royalties for the reproduction of paintings of living or recently deceased artists whose work has not yet entered the [[public domain]].  There are also collectives that collect royalties for copies from magazines and scholarly journals such as [[Access Copyright]] in Canada.

'''Declarationism''' is a legal philosophy that incorporates the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] into the body of case law on level with the [[United States Constitution]]. It holds that the Declaration is a [[natural law]] document and so that natural law has a place within American jurisprudence. Its main proponents include [[Harry V. Jaffa]] and other members of the [[Claremont Institute]]. Some proponents claim that Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] is a follower of this school of thought; however, Thomas is more widely considered a member of the [[strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] school.

In ''Cotting v. Godard, 183 U.S. 79'' (1901), the United States Supreme Court stated:
:The first official action of this nation declared the foundation of government in these words: "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. "While such declaration of principles may not have the force of organic law, or be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and duty, and while in all cases reference must be had to the organic law of the nation for such limits, yet the latter is but the body and the letter of which the former is the thought and the spirit, and it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. No duty rests more imperatively upon the courts than the enforcement of those constitutional provisions intended to secure that equality of rights which is the foundation of free government."
Proponents claim that the concept is derived from the philosophical structure contained in the Declaration of Independence and assertion that it was the Declaration that revealed the United States as a new emergent nation, the Constitution creating only the federal government. According to this view, the authority to create the Constitution derives from the prior act of nation-creation accomplished by the Declaration. The Declaration declares that the people have a right to alter or abolish any government once it becomes destructive of their natural rights. The turn away from the [[Articles of Confederation]] with the ratification of the Constitution was an action of this sort and so the Constitution's authority exists within the legal framework established by the Declaration. The Constitution cannot, then, be interpreted as though it were the foundation of constitutional law, in the absence of principles derived from the Declaration.

Though philosophically conservative, Declarationists such as Jaffa have been outspoken critics of [[originalism|originalist construction]] jurists including [[Robert Bork]], [[Antonin Scalia]], and [[William Rehnquist]], likening them to [[legal positivism|legal positivists]]. Bork and legal scholar [[Lino Graglia]] have, in turn, critiqued the Declarationist position, retorting that it is single-mindedly obsessive over the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision and resembles a [[theology]] rather than a legal doctrine.

The '''Defence of India Act 1915''', also referred to as the '''Defence of India Regulations Act''', was an emergency [[criminal law]] enacted by the [[Governor-General of India]] in 1915 with the intention of curtailing the nationalist and revolutionary activities during and in the aftermath of the First World War.&lt;ref name=Horniman44&gt;{{Harvnb|Horniman|1984|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was similar to the British [[Defence of the Realm Acts]], and granted the Executive very wide powers of preventive detention, internment without trial, restriction of writing, speech, and of movement. However, unlike the English law which was limited to persons of hostile associations or origin, the Defence of India act could be applied to any subject of the King,&lt;ref name=Horniman44/&gt; and was used to an overwhelming extent against Indians.
The passage of the act was supported unanimously by the non-official Indian members in the Viceroy's legislative council, and was seen as necessary to protect against British India from [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|subversive nationalist violence]]. The act was first applied during the [[First Lahore Conspiracy trial]] in the aftermath of the failed [[Ghadar Conspiracy]] of 1915, and was instrumental in crushing the Ghadr movement in Punjab and the ''Anushilan Samiti'' in Bengal.&lt;ref name=Bates118&gt;{{Harvnb|Bates|2007|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popplewell210/&gt; However its widespread and indiscriminate use in stifling genuine political discourse made it deeply unpopular, and became increasingly reviled within India. The extension of the law in the form of the [[Rowlatt Act]] after the end of World War I was opposed unanimously by the non-official Indian members of the Viceroy's council. It became a flashpoint of political discontent  and nationalist agitation, culminating in the [[Rowlatt Satyagraha]]. The act was re-enacted during World War II as [[Defence of India act 1939]]. Independent India retained the law in a number of amended forms, which have seen use in proclaimed states of national emergency including [[Sino-Indian War]], [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh crisis]], [[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency of 1975]] and subsequently the [[Khalistan movement|Punjab insurgency]].

==Background==
{{See also|Revolutionary movement for Indian independence}}
Punjab and Bengal, along with Maharashtra, became hotbeds of revolutionary nationalist violence against British rule in India in the first decade of the 20th century. 1905 partition of Bengal and the 1907 colonisation bill in Punjab fed growing discontent. In Bengal, revolutionary organisations like ''[[Anushilan Samiti]]'' and ''[[Jugantar]]'' drew young recruits from the educated middleclass ''[[Bhadralok]]'' ranks, and engaged in a number of prominent attacks on both figures in the administration as well as the local police investigating incidents of robbery, violence and murder linked to these groups. These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants, prominent public figures and Indian informants. In 1907 attempts were made on the life of the Bengal Lieutenant-Governor Sir [[Andrew Fraser (Governor of Bengal)|Andrew Fraser]]. In 1908, a failed assassination attempt by ''Jugantar'' on the life of Presidency Magistrate Douglas Kingsford led to death of two European women. In 1909, a failed assassination attempt saw two bombs thrown at [[Lord Minto]]. In December that year the magistrate of [[Nasik]] [[A. M. T. Jackson]] was shot dead by [[Anant Kanhere]], and suspicion fell on links to [[India House]] in London which was at the time being led by [[V. D. Savarkar]] whose elder brother Ganesh had been convicted by Jackson of seditious conspiracy. India House was also held responsible for the murder in London of [[William Hutt Curzon Wyllie]], the political ADC to the secretary of state to India.  A number of assassinations were also carried out of approvers who had turned crown-witnesses. In 1909 Naren Gossain, crown-witness for the prosecution in [[Alipore bomb case]], was shot dead within [[Alipore Jail]] by [[Satyendranath Bose]] and [[Kanailal Dutt]]. Ashutosh Biswas, an advocate of Calcutta High Court in charge of prosecution of Gossain murder case, was shot dead within Calcutta High Court in 1909.In 1910, Shamsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Bengal Police responsible for investigating the Alipore Bomb case, was shot dead on the steps of Calcutta High Court.
In Punjab, agitation against the 1907 colonisation bill attempting to introduce law of primogeniture had stirred agitation. Punjab police had become aware of nuclei of nationalist movements arising in Punjab in the form of the nascent Ghadr movement, fed by resources and efforts of emigrant Sikh communities in Canada.&lt;ref name=Riddick92&gt;{{Harvnb|Riddick|2006|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations into the 1912 [[Delhi conspiracy case|attempt to assassinate]] the then [[Viceroy of India]], [[Charles Hardinge]], led to the discovery of the links between Bengal revolutionaries led by erstwhile Jugantar member [[Rash Behari Bose]], and Ghadr movement in Punjab.

==Early laws==

===Preventive detention===
The Bengal Regulation of 1812 and [[Bengal Regulation III of 1818|Regulation III of 1818]] were some of the earliest laws in British India to incorporate the provisions of [[Preventive detention]], without having to commit the detenue to trial.&lt;ref name=Hindu&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/op/2004/09/07/stories/2004090700101500.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the Presidencies of [[Presidency of Madras|Madras]] and [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]],  similar laws had been enacted in 1819 and 1827 respectively.&lt;ref name=V.B.Patel553&gt;{{Harvnb|Patel|1995|p=532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners under these regulations had no right of ''[[habeas corpus]]''.&lt;ref name=Ghosh398&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghosh|1995|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code introduced the writ of Habeas Corpus in 1882.&lt;ref name=Ghosh398/&gt; In 1907, emergency ordinances were issued in Punjab and in Eastern Bengal and Assam on the fiftieth anniversary of the 1857 mutiny. This allowed abolishment of public meetings, and the Indian press was subjected to controls to limit seditious material being published.&lt;ref name=Riddick92/&gt; The Explosive Substances Act and the Newspaper Act were passed in June 1908 to try and arrest agitation.

In June 1907 local governments were further authorised to initiate proceedings against local press publishing seditious material amongst civilian population or the army.&lt;ref name=Riddick92/&gt; ''[[The Indian Sociologist]]'' was banned in India in September 1907 and in November that year  the [[Prevention of Seditious Meetings Act, 1907|Prevention of Seditious Meetings Act]] was passed.&lt;ref name=Riddick93&gt;{{Harvnb|Riddick|2006|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  February 1910 saw the introduction of [[Press Act|Indian Press Act]] which allowed Provincial governments to ask for punitive securities of up to Rs 5,000 from newspapers likely to incite sedition and violence. This act resulted in a number of nationalist publications closing down unable to provide such a surety.&lt;ref name=Riddick93/&gt;

===Criminal law amendment 1908===
Failure of prosecution in a number of cases under the Criminal procedures act 1898 led to a special act whereby crimes of nationalist violence were to be tried by a special tribunal composed of three high-court judges. December 1908 saw the passage of the Criminal Law amendments under the terms of Regulation III of 1818 and to suppress associations formed for seditious conspiracies.&lt;ref name=Riddick93/&gt; The act was first applied to deport nine Bengali revolutionaries to [[Mandalay prison]] in 1908.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Despite these measures however, high standards of evidence demanded by the [[Calcutta High Court]], insufficient investigations by police, and at times outright fabrication of evidence led to persistent failure to tame nationalist violence.&lt;ref name=Horniman42&gt;{{Harvnb|Horniman|1984|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police forces felt unable to deal with the operations of secretive nationalist organisations, leading to demands for special powers. These were opposed vehemently in the Indian press, which argued against any extension of already wide powers enjoyed by the police forces in India, and which it was argued was being used to oppress Indian people.&lt;ref name=Horniman43&gt;{{Harvnb|Horniman|1984|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
{{Main article|Hindu-German Conspiracy|Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition|Silk Letter Conspiracy}}
The [[World War I|First World War]] began with an unprecedented outpouring of support towards Britain from within the mainstream political leadership, contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt. India contributed massively to the British war effort by providing men and resources. About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money and ammunition. However, [[Bengal]] and [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] remained hotbeds of [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|anti colonial activities]]. After the onset of the First World War, plague, rising grain prices, dissatisfaction with immigration policies within the British empire (highlighted by the ''[[Komagata Maru]]'' affair), and rumours of British misfortunes in the war meant by 1914, Punjab was in an unsettled state.&lt;ref name=Popplewell171&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; India lay considerably far away from the Central Powers, with only feasible routes of invasion being through Persia and Afghanistan. The Indian Government at the outset of the war anticipated that India would remain safe as long as Afghanistan maintained neutrality, and the tribes of NWFP were under control.&lt;ref name=Popplewell165&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worst situation would  be from a combination of war with Afghanistan and internal unrest fomented by either the Bengali revolutionary network, the Ghadr in Punjab or Indian Muslims who may sympathise with Ottoman ''[[Umma]]''.&lt;ref name=Popplewell166&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghadr===
British intelligence in North America indicated early in the war that the [[Ghadr Party]], co-ordinating with the [[Berlin Committee]] in Germany, and the [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|Indian revolutionary underground]]  was [[Hindu–German Conspiracy|attempting to transport]] men and arms from United States and East Asia into India, intended for a revolution and mutiny in the British Indian Army. From August 1914, a large number of Sikh expatriates began leaving Canada and USA under the plans of the Ghadr leadership for fomenting mutiny in India, whilst in Bengal nationalist crime also increased.&lt;ref name=Popplewell160&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Department of Criminal Intelligence chief Charles Cleveland noted that the threat to India should be dealt with by dealing with Ghadr activists who were already in India and those who were returning.&lt;ref name=Popplewell161&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, [[Ingress into India Ordinance, 1914]] was passed to limit the influx of Ghadarites,&lt;ref name=KannabiranandSingh235&gt;{{Harvnb|Kannabiran|Singh|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to stem the inflow. The [[Ghadr mutiny|planned mutiny]] for February 1915 was averted at the last minute.

===Bengal===
In the meantime, the situation in Bengal worsened considerably following the [[Rodda Company raid]] by Jugantar, which handed large amount of firearms to Bengal revolutionaries. There were 36 outrages in 1915, climbing steeply from 13 in 1913 and 14 in 1914. The revolutionaries launched what has been described by some historians as "a reign of terror in both the cities and the countryside" that "came close to achieving their key goal of paralysing the administration." A general atmosphere of fear encompassed the police and the law courts, severely affecting the moral.&lt;ref name=Popplewell201&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; In entire 1915, only six revolutionaries were successfully brought to trial.

==Defence of India act==
On 19 March 1915, [[Sir Reginald Craddock]], home member in the Viceroy's council introduced the law and it passed in a single sitting. It was enacted as a temporary legislation in effect for the duration of World War I and for six months afterwards. The act gave the Governor General in Council the power to make rules {{quote|for the purpose of securing the public safety and the defence of British India and as to the powers and duties of public servants and other persons in furtherance of that purpose...}}
Considerable pressure for the passage of the act was from [[Michael O'Dwyer]] particularly in light of the Ghadr threat. Answering to Sir [[Surendranath Bannerjee]] in the legislative assembly, Craddock denied any necessity or propriety for the government to constitute an advisory board of judicial character that would deal with the applications of the act.&lt;ref name=Samaddara94&gt;{{Harvnb|Samaddara|2007|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard the law differed from the Defence of the Realm act. Craddock explained to the assembly that the lack of judicial oversight and advice were acceptable since the restrictive measures in the act were "preventive and not punitive in measures".&lt;ref name=Samaddara94/&gt;

===Scope===
The law was to be valid for the duration of the war and for six months thereafter "for public safety" and "the defence of British India". The main object of the law made it illegal to communicate with the enemy, obtaining information, spreading false reports, as well as any activities that the government saw prejudicial to the war effort. The act allowed local governments to make rules detain indefinitely,&lt;ref name=Bates118/&gt; without representation, and to try  by special tribunals persons "''reasonably suspected''" of being of hostile origin or acting in a manner prejudicial to the safety of the empire.&lt;ref name=HallidayKarpikFeeley63&gt;Halliday, Karpik &amp; Feeley(2012), pp. 63&lt;/ref&gt; committing or conspiring to commit crimes either described in the act, or crimes which maybe punishable by death, transportation or at least seven year imprisonment.&lt;ref name=IndianlawMinistrytextofcentralacts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/textofcentralacts/1915.pdf |title= A collection of the acts passed by the Governor General of Indian in Council in the year 1915. Records of Indian Law Ministry |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 1916 |website= Indian Ministry of Law &amp; Justice |publisher= Superintendent Government Printing|access-date=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power of detention, unlike under DORA, was carried by subordinate officers. For Trials already initiated under the Criminal procedures act 1898 or the 1908 Criminal law amendment were exempt from the act. Prosecution was to follow the procedures prescribed in the criminal procedures act 1898, but was superseded by the special powers and discretion of court. Crucially however, the Commissioners could take direct cognisance of the offences alleged and therefore preliminary procedures could be disposed off with.

===Implementation===
The act gave powers to local government to appoint three commissioners for trials who may be below the status of high-court judges. At least two would be Sessions judges or additional sessions judges for at least three years, were qualified for appointment as Judges of a High Court, or [[advocate]]s of a Chief Court or [[pleader]]s of ten years' standing. A majority verdict was acceptable.

The act allowed the commissioners to accept as evidence statements recorded by a magistrates without scrutiny to cross examination and superseded the standards of evidence proscribed in the Indian evidence act 1872.  Further the act allowed commissioners to accept such recorded evidence where the witness was unavailable or dead. This measure was intended to secure and safeguard against intimidation and assassinations by revolutionaries of approvers. There was no right to trial by jury.
The act excluded from appeal or judicial review the decisions of the commissioners appointed under the Defence of India act.

Although designed to maintain order and curtail revolutionary movement, the law was in practice used in widespread scale from limiting revolutionaries, through arresting perpetrators of religious violence, to curtailing the voice of moderate political leaders.&lt;ref name=Horniman45&gt;{{Harvnb|Horniman|1984|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the Defence of the Realm Act (which was limited in scope to people of Hostile origin or associations, i.e. enemy citizens or collaborators), the act could be applied against any subject of the King. By June 1917, 705 were under home-arrest under the act, along with 99 imprisonments under Regulation III.&lt;ref name=Popplewell210/&gt; Through the war, more than 1400 people were interned in India under the Defence of India Act alone, and a further three hundred subjected to minor restrictions, while more than two thousand were subjected to the restrictions of the [[Ingress into India Ordinance]].&lt;ref name = Hansard&gt;{{cite hansard |title=PERSONS INTERNED. |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1919/oct/22/persons-interned |house=House of Commons |date=22 October 1919 |column= 52-3W|speaker= |position=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
At the time of its enactment, the Defence of India act received universal support from Indian non-officiating members in the Governor General's council, from moderate leaders within Indian Political Movement. The British war effort had received popular support within India and the act received support on the understanding that the measures enacted were necessary in the war-situation. Its application saw a significant curtailment in revolutionary violence in India. However, the wide scope and widespread use amongst general population and against even moderate leaders led to growing revulsion within Indian population.

===Revolutionary violence===
The enactment of the law saw 46 executions and 64 life sentences handed out to revolutionaries in Bengal and Punjab in the [[Lahore Conspiracy Trial]] and [[Benares Conspiracy Trial]], and in tribunals in Bengal,&lt;ref name=Bates118/&gt; effectively crushing the revolutionary movement. The power of preventive detention were however applied more particularly to Bengal. By March 1916 widespread arrests helped Bengal Police crush the ''[[Dhaka Anushilan Samiti]]'' in Calcutta.&lt;ref name=Popplewell210&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulation III and Defence of India act was applied to Bengal from August 1916 on a widescale.  In Bengal Revolutionary violence in Bengal plummeted to 10 in 1917.&lt;ref name=Bates118/&gt; By the end of the war there were more than eight hundred interned in Bengal under the act.

===Moderate dissent===
The application of the act was not limited to those suspected of revolutionary crimes. It gradually came to be used in coercing and suppressing the voice of many nationalist leaders, even of moderate views, where regional administration felt their opinion or views were seditious to British rule in India, or dangerous to the administration.&lt;ref name=Bates119&gt;{{Harvnb|Bates|2007|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of prominent moderate leaders were interned or deported under the Defence of India act. Most notable of these leaders was Mrs [[Annie Besant]]. Beasant  had set up branches of the [[Home Rule League]] in major towns and cities at the time [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] was establishing the league in Bombay and in Western India. Although these amounted to little more than debating societies (having been modelled on the [[Fabian Society|Fabian Societies]]), the leagues were noted to be publishing political pamphlets, selling alm ost 46000 of these in 1916. Librairies were also established where political treatises were made available. Beasant's league had 27000 members by 1917, and that same year both Tilak and Beasant were interned under the act on the grounds their activities were becoming submersive. India. [[Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar]] and [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]] were arrested and interned after they were found to have been in liaison with [[Niedermayer-Hentig expedition|individuals in Kabul]] linked to the German mission, which the administration suspected may have been to promulgate a pan-Indian Islamic revolution.&lt;ref name=Bates119/&gt; [[Abul Kalam Azad]] was deported from Bengal and placed under house arrest in Ranchi for his writing in ''[[Al Balagh]]''.

===Post-WWI===
The Defence of India Act, in its implementation, was increasingly reviled. The unpopularity was such that the Lucknow session of the Indian National Congress in 1917 passed a resolution expressing alarm at the extensive use of the act, and urged the Government that its use be under same principles as the Defence of the Realm Act.&lt;ref name=Pasrisha&amp;Bharati85&gt;{{Harvnb|Pasrisha|Bharati|2009|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the war, [[Benjamin Horniman]] was deported from the [[Presidency of Bombay]] for his reporting on the [[Amritsar massacre]].

==Later laws==

===Rowlatt act===
With the impending lapse of the 1915 act, the [[Rowlatt Committee]] was appointed to recommend measures to deal with the threat from the revolutionary movement. Rowlatt recommended an extension of the provisions of the Defence of India act for a further three years with removal of ''habeas corpus'' provisions. It was met with universal opposition by the Indian members of the Viceroy's council, as well within the population in general, earning the title of "The Black Bills" from Mohandas Gandhi. [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]] left the Viceroy's council in protest, after having warned the council of the dangerous consequences of enacting an extension of such an unpopular bill. Rowlatt's recommendations were enacted in the [[Rowlatt Bills]]. The  agitations against the proposed Rowlatt bills took shape as the [[Rowlatt Satyagraha]] under the leadership of Gandhi, one of the first Civil disobedience movements that he would lead the [[Indian independence movement]]. The protests saw hartals in Delhi, public protests in Punjab as well as other protest movements across India. In Punjab, protests against the bills, along with a perceived threat of a Ghadrite uprising by the Punjab regional government culminated in the [[Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre]] in April 1919. After nearly three years of agitation, the government finally repealed the Rowlatt act and its component sister acts.

===1939 act===
{{main article|Defence of India Act, 1939}}
The Defence of India act 1915 was re-enacted in a more severe form at the onset of World War II as the Defence of India act 1939. It was enacted on 29 September 1939 but deemed to come into force from 3 September 1939, the day when the Second World War began. The act was used notoriously during the war in subduing the independence movement. It expired six months after the termination of the war and was ultimately repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act,1947(Act II of 1948).

===Independent India===
{{see also|Maintenance of Internal Security Act|Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act|Defence of India act, 1962|Internment of Chinese Indians}}
The [[Indian Constitution]] retained the principles of preventive detention encapsulated in the Defence of India act, making one of the few countries were citizens of the country may be subjected to such measures. In Independent India, the law retained in legislations in the form of Preventive Detention act 1950, and has seen implementation as the [[Defence of India Rules 1962]] during the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962, and the [[Defence of India Act,1971]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pak war]]. The 1962 act gained notoriety for its use in internment of Chinese immigrants in India, most notably Calcutta. Other similar laws enacted in independent India include the [[Maintenance of Internal Security Act]] (MISA) during ''[[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]]'', and &lt;ref name=Desai233&gt;{{Harvnb|Desai|1991|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (enacted during the [[Punjab insurgency]])  which carry very similar provisions.

[[File:Detroit bankruptcy.svg|right|300px]]
The [[Government of Detroit|city of Detroit]], [[Michigan]], filed for [[Chapter 9 bankruptcy]] on July 18, 2013. It is the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history by debt, estimated at $18–20 billion, exceeding [[Jefferson County, Alabama]]'s [[Jefferson County, Alabama#2011 Bankruptcy filing|$4-billion filing in 2011]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; [[Detroit]] is also the largest city by population in the U.S. history to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, more than twice as large as [[Stockton, California]], which [[Stockton, California#Bankruptcy|filed in 2012]]. While Detroit’s population had [[Decline of Detroit|declined]] from a peak of 1.8 million in 1950, its July 2013 population was reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a city of "700,000 people, as well as to tens of thousands of abandoned buildings, vacant lots and unlit streets."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/us/detroit-files-for-bankruptcy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title= Billions in Debt, Detroit Tumbles Into Insolvency |last= Davey |first= Monica |first2=Mary Williams |last2= Walsh |date=July 18, 2013 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detroit’s bankruptcy filing followed a declaration of financial emergency in March 2013 that resulted in [[Kevyn Orr]] being appointed as "emergency manager" of the city by [[Michigan]] Governor [[Rick Snyder]]. Orr’s subsequent negotiations sought to get creditors to willingly "[[Debt restructuring|take a haircut]]" on Detroit’s debt, and were ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="michigangov" /&gt;&lt;ref name=detroitnews /&gt;

On July 19, 2013, Judge [[Rosemarie Aquilina]] of the Thirtieth Judicial Circuit Court of Michigan ruled the bankruptcy filing by Detroit violated Article IX, Section 24, of the [[Michigan Constitution]] and ordered Governor Rick Snyder to withdraw the filing immediately.&lt;ref name=actionnews&gt;{{cite news |first= Ann |last= Mullen |url= http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/news/judge-rules-detroit-chapter-9-bankruptcy-filing-unconstitutional |title= Judge rules Detroit Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing unconstitutional |location= Detroit |publisher= [[WXYZ-TV]] |date= July 19, 2013 |accessdate= July 19, 2013}}

Bankruptcies of cities, towns, villages and counties since the [[Great Depression]] are rare (about 60 since 1950, i.e. around 1 per year; [[Special-purpose district|special district]] bankruptcies have been more numerous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Church|first=Steven|title=Nebraska, Not California, is King of Municipal Collapse|url=http://about.bloomberglaw.com/legal-news/nebraska-not-california-is-king-of-municipal/|accessdate=July 29, 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg Law|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and how Detroit will be affected is unclear.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Detroit’s estimated long-term debt was more than $14 billion and could be between $18 and $20 billion,&lt;ref name="Nation 2013" /&gt; far exceeding the $4 billion in debt of [[Jefferson County, Alabama]], that had been the largest American municipal bankruptcy filing to date.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; It is also the largest city by population in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy, with more than double the population of [[Stockton, California]], which filed for bankruptcy in 2012.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; State officials said that city services will not be affected immediately by the bankruptcy filing.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Municipal workers with pensions are not insured by the federal [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]], since they work for a municipality and not a business, and some also had received pensions in lieu of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Hicken |first= Melanie |url= http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/18/pf/detroit-bankruptcy-pensions/ |title= Detroit's workers and retirees face big cuts |publisher= [[CNN]] |date= February 27, 2013 |accessdate= July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yields on bonds issued by the city of Detroit increased on July 18 to record highs, as investors considered the potential effects of the bankruptcy filing. Rates had already escalated when yields jumped from 8.39% in mid-May to 16% in mid-June 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/18/us-usa-detroit-bankruptcy-idUSBRE96H16O20130718 |last= Carey |first= Nick |title= Detroit files for bankruptcy, stage set for court fight |publisher= [[Reuters]] |date= July 18, 2013 |accessdate= July 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[credit rating agency]] [[Moody's|Moody’s]] said that the bankruptcy filing was credit negative for Detroit and that it created an "unprecedented litigation scenario," which could impact services city residents receive, as well as how much bondholders would recover from Detroit.&lt;ref name="reutersmoodys"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/19/us-usa-detroit-moodys-idUSBRE96I02D20130719 |title= Moody's: Detroit bankruptcy filing credit negative |publisher= Reuters |date= July 18, 2013 |accessdate= July 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business and labor leaders reacted to the filing. Detroit union leaders called Orr’s move to declare bankruptcy premature due to ongoing financial negotiations with creditors, unions, and pension boards,&lt;ref name="Nation 2013" /&gt; but also stated that employees will continue to work in a typical fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.freep.com/article/20130718/NEWS01/307180128/ |title= Detroit union leaders call bankruptcy filing premature, say they were trying to negotiate |work= Detroit Free Press |date= March 7, 2013 |accessdate= July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only major U.S. automaker headquartered in Detroit itself, [[General Motors]], said it "is proud to call Detroit home and ... (this is) a day that we and others hoped would not come. We believe, however, that today also can mark a clean start for the city."&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;

Politicians have commented on the bankruptcy. Bing said that the people of Detroit "have to make the best of it".&lt;ref name="Nation 2013" /&gt; Snyder stated that "I know many will see this as a low point in the city’s history," "If so, I think it will also be the foundation of the city’s future—a statement I cannot make in confidence absent giving the city a chance for a fresh start, without burdens of debt it cannot hope to fully pay."&lt;ref name="washingtonpostjuly18" /&gt;  President [[Barack Obama]] said that he is following the developments and that he is "committed to continuing our strong partnership" with Detroit.&lt;ref name="washingtonpostjuly18" /&gt; Kentucky Senator [[Rand Paul]] stated that he will not allow the government to [[bailout|bail out]] the city, saying "He is bailing them out over my dead body, because we don’t have any money in Washington."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClure|first=Caitlin|title=Rand Paul: Obama will bail out Detroit ‘over my dead body’|url=http://dailycaller.com/2013/07/19/rand-paul-obama-will-bail-out-detroit-over-my-dead-body/#ixzz2ZeRGfOVf|newspaper=The DC|date=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rand Paul: Obama Will Bail Out Detroit 'Over My Dead Body'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/19/rand-paul-bail-out_n_3624801.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder also stated that he did not support a government bail out. "It's not just about putting more money in a situation," he said. "It's about better services to citizens again. It's about accountable government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Condon|first=Stephanie|title=Gov.

Detroit's debts included $369 million in [[unlimited general obligation]] bonds, bonds issued with the general backing of taxpayers, described by Florida bond finance director Ben Watkins as "[having] been the gold standard of the municipal-bond market".  The offer by Kevyn Orr to settle these for less than 20% face value, and doubts regarding the willingness of Michigan to assume the debts, was predicted to drive up borrowing costs of nearby municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-19/detroit-scrutinized-by-900-million-g-o-market.html |title= Detroit Case Scrutinized by $900 Million G.O.

Recent history from California "has shown that the fallout from a bankruptcy can dissipate quickly" in the bond market.  Contributing to this is the fact that [[Moody's]] has fewer than 40 of the 7,500 local governments that it rates listed as below investment grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chapatta|first=Brian|title=Detroit's Bankruptcy Doesn't Faze the Municipal Bond Market|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-08/detroits-bankruptcy-doesnt-faze-the-municipal-bond-market|accessdate=August 8, 2013|newspaper=Business Week|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Detroit declared bankruptcy, it was reported that the city would continue with plans for a bond issue to fund a new $444 million arena for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Repayment of the bonds would be split between taxpayers and developers of the arena. Both Snyder and Orr acknowledged concerns raised about the expense, but stated that continuing the project makes good economic sense even with the context of Detroit's bankruptcy.  With the arena, and additional retail, office, residential and hotel space the developer has committed to build as part of the overall project, it is expected to create about 8,000 construction jobs, with work due to start in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/26/news/economy/detroit-bankruptcy-arena/index.html New $444 million hockey arena is still a go in Detroit], CNN, July 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From bankruptcy filing to eligibility ruling ===
[[File:Russell Industrial Complex, Detroit, Michigan.jpg|thumb|Detroit at Milwaukee Junction, looking southwest at the [[Russell Industrial Center]]]]
On July 19, 2013, [[Ingham County, Michigan|Ingham County]] [[Circuit Court#United States|Circuit Court]] Judge Rosemarie Aquilina ruled, using a typed statement with hand-written notes attached, that the bankruptcy filing by Detroit violated the Michigan constitution by impairing pension payments and ordered Snyder to withdraw the filing: Snyder has appealed the motion, and Aquilina indicated she was sending a copy of her ruling to President Obama.&lt;ref name="actionnews"/&gt;  While under Article IX, Section 24, of the Michigan Constitution, neither the state nor any of its "political subdivisions" are permitted to default on the accrued financial benefits of their pension plans or retirement systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Michigan Legislature]] |date= December 2010 |url= http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(0fyy1o55x0uazoenx4apml45))/documents/Publications/Constitution.pdf |format= PDF |chapter = Article IX § 24 |title=Constitution of Michigan of 1963 |publisher= State of Michigan |page= 44 |accessdate= July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; federal law may allow bankruptcy judges to renegotiate pensions of municipalities in bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news |title= Confusion in Detroit as judge challenges legality of bankruptcy |date= July 19, 2013 |publisher= Fox News |url= http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/19/confusion-in-detroit-as-judge-challenges-legality-bankruptcy/#ixzz2ZYJp24yh |accessdate= July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many consider public pension benefits of existing retirees "virtually untouchable"; the clash between state constitutional protections of [[vested]] public pension rights and the general ability of the bankruptcy process to modify debt obligations has yet to be fully tested in any Chapter 9 proceeding.&lt;ref name=benvenutti&gt;{{cite web |last1= Benvenutti |first1= Peter J. |first2= David G. |last2= Heiman |first3= Heather |last3= Lennox |first4= Lori |last4= Sinanyan |first5= Mark K. |last5= Sisitsky |first6= Jayant W. |last6= Tambe |date= August 2010 |title= An Overview of Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code: Municipal Debt Adjustments |url= http://www.jonesday.com/an-overview-of-chapter-9-of-the-bankruptcy-code-municipal-debt-adjustments-08-15-2010/ |publisher= Jones Day |accessdate= July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, Aquilina delayed to July 29 her hearing on retiree funds request for an order directing Orr and Snyder to withdraw the bankruptcy filing and desist from any effort to reduce vested pension benefits in the face of their protected status under the Michigan Constitution.  This legal move allowed the bankruptcy court to weigh in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Kathleen|title=Judge delays hearing on Detroit bankruptcy, pensions|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2013307220065|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=July 22, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes scheduled a hearing on July 24, on the city's request that the retiree state court suit be stayed because of the pending federal bankruptcy case. Rhodes indicated that the [[bankruptcy court]], not the [[State court (United States)|state court]], has the authority to resolve the dispute between the city and the retiree funds over the city's authorization to file the bankruptcy case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Snavely|first=Brent|title=Federal judge to consider pension funds' lawsuit Wednesday in first Detroit bankruptcy hearing|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130722/NEWS05/307220078/|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=July 22, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, a three-judge panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled unanimously to stay the proceedings in the state court actions, pending a resolution of the state's appeal of Aquilina's rulings directing withdrawal of the bankruptcy filing.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Kathleen|title=Ingham County judge loses another round in her bid to halt Detroit's bankruptcy case|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130723/NEWS06/307230106/detroit-bankruptcy-judge-aqulina|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another development in the bankruptcy case, Rhodes indicated in a filing on July 23 his intent to appoint a mediator to work with the parties in the bankruptcy. Rhodes indicated that the mediator would be Chief Judge [[Gerald Rosen]] of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

On July 24, the bankruptcy court held a two-hour hearing on the city's request for a stay of the pending state court proceedings against Snyder and Orr. Rhodes then granted the federal stay and ruled that Orr is a validly authorized officer to act for the city in the bankruptcy.  Rhodes ordered that three suits filed by city employees, retirees and pension funds in State Court be halted. He made it clear that all legal battles will be fought in the Federal Bankruptcy Court&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; Rhodes emphasized that he was not on July 24 deciding whether the city met the statutory criteria for eligibility for a Chapter 9 filing, nor the effect on the bankruptcy case of Michigan's constitutional protection of vested public pension benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snavely|first1=Brent|last2=Helms|first2=Matt|title=Judge: Bankruptcy court can decide whether pension systems, retiree suits can proceed|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130724/NEWS01/307240105/Detroit-bankruptcy-federal-judge-Gov-Rick-Snyder|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=July 24, 2013|accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, Michigan Attorney General [[Bill Schuette]] announced that he would enter an appearance in the bankruptcy case for the purpose of defending Michigan's constitutional protection of vested public pension benefits.  Schuette said that in doing so he would be acting in his role as "the people's attorney."  Schuette acknowledged that there is no action currently pending in the case related to public pensions, but he stated that by filing an appearance he "will be able to defend the state constitution if and when this does occur." Schuette's office also represents Snyder, who favors cuts to Detroit's public pension plans as an element of restoring the city to financial stability.  Schuette's spokesperson said that his office would continue to represent the governor and other state agencies in the bankruptcy; different sets of attorneys in the attorney general's office will represent these divergent positions.  A spokesperson for emergency manager Orr said that Orr "respects the attorney general’s concern for Detroit’s pensioners.  This is an important issue that will be decided, appropriately, by a federal bankruptcy judge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Helm|first=Matt|title=Michigan AG to defend public pensions, state constitution in Detroit bankruptcy filing|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130727/NEWS15/307270059/Michigan-AG-to-defend-public-pensions-in-Detroit-s-bankruptcy-filing|accessdate=July 27, 2013|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, the bankruptcy court held a status conference, set an initial schedule for the case, and made several initial rulings.  The court set August 19 as the deadline for any party to file objections to the city's eligibility for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and October 23 as the hearing date for trial on such objections.  The court set March 1, 2014, as the deadline for the city to file a plan of adjustment for its debts.&lt;ref name="mieb.uscourts.gov"/&gt;  The court ordered the appointment of a fee examiner to review the fees incurred by attorneys and other professionals for the City, and invited comments on naming an appropriate person to fill this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order Regarding Comment Period on Fee Examiner Appointment |url=http://www.mieb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/detroit/docket277.pdf|publisher=U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|accessdate=August 2, 2013|date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court presented a proposed order establishing a mediation process aimed at facilitating settlement of disputed issues that will arise in the case, and inviting comments on the naming of an appropriate mediator, with the court having initially proposed Chief Judge Gerald Rosen of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order Regarding Comment Period on Revised Mediation Order |url=http://www.mieb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/detroit/docket278.pdf|publisher=U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|accessdate=August 2, 2013|date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court ordered the Office of the U.S. Trustee to appoint an official committee to represent retired employees of the city, with the U.S. Trustee to select the members to serve on this Retiree Committee.  The professional expenses of the Retiree Committee will be paid by the city, which consented to do so.  When a fee examiner is appointed, the professional expenses of the Retiree Committee will also be subject to the examiner's review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order, Pursuant to Section 1102(a(2) of the Bankruptcy Code Directing the Appointment of a Committee of Retired Employees |url=http://www.mieb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/detroit/docket279.pdf|publisher=U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|accessdate=August 2, 2013|date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 19, Rhodes appointed Robert M. Fishman, an attorney with the Chicago law firm Shaw Fishman Glantz and Tobin, as the fee examiner.  Fishman's own fees are charged at $600 per hour.  Another attorney who has served as an expert witness in fee matters commented that, while the fees will no doubt be large, legal fees are always a small percentage of what is at stake in a bankruptcy of this magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bomey|first=Nathan|title=Judge appoints $600-an-hour attorney to keep tabs on Detroit bankruptcy legal fees|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130819/NEWS01/308190066/Robert-Fishman-Steven-Rhodes-fee-examiner-Detroit-bankruptcy|accessdate=August 21, 2013|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, Judge Rhodes, after receiving input from various parties in the bankruptcy, confirmed his appointment of Judge Rosen of the District Court to serve as a mediator in the Chapter 9 case process.  The mediator may bring parties together for "facilitative mediation" on any issues that Rhodes chooses to refer to mediation.  Any mediation proceedings held will be confidential, except for the terms of any settlement that may be reached and presented to the bankruptcy court for approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bathon|first=Michael|title=Detroit Judge Rosen Named Mediator in City’s Bankruptcy|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-08-13/detroit-judge-rosen-named-mediator-in-city-s-bankruptcy-1|accessdate=August 13, 2013|newspaper=BloombergBusinessWeek|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 21, Rosen - as permitted by Rhodes's order appointing him - appointed additional mediators to assist him.  As Rosen said, mediation in this case will amount to a monumental task, involving "thousands of claims and issues."  The additional mediators are:  U.S. District Judge [[Victoria A. Roberts|Victoria Roberts]], a Detroit native who is also an adjunct professor at the University of Michigan Law School; U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Elizabeth Perris of the District of Oregon, who has served almost 30 years as judge and has been a judicial mediator in the Chapter 9 bankruptcies of Vallejo, Stockton and Mammoth Lakes, Calif.; Senior U.S. District Judge [[Wiley Daniel]] of the District of Colorado, a former Detroit resident; former U.S. Bankruptcy and U.S. District Judge [[David Coar]], who has also served as a private mediator in large bankruptcy cases, including the Mammoth Lakes, Calif., Chapter 9; and Eugene Driker, also a Detroit native, who is "considered a leading mediator in Michigan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baldas|first=Tresa|title=Rosen selects team of mediators for Detroit bankruptcy case|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2013308200142|accessdate=August 21, 2013|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is despite Kevyn Orr's stated intention to treat approximately $2 billion of general obligation bond debt as unsecured, which would likely result in substantial losses to the bond parties.  Frank Schafroth, director of the Center for State and Local Leadership at [[George Mason University]], commented that the choice not to object on eligibility reflected lessons learned in the Stockton, California, Chapter 9 case.  There, bondholders and bond insurers did wage a months-long litigation effort to have Stockton declared ineligible.  But this expensive and time-consuming effort proved unsuccessful.  An attorney for some of the bondholders in Detroit's case commented that they felt it was better to have the bankruptcy judge as a referee rather than to deal only with Orr on the terms of his severe pre-bankruptcy proposal to the bond groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Devitt|first=Caitlin|title=No Challenge to Detroit's Eligibility from Bond Insurers, Investors|url=http://www.bondbuyer.com/issues/122_161/no-challenge-to-detroits-eligibility-from-bond-insurers-investors-1054817-1.html|accessdate=August 22, 2013|newspaper=The Bond Buyer|date=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Rhodes ordered that initial argument on the purely legal issues of Detroit's eligibility for Chapter 9 be held on October 15–16, rather than the October 23 date of the full trial on eligibility.  Rhodes declared early consideration of the purely legal issues, such as Detroit's authorization under state law for the bankruptcy filing, would expedite determination of eligibility under the Bankruptcy Code.  At the same time, Rhodes reserved issues requiring factual determinations, such as whether Detroit negotiated in good faith with its creditors before filing the bankruptcy case, for the October 23 trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lichterman|first=Joseph|title=Judge speeds hearing on Detroit bankruptcy eligibility|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/27/us-usa-detroit-bankruptcy-idUSBRE97Q0K820130827|accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Amended Order Regarding Eligibility Objections Notices of Hearings and Certifications Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a) &amp; (b)|url=http://www.mieb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/detroit/docket821.pdf|publisher=U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|accessdate=September 14, 2013|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruling Makes Detroit Biggest City to Qualify for Bankruptcy | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | author1 = Bill Vlasic | author2 = Monica Davey | author3 = Mary Williams Walsh | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/us/detroit-bankruptcy-ruling.html | date = December 3, 2013 | accessdate = December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ruling the judge determined that Detroit is insolvent, and that the city could not have practically negotiated on a plan of adjustment pre-bankruptcy with its thousands of creditors.  The judge declined to find that the city had negotiated in good faith with creditors pre-bankruptcy, based on the testimony at the eligibility trial; he noted that the meetings the city held with creditors leading up to the bankruptcy filing did not meet the statutory good-faith requirement.  However, he found the city eligible for Chapter 9&lt;ref&gt;Finances.com ''[http://www.finances.com/news/politics/2306-judge-rhodes-grants-detroit-chapter-9-protection.htm]''. Finances.com, 2013. Retrieved 23 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; on the statutory alternative ground of impracticability of negotiating with so many creditors.  The judge also found that the city could potentially impair the pensions of city retirees through a plan under federal bankruptcy law, despite the Michigan state constitutional provision protecting such pensions from impairment.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news | title = In largest-ever U.S. city bankruptcy, cuts coming for Detroit creditors, retirees | publisher = [[Reuters]] | author1 = Joseph Lichterman | author2 = Bernie Woodall | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/03/us-usa-detroit-bankruptcy-judge-idUSBRE9B20PZ20131203 | date = December 3, 2013 | accessdate = December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|eligibility for Chapter 9 opinion}}Judge Rhodes followed the announcement of his ruling in open court with a 143-page written memorandum opinion providing the bases for the ruling.  The memorandum discusses in detail the financial status of the city.  It reviews the statutory criteria for eligibility and indicates those the city satisfied, and finds that the city met the minimum criteria for eligibility.  The memorandum discusses in depth the major objections raised by various parties to the city's eligibility, and finds that the objections are either unfounded in law or insufficient factually to deny the city eligibility for Chapter 9.  The judge concluded the memorandum with a reminder to all interested parties that eligibility is only a preliminary step in a Chapter 9 case, and that the "ultimate objective is confirmation of a plan of adjustment....the Court strongly encourages the parties to begin to negotiate, or if they have already begun, to continue to negotiate, with a view toward a consensual plan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion Regarding Eligibility |url=http://www.mieb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/detroit/docket1945.pdf|publisher=U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|accessdate=December 5, 2013|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal of eligibility ruling ===

Judge Rhodes declined to stay the effect of his eligibility ruling while any potential appeals are decided.  He also indicated that he would consider permission for an appeal to proceed directly to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, rather than the regular route of an appeal first to the federal district court, in a separate motion.  [[AFSCME]] immediately filed a notice of appeal of the ruling.  It is expected that the independently managed pension funds for city workers will join in the appeal.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blog replay: Judge rules Detroit is eligible for bankruptcy | publisher = Detroit Free Press | author1 = Brent Snavely | author2 = Nathan Bomey | url = http://live.freep.com/Event/Detroit_bankruptcy_eligibility_hearing?Page=5 | date = December 3, 2013 | accessdate = December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detroit’s teachers' union will appeal the bankruptcy ruling according to [[Randi Weingarten]], national president of the [[American Federation of Teachers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Teachers’ Union Vows Appeal of Detroit Bankruptcy Ruling | publisher = The Wall Street Journal | author = Melanie Trottman | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/12/04/teachers-union-president-vows-appeal-of-detroit-bankruptcy-ruling | date = December 4, 2013 | accessdate = December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 16, 2013, Judge Rhodes granted motions by AFSCME and the pension funds permitting direct appeal to the Sixth Circuit.  The permission includes the ruling on eligibility for Chapter 9, and the ruling that the city can impair vested public pension benefits through a Chapter 9 plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Detroit bankruptcy judge allows appeal of eligibility, pension rulings | publisher = [[Detroit Free Press]] | author1 = Matt Helms | author2 = Brent Snavely | url = http://www.freep.com/article/20131217/NEWS01/312160058/detroit-bankruptcy-case-appeals-judge-rhodes | date = December 17, 2013 | accessdate = December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fee controversy ===
As of October 1, 2013, Detroit had spent almost $23 million in fees to lawyers, consultants and financial advisers for the bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="Detroit has paid $23 million to consultants through October 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-usa-detroit-fees-idUSBRE9AK01S20131121 | title=Detroit has paid $23 million to consultants through October 1 | publisher=Reuters | date=November 20, 2013 | accessdate=November 21, 2013 | author=Lichterman, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the fees are:&lt;ref name="Detroit has paid $23 million to consultants through October 1"/&gt;
*$11 million to law firm [[Jones Day]]
*$4.59 million to [[Conway MacKenzie]], a Detroit area restructuring firm
*$4.17 million to [[Ernst &amp; Young]], accounting firm 
*$1.5 million to [[Plante Moran]], accounting firm
*$1.2 million to [[Miller Buckfire]], investment banking firm 
Orr used $95 million earmarked for unsecured bond debt and pension payments to Detroit's restructuring initiatives, which caused Detroit to first miss bond payments in June 2013.&lt;ref name="Detroit has paid $23 million to consultants through October 1"/&gt;

Fees paid to 3 Jones Day partners who billed the city for more than $1000 per hour of their time, as well as for trips to or from vacation homes, proved particularly controversial, but their former partner Kevyn Orr, did not consider them overbilling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne-county/2014/12/02/bankruptcy-legal-fees/19815475/&lt;/ref&gt; On December 31, city officials disclosed that the city's general fund paid $164.91 million in fees relating to the bankruptcy, although they did not reveal concessions made by various parties pursuant to a mediation order, said to be worth about $25 million. The city's plan of adjustment allotted $177 million for legal and consulting fees. [[Disclosed fees]] included:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne-county/2014/12/30/detroit-bankruptcy-fees-top/21074011/&lt;/ref&gt;
* $57.9 million to Jones Day, 
* $17.28 million to Conway MacKenzie for operational restructuring
* $20.22 million to Ernst &amp; Young for financial restructuring
* $22.82 million to investment banking firm Miller Buckfire, and 
* $15.41 million to Dentons US LLP, a law firm that acted on behalf of an official committee of city retirees fighting pension cuts
* $980,000 went to two Detroit mediator firms
Furthermore, the two pension funds paid attorneys at Clark Hill $6.25 million and financial advisers at Greenhill &amp; Co. $5.71 million to fight the bankruptcy case. Judge Rhodes, whose judicial salary is set by Congress, had up to 14 days to determine whether the agreed-upon fees are reasonable.

=== City's plan of adjustment of debts ===
After the Chapter 9 eligibility ruling, emergency manager Kevyn Orr said the city will seek to file a plan for adjustment of its debts under bankruptcy law by early January.  Orr said that negotiations with unions for the city's workers on the terms of a possible plan were continuing.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt; The plan was approved by the [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/us/detroit-bankruptcy-plan-ruling.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Grand Bargain and the End of Bankruptcy  ==
{{See also|Detroit Institute of Arts#Impact of Detroit Bankruptcy on the Museum}}

One of the biggest issues facing litigators of Detroit's bankruptcy was which assets belong to the city outright and those that were available to creditors in order to satisfy liabilities. Nowhere did this question loom larger than the fate of the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. The DIA holds 66,000 valuable pieces; however, only five percent of this collection was bought with city money. Judge Rhodes had to decide if the other 95% of this collection could be monetized in order to satisfy the claims of the bankruptcy creditors. In particular interest, was whether the art collection would be needed to satisfy the pension claims of its retirees.&lt;ref name="grand bargain"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bomey|first1=Nathan|last2=Gallagher|first2=John|last3=Stryker|first3=Mark|title=HOW DETROIT WAS REBORN|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/detroit-bankruptcy/2014/11/09/detroit-bankruptcy-rosen-orr-snyder/18724267/|work=Detroit Free Press|date=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Judge for the Eastern District Michigan [[Gerald Rosen]], who had taken on the role of chief mediator, and Rhodes sought a quick end to the bankruptcy fearing a process that could take years to resolve. On November 5, 2013 Rosen convened a meeting at the federal courthouse in Detroit with the leaders of some of the largest foundations in the country. Among those in attendance were the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[Knight Foundation|Knight]] and [[Mott Foundation|Mott]] Foundations. It was here that Rosen laid out his plan that would become known as the Grand Bargain. Rosen's plan sought commitments for over $800 million over the next 20 years from foundations, private donors, the DIA, and the state that would be used to shore up underfunded pensions. This would save the DIA from selling its art; the DIA would then become a private organization, releasing it from city ownership and protecting its collection forever.&lt;ref name="grand bargain" /&gt;

When asked why they donated, Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation said "If you don't have great cities, you won't have great nations," he said. "Detroit is a metaphor for America, for America's challenges and America's opportunities. It is a hothouse for new innovation, for ingenuity and risk taking. That doesn't happen in a lot of American cities. We need to be in Detroit because of that."  In total foundations would commit $366 million over 20 years to the Foundation for Detroit's Future, the non-profit set up to act as the fiduciary for the funds.&lt;ref name="grand bargain" /&gt;

On December 22 Rosen rejected a $230 million settlement negotiated between the city and [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]] and [[UBS]]. The city owed the banks $290 million due to the investment by former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. The city and banks would settle, on the 24th, for $185 million in the Rosen-negotiated deal.  Rhodes would later stun those following the proceedings, in what would be known as the Christmas Eve Massacre, when he rejected the settlement three weeks later, saying that it was "just too high a price to pay". After Orr threatened to sue the two banks, they eventually settled for $85 million. By January 2014, the city would reach a deal with some of its toughest opponents (three bond insurers) to whom they owed $388 million on the city's general obligation bonds by agreeing to pay 74%.

The DIA initially offered $50 million toward the Grand Bargain; the city, governor and others pushing for the deal viewed that as too low to get the state legislature on board. Ultimately, the DIA would agree to contribute $100 million.

In May 2014, legislation was introduced giving Detroit's retirement systems a $194.8 million lump sum as part of the state's $350 million commitment. If pensioners accepted the deal, they would not be able to sue the state over pension reductions; this was seen as a critical step toward getting support from the Republican-majority legislature. Some Republicans, such as Speaker of the House Jase Bolger, wanted unions to make contributions to help in the Detroit settlement. Another condition sought was that of a financial review commission modeled after the [[New York State Financial Control Board]] that oversaw New York City's troubled finances during the 1970s and 80s.  After unions agreed to contribute money towards the settlement, the Michigan House passed legislation with major bipartisan support on May 22.&lt;ref name=DetNewsDET&gt;Livengood, Chad &amp; Gary Heinlein (May 22, 2014).

Early in negotiations, the city's retirees saw themselves threatened with in cuts of 50%. However, with the grand bargain those cuts were reduced to a 4.5% with no cost living increases. Over the spring and summer of 2014 more than two-thirds of Detroit retirees voted in favor of the deal.

On September 10, Detroit reached a deal with three Michigan counties over regional water and sewer services that could eliminate one roadblock to federal court approval of the city's plan to adjust its debt and exit bankruptcy. The deal with Oakland, Wayne and Macomb counties created the [[Great Lakes Water Authority]], a new regional water and sewer authority, but allowed Detroit to maintain control of its local system. The deal was crucial to adjusting the city's $18 billion of debt and helping it exit its historically unprecedented municipal bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Lisa|title=Detroit, counties reach deal over water, sewer authority|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/10/us-usa-detroit-bankruptcy-water-idUSKBN0H41Q420140910|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detroit would reach deals with more of its creditors throughout the fall. In September it came to terms with bond insurer Syncora on its $400 million claim; Syncora would receive $25 million in cash and bonds, as well as a 20-year lease extension on their operation of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and 30-year lease of the underground garage at Grand Circus Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Terms of Detroit's settlements with FGIC, Syncora|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/detroit-bankruptcy/2014/10/17/detroit-settlement-details-syncora-fgic/17384587/|work=Detroit Free Press|date=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, lawyers for the city and [[Financial Guaranty Insurance Company]] (FGIC), a bond insurer with a $1 billion claim, disclosed in court that they had reached a deal to settle the company's claims. Under the deal, the city and state would pay for the demolition of the city-owned [[Joe Louis Arena]] once the Red Wings move into the new arena. After demolition, FGIC would receive the arena site and an adjacent parking lot, giving the company nearly 9 acres (3.6 ha) for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/11710381/red-wings-arena-demolished-detroit-looks-emerge-bankruptcy |title=Red Wings arena to be demolished |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=October 16, 2014 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2014 Judge Rhodes accepted the city's plan of adjustment, 17 months after the city had filed bankruptcy—a far shorter time frame that had been predicted based on other municipal bankruptcies. At the hearing Rhodes remarked, "We have used the phrase 'the Grand Bargain' to describe the group of agreements that will fix the city's pension problem. That description is entirely fitting. In our nation, we join together in the promise and in the ideal of a much grander bargain. It is the bargain by which we interact with each other and with our government, all for the common good. That grander bargain, enshrined in our Constitution, is democracy. It is now time to restore democracy to the people of the City of Detroit".&lt;ref name="grand bargain" /&gt;

On December 10, the ownership of DIA transferred to the non-profit DIA, Inc. The following day Detroit exited bankruptcy protection with finances returned to the control of city, subject to three years of oversight by the Detroit Financial Review Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Brian J.|title=City financial review commission starts work|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne-county/2014/11/12/detroit-financial-review-commission/18901757/|work=Detroit News|date=Nov 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Detroit Financial Review Commission|url=http://www.michigan.gov/treasury/0,4679,7-121-1751_51556_64472_66601_70240_70241---,00.html|website=www.michigan.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6772">The '''Eastern Wilderness Areas Act''' ({{USStatute|93|622|88|2096|1975|01|03}}) was signed into law by President [[Gerald Ford]] on January 3, 1975. Built upon the 1964 [[Wilderness Act]], which was written by [[Howard Zahniser]] of [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]] and signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Act designated 16 new wilderness areas in the [[Eastern United States]], including {{convert|207000|acre|ha}} of wilderness on national lands in 13 states.&lt;ref&gt;Rennicke, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was originally untitled, the bill signed by Ford has come to be known as the Eastern Wilderness Areas Act.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;  

While the previous Act created the legal definition of [[wilderness]] in the United States, the Eastern Wilderness Areas Act applied only to land east of the [[100th meridian west]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncmountaintreasures.org/the-wilderness-act-of-1964/ The Wilderness Act of 1964]". Western North Carolina's Mountain Treasures. Retrieved on June 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1964, both the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] agreed that eastern areas would have qualified as wilderness. However, six years later, the Forest Service opposed congressional designation of new wilderness areas in [[West Virginia]] with land use histories of logging. In 1971, it adopted a "purity" interpretation for wilderness designation so that no eastern or western lands with a history of human disturbance could qualify as wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Douglas W. (2005). "[http://www.georgewright.org/0507scott.pdf  Our Nationwide National Wilderness Preservation System]". ''People, Places, and Parks: Proceedings of the 2005 George Wright Society Conference on Parks, Protected Areas, and Cultural Sites''. Hancock, Michigan: The George Wright Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forest Service drafted its own bill as an alternative "to establish a system of wild areas within the land of the national forest system" that would have allowed cutting trees to "improve" wildlife habitat and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization described the bill as necessary because eastern areas "do not meet the strict criteria of the Wilderness Act." Members of Congress who championed the Wilderness Act resolved to overturn the misconception that wilderness areas included only those "pristine" in nature. Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry Jackson]] warned of this "serious and fundamental misinterpretation of the Wilderness Act" and pledged himself to correct the falsity of the so-called purity theory. Senator [[Frank Church]], who had been leader of the Senate debate on the Wilderness Act, observed that "the effect of such an interpretation would be to automatically disqualify almost everything, for few if any lands on this continent—or any other—have escaped man’s imprint to some degree."

To counteract the Forest Service bill, advocates for wilderness, including The Wilderness Society, the [[Sierra Club]], and [[Friends of the Earth]], and their congressional allies, responded with the proposed Eastern Wilderness Areas Act.  Promoted largely by [[Ernie Dickerman]], a Wilderness Society staff member, and [[George Aiken]], a senator from Vermont, the Senate endorsed the bill in May 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Northup, Jim. (April 2001.) "[http://www.forestwatch.org/content.php?id=1 George D. Aiken: Father of Eastern Wilderness]". Forest Watch. Retrieved on June 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final legislation adopted some elements of the Forest Service-inspired bill, but it did not alter the definition and intent of the Wilderness Act of 1964.  The previous debate regarding the meaning of "wilderness" versus "pristine" land led to the understanding that cultural use of lands should not keep the area from being restored to a "secondary wilderness," with functioning natural processes similar to when the land was in a primary state. Therefore, the Eastern Wilderness Areas Act explicitly protects lands that both suffered previous abuse and have the ability to recover and therefore be designated for wilderness protection.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally [[energy management]] equipment is associated with [[building automation]] (BAS) or [[building management systems]] (BMS). 

Energy management systems generate huge amounts of data about a building, from outside and inside air temperature, to [[carbon monoxide]] and [[humidity]] levels, each associated with the time of day, week, and year. These systems allow you to see what is going on in the building and to set complex schedules to control light and temperature based on the current information and instructions. They usually produce a record of energy use, but generally do not aggregate the data or allow you to see trends over time and location. 

Energy information management offers solutions to automate the data available from a BMS, BAS or EMS, aggregate it and apply algorithms to extract actionable information from the data. This allows the building owner a method for the ongoing, continuous improvement of a building’s energy use over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9097">'''FedEx furniture''' is the artistic creation of computer programmer and [[creative consumer]] Jose Avila, III.  In June, 2005, Avila created a website, Fedexfurniture.com,  to display photographs of a couch, bed, dining room table, and desk that he had constructed out of cartons obtained from overnight shipping giant [[FedEx Corporation]] (FedEx). FedEx attorneys used the [[Notice and take down|takedown]] provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) to force Avila's [[Internet service provider|ISP]] to take the site offline, accusing Avila of infringing on FedEx's [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s, breaching his [[contract]] with FedEx by using the cartons for purposes other than shipping, and potentially misleading consumers into believing that FedEx approved or endorsed Avila's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre R.|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland F.|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ian|last4=Kates|first4=Steven M.|date=2007-01-01|title=When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681306000796|journal=Business Horizons|volume=50|issue=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2006.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland|last3=Kietzmann|first3=Jan|last4=McCarthy|first4=Ian P.|date=2015-08-01|title=CGIP: Managing Consumer-Generated Intellectual Property|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43|journal=California Management Review|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=43–62|doi=10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43|issn=0008-1256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among attorneys and activist organizations concerned with the exercise of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights on the [[Internet]], FedEx's actions raised questions about the [[constitutionality]] of using the DMCA to [[censorship|censor]] unwanted speech.  The Fedexfurniture.com website is down as of July 8th, 2017.

==The story==

In 2005, Avila moved to Tempe, Arizona with nothing more than clothes and work essentials.  He was still stuck in a lease on his California apartment, and could barely afford his new apartment in Arizona.

After a bit of frustration over not having furniture, Avila remembered that a former roommate had solved a similar problem by constructing furniture using FedEx cartons.  Using hundreds of FedEx boxes and materials that he "already had lying around" for shipping various items, Avila constructed every piece of furniture in his apartment. Avila's designs were sturdy and attractive. Friends urged Avila to put pictures of the furniture on a Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland|last3=Kietzmann|first3=Jan|last4=McCarthy|first4=Ian P.|date=2015-08-01|title=CGIP: Managing Consumer-Generated Intellectual Property|url=https://doi.org/10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43|journal=California Management Review|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=43–62|doi=10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre R.|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland F.|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ian|last4=Kates|first4=Steven M.|date=2007-01-01|title=When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681306000796|journal=Business Horizons|volume=50|issue=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2006.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avila, he did so in order to show that trying financial circumstances need not lead to despair; one can respond creatively, even artistically, by using "found" materials.{{ref|ffstory}} The site's message was "It's OK to be ghetto".{{ref|counterthink}}

The site subsequently attracted widespread attention, both from Web surfers and the press.  Because the site was getting so much traffic, Avila placed a PayPal donation link on the page and asked for help to pay for the bandwidth charges. He also announced a plan to sell Fedexfurniture.com T-shirts, although Avila says that no T-shirts were ever sold.{{ref|ffstory}}

On June 27, 2005, FedEx attorneys wrote to Avila's [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. Citing the takedown provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), they demanded that the ISP remove Avila's materials from the Web.{{ref|takedownnotice}} They justified their request on two grounds:
*Infringement of FedEx's [[intellectual property]] (specifically, [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s.)
*Violation of FedEx's [[terms of use]] for packaging supplies.

In order to take advantage of the [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] provisions of the DMCA, Avila's ISP complied with the request and removed Avila's materials from the Web. Had the ISP not done so, it could have been held liable for [[contributory copyright infringement|contributory infringement]] (aiding and abetting the infringer) if Avila's materials were subsequently found to be infringing in a court of law.

FedEx's actions concerned Internet free speech activist organizations, such as [[Stanford University|Stanford University's]] [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]],  which are concerned about the use of the DMCA's takedown provisions to [[censorship|censor]] unwanted speech.  According to these organizations, the DMCA's purpose is to prevent Internet copyright infringement; it was never Congress's intent that the DMCA's takedown provisions should be used when the real issue is [[trademark infringement]] or [[breach of contract]].{{ref|fairuse}}

A Stanford attorney, [[Jennifer Granick]], assisted Avila on a [[pro bono]] basis. In her letter to FedEx, she disputed the use of the DMCA to remove Avila's site from the Web; she argued that the company's claim of [[copyright infringement]] had no merit; therefore, FedEx should not have used the DMCA to silence Avila's speech. The company's underlying motivations, she argued, were to protect its [[trademark]] and ability to place restrictions on public use of its cartons.{{ref|stanford}} Avila restored his site briefly. The dispute attracted widespread press attention, and Avila was frequently interviewed to tell his side of the story. In response to Granick's letter, FedEx attorneys reiterated their claims. Subsequently, Avila removed his site from the Web, citing technical difficulties.  By January 2006, Avila's site had returned, however, by June 30, 2006 the site had again disappeared. This was caused by a server crash, and as of July 27, 2006 it was back online, but as of August 16, 2007 the site is gone.  It popped up again in October 2007, but is currently down (July 8, 2017).

'''''Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics''''' is a 2007 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, Unger criticizes the doctrine holding that maximization of [[free trade]] should be the commanding goal of the worldwide trading regime, contending that this doctrine is misguided. Instead, Unger argues, the goal of an open worldwide trading regime should be reconciled with measures that foster national and regional diversity, deviation, heresy, and experiment in production, markets and economies. Unger further explores how the tradition of [[marginalism]] has rendered the discipline of [[economics]] incapable of offering deep insight into the problems of trade and of the global division of labor.

==Reception==

[[Francisco Rodríguez (economist)|Francisco Rodríguez]] wrote a detailed and laudatory review of ''Free Trade Reimagined'' for the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]''. Noting that Unger "deliberately eschews" the language of economics, Rodriguez describes Unger's project in ''Free Trade Reimagined'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger's critique is directed at the practical case for free trade that is premised on the theory of comparative advantage. His central contention is that the model of comparative advantage is too partial, incomplete, and empirically inaccurate to permit the drawing out of the general broad policy implications which are commonly attributed to it. Unger's interest is not in theoretical debates in economics, but rather in the broader process of formulation of trade policy and the design of the institutions of the world trading system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rodríguez|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rodriguez identifies and examines the three basic points that make up Unger's central argument:
* That trade theory is fundamentally incomplete.
* That international competition and political institutions can have significant effect on technological progress.
* That the political economy case for free trade is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rodríguez|2008|pp=1005–1006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodriguez notes that "this is not the first time that someone has come up with a reasonable case for trade protection—indeed ... the literature is filled
with this type of argument."&lt;ref name="Rodríguez_1005"&gt;{{harvp|Rodríguez|2008|p=1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, Rodriguez notes, Unger is less skeptical of state intervention in markets because, unlike many economists, Unger does not view a state's vulnerability to "rent-seeking behaviors" as given, but sees this vulnerability as variable depending on the power of various groups in a society, the nature of bureaucracy, and the openness of the political process.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez_1005"/&gt;

Rodriguez states that "[w]hile many of the basic ideas proposed by Unger make sense, some of the implications that he draws from them appear problematic."&lt;ref name="Rodríguez_1013"&gt;{{harvp|Rodríguez|2008|p=1013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Rodriguez's final assessment of ''Free Trade Reimagined'' is a positive one:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger's book is valuable because it puts together a set of ideas—some of them well-known, others new—into a coherent proposal for a different approach to free trade than the one that today finds overwhelming acceptance in policy circles and among academic economists. The fact that some of these ideas had been developed by economists shows that there is not as much distance as could appear between what Unger is claiming and what our profession has found. What is novel is the way in which Unger puts together these distinct observations into a well-thought out case that with practical relevance for the formation of commercial policy and the design of international economic institutions. While economists are familiar with the elements that make up this case, Unger deserves the credit for drawing out their full implications.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez_1013"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewing ''Free Trade Reimagined'' for the ''World Trade Review'', [[Mordechai E. Kreinin]] praised the book as " a bold attempt to question and restructure the theory of comparative advantage and the idea of free trade that springs from it."&lt;ref name="Kreinin_705"&gt;{{harvp|Kreinin|2008|p=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kreinin identified what he described as a number of "questionable propositions" in the book.&lt;ref name="Kreinin_705"/&gt; For example, Kreinin concedes that while "it is appropriate to challenge the assumption of the Heckscher–Ohlin (H–O) model, one must admit that … the H–O model does explain many real-world phenomena."&lt;ref name="Kreinin_705"/&gt; Kreinin went on to state that "[m]any of the arguments in the book are well-known propositions that do not necessarily conflict with the idea of free trade."&lt;ref name="Kreinin_705"/&gt; Kreinin took issue with what he characterized as Unger’s obscurity and unsupported rejection of "certain conventional wisdoms."&lt;ref name="Kreinin_707"&gt;{{harvp|Kreinin|2008|p=707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kreinin concluded that

&lt;blockquote&gt;too much of [''Free Trade Reimagined''] consists of assertions (rather than testable hypotheses), without even examples to illustrate them. To buttress his arguments, I would suggest adding many real world examples. It is indeed difficult to revolutionize a theory that has been around for many years and change radically a trading system built on it, by writing one book. It certainly can’t be done by simply imagining that an alternative system is superior.&lt;ref name="Kreinin_707"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Natalie Chen, reviewing ''Free Trade Reimagined'' in the ''[[Journal of Regional Science]]'', noted that Unger "seeks to revise and to rethink some of the main assumptions that inspire the debate between free trade and protectionism, and his book achieves this objective in an admirable way."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chen|2009|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chen summed up Unger's main message as being "that the debate about free trade cannot be resolved independently of politics."&lt;ref name="Chen_210"&gt;{{harvp|Chen|2009|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chen singled out for special praise Unger's argument that "the tasks that require repetition should ... be left to machines, allowing workers to specialize in the other tasks that do not require repetition and thus are the ones that will lead to innovation." As Chen notes, "[t]his point of view is so accurate that it comes to a surprise that it still remains largely overlooked in the literature and in the debate on free trade."&lt;ref name="Chen_210"/&gt; Chen concluded: "Overall, [''Free Trade Reimagined''] is an exceptional contribution, providing an original and innovative perspective to the rethinking of globalization and free trade."&lt;ref name="Chen_210"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33355">In a notable study of power conducted by [[social psychologist]]s [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]] in 1959, [[Power (social and political)|power]] is divided into five separate and distinct forms.  In 1965 Raven revised this model to include a sixth form by separating the informational power base as distinct from the expert power base.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2010, 2006). Group Dynamics. Belmont: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relating to [[social communication]] studies, ''power'' in [[social influence]] settings has introduced a large realm of research pertaining to [[persuasion]] tactics and leadership practices. Through social communication studies, it has been theorized that leadership and power are closely linked. It has been further presumed that different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in [[organizational communication]] and throughout the workforce.  In a notable study of power conducted by social psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven in 1959, power is divided into five separate and distinct forms.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt; They identified those five bases of power as ''coercive, reward, legitimate, referent, and expert''. This was followed by Raven's subsequent identification in 1965 of a sixth separate and distinct base of power: informational power.&lt;ref name=371-382&gt;Raven, B. H. (1965). Social influence and power. In I.D. Steiner &amp; M. Fishbein (Eds.),Current studies in social psychology (pp. 371–382). New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, French and Raven defined social influence as a change in the belief, attitude, or behavior of a person (the target of influence) which results from the action of another person (an influencing agent), and they defined social power as the potential for such influence, that is, the ability of the agent to bring about such a change using available resources.&lt;ref name=1242-49&gt;Raven, Bertram H. "Power, Six Bases of." Encyclopedia of Leadership.Ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2004. 1242-49. SAGE; Reference Online. Web. 30 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there have been many formal definitions of leadership that did not include [[social influence]] and power, any discussion of leadership must inevitably deal with the means by which a leader gets the members of a group or organization to act and move in a particular direction.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

Whereby, this is to be considered "power" in social influential situations.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Overview==
The original French and Raven (1959) model included five bases of power – reward, coercion, legitimate, expert, and referent – however, informational power was added by Raven in 1965, bringing the total to six.&lt;ref name=217-244&gt;Raven, Bertram H. (1992) "A power interaction model on interpersonal influence: French and Raven thirty years later". Journal of Social Behavior and Personality. Vol. 7, No. 2, 217-244&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the model has gone through very significant developments: coercion and reward can have personal as well as impersonal forms. Expert and referent power can be negative or positive. Legitimate power, in addition to position power, may be based on other normative obligations: reciprocity, equity, and responsibility. Information may be utilized in direct or indirect fashion.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

French and Raven defined social power as the potential for influence (a change in the belief, attitude or behavior of a someone who is the target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;

As we know [[leadership]] and power are closely linked.  This model shows how the different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in organizational communication and throughout the workforce. "The French-Raven power forms are introduced with consideration of the level of observability and the extent to which power is dependent or independent of structural conditions.  Dependency refers to the degree of internalization that occurs among persons subject to social control.  Using these considerations it is possible to link personal processes to structural conditions".&lt;ref name=Lazarsfeld&gt;Lazarsfeld, Paul. Menzel, Herbert. 1961. On the relation between individual and collective properties. pp 214–249 in Amitai Etzioni (ed.), Complex Organizations: A Sociological Reader. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original typology ==
The bases of social power have evolved over the years with benefits coming from advanced research and theoretical developments in related fields. On the basis of research and evidence, there have been many other developments and elaborations on the original theory. French and Raven developed an original model outlining the change dependencies and also further delineating each power basis.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Though it is a common understanding that most social influence can still be understood by the original six bases of power, the foundational bases have been elaborated and further differentiated.

==Bases of power==
As mentioned above, there are now six main concepts of power strategies consistently studied in social communication research. They are described as Coercive, Reward, Legitimate, Referent, Expert, and Informational.  Additionally, research has shown that [[source credibility]] has an explicit effect on the bases of power used in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Nesler, Mitchell S.; Aguinis, Herman; Quigley, Brian M.; Tedeschi, James T. (1993). "The Effect of Credibility on Perceived Power". Journal of Applied Social Psychology 23 (17): 1407–1425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Source credibility, the bases of power, and objective power, which is established based on variables such as position or title, are interrelated. The levels of each have a direct relationship in the manipulation and levels of one another.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The bases of power differ according to the manner in which social changes are implemented, the permanence of such changes, and the ways in which each basis of power is established and maintained.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The effectiveness of power is situational. Given there are six bases of power studied in the [[Communication]] field, it is very important to know the situational uses of each power, focusing on when each is most effective.  According to French and Raven, "it is of particular practical interest to know what bases of power or which power strategies are most likely to be effective, but it is clear that there is no simple answer.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

For example, a power strategy that works immediately but relies on surveillance (for example, reward power or coercive power) may not last once surveillance ends. One organizational study found that reward power tended to lead to greater satisfaction on the part of employees, which means that it might increase influence in a broad range of situations. Coercive power was more effective in influencing a subordinate who jeopardized the success of the overall organization or threatened the leader's authority, even though in the short term it also led to resentment on the part of the target. A power strategy that ultimately leads to private acceptance and long-lasting change (for example, information power) may be difficult to implement, and consume considerable time and energy. In the short term, complete reliance on information power might even be dangerous (for example, telling a small child not to run into the street unattended). A military officer leading his troops into combat might be severely handicapped if he had to give complete explanations for each move. Instead, he would want to rely on unquestioned legitimate position power, backed up by coercive power. Power resources, which may be effective for one leader, dealing with one target or follower, may not work for a different leader and follower. The manner in which the power strategy is utilized will also affect its success or failure. Where coercion is deemed necessary, a leader might soften its negative effects with a touch of humor. There have been studies indicating that cultural factors may determine the effectiveness of power strategies."&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;
             
=== Coercive power ===
{{Also|Coercive control}}
[[File:Blackbeard, Buccaneer - Cover.jpg|thumbnail|Blackbeard the infamous pirate]]
Coercive power uses the threat of force to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] from another. Force may include physical, social, emotional, political, or economic means. Coercion is not always recognized by the target of influence.&lt;ref name=Petress&gt;{{cite web|last=Petress|first=Ken|date=2003|title=Power: Definition, Typology, Description, Examples, and Implications|format=PDF|url=http://uthscsa.edu/gme/documents/powerdefinitionstypologyexamples.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is based upon the idea of [[coercion]]. The main idea behind this concept is that someone is forced to do something that he/she does not desire to do. The main goal of coercion is compliance. Coercive power's influence is socially dependent on how the target relates to the change being desired by the influence agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro&gt;Pierro, A., Cicero, L., &amp; Raven, B. Motivated Compliance With Bases of Social Power. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38, 1921-1944.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, a person would have to be consistently watched by the influencing agent in order for the change to remain in effect.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal coercion relates a person's belief that the influencing agent has the real power to physically threaten, impose a monetary fine or dismiss an employee.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal coercion relates to a threat of rejection or the possibility of disapproval from a person whom is highly valued.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

According to Changingminds.org "demonstrations of the harm are often used to illustrate what will happen if compliance is not gained".&lt;ref&gt;ChangingMinds. (2002–2009). Retrieved on May 5, 2009 from Changingminds.org&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} The power of coercion has been proven to be related with [[Punishment (psychology)|punitive behavior]] that may be outside one's normal role expectations.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; However coercion has also been associated positively with generally punitive behavior and negatively associated to contingent [[Reward system|reward behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, D. A., &amp; Sims, H. P. Perceptions of managerial power as a consequence of managerial behavior and reputation. Journal of Management 1983, 9, 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This source of power can often lead to problems and in many circumstances it involves [[abuse]].  These type of leaders rely on the use of threats in their [[leadership style]]. Often the threats involve saying someone will be fired or demoted.

=== Reward power ===
{{Also|Operant conditioning|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}
Reward power is based on the right of some to offer or deny tangible, social, emotional, or spiritual [[Reward system|rewards]] to others for doing what is wanted or expected of them. Some examples of reward power (positive reward) are: (a) a child is given a dollar for earning better grades; (b) a student is admitted into an honor society for excellent effort; (c) a retiree is praised and feted for lengthy service at a retirement party; and (d) New York firefighters were heralded as heroes for their acts on 9-11-01.[[File:Money 555.jpg|thumbnail]] Some examples of reward power (negative reward) are: (a) a driver is fined for illegal parking; (b) a teenager grounded for a week for misbehaving; (c) a rookie player is ridiculed for not following tradition; and (d) [[President Harding]]'s name is commonly invoked whenever [[political scandal]] is mentioned. Some pitfalls can emerge when a too heavy reliance is placed on reward power; these include: (a) some people become fixated and too dependent on rewards to do even mundane activities; (b) too severe fears of punishment can immobilize some people; (c) as time passes, past rewards become insufficient to motivate or activate desired outcomes; and (d) negative rewards may be perverted into positive attention.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal reward relates to promises of promotions, money and rewards from various social areas.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal reward relates to the reward of receiving approval from a desired person and building relationships with romantic partners.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

=== Legitimate power ===
{{Also|Legitimisation}}
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II - 1953-Dress.JPG|thumbnail|Queen Elizabeth II - 1953]]
Legitimate power comes from an elected, selected, or appointed position of authority and may be underpinned by [[social norms]].&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; This power which means the ability to administer to another certain feelings of [[obligation]] or the notion of responsibility.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; "Rewarding and Punishing subordinates is generally seen as a legitimate part of the formal or appointed leadership role and most managerial positions in work organizations carry with them, some degree of expected reward and punishment."&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. (1990). Handbook of leadership (3rd ed.). New York: Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; This type of formal power relies on position in an authority [[hierarchy]]. Occasionally, those possessing legitimate power fail to recognize they have it, and may begin to notice others going around them to accomplish their goals.&lt;ref name="administration1998"&gt;Fuqua, E., Payne, K., &amp; Cangemi, J. (1998). Leadership and the effective use of power. National Forum of Educational Administration and Supervision Journal, 15E(4), 36-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Three bases of legitimate power are cultural values, acceptance of social structure, and designation.&lt;ref name=150-167&gt;French, J. and Raven, B. (1959). The Bases of Social Power. In Studies in Social Power, D. Cartwright, Ed., pp. 150-167. Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural values comprise a general basis for legitimate power of one entity over another.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; Such legitimacy is conferred by others and this [[Legitimation|legitimacy]] can be revoked by the original granters, their designees, or their inheritors.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Legitimate power originates from a target of influence accepting the power of the influencing agent whereas behavioral change or [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]] occurs based on target's obligation.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; One who uses legitimate power may have a high need for power which is their motivator to use this base for change in behavior and influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; There may be a range of legitimate power.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt;

==== Position ====
The legitimate position power is based on the social norm which requires people to be obedient to those who hold superior positions in a formal or informal social structure.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Examples may include: a [[Police legitimacy|police officer's legitimacy]] to make arrests; a parent's legitimacy to restrict a child's activities; the President's legitimacy to live in the White House; and the Congress' legitimacy to declare war. Some pitfalls can arise when too heavy reliance is placed on legitimate power; these include: (a) unexpected exigencies call for non-legitimized individuals to act in the absence of a legitimate authority – such as a citizen's arrest in the absence of a police official; and (b) military legitimacy&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Reciprocity ====
The legitimate power of reciprocity is based on the social norm of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Which states how we feel obligated to do something in return for someone who does something beneficial for us.&lt;ref&gt;Gouldner, A. (1960). The norm of reciprocity: A preliminary statement.
American Sociological Review, 47, 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). New York:
HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Equity ====
The legitimate power of equity is based on the social norm of equity (or [[compensatory damages]])&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; The social norm of equity makes people feel compelled to compensate someone who has suffered or worked hard.&lt;ref&gt;Walster, E., Walster, G. W., &amp; Berscheid, E. (1978). Equity theory and
research. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as someone whom we have harmed in some way is based on the premise that there is a wrong that can be made right, which may be a compensatory form of righting the wrong.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz&gt;Berkowitz, L. and Daniels, L. (1963).  The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, Vol 66(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dependence  ====
The legitimate power of dependence is based on the social norm of [[social responsibility]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Social responsibility norm states how people feel obligated to help someone who is in need of assistance.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz/&gt;

People traditionally obey the person with this power solely based on their role, position or title rather than the person specifically as a leader. Therefore, this type of power can easily be lost and the leader does not have his position or title anymore. This power is therefore not strong enough to be one's only form of influencing/persuading.

=== Referent power ===
{{Main article|Referent power}}
Referent power is rooted in the affiliations we make and/or the groups and organizations we belong to.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Our affiliation with a group and the beliefs of the group are shared to some degree. As Referent power emphasizes similarity, respect for an agent of influence's superiority may be undermined by a target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Use of this power base and its outcomes may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; An agent for change motivated with a strong need for affiliation and concern of likeability will prefer this power base and will influence their leadership style.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Ingratiation or flattery and sense of community may be used by an agent of influence to enhance their influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;
[[File:Reagans with Billy Graham.jpg|thumbnail|Reagans with Rev. Billy Graham]]

==== Positive ====
Referent power in a positive form utilizes the shared personal connection or shared belief between the influencing agent and target with the intention of positively correlated actions of the target.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Negative ====
Referent power in a negative form produces actions in opposition to the intent of the influencing agent, this is the result from the agent's creation of [[cognitive dissonance]] between the referent influencing agent and the target's perception of that influence.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Examples of referent power include: (a) each of the last seven White House press secretaries have been paid handsomely for their memoirs relating to their presence at the seat of government; (b) Mrs. Hillary Clinton gained political capital by her marriage to the President; (c) Reverend Pat Robertson lost a bid for the Republican Party's nomination for President due, in significant part, to his religious affiliation; and (4) national firefighters have received vocational acclaim due to the association with the heroic NYC firefighters. Some pitfalls can occur related to referent assumptions; these include: (a) guilt or glory by association where little or no true tie is established; (b) associative traits tend to linger long after real association ends; (c) some individuals tend to pay dearly for associates' misdeeds or terrible reputations.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; It is important to distinguish between referent power and other bases of social power involving control or [[conformity]].&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Fuqua, Payne, and Cangemi, referent power acts a little like [[role model]] power. It depends on respecting, liking, and holding another individual in high esteem. It usually develops over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="administration1998"/&gt;

The power of holding the ability to administer to another a sense of personal acceptance or personal approval.&lt;ref name=Hinkin&gt;Hinkin, T. R., &amp; Schriesheim, C. A. Development and application of new scales to measure the bases of social power. Journal of Applied Psychology, 1989 74, 561-567.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is strong enough that the power-holder is often looked up to as a role model.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, B. H. Political applications of the psychology of interpersonal influence and social power. Political Psychology, 1990, 11, 493-520.&lt;/ref&gt; This power is often regarded as admiration, or charm. The responsibility involved is heavy and the power easily lost, but when combined with other forms of power it can be very useful. Referent power is commonly seen in political and military figures, although celebrities often have this as well.

=== Expert power===
[[File:Julius Richmond, Surgeon General official photo.jpg|thumbnail|[[Julius Richmond]], [[Surgeon General of the United States]]]]
Expert power is based on what one knows, experience, and special skills or talents.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Expertise can be demonstrated by reputation, credentials certifying [[expertise]], and actions.  The effectiveness and impacts of the Expert power base may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Expert power if the motive is a need for achievement.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; The ability to administer to another information, knowledge or expertise.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven&gt;French, J. R. P., Raven, B. The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright and A. Zander. Group dynamics. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; (Example: Doctors, lawyers). As a consequence of the expert power or knowledge, a leader is able to convince their subordinates to trust them.  The expertise does not have to be genuine – it is the [[perception]] of expertise that provides the power base.  When individuals perceive or assume that a person possesses superior skills or abilities, they award power to that person.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Positive ====
Expert power in a positive form influences the target to act accordingly as instructed by the expert, based on the assumption of the expert's correct knowledge.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

====  Negative ====
Expert power in a negative form can result from a person acting in opposition to the experts instructions if the target feels that the expert has personal gain motives.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Some examples include: (a) a violinist demonstrating through audition skill with music; (b) a professor submits school transcripts to demonstrate discipline expertise; (c) a bricklayer relies on 20+ years of experience to prove expertise. Some pitfalls can emerge when too heavy a reliance is made on expertise; these include: (a) sometimes inferences are made suggesting expertise is wider in scope than it actually is; for example, an expert in antique vases may have little expertise in antique lamps; (b) one's expertise is not everlasting; for example, a physician who fails to keep up with medical technology and advances may lose expertise; and (c) expertise does not necessarily carry with it [[common sense]] or [[ethics|ethical judgement]].&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

=== Informational power ===
French and Raven's original five powers brought about change after many years, by which Raven added a sixth base of power. Informational is the ability of an [[agent of influence]] to bring about change through the resource of information.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Raven arguably believed that power as a potential influence logically meant that information was a form of influence and the social power base of Information Power was derived.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence results in [[cognition]] and acceptance by the target of influence. The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; In order to establish Information Power, an agent of influence would likely provide a baseline of information to a target of influence to lay the groundwork in order to be effective with future [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; A link between informational power, control, cooperation, and satisfaction have been hypothesized and tested in a lab study. The findings indicate that a channel member's control over another's strategy increases with its informational power source.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Information power if the motive is a need for achievement and can also be affected by an agent's [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Feldman summarizes informational power as the most transitory type of power. If one gives information away, then the power is given away, which differs from other forms of power because it's grounded in what you know about the content of a specific situation. Other forms of power are independent of the content.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, R.S. (1985). Social Psychology: Theories, Research, and Applications.  McGraw Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information power comes as a result of possessing knowledge that others need or want.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; In the age of [[Information technology]], information power is increasingly relevant as an abundance of information is readily available.  There may be a [[cost-benefit analysis]] by an agent of influence to determine if Information Power or influence is the best strategy.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence or persuasion would generally be favorable however it may not be best suited if timing and effort lacks.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Information possessed that no one needs or wants is powerless. Information power extends to the ability to get information not presently held such as a case with a librarian or data base manager. Not all information is readily available; some information is closely controlled by few people.  Examples of information that is sensitive or limits accessibility: (a) national security data; (b) personnel information for government or business; (c) corporate trade secrets; (d) juvenile court records; (e) many privately settled lawsuit documents; (f) Swiss bank account owners; and (g) private phone conversations. Of course, legally obtained phone tap warrants, spying, eavesdropping, group and group member leaks can allow others not intended to be privy to information.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Possessing information is not, typically, the vital act; it is what one can and does do or potentially can do with the information that typically is of vital importance. Information can, and often is, used as a weapon as in a divorce, a child custody case, business dissolution, or in civil suits discoveries. Information has been used by some to extort action, utterance, agreement, or settlement by others.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Information power is a form of personal or collective power that is based on controlling information needed by others in order to reach an important goal.  Our society is now reliant on information power as knowledge for influence, decision making, credibility, and control.  Timely and relevant information delivered on demand can be the most influential way to acquire power.  Information may be readily available through public records, research, and but information is sometimes assumed privileged or confidential. The target of influence accepts,comprehends and internalizes the change independently, without have to go back to the influencing agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

Informational power is based on the potential to utilize information.  Providing rational arguments, using information to persuade others, using facts and manipulating information can create a power base.  How information is used – sharing it with others, limiting it to key people, keeping it secret from key people, organizing it, increasing it, or even falsifying it – can create a shift in power within a group.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Direct ====

Information presented by the influencing agent directly to the target of change.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Indirect ====

Information presented influencing agent indirectly to the target of change void of attempting influence, such as hints or suggestions.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Socially independent of change====

The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Power socially independent of change may reflect the target continuing changed behavior without referring to, or even remembering, the supervisor or individual of authority as an agent of change because the target understands and accepts the reasoning of information received.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

==== Accessibility ====

Raven acknowledged leaders can attempt to influence subordinates by access and control of information. Information power may be used in both personal and positional classifications and is among the most preferable power bases.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, D. E. and Stahelski, A. J. The systematic measurement of French &amp; Raven's bases of social power in workgroups. Journal of Applied Social Psychology vol. 18 (1988) pp. 375–389&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tools/mechanisms ====

Informational power includes not only possessing information, but also the ability to obtain relevant information in a timely way to amass a power base.  The use of tools or technological mechanisms such as [[internet]], smart phones, and [[Social media]] progresses society's access to information but informational power as a base is derived by determining the usefulness and appropriateness of the information.&lt;ref&gt;Dessler, G. and Phillips, J. (2008). Managing Now. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power as a function of leadership and leadership styles ==
Tradition power is that force that is exerted upon us to conform to traditional ways. Traditions, for the most part, are social constructs; they invite, seduce, or compel us to conform and act in predictable, patterned ways. Breaking with traditions put people at risk of social alienation. Traditions can blunt rationality; they can block innovation; and they can appear to outsiders as silly when original traditions' rationales become outdated or forgotten.

The power of traditions, rather than being typically vested in particular individuals, is ordinarily focused on group conformity&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Charismatic power is that aura possessed by only a few individuals in our midst; it is characterized by super confidence, typical physical attractiveness, social adroitness, amiability, sharpened leadership skills, and heightened charm. Some [[charisma]] has dark and sinister overtones such as that shown by [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jim Jones]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[David Koresh]], and many [[confidence trickster]]s. Others demonstrate more positive displays of charisma such as that displayed by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Charisma has, in many cases, short circuited rationality; that is, others have been fooled into or lulled into not rationally considering what a charismatic requests or demands but going along as a result of the charismatic attraction. It must be remembered that power is effective only when the target of powerful actions agrees [implicitly or explicitly] to the relevant power dynamic; we are all technically able to resist the power of others; at times, however, we may feel powerless to resist or the social, political, personal, and/or emotional price to be paid is too high or we fear failure in resisting&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

The '''General Product Safety Regulations 2005''' is a 2005 [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|Statutory Instrument]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that demands that "No producer shall [supply or] place a [consumer] product on the market unless the product is a safe product" (reg.5(1)) and provides broad enforcement powers. The '''regulations''' implemented [[European Union]] [[directive 2001/95/EC]] and revoked the '''General Product Safety Regulations 1994'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1994/Uksi_19942328_en_1.htm SI 1994/2328]&lt;/ref&gt; (reg.1(2)). The '''regulations''' also [[repeal]]ed section 10 of the [[Consumer Protection Act 1987]] which had previously imposed a more limited '''general safety requirement''' (reg.46(2)).

It is a [[crime]] to breach the '''general safety requirement'''. On [[summary conviction]] in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]], an offender can be [[sentence (law)|sentence]]d to up to three months' [[imprisonment]] and the [[statutory maximum]] [[fine (penalty)|fine]]. On conviction on [[indictment]] in the [[Crown Court]], an offender can be sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment and a £20,000 fine (s.20(1)). An '''enforcement authority''' can recover the full costs of enforcement from an offender (s.27).

It is a [[defence (legal)|defence]] that all [[due diligence]] was exercised in the supply of the '''product''' (reg.29(1)). Where a person wishes to rely on the defence that supply of a '''dangerous product''' was due to the default of someone else or reliance on information from someone else, he must [[service of process|serve]] notice on the court seven days before the hearing (s.29(2)-(3)).

==The general safety requirement==
The '''regulations''' require that no '''producer''' shall (reg.5):
*Place a '''product''' on the [[marketing|market]];
*Offer or agree to place a product on the market or expose or possess a product for placing on the market;
*Offer or agree to supply a product or expose or possess a product for supply;
*Supply a product;
&amp;mdash; unless the product is a '''safe product'''.

A '''producer''' must provide appropriate information to consumers (art.7). Either a '''producer''' or '''distributor''' must inform an '''enforcement authority''' if they become aware that they have supplied a '''dangerous product''' (reg.9). The '''authority''' must inform the '''Secretary of State''', {{As of|2008|lc=on}} the [[Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]], who must inform the European Commission (regs.33–34)

A '''distributor''' must exercise [[due care]] in helping to ensure safety through (reg.8):
*Not selling '''dangerous products''';
*Providing information to purchasers;
*Maintaining [[traceability]];
*Co-operating with '''enforcement authorities'''.

===Producer===
A '''producer''' is (s.2):
*The manufacturer of a '''product''' who is [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|established]] in the EU;
*A person established in the EU, holding himself out as the manufacturer, for example by selling [[private label]] products under his own [[brand]] ("own-branders");
*A person established in the EU who reconditions the '''product''';
*A person established in the EU who represents a manufacturer from outside the EU;
*Where there is no EU representative of the manufacturer, the [[import]]er into the EU;
*Other [[professional]]s in the [[supply chain]] who affect the safety of the '''product'''.

A supply chain professional whose activity does not affect '''product''' safety is a '''distributor''' (reg.2).

===Product===
The '''regulations''' apply to products supplied commercially, whether or not for [[consideration under English law|consideration]], that are (reg.2):
*[[Consumer product]]s; or
*Likely, under reasonably foreseeable conditions, to be used by consumers;
&amp;mdash; including products that are:
*New, used or reconditioned;
*Made available for consumer for their own use during providing a service, for example [[Rental|hire]] of [[bowling shoes]].

The '''regulations''' do not apply to products used by service providers themselves, especially means of [[transport]] (reg.2), nor do they apply to [[second hand]] goods supplied with the clear intention that they will be repaired or reconditioned before use (reg.4). They do not apply to products where there are specific provisions as to the product's safety in the [[law of the European Union]] (reg.3).

===Safe product===
A '''safe product''' is a product which, under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use including (reg.2):
*Duration of use;
*Putting into service;
*Installation; and
*[[Maintenance, repair and operations|Maintenance]] requirements;
&amp;mdash; does not present any [[risk]] or only the minimum risks compatible with the product's use, considered to be acceptable and consistent with a high level of protection for the safety and health of persons.

Relevant factors are (reg.2):
*Characteristics of the product, including:
**Composition;
**[[Packaging]]; and
**Instructions for [[manufacturing|assembly]], installation and maintenance;
*Effect on other products, where it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be used with other products;
*Presentation, labelling, [[Precautionary statements|warnings]], instructions for use and disposal and any other indication or information regarding the product; and
*Categories of consumers at risk when using the product, in particular [[children]] and [[old age|the elderly]];

&amp;mdash; and conformance to or compliance with (reg.6(3)):
*A voluntary UK standard giving effect to a [[European standard]], but not a European standard published in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]];
*Other UK standards;
*Recommendations of the [[European Commission]] setting guidelines on product safety assessment;
*Product safety codes of good practice in the sector concerned;
*The [[development risks defence|state of the art and technology]]; and
*Reasonable consumer expectations concerning safety.

A product that is not a '''safe product''' is a '''dangerous product'''. A '''product''' is not '''dangerous''' solely because other products are safer or it was feasible to make the product itself safer (reg.2).

===Products deemed safe by conformity===
'''Products''' are deemed '''safe products''' where they conform to:
*UK safety legislation where there is no EU legislation (reg.6(1)); or
*A voluntary UK [[standardisation|standard]] that gives effect to a European standard that itself has been published in the Official Journal (reg.6(2)).

===Antiques===
A '''supplier''' has a defence where (reg.30):
*The '''product''' is second hand goods;
*The '''product''' is an [[antique]];
*The '''supplier''' [[sale of goods|sells]] the '''product''', rather than supplying it for use on some other basis; and
*The '''supplier''' informs the purchaser that the '''product''' is an antique.

==Enforcement==

===Enforcement authorities===
'''Enforcement authorities''' that have a duty to enforce the '''regulations''' are (reg.10):
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*England:
**[[County Council]]s;
**[[Districts of England|District Councils]];
**[[London Borough Council]]s;
**[[Common Council of the City of London]];
**[[Council of the Isles of Scilly]];
{{col-break}}
*Scotland:
**Councils for a local government area; and
*Wales:
**County Councils or [[County Borough Council]]s.
*Northern Ireland:
**[[Local government in Northern Ireland|District Councils]].
{{col-end}}

'''Enforcement authorities''' must act proportionately and encourage voluntary action but may take urgent action in the case of a serious risk (reg.10(5)). They have the power to make [[test purchase]]s (reg.21) and powers of [[entry and search]] (regs.22-23, 25-27). '''Authorities''' must undertake [[market surveillance]] (reg.36) and make information available to the public (reg.39) It is a crime to obstruct an officer of an '''enforcement authority''', punishable on [[summary conviction]] to a fine of up to level 5 on the [[standard scale]] (reg.24(1)).

===Safety notices===
An  '''enforcement authority''' may serve a '''safety notice''' being a:
*'''Suspension notice''' preventing marketing or sale of the goods while safety evaluations, checks and controls and performed (reg.11);
*'''Requirement to mark''' to ensure an adequate safety marking (reg.12);
*'''Requirement to warn''' to issue a warning about a '''dangerous product''' to past and future consumers;
*'''Withdrawal notice''' to withdraw a '''dangerous product''' from the market and, possibly, to warn past consumers (reg.14);
*'''Recall notice''' to [[product recall|recall]] a '''dangerous product''' (reg.15).

The '''Secretary of State''' can require information or a '''product''' [[Sample (material)|sample]] from a '''producer''' and it is a crime not to comply unless the information is protected by [[legal professional privilege]] or the [[right to silence]] (reg.43).

[[Appeal]] against a '''notice''' can be made to a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]] in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland, and to a [[Sheriff Court|Sheriff]] in Scotland (reg.17).

Breach of a '''safety notice''' is a crime and, on [[summary conviction]] in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]], an offender can be [[sentence (law)|sentence]]d to up to three months' [[imprisonment]] and the statutory maximum [[fine (penalty)|fine]]. On conviction on [[indictment]] in the [[Crown Court]], an offender can be sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment and a £20,000 fine (s.20(4)).

===Forfeiture===
In the case of [[prosecution]] for a breach of the '''regulations''' or an appeal against a '''safety notice''' in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the '''enforcement authority''' may apply to the court for '''forfeiture''' of the product. Appeal is to the [[Crown Court]] (England and Wales) or [[County Court]] (Northern Ireland) (reg.18). In Scotland, application must be made to the [[Procurator fiscal]] with appeal to the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (reg.19).

==Further decisions under the Directive==
Art.13 of the '''directive''' gives the European Commission the power to issue further [[European Union decision|decisions]] with which the '''Secretary of State''' must comply (reg.35).

'''Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg''' (born 17 October 1984), alias '''anakata''', is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] computer specialist, known as the former co-owner of the web hosting company [[PRQ]] and co-founder of the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] site [[The Pirate Bay]] together with [[Fredrik Neij]] and [[Peter Sunde]].

Parts of an interview with Svartholm commenting on the [[The Pirate Bay raid|May 2006 police raid]] of [[The Pirate Bay]] are featured in ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' and ''[[Steal This Film]]''. He is a main focus of the documentary ''[[TPB AFK]]''.

In May 2013, [[WikiLeaks]] revealed Svartholm Warg collaborated with the organization for the 2010 release of [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike|''Collateral Murder'']], the helicopter [[Target Acquisition and Designation Sights, Pilot Night Vision System|cockpit gunsight]] video of a July 2007 airstrike by U.S. forces in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="WikiLeaks"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://wikileaks.org/gottfrid-docs/|title=Prosecution and prison documents for Pirate-Bay founder Gottfrid Svartholm Warg (alias Anakata)|publisher=WikiLeaks.org|date=19 May 2013|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WikiLeaks, Svartholm served as technical consultant and managed infrastructure critical to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;WikiLeaks (press release), (29 November 2013). [https://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-consultant-Gottfrid.html ''"WikiLeaks consultant Gottfrid Svartholm Warg extradited from Sweden after alleged access to NSA contractor CSC"'']. WikiLeaks.org. Retrieved 1 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2013 he was extradited to [[Denmark]], where he was charged with infiltrating the Danish social security database, driver’s licence database, and the shared IT system used in the [[Schengen Area|Schengen zone]]. Awaiting his court trial, he was being held in [[solitary confinement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Pirate Bay co-founder appears in Danish court | publisher = [[RT (TV network)|RT]] | date = 18 December 2013  | url = https://rt.com/news/pirate-bay-danish-court-403/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court trial ended on 31 October 2014 and he was found guilty by the jury and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. He immediately appealed the sentence, but, fearing that he may try to evade his sentence, the judges ruled that he should be held in confinement until the appeal court trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Dom i hackersag: Tre et halvt års fængsel til svenske Warg – danske JT får sin pc med hjem | publisher = Version2 | date = 31 October 2014  | url = http://www.version2.dk/artikel/tre-et-halvt-aars-faengsel-til-hackerdoemt-svensker-anker-paa-stedet-70386 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending three years in different prisons from Sweden and Denmark, he was eventually released on 29 September 2015 and is ready to get back to work again in IT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/29/last-pirate-bay-co-founder-released-prison-gottfrid-svartholm/|title=Last Pirate Bay co-founder released from prison|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 September 2015|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Pirate Bay==
{{expand section|date=February 2013}}
Svartholm Warg co-founded [[The Pirate Bay]]. He also created the [[BitTorrent tracker|tracker]] software Hypercube (open source software under no specific license)&lt;ref name="TPB hypercube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3903397/hypercube_tracker_by_anakata|title=Hypercube Tracker by Anakata|publisher=ThePirateBay.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used to run The Pirate Bay web site and tracker.

===Legal issues===
{{see also|The Pirate Bay Trial}}
On 31 January 2008, [[The Pirate Bay]] operators — [[Peter Sunde]], [[Fredrik Neij]], Gottfrid Svartholm and [[Carl Lundström]] ([[CEO]] of The Pirate Bay's former [[ISP]]) — were charged with "promoting other people’s infringements of copyright laws".&lt;ref name="wired cr infringement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/01/pirate-bay-futu/|title=Pirate Bay Future Uncertain After Operators Busted|publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date=31 January 2008|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Pirate Bay Trial|trial]] began on 16 February 2009. On 17 April 2009, Sunde and his co-defendants were found to be guilty of "assisting in making copyright content available" in the [[Stockholm]] district court ([[tingsrätt]]en). Each defendant was sentenced to one year in prison and they were ordered to pay damages of 30 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] (approximately [[€]]3,390,317 or [[United States dollar|US$]]4,222,980), to be apportioned among the four defendants.&lt;ref name="tf tpb verdict"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-trial-the-verdict-090417|title=The Pirate Bay Trial: Official Verdict – Guilty|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=17 April 2009|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants lawyers have appealed to the [[Svea Court of Appeal]] together with a request for a retrial in the district court because of the recent suspicion of bias by judge Tomas Norström.&lt;ref name="local retrial"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/19028/20090423|title=Pirate Bay lawyer calls for retrial|publisher=[[The Local|The Local (Sweden)]]|date=23 April 2009|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Swedish law, the verdict is not lawful until all appeals have been processed.&lt;ref name="csmonitor convicted"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/innovation/2009/04/17/pirate-bay-founders-convicted-by-swedish-court|title=‘Pirate Bay’ founders convicted by Swedish court|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|last=Sullivan|first=Tom|date=17 April 2009|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Svartholm was the subject of an investigation by Swedish prosecutors looking into his role in The Student Bay, a file sharing site specializing in academic texts. Svartholm claimed he had no knowledge of the site. The site was reported by the Swedish Association for Educational Writers in December 2008 claiming it violated copyright law.&lt;ref name="thelocal new probe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/18974/20090420|title=Pirate Bay operator faces new probe|publisher=The Local (Sweden)|date=20 April 2009|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Stockholm District Court ordered that Svartholm be banned from operating the Pirate Bay, despite the facts that he was no longer living in Sweden, and the Pirate Bay was no longer located there.&lt;ref name="tf tpb banning"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founders-banned-from-running-the-site-091029|title=Pirate Bay Founders Banned From Running The Site|publisher=[[TorrentFreak]]|date=29 October 2009|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, a Swedish court ordered that Svartholm be jailed for not attending a court appearance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Arrest in Cambodia==
On 30 August 2012, at the request of Swedish authorities, Svartholm was arrested by [[Cambodia]]n police in the capital [[Phnom Penh]],&lt;ref name="BBC Cambodia"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19457334|title=Pirate Bay co-founder Warg arrested in Cambodia|publisher=BBC News|date=2 September 2012|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he had been living for several years.&lt;ref name="tf cambodia arrest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pirate Bay Founder Arrested in Cambodia|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-arrested-in-cambodia-120901|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=1 September 2012|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambodia has no extradition treaty with Sweden, but Cambodian police spokesman Kirth Chantharith told the AFP news agency "we'll look into our laws and see how we can handle this case". Subsequently, Cambodian police were reported stating that the Swedish government had requested that Gottfrid be deported in connection with "a crime related to information technology".&lt;ref name="tf deported"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-will-be-deported-cambodian-authorities-confirm-120804|title=Pirate Bay Founder will be deported Cambodian authorities confirm|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Torrentfreak]] speculated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-arrest-followed-by-59m-swedish-aid-package-for-cambodia-120905/ |title=Pirate Bay Founder Arrest Followed By $59m Swedish Aid Package For Cambodia |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Svartholm's arrest may have been connected to a 400 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] (at the time, approximately US$59M) two-year "democratic development, human rights, education, and climate change" grant from the Swedish government to the Cambodian government. The grant was announced on 5 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-09/05/c_131829212.htm |title=Sweden grants 59.4 mln USD aid to Cambodia for social development - Xinhua &amp;#124; English.news.cn |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2012-09-05 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gottfrid has since been deported back to Sweden where he served his jail term in the [[Mariefred prison]] in [[Mariefred]].&lt;ref name="pic TBP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i49.tinypic.com/4dvnt.jpg|publisher=grez868|title=Snapshot of TPB|date=24 December 2012|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been investigated for two alleged instances of hacking, including breaking into the Swedish tax office between 2010 and April 2012,&lt;ref name="idg charging"&gt;{{cite web|title=Svartholm Warg to be charged within a month|url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.488999/svartholm-warg-atalas-inom-en-manad|date=28 January 2013|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also suspected of serious fraud. {{As of|2013|01}}, no charges had been filed for these matters yet.&lt;ref name="tf solitary confinement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-released-from-solitary-confinement-121209|title=Pirate Bay founder released from solitary confinement|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=9 December 2012|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early June 2013 Warg was named as a suspect in a Danish case, where millions of [[Personal identification number (Denmark)|personal identification numbers]] were stolen from a police database. Danish police have asked that Warg be extradited from Sweden, so that he can be tried in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karina Svensgaard (bt-ksv) |url=http://www.bt.dk/krimi/saa-mange-data-stjal-hackere-derfor-faar-du-ikke-noget-at-vide |title=Så mange data stjal hackere: Derfor får du ikke noget at vide - Krimi |publisher=www.bt.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later confirmed that Svartholm would be extradited to Denmark, to undergo a similar trial to Sweden, the timing of which is dependent on the outcome in Sweden.&lt;ref name=torrentfreak&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-will-be-extradited-to-denmark-130618/ |title=Pirate Bay Founder Will be Extradited to Denmark |author=Ernesto |date=18 June 2013 |website=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 2013, Gottfrid was found guilty of hacking and sentenced to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-guilty-of-hacking-sentenced-to-two-years-in-prison-130620/ Pirate Bay Founder Guilty of Hacking, Sentenced to Two Years in Prison]&lt;/ref&gt; This two-year prison sentence was eventually reduced to one year by appeal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29832318|title = Pirate Bay founder Gottfrid Warg gets lengthy jail term|date = 30 October 2014|accessdate = 31 October 2014|website = BBC News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, Gottfrid was deported to Denmark and on 31 October 2014 was subsequently sentenced to three and a half years in prison for breaking into computers owned by [[Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==''Americas Dumbest Soldiers'' and meeting Fredrik Neij==
{{anchor|Americas Dumbest Soldiers}}
Svartholm Warg started the website ''Americas Dumbest Soldiers'' which listed deceased US soldiers in the [[Iraq War]] and asked users of the site to rate how "dumb" the soldiers were based on how they died. [[Fredrik Neij]] provided Svartholm Warg's site Internet access via a Swedish provider and [[British Telecom]]. According to Neij, someone at the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] contacted the head of British Telecom, who in turn contacted the head of the Swedish provider, asking them to remove the site. Invoking [[freedom of speech]] and [[parody]], they questioned the request, but eventually removed the site.&lt;ref name="YT tbp afk"&gt;"{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTOKXCEwo_8#t=13m12s|title=TPB AFK: The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard|via=YouTube|publisher=''[[TPB AFK]]''|date=8 February 2013|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, Center for Government Competitiveness (CGC) at [[Seoul National University]] has developed the Government Competitiveness (GC) index which evaluates government achievements in the various fields and furthermore provides policy recommendations to increase competitiveness of government in the future.

== Description ==
'''Government competitiveness''' ('''GC''') is often confounded with similar [[concepts]]. One of the prominent examples is national competitiveness. A variety of institutions have developed indices measuring the level of national competitiveness. Two indices, the World Competitiveness Scoreboard (WCS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imd.org/wcc/wcy-world-competitiveness-yearbook/|title=World Competitiveness Scoreboard|date= 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the [[International Institute for Management Development]] (IMD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imd.org/|title=International Institute for Management Development|date= 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Global Competitiveness Report|the Global Competitiveness Index]] (GCI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015/|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2014 and 2015|date= 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  built by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/|title=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have come to dominate the field of competitiveness studies.

The [[International Institute for Management Development]] [[International Institute for Management Development#MD World Competitiveness Center (WCC)|WCS]] and the [[World Economic Forum]] [[Global Competitiveness Index|the Global Competitiveness Index]] view national competitiveness akin to how business-friendly a nation is, and focus upon economic and market indicators. As such, if a nation is a good place for foreign firms to do business and make money, it will, as a result, be viewed as competitive. Following this logic, the role played by a government then, is mainly restricted to constructing an environment that is attractive to businesses.&lt;ref&gt;For the general assessment on the two indices, see Ochel, W &amp; Rohn, O. (2006). Ranking of countries – the WEF, IMD, Fraser and Heritage Indices. CESifo DICE Report Vol. 4 no. 2. pp. 48-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stressing the broader fields of government activities, several institutions have started to develop indicators emphasizing the role of government in driving development and national competitiveness. Prominent examples include [[Worldwide Governance Indicators|The World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators]] (WGI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#home|title=World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicator}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Quality of Government Institute|the Quality of Government Institute’s]] (QGI) (the University of Gothenburg) Quality of Government indicators(QoG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qog.pol.gu.se/|title=Quality of Government indicators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these two indices constitute important steps toward improving our understanding of how government contributes toward competitiveness, they have also revealed numerous theoretical and methodological shortcomings related to the study of governments’ role in fostering national competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;(2007){{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/4149.htm/|title=The Worldwide Governance Indicators Project: Answering the Critics. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 4149}} For the critics on the WGI and its responses, see Kaufmann, D, Kraay, A, &amp; Mastruzzi, M.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, Center for Government Competitiveness (director: [[Tobin Im]]) has developed the GC index mainly focusing on government capacities and roles in national development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccenter.net|title=Government Competitiveness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After investigating the limited capabilities of existing competitiveness indicators to define and measure the level of GC, the CGC has tried to develop a novel approach to conceptualizing and measuring GC.&lt;ref&gt;Im, T. (2014). Government Competitiveness 2013. Seoul: CM Press (in Korean); Im, T., Kim, S., Ko, G., &amp; Jo, W. (2014). Government Competitiveness: Theory and Evaluation Index. Seoul: Bakyoungsa (In Korean).&lt;/ref&gt;   According to Ho and Im (2012), the concept of GC can be defined as “the power of government to, in light of various constraints, take resources from in and outside of the country and improve social, economic and cultural conditions of the nation in order to sustainably enhance citizens’ quality of life.”  Moreover, the concepts of ‘constraints’ and ‘quality of life’&lt;ref&gt;Ho, A., &amp; Im, T. (2012). Defining a new concept of government competitiveness. The Korean Journal of Public Administration, 50 (3), p. 13 (In Korean).&lt;/ref&gt; can be interpreted in various ways, depending on a nation's unique environments.

By considering different experiences and policy practices between developed countries and developing countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arp.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/09/16/0275074013501856.full.pdf+html|title=Ho, A. &amp; Im, T. (2013). Challenges in Building Effective and Competitive Government in Developing Countries: An Institutional Logics Perspective, The American Review of Public Administration, first published online.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CGC measures the level of government competitiveness by applying different criteria to OECD and non-OECD countries. The seven fields of government activities both OECD and non-OECD countries have in common are followings: economy, education, health and welfare, agriculture and food, ICT, energy and environment, and governance. For OECD countries, three more fields are added: research and development, culture and tourism, and disaster management. Meanwhile, non-OECD countries have nine fields of government activities in total including infrastructure and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccenter.net|title=Government Competitiveness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGC builds the GC index based on David Easton's system theory as a theoretical framework.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, D. (1953). The Political System: An Inquiry into the State of Political Science. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the GC Index first analyzes competitiveness through each of the four levels- input, throughput (public management capacity), output, and outcome. The index then aggregates results from each level to produce an overall competitiveness score. This approach generates a variety of policy implications at each systemic level. The following are some sub-categories for each stage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccenter.net/data/ranking/Government%20Competitiveness%20Report_2016pdf.pdf|title= Center for Government Competitiveness. (2016) Government Competitiveness Report 2016, Graduate School of Public Administration. Seoul National University.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Input: ''' resources, infrastructure, government expenditure, environment &lt;br&gt;
''' Throughput: ''' human, fiscal, organizational capacity, policy, system, process &lt;br&gt;
''' Output: ''' production, growth rate, improvement level, immediate goal achievement &lt;br&gt;  
''' Outcome: ''' quality of life, satisfaction, social capital, ultimate goal achievement

The '''Howard Foundation''' is a charitable trust&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=285822&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 Charity Commission ref 285822]&lt;/ref&gt; with the aims of establishing and maintaining scientific research into nutriceuticals and in assisting the construction and maintenance of buildings at [[Downing College]] [[Cambridge University]]. 

== History ==
In 1982 [[Alan_Howard_(nutritionist)|Dr Alan Howard]], together with his son Jon, formed the Howard Foundation into which all royalties and profits from worldwide sales of the [[Cambridge Diet]] and other intellectual property rights were paid. The Foundation currently focuses on biomedical research and philanthropy.  The Foundation sponsors research into human nutrition and conferences on [[Obesity]], [[Prostate Cancer]], [[Creatine]] and on Macular [[Carotenoid]]s.

== Philanthropy ==
The Foundation has made significant donations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dow.cam.ac.uk/about/our-benefactors Downing College Benefactors]&lt;/ref&gt; to buildings and other works at [[Downing College]] [[Cambridge University]]. In particular, the Howard Building (1986) and the Howard Lodge (1991) both designed by [[Quinlan Terry]] and the Howard Theatre designed by Quinlan and [[Francis_Terry_(architect)|Francis Terry]] (2009). The Foundation sponsored the book by [[Tim Rawle]]: ''A Classical Adventure – the Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rawle |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Rawle |date=2015 |title=A Classical Adventure – the Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge |edition=1st |url=http://oxbridgeportfolio.co.uk/shop/books/a-classical-adventure/ |isbn= 978-0-9572867-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation also made donations to the [[Waterford Institute of Technology]] towards the construction of the Howard Laboratory (an analytical chemical laboratory)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Conferences ==

In May 2010, the Foundation sponsored a conference on "Creatine in Health, Medicine and Sport", held at Downing College, Cambridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Amino Acids |volume= 40 |issue= 5 |pages= 1267–70 |last1= Harris |first1= R |title= Creatine in health, medicine and sport: an introduction to a meeting held at Downing College, University of Cambridge, July 2010 |date= May 2011|doi= 10.1007/s00726-011-0913-3|pmid= 21509489 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. This was followed by the first Macular [[Carotenoid]]s Conference also held at Downing College in July 2011 which led to a book, ''Carotenoids and Retinal Disease''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landrum |first1=John T |last2=Nolan |first2=John |date=18 October 2013 |title=Carotenoids and Retinal Disease |url=https://www.crcpress.com/Carotenoids-and-Retinal-Disease/Landrum-Nolan/p/book/9781466502055 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781466502055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further conferences on Macular [[Carotenoid]]s at Downing College were held in 2013 and 2015. The BON (Brain and Ocular Nutrition) Conference is to be held 11-13 July 2018 again at [[Downing College]], Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

[[File:IndonesiaAceh.png|thumb|Location of Aceh (green) in Indonesia (beige).]]
[[File:Aceh caning 2014, VOA.jpg|thumb|A convict receiving a caning sentence in [[Banda Aceh]] in 2014. Caning is one of the controversial provisions of Islamic criminal law in Aceh.]]
The province of [[Aceh]] in [[Indonesia]] enforces some provisions of [[Islamic criminal law]], the sole province to do so. In Aceh, Islamic criminal law is called ''jinayat'' (an Arabic loanword). The laws that implement it are called ''Qanun Jinayat'' or ''Hukum Jinayat'', roughly meaning "Islamic criminal code".&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ASA2150392016ENGLISH.pdf|title=Indonesia: Criminalization of consensual intimacy or sexual activity for unmarried couples in Aceh must end|author=[[Amnesty International]]|date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Sometimes media sources refer to these laws as the "[[Sharia]]" (Islamic law), but the vast majority of instances of the application of Islamic law in Aceh involved civil cases (e.g. divorce and inheritance), with criminal cases forming only a small subset. See {{harvnb|Cammack|Feener|2012|p=42}} and {{harvnb|Mahkamah Syar'iyah Aceh|2017|pp=34–36}}}} Although the largely-secular [[Law of Indonesia|laws of Indonesia]] apply in Aceh, the provincial government passed additional regulations, some derived from Islamic criminal law, after Indonesia authorized its provinces to enact [[Regional regulation (Indonesia)|regional regulations]] (''perda'') and granted Aceh special autonomy to implement [[Islamic law]]. Offences under the provisions include [[Islam and alcohol|alcohol consumption, production and distribution]], [[Gambling in Islam|gambling]], [[Adultery in Islam|adultery]], rape, sexual harassment, certain intimacies outside marriage, and certain [[LGBT in Islam|homosexual acts]]. Punishments include [[caning]], [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], and [[imprisonment]]. Caning is the only Sharia-based punishment that applied in Aceh; an attempt to introduce [[stoning]] in 2009 by local legislature was vetoed by Governor of Aceh [[Irwandi Yusuf]]. In 2016 Aceh processed 324 [[first instance]] [[court case]]s under Islamic criminal law, and carried out at least 100 caning sentences.

Supporters of Islamic criminal law defend its legality under the special autonomy granted to Aceh, saying that it is covered by the [[freedom of religion]] of the people of Aceh. Critics, including [[Amnesty International]], object to the use of [[caning]] as a punishment, as well as the criminalization of consensual sex outside marriage.

== Background ==
=== Special autonomy of Aceh ===
[[File:Free Aceh Movement women soldiers.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the now-defunct [[Free Aceh Movement]] (date unknown, photo published in 1999). The [[insurgency in Aceh]] led to a peace treaty and special autonomy in Aceh.]]
[[Aceh]] is the westernmost [[Provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]], with a population of 4.49{{nbsp}}million according to the [[Indonesia 2010 census|2010 census]] (roughly 1.8% of [[Indonesia]]'s total population).&lt;ref name=sensus&gt;[http://kesga.kemkes.go.id/images/pedoman/SP2010_Jumlah%20Penduduk%20Per%20Provinsi.pdf Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2010], [[Badan Pusat Statistik]]&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from other regions of Indonesia due to its distinct political, religious, and ethnic identity, formed during the time of the indigenous pre-colonial states such as the [[Aceh Sultanate]].{{sfn|Uddin|2010|p=615}} Muslims in Aceh are generally more religious than those in other parts of Indonesia, and are proud of their Islamic heritage, earning the province the nickname of "Verandah of Mecca" ({{lang-id|serambi Mekkah}}).{{sfn|Uddin|2010|p=615}}{{sfn|Ichwan|2011|p=184}} More than 98% of Aceh's population identify as Muslim.&lt;ref name=religion_aceh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&amp;wid=1100000000|title=Sensus Penduduk 2010, Penduduk Menurut Wilayah dan Agama yang Dianut, Provinsi Aceh|language=id|publisher=[[Badan Pusat Statistik]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Reformasi (Indonesia)|post-Suharto reforms]], Indonesia granted more power to local governments.{{sfn|Cammack|Feener|2012|p=36}} This decentralization of power was largely governed by two laws passed in 1999 and 2004.{{sfn|Cammack|Feener|2012|p=36}} These laws authorized the local governments and legislatures to pass [[Regional regulation (Indonesia)|regional regulations]] (''peraturan daerah'' or ''perda'') that carry the force of law, as long as they do not conflict with laws or regulations that are higher in the hierarchy of laws.{{sfn|Cammack|Feener|2012|p=36}} Aceh's regional regulations are known as ''qanun'' (from [[Qanun (law)|an Arabic word]] meaning "law" or "rules") instead of ''perda''.&lt;ref name=hukum_basis/&gt;

In addition to this, Aceh was given special autonomy, partly in response to the 1976{{ndash}}2005 [[Insurgency in Aceh|insurgency in the province]].&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; Indonesian Law No.{{nbsp}}18 of 2001 on Special Autonomy in Aceh granted broader powers to the province, including the authority to formally implement Islamic law.{{sfn|Cammack|Feener|2012|p=38}} Law No.{{nbsp}}11 of 2006 on the Administration of Aceh explicitly made implementation of Islamic law the legal duty of the government of Aceh.{{sfn|Ichwan|2011|p=184}}

=== Status of Islamic law in Indonesia ===
{{see|Law of Indonesia|Application of Islamic law by country}}
At the national level, there are three systems of law in operation in Indonesia: civil law, commercial law, and criminal law. Outside Aceh, the influence of Islamic law is limited to civil law in the areas of marriage, inheritance, and religious endowments ({{lang-id|[[waqf|waqaf]]}}), and to commercial law in certain areas of [[Islamic banking and finance]].{{sfn|Cammack|Feener|2012|pp=28–29}} Other sources of civil and commercial law include European codes and customary tradition ({{lang-id|[[adat]]}}).&lt;ref name=legalsystem&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseanlawassociation.org/papers/LegalSystem.pdf|title=Legal System|publisher=ASEAN Law Association|accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal code ({{lang-id|Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana}}, KUHP, the "Criminal Law Code") is largely based on the Netherlands Indies Criminal Code imposed by the [[Netherlands]], which ruled Indonesia before 1945, with certain amendments promulgated by the Republic of Indonesia after independence.&lt;ref name=legalsystem/&gt; Aceh is the only province of Indonesia that enforces Islamic law in criminal matters.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-aceh-law-idUSKCN0SI02H20151024|title=Indonesia's Aceh province enacts Islamic criminal code|date=2015-10-23|publisher=Reuters|last=Munawir|first=Reza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==
{{see|Regional regulation (Indonesia)}}
Provisions of Islamic law specific to Aceh are promulgated through ''qanuns'', which have the legal status of ''perda'' (regional regulation).&lt;ref name=hukum_basis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hukumonline.com/klinik/detail/lt563a237f66b9e/dasar-hukum-pelaksanaan-pemerintahan-di-aceh|title=Dasar Hukum Pelaksanaan Pemerintahan di Aceh|date=2015-11-06|publisher=Hukumonline|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their legal basis includes Indonesian laws authorizing ''perda'', as well Law No.{{nbsp}}11 of 2006, which mandated Islamic law in Aceh.&lt;ref name=hukum_legality&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hukumonline.com/klinik/detail/lt50c91f228f796/keabsahan-ketentuan-pidana-dalam-qanun-pemerintah-aceh|title=Keabsahan Ketentuan Pidana dalam Qanun Pemerintah Aceh|date=2013-05-06|publisher=Hukumonline|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''qanun'' requires approval from both the [[parliament of Aceh]] ({{lang-id|Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Aceh}}, DPRA) and the governor to become law.{{sfn|Ichwan|2011|p=212}} While the largely secular [[Law of Indonesia|Indonesian national law]] still applies in Aceh, the ''qanuns''  cover offences not defined in the national law, and in some cases define a different punishment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hukumonline.com/klinik/detail/cl277/pluralisme-sistem-hukum-di-aceh&lt;/ref&gt; The ''qanuns'' are subordinate to the Indonesian constitution and national laws, and are subject to judicial review in the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia|Supreme Court]] or the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref name=hukum_legality/&gt; This legal structure means that not all provisions of Islamic law apply in Aceh, but only the specific elements of it which have been legislated.{{sfn|Ichwan|2011|p=199}} It also means that legislation is carried out by the elected parliament and governor, not the [[ulema]] (Islamic scholars).{{sfn|Ichwan|2011|p=212}}

== Legislative history ==
[[File:Irwandi Yusuf 2007.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Irwandi Yusuf]] (in office 2007–2012) vetoed a 2009 ''qanun'' which would have introduced stoning.]]
Institution of Islamic criminal law in Aceh began with ''Qanun'' No.{{nbsp}}11 of 2002, which was largely symbolic.{{sfn|Cammack|Feener|2012|p=38}} In 2003 further laws were passed: ''Qanuns'' No.{{nbsp}}12, which dealt with the consumption of alcohol, No.{{nbsp}}13, on gambling, and No.{{nbsp}}14, on ''khalwat'' (being alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not a spouse or a relative).{{sfn|Cammack|Feener|2012|p=38}} In 2009 the parliament of Aceh approved a new ''qanun'' that expanded the implementation of Islamic criminal law, but the [[governor of Aceh|governor]] at the time, [[Irwandi Yusuf]], refused to sign the ''qanun'' into law, openly declaring his opposition to the provision of [[stoning]] (''[[rajm]]'') in the Qanun.{{sfn|Ichwan|2011|p=211}} The law required approval from both the legislature and the governor, so it did not go into effect.{{sfn|Ichwan|2011|pp=183–184, 211}}&lt;ref name=jakartapost_early&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/02/07/aceh-fully-enforces-sharia.html|title=Aceh fully enforces sharia|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27{{nbsp}}September 2014 the parliament of Aceh passed ''Qanun'' No.{{nbsp}}6, which revised the rejected 2009 ''qanun'' and removed the provision of stoning.&lt;ref name=tempo&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/news/2015/10/23/078712269/qanun-jinayat-kini-berlaku-hukuman-cambuk-lebih-berat|title=Qanun Jinayat Kini Berlaku, Hukuman Cambuk Lebih Berat|date=2015-10-23|publisher=[[Tempo (Indonesian magazine)|Tempo]]|last=Warsidi|first=Adi|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jakartapost_early/&gt; Governor [[Zaini Abdullah]] signed it into law on 23{{nbsp}}October 2014, and it went into effect one year later on 23{{nbsp}}October 2015, as stipulated by the ''qanun''.&lt;ref name=tempo/&gt; Compared to the 2003 ''qanuns'' that it replaced, ''Qanun'' No.{{nbsp}}6 increased the number of offences punishable under Islamic law as well as the severity of punishment.&lt;ref name=tempo/&gt;&lt;ref name=hukum_online_history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hukumonline.com/berita/baca/lt54d80e8854ee1/qanun-hukum-jinayah--kitab-pidana-ala-serambi-mekkah|title=Qanun Hukum Jinayah, Kitab Pidana ala Serambi Mekkah|publisher=Hukumonline|date=2015-02-09|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia's Aceh province: Laying down God’s law|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21596577-politics-much-faith-behind-harder-line-laying-down-gods-law|date=2014-02-15|publisher=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 2003 laws, the maximum number of caning strokes was set at 40, and in practice it rarely exceeded 12, but the 2014 law set the minimum number of strokes at 10 and the maximum at 150.&lt;ref name=tempo/&gt;

=== Possible expansion ===
On March 2018, Aceh's sharia and human rights bureau started conducting research and consulting public opinion for the introduction of [[capital punishment]], specifically [[Decapitation|beheading]], as punishment for severe crimes such as murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/indonesian-province-aceh-considers-beheading-as-punishment|title=Indonesian province considers beheading as murder punishment|last=B|first=Associated Press in|last2=Aceh|first2=a|date=2018-03-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provisions ==
''Qanun'' Aceh No. 6 of 2014 (known as the ''Qanun Jinayat'') is the latest revision of Islamic criminal law implementation in Aceh. It criminalizes the [[Islam and alcohol|consumption and production of liquor]] (called ''khamar'' in the law), [[gambling in Islam|gambling]] (''maisir''), being alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not a spouse or a relative (''khalwat''), committing intimacy outside marriage (''ikhtilath''), [[Zina|adultery]] (''zina''), [[sexual abuse]] (''pelecehan seksual''), rape (''pemerkosaan''), falsely accusing someone of adultery (''qadzaf''), [[LGBT in Islam|sodomy]] (''liwath''), and [[lesbian]] acts (''musahaqah'')&lt;ref name=jakartapost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/10/23/qanun-jinayat-becomes-official-all-people-aceh.html|title='Qanun Jinayat' becomes official for all people in Aceh|date=2015-10-13|last=Simajuntak|first=Hotli|publisher=[[The Jakarta Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qanun Aceh No. 6 of 2014, Arts 1 and 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty for violation of these laws includes caning, fines, and imprisonment.&lt;ref name=jakartapost/&gt; The severity of the sentence varies.&lt;ref name=jakartapost/&gt; ''Khalwat'' offences have the lightest sentence, and may include caning (maximum 10 strokes), 10 months' imprisonment, or a fine of 100 [[gold gram]]s.&lt;ref name=bbc_response&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/indonesia/berita_indonesia/2015/10/151023_indonesia_pemberlakuan_jinayah|title=Perda Jinayat Aceh terus dikecam|date=2015-10-23|publisher=BBC Indonesia|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qanun Aceh No. 6 of 2014, Art 23&lt;/ref&gt; The heaviest sentence is imposed on perpetrators of [[child rape]]; the sentence may be caning (150{{ndash}}200 strokes), imprisonment (150{{ndash}}200 months), or a fine (1,500{{ndash}}2,000 gold grams).&lt;ref&gt;Qanun Aceh No. 6 of 2014, Art 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tempo_200&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tempo.co/read/news/2015/10/27/058713390/qanun-jinayat-hukuman-pemerkosa-anak-cambuk-200-kali|title=Qanun Jinayat: Hukuman Pemerkosa Anak, Cambuk 200 Kali|date=2015-10-27|publisher=[[Tempo]]|language=id|last=Warsidi|first=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges of individual cases have the discretion of imposing caning, imprisonment, or a fine.&lt;ref name=tempo_200/&gt; According to [[Amnesty International]], there were 108 cases of caning carried out under the ''Qanun'' in 2015, and 100 in 2016 up to October.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc_response/&gt;

The law is applicable to all offences committed by Muslims or legal entities in Aceh. In addition, it also applies to offences committed by non-Muslims if the offences are not regulated in the Indonesian Criminal Code, or if committed together with a Muslim and the non-Muslim voluntarily chooses Islamic law.&lt;ref name=jakartapost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qanun Aceh No. 6 of 2014, Art 5&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016 a Christian woman was caned 28 times for selling alcohol{{snd}}the first non-Muslim to receive caning under the law.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;

[[File:Mahkamah Syar'iyyah Aceh.JPG|thumb|The Aceh Sharia courts (Mahkamah Syar'iyah Aceh), which hear both civil and criminal cases involving Islamic law]]
Major institutions relevant to the implementation of Islamic criminal law in Aceh include the ulama council ({{lang-id|Majelis Permusyawaratan Ulama}}, MPU), the [[Wilayatul Hisbah]] (WH, sometimes referred to in English as the "Sharia police"), and the sharia courts ({{lang-id|Mahkamah Syar'iyah}}).{{sfn|Cammack|Feener|2012|p=39}} The ulema council is composed of both the ulama and "Muslim intellectuals", and on paper is expected to be involved in drafting legislation together with the government.

[[Amnesty International]] said that they are "seriously concerned" about the implementation of the law and called for the repeal of some of its provisions.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt; It said that caning can amount to torture and contravenes the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] and [[international human rights law]], and can cause long-term physical and mental injuries.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt; Additionally, it objected to the criminalization of consensual sexual relationships outside marriage, on the grounds that they violate the right to privacy.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt; Indonesian women's rights [[NGO|organization]] [[Solidaritas Perempuan]] said that the provisions are biased against women, and that the high standard of proof required for rape convictions means that many rapists are acquitted.&lt;ref name=kompas_criticism&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2016/10/23/23340501/setahun.diberlakukan.qanun.jinayat.aceh.diminta.dikaji.ulang?page=all|title=Setahun Diberlakukan, Qanun Jinayat Aceh Diminta Dikaji Ulang|publisher=[[Kompas]]|date=2016-10-23|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholar [[Hamdani (legal scholar)|Hamdani]] of Aceh's [[Malikussaleh University]] said that the people of Aceh have the right to enact Islamic law as [[freedom of religion]] and defended its legality based on Indonesian laws granting Aceh authority to enact Islamic law.{{sfn|Hamdani|2013|p=89}} Deputy head of the [[Aceh Islamic Sharia Agency]] [[Munawar Jalil]] rejected criticism that provisions of the law violated human rights or existing laws in Indonesia and Aceh, and invited critics to file a [[judicial review]] if they believe otherwise.&lt;ref name=jakartapost/&gt;

Bush]], serving as the Science Advisor to the [[President of the United States|President]]. His tenure was marked by controversy regarding his defense of the administration against allegations from over two dozen [[Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureates]], amongst others, that scientific evidence was [[Politicization of science|being suppressed or ignored]] in policy decisions, including those relating to [[Stem-cell research|stem cell research]] and [[global warming]]. However, he has also been credited with keeping the political effects of the [[September 11 attacks]] from harming science research—by ensuring that tighter visa controls did not hinder the movement of those engaged in scientific research—and with increasing awareness of the relationship between science and government. He also served as the President of [[Stony Brook University]] from 1980 until 1994, and director of [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] from 1998 until 2001.

==Early life==
Marburger was born on [[Staten Island, New York]], to Virginia Smith and John H. Marburger Jr., and grew up in [[Severna Park, Maryland]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], graduating in 1962 with a [[B.A.]] in [[physics]], followed by a [[Ph.D.]] in [[applied physics]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnlobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thesis-marburger-1967"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302266315/ |title=The derivative method in many body theory |date=1967 |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Marburger |first=John Harmen, III |via=[[ProQuest]] |subscription=yes |oclc=654228115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his education, he served as a professor of physics and [[electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Southern California]] beginning in 1966, specializing in the [[theoretical physics]] of [[nonlinear optics]] and [[quantum optics]], and co-founded the Center for Laser Studies at that institution. He rose to become chairman of the physics department in 1972, and then dean of the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 1976. He was engaged as a public speaker on science, including hosting a series of educational television programs on [[CBS]]. He was also outspoken on campus issues, and was designated the university's spokesperson during a scandal over preferential treatment of athletes.&lt;ref name="bnlobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crease|first=Robert P.|title=Realist in the modern scientific era; John Marburger knew how to promote research in face of competing interests|url=http://www.newsday.com/opinion/oped/crease-marburger-knew-how-to-do-science-1.3067553|accessdate=4 August 2011|newspaper=Newsday|date=1 August 2011|page=A31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stony Brook University==

In 1980, Marburger left USC to become the third president of the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] on [[Long Island]], New York. At the time, state budget cuts were afflicting the university, and he returned it to growth with increases in the university's science research funding from the federal government. He also presided over the founding of [[Stony Brook University Medical Center]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/30/us/30marburger.html|title=John H. Marburger, Bush Science Adviser, Dies at 70|author=Paul Vitello|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bnlobit"/&gt;

From 1988 to 1994, Marburger chaired [[Universities Research Association]], the organization that operated [[Fermilab]] and oversaw construction of the ill-fated [[Superconducting Super Collider]],&lt;ref name="bnlobit" /&gt; an experience that is credited with convincing him of the influence government had in how science is carried out.&lt;ref name="newsday" /&gt; During this time he also served as a trustee of [[Princeton University]]. He stepped down as President of Stony Brook University in 1994, and began doing research again as a member of the faculty.&lt;ref name="bnlobit" /&gt;

===Chair of Shoreham commission===

In 1983, he was picked by New York Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] to chair a scientific fact-finding commission on the [[Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant]], a job that required him to find common ground between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newsday" /&gt; Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] regulations were put into effect after the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gargan|first=Edward A.|title=Shoreham Panel Says Evacuation Depends on Suffolk's Cooperation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/21/nyregion/shoreham-panel-says-evacuation-depends-on-suffolk-s-cooperation.html|accessdate=6 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 November 1983|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marburger characterized his participation as a learning experience, and the experience was credited with profoundly changing his view on the relationship between the scientific community and the public. He had never been to a public hearing prior to his participation in the Shoreham commission, and he said that he had initially expected that the issues could be resolved by examining scientific data and establishing failure probabilities. However, he quickly became aware of the importance of the public participation process itself, stating that it was "one of the rare opportunities for the public to feel they were being heard and taken seriously." Marburger's conduct on the committee was praised by activists on both sides of the debate, with his focus on listening to all viewpoints and his ability to not take disagreements personally being especially noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winerip|first=Michael|title=Man in the News: A Mediator For Shoreham Panel, John Harmen Marburger 3d|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/15/nyregion/man-in-the-news-a-mediator-for-shoreham-panel-john-harmen-marburger-3d.html|accessdate=7 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 December 1983|page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brookhaven National Laboratory==

In January 1998, Marburger became president of [[Brookhaven Science Associates]], which subsequently won a bid to operate [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] for the federal government, and he became the director of the lab. He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which [[tritium]] leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists to shut down the lab. Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]], expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its [[technology transfer]] program.&lt;ref name="bnlobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt;

The tritium leak, combined with other disclosures about improper handling and disposal of [[hazardous waste]], had caused [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] [[Federico Peña]] to fire the lab's previous manager, [[Associated Universities, Inc.]] Upon starting as the laboratory's director, Marburger noted the increased importance of health and environmental concerns since the beginning of the Cold War, stating that "getting the people at Brookhaven to understand that won't be simple, and there may be some disagreement on how we should do it, but that's my job."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = At Troubled Brookhaven Lab, Priority Now Is Safe Science|date = 4 December 1997|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/04/nyregion/at-troubled-brookhaven-lab-priority-now-is-safe-science.html|last = McQuiston|first = John T.|newspaper = The New York Times|accessdate = 11 August 2013|page = B20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marburger set up a permanent community advisory council and met with local environmental groups to increase communication between them and the laboratory's management. By 2001, when Marburger left to join the Bush administration, local environmental groups credited him with having largely dissipated the distrust that had existed between the groups when he started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Man in the News: John Marburger; Balancing the Equation of Science and Politics|date = 3 July 2011|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/03/science/man-in-the-news-john-marburger-balancing-the-equation-of-science-and-politics.html|last = Glanz|first = James|newspaper = The New York Times|accessdate = 11 August 2013|page = F3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Lab Seeks Leader for Post-Marburger Era|date = 15 July 2001|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/nyregion/lab-seeks-leader-for-post-marburger-era.html|last = Cotsalas|first = Valerie|newspaper = The New York Times|accessdate = 11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bush administration==
[[Image:John Marburger speaking.jpg|thumb|Marburger speaking during a 2003 news conference]]

In September 2001, Marburger became Director of the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] under [[George W. Bush]]. Marburger was a noted Democrat, a fact that ''Nature'' magazine stated was relevant to the decision by the administration to take the unusual step of withholding from Marburger the title of [[Assistant to the President]] that previous science advisors had been granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bush’s science advisor John Marburger dies, aged 70|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/08/bushs_science_advisor_john_mar_1.html|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|accessdate=12 October 2013|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His tenure was marked by controversy as he defended the Bush administration from accusations that [[Politicization of science|political influence on science]] was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, especially on the topics of [[abstinence-only]] birth control education, [[Climate change policy of the George W. Bush administration|climate change policy]], and [[Stem cell laws and policy in the United States|stem cell research]]. Marburger defended the Bush Administration from these accusations, saying they were inaccurate or motivated by partisanship, especially on the issue of science funding levels. Marburger continued to be personally respected by many of his academic colleagues.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sci11"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mervis|first=Jeffrey|title=John Marburger's Impact on U.S. Science Policy|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/08/john-marburgers-impact-on-us-science.html|work=ScienceInsider|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=4 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009070749/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/08/john-marburgers-impact-on-us-science.html|archivedate=9 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marburger's tenure as Director was the longest in the history of that post. After the [[September 11 attacks]], he helped to establish the [[DHS Directorate for Science and Technology]] within the new [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's [[Space policy of the George W. Bush administration|space policy]] after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]], and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] program. Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging field of [[science of science policy]], which seeks to analyze how [[science policy]] decisions affects a nation's ability to produce and benefit from innovation.&lt;ref name="bnlobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sci11"/&gt;

In February 2004, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Integrity in Policy Making: Further Investigation of the Bush Administration’s Misuse of Science|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/abuses_of_science/scientific-integrity-in.html|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=19 December 2011|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; accusing the Bush administration of manipulating science for political purposes, listing more than 20 alleged incidents of censoring scientific results or applying a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] in the appointment of supposedly scientific advisory panel members. In April 2004, Marburger published a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marburger|first=John|title=Statement of the Honorable John H. Marburger, III On Scientific Integrity in the Bush Administration|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/scientific_integrity/ResponsetoCongressonUCSDocument.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2011|date=2 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; rebutting the report and exposing errors and incomplete explanations in it, and stating that "even when the science is clear—and often it is not—it is but one input into the policy process," but "in this Administration, science strongly informs policy." The Union of Concerned Scientists issued a revised version of their report after Marburger's statement was published. Marburger also called the report's conclusions illusory and the result of focusing on unrelated incidents within a vast government apparatus, and attributed the controversy as being related to the [[United States elections, 2004|upcoming elections]]. It was noted that Marburger enjoyed close personal relationships with President Bush, [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Andrew Card]] and [[Office of Management and Budget]] Director [[Joshua Bolten]], attesting to his active involvement within the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malakoff|first=David|title=White House Rebuts Charges It Has Politicized Science|journal=Science|date=9 April 2004|volume=304|issue=5668|pages=184–185|doi=10.1126/science.304.5668.184|pmid=15073339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glanz|first=James|title=At the Center Of the Storm Over Bush and Science|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/30/science/at-the-center-of-the-storm-over-bush-and-science.html|accessdate=19 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marburger responded to criticism of his support for Bush administration policies in 2004, stating "No one will know my personal positions on issues as long as I am in this job. I am here to make sure that the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser."&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the [[National Association of Science Writers]], he stated, "[[Intelligent design]] is not a scientific theory.... I don't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mooney|first=Chris|title=Intelligent Denials|url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9216|accessdate=4 August 2011|newspaper=American Prospect|date=22 February 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205114948/http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9216|archivedate=5 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also In 2005, he told ''The New York Times'' that "global warming exists, and we have to do something about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=John H. Marburger, chief science adviser to George W. Bush, dies at 70|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-07-30/local/35267480_1_john-harmen-marburger-iii-science-and-technology-policy-cells|accessdate=7 February 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sherwood Boehlert]], the Republican chair of the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|House Committee on Science]] during most of Marburger's tenure, said that "the challenge he faced was serving a president who didn't really want much scientific advice, and who let politics dictate the direction of his science policy... and he was in the unenviable position of being someone who had earned the respect of his scientific colleagues while having to be identified with policies that were not science-based."&lt;ref name="sci11"/&gt; On the other hand, [[Robert P. Crease]], a colleague of Marburger at Stony Brook University, characterized him as someone who "[went] to the White House as a scientist, not an advocate. He refused to weigh in on high-profile, politically controversial issues, but instead set about fixing broken connections in the unwieldy machinery by which the government approves and funds scientific projects.... Some bitterly criticized him for collaborating with the Bush administration. But he left the office running better than when he entered."&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt;

==Later life==

Marburger returned to Stony Brook University as a faculty member in 2009, and co-edited the book ''The Science of Science Policy: A Handbook'', which was published in 2011. He also served as Vice President for Research but stepped down on July 1, 2011. Marburger died Thursday, July 28, 2011, at his home in [[Port Jefferson, New York]], after four years of treatment for [[non-Hodgkins lymphoma]]. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and a grandson. His final publication, a book on quantum physics for laypeople called ''Constructing Reality: Quantum Theory and Particle Physics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Marburger |title=Constructing Reality: Quantum Theory and Particle Physics' |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |year=2011 |ISBN=978-1-107-00483-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published shortly after his death.&lt;ref name="bnlobit"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Memoriam: John Marburger|url=http://www.bnl.gov/today/story.asp?ITEM_NO=2516|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|accessdate=3 August 2011|date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael''''', 526 U.S. 137 (1999), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case that applied the [[Daubert Standard|''Daubert'' standard]] to [[expert testimony]] from non-scientists.

==Facts of the case==
Patrick Carmichael was driving his [[minivan]] on July 6, 1993, when the right rear [[tire]] blew out.  One of the [[passengers]] in the [[vehicle]] died, and others were severely injured.  Three months later, the Carmichaels sued the [[manufacturer]] of the tire, claiming that the tire was defective and the defect caused the [[accident]].  The Carmichaels' case rested largely on [[testimony]] from a tire failure expert.  

The tire failure expert relied on features of tire [[technology]] that the [[manufacturer]] did not dispute, as well as background facts about the particular tire on the Carmichaels' [[van]].  The expert's conclusion that a defect in the tire caused the accident rested on certain observations about the tire that [[Kumho Tire]] vigorously disputed.  Kumho also disagreed with certain aspects of the tire expert's methodology, and asked the [[federal district court]] hearing the case to exclude it under Rule 702 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]].  

The district court took its cue from ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]],'' which had solidified a gatekeeping role for trial judges in admitting [[expert testimony]].  Under ''Daubert'', certain factors contribute to the reliability, and hence the admissibility, of expert testimony, one of which is the general validity of the expert's [[Methodology|methods]].  The district court found the [[tire]] expert's methods not to be scientifically valid, and hence excluded his testimony.  This resulted in a conclusion that Kumho Tire would rightly prevail.  The Carmichaels appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]].

The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court's ruling.  It reasoned that ''Daubert'' was expressly limited only to scientific expert testimony and did not apply to "skill- or experience-based observation."  The tire expert's testimony rested on such unscientific "observation and experience", and so the Eleventh Circuit reasoned the district court should have made a different ruling based on their legal reasoning over Rule 702 without the ''Daubert'' gloss.  Kumho Tire asked the Supreme Court to review whether ''Daubert'' applied solely to scientific evidence.

==Majority opinion==
The Court found in the text of Rule 702, a codification of ''Daubert'', a gatekeeping function for federal trial judges who had to determine whether expert scientific testimony was admissible in a federal trial.  But Rule 702 applies to "scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge."  "This language makes no relevant distinction between 'scientific' knowledge and 'technical' or 'other specialized' knowledge."  True, ''Daubert'' only dealt with scientific knowledge.  But that was the nature of the case, and did not stray beyond the facts of that case.

The Court observed that the line between "scientific" and "technical" knowledge is not always clear.  "Pure scientific theory itself may depend for its development upon observation and properly engineered machinery.  And conceptual efforts to distinguish the two are unlikely to produce clear legal lines capable of application in particular cases."  If the line between "scientific" and "technical" knowledge was not clear, then it would be difficult for federal trial judges to determine when they were to perform ''Daubert'''s gatekeeping function and when to apply some other threshold test the Court might craft for applying Rule 702.  Furthermore, the Court saw no "convincing need" to draw a distinction between "scientific" and "technical" knowledge, because both kinds of knowledge would typically be outside the grasp of the average juror.  Accordingly, the Court held that the gatekeeping function described in ''Daubert'' applied to all expert testimony proffered under Rule 702.

''Daubert'' had mentioned four factors that district courts could take into account in making the gatekeeping assessment&amp;mdash;whether a theory has been tested, whether an idea has been subjected to scientific peer review or published in scientific journals, the rate of error involved in the technique, and even general acceptance, in the right case.  In the context of other kinds of expert knowledge, the Court conceded, other factors might be relevant, and so it allowed district judges to take other factors into account when performing the gatekeeping function contemplated by ''Daubert''.  These additional factors would, of course, depend on the particular kind of expert testimony involved in a particular case.  Equally as important, because federal appeals courts review the evidentiary rulings of district courts for [[abuse of discretion]], the Court reiterated that district courts have a certain latitude to determine how they will assess the reliability of expert testimony as a subsidiary component of the decision to admit the evidence at all.

Applying that standard to the evidence proffered by the Carmichaels' tire expert, the Court concluded that the district court correctly refused to admit the expert's testimony.  The district court had to determine whether the tire expert's methods could reliably determine what had caused the tire on the Carmichaels' van to explode.  The expert's experience as a tire engineer wasn't the problem&amp;mdash;the expert had worked for ten years at [[Michelin]].  The fact that visual inspection of tires was generally a reliable method wasn't an issue either, because the issue before the court was specific to the tire on the Carmichaels' van.  But the expert said that his inspection of the tire led to the conclusion that a defect caused the tire to explode because he did not see evidence of other causes.  "Nothing in either ''Daubert'' or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ''ipse dixit'' of the expert [i.e., only by the statement of the expert himself]."  The district court acted within its discretion to exclude the evidence proffered by the tire expert in light of these concerns.  Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit's decision to overrule the district court.

== Biography==

A native of [[Frankfurt am Main]], Lars-Hendrik Röller is the son of the former chairman of the board of [[Dresdner Bank]], Wolfgang Röller. Lars-Hendrik Röller earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] in [[computer science]] from the [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1981 as well as a [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] in [[artificial intelligence]] and a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[economics]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1982 and 1983. In 1987, Röller obtained a [[Ph.D.]] in economics from the University of Pennsylvania, where he also briefly worked as lecturer, with a thesis on the theory and application of [[contestable market]]s. He then became assistant professor (1987–91) and later associate professor (1991–95) and full professor of economics (1995–99) at [[INSEAD]] in [[Fontainebleau]]. Since 1994, Röller has worked in Berlin in various functions, directing the Institute on Competitiveness and Industrial Change at the [[WZB Berlin Social Science Center]] from 1994 to 2007, where he also has been working as research professor on innovation and competition since 2007, and holding the chair of the Institute of Industrial Economics at [[Humboldt University Berlin]] since 1995. Additionally, Röller has been a full professor at the [[European School of Management and Technology]], which he has presided over between 2006 and 2011. Throughout his academic career, Röller has held visiting appointments at the [[Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona]], [[New York University]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]] (NHH).

== Research==

Lars-Hendrik Röller's research focuses on the economics of [[competition]], technology, and innovation. His contributions to research have been acknowledged through the [[Gossen Prize]] (2002), a fellowship of the [[European Economic Association]] (2004), and a membership of the German Academy of Sciences (2008). Key contributions of his research include the following:

* Investments into telecommunication infrastructure between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s likely substantially increased [[economic growth]] in the [[OECD]], especially when it led to an infrastructure allowing for near universal universal (with [[Leonard Waverman]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.4.909 Röller, L.H., Waverman, L. (2001). Telecommunications infrastructure and economic development: A simultaneous approach. ''American Economic Review'', 91(4), pp. 909-923.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether or not innovation policies are complementary depends on whether the target is to make firms innovative or increase their innovation intensity as well as on the particular pair of policies, suggesting that packages of policies may be needed to make firms innovate whereas a more targeted approach is needed to increase the intensity of their innovations (with [[Pierre Mohnen]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292103001600 Mohnen, P., Röller, L.H. (2005). Complementarities in innovation policy. ''European Economic Review'', 49(6), pp. 1431-1450.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reflecting the need to evaluate the efficiencies of corporate mergers on a case-by-case basis, first assessing mergers through routine tools with modest information requirements and then assessing them further, including an efficiency defence, may be an information efficient framework for evaluations (with Johan Stennek and Frank Verboven).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/11608# Röller, L.H., Stennek, J., Verboven, F. (2000). ''Efficiency gains from mergers''. Berlin: WZB.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In particular due to the alignment of the pricing strategies of mobile phone services operators across multiple markets and the cross-ownership of licenses, the prices for such services in the [[United States|U.S.]] during the 1980s were significantly above those to be expected under [[perfect competition]] or in a non-cooperative [[duopoly]] (as existed due to the award of two licenses per geographic region by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]), suggesting substantial gains to deregulation (with [[Philip Parker]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2555807?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Parker, P.M., Röller, L.H., (1997). Collusive conduct in duopolies: multimarket contact and cross-ownership in the mobile telephone industry. ''RAND Journal of Economics'', 28(2), pp. 304-322.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* If lobbying is efficient, accountability low, mergers large, and profits grow disproportionately as the size of mergers increases, the use of a consumer surplus standard by an antitrust agency to assess mergers yields higher welfare than the use of a welfare standard (with [[Damien Neven]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016771870500127X Neven, D.J., Röller, L.H. (2005). Consumer surplus vs. welfare standard in a political economy model of merger control. ''International Journal of Industrial Organization'', 23(9-10), pp. 829-848.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electoral concerns and lobbying significantly affected the allocation of investments into transportation infrastructure across [[France|French]] regions in 1985-92, whereas concerns for maximizing the economic returns to infrastructure spending doesn't seem to have played a major role (with Olivier Cadot and Andreas Stephan).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272705001258 Cadot, O., Röller, L.H., Stephan, A. (2006). Contribution to productivity or pork barrel? The two faces of infrastructure investment. ''Journal of Public Economics'', 90(6-7), pp. 1133-1153.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eliminating the gap in technical efficiency between American and European air carriers in 1986 was expected to create annual savings of $4.5 billion (1993 U.S. dollars) and displace about 42,000 across the European air carrier industry (with [[David H. Good]], M. Ishaq Nadiri and Robin Sickles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037722179400134X Good, D.H., Röller, L.H., Sickles, R.C. (1995).

Efficiency and productivity growth comparisons of European and U.S. air carriers: a first look at the data. ''Journal of Productivity Analysis'', 4(1-2), pp. 115-125.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The decisions of the [[European Commission]] on merger control are not only determined by concerns over consumer protection, though they don't seem sensitive to firms' interests; instead, other institutional and political factors, e.g. the definition of a market's scope, procedural aspects, and country and industry specificities, appear to be significant (with Neven and Tomaso Duso).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/519812 Duso, T., Neven, D.J., Röller, L.H. (2007). The political economy of European merger control: evidence using stock market data. ''Journal of Law and Economics'', 50(3), pp. 455-489.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Based on quadratic cost functions, the [[Bell System]] appears to have held a [[natural monopoly]] over the U.S. telecommunications industry prior to its break-up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2109709 Röller, L.H. (1990). Proper quadratic cost functions with an application to the Bell system. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 72(2), pp. 202-210.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Limitation Act 1963'''  (1963 c.47) was an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that amended the [[statute of limitations]] to allow actions in some cases where the injured party had not discovered the injury until after the standard date of expiration. The Act was based on the report of the [[Edmund Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies|Davies]] Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury, created after the Court of Appeal decision in the case of ''Cartledge v Jopling'', and the Committee notably produced their final report before ''Cartledge'' had been heard in the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]. The draft bill was presented to Parliament on 6 May 1963; it was given the Royal Assent on 31 July and came into force on the same day.

The act allowed an injured party to bring a claim outside the normal [[statute of limitations]] period if he could show that he was not aware of the injuries himself until after the limitation period had expired and if he gained the permission of the court. After a series of problems emerged, including vagueness on a point even the House of Lords was unable to clarify and poor draftsmanship, the Act was repealed bit by bit during the 1970s, with the [[Limitation Act 1980]] scrapping the last remaining sections.

==Background==
Before the passing of the 1963 Act, the only exceptions to the normal [[statute of limitations]] (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the [[Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954]]) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin (1964) p.47&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Cartledge v E. Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;[1963] 1 All E.R. 341&lt;/ref&gt; the claimant sued Jopling after he developed [[pneumoconiosis]] from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills.&lt;ref&gt;Patten (2006) p.351&lt;/ref&gt; The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;Jolowicz (1964) p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

Cartledge pursued the claim anyway in an attempt to have the law changed, and decisions were made against him in both the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under [[Edmund Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies|Mr Justice Davies]], which produced its report before the ''Cartledge'' case had even got to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=d1&gt;Dworkin (1964) p.48&lt;/ref&gt; The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the [[House of Lords]], Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the [[Limitation Act 1939]], but this was never acted on.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt; The act received the [[Royal Assent]] on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt;

==Act==
The Act created exceptions to the normal [[statute of limitations]] in addition to the previous ones of fraud and mistake. It introduced an exception if 1) the permission of the court had been gained to bring a case and 2) the "material facts" of the case included "facts of a decisive character" which the claimant was not aware of until after the expiry of the statute of limitations.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt; Where these two requirements were fulfilled, a case could be brought as long as it was within twelve months of the claimant finding out the "facts of a decisive character".&lt;ref name=d1/&gt; The same principles applied if the injured party were dead and the claim was being brought on behalf of his estate or dependants.&lt;ref name=j2&gt;Jolowicz (1964) p.200&lt;/ref&gt; If leave was refused to open a case, the decision could be appealed up to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], but no further.&lt;ref name=j3/&gt;

These provisions covered both ''Cartledge''-like situations and cases where the injured party, while aware of his injuries, does not connect them to the true cause until more than three years after the injuries were sustained.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt; The act had a limited retrospective effect - it covered injuries that had happened before the Act came into force if an action had not been brought.&lt;ref name=j3&gt;Jolowicz (1964) p.201&lt;/ref&gt; If a judgment had already been made in a case, the Act could not apply to it, meaning the Act actually had no effect on the ''Cartledge'' case itself.&lt;ref name=j3/&gt;

==Problem and repeal==
The main problem with the Act was whether or not the claimant had to know he had a method of action or not for the standard limitation period to apply.&lt;ref name=j3/&gt; The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] had an opportunity to resolve this in ''[[Central Asbestos Co Ltd v Dodd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1972] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 413  &lt;/ref&gt; but "failed spectacularly", making a decision so confused that the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] in ''Harper and others v National Coal Board''&lt;ref&gt;[1974] 2 All E.R. 441&lt;/ref&gt; said they could not actually find a ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' anywhere in the House of Lords' opinion. The Act also suffered from drafting problems - in ''Central Asbestos'' [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] described it as having "a strong claim to the distinction of being the worst drafted Act on the statute book".&lt;ref&gt;Patten (2006) p.366&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was repealed piecemeal by a series of Acts during the 1970s, and the [[Limitation Act 1980]] finally repealed the last remaining sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chronological table of the statutes|publisher=HMSO|location=London|year=1993|isbn=0-11-840331-1}}, pp. 1038-39&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Madrid system''' (officially the '''Madrid system for the international registration of marks''') is the primary international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Its legal basis is the multilateral [[treaty]] ''Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks'' of 1891, as well as the ''Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement'' (1989).

The Madrid system provides a centrally administered system of obtaining a bundle of trademark registrations in separate jurisdictions. Registration through the Madrid system does not create a unified registration, as in the case of the European Union trade mark&lt;ref&gt;Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark (Official Journal No. L78, 24.3.2009, p.1)&lt;/ref&gt; system; rather, it creates a bundle of national rights through an international registration able to be administered centrally.  Madrid provides a mechanism for obtaining trademark protection in many countries around the world which is more effective than seeking protection separately in each individual country or jurisdiction of interest.

The Madrid Protocol system provides for the international registration of trade marks by way of one application that can cover more than one country. The opportunity of having a single registration to cover a wide range of countries gives advantages, both in terms of portfolio management and cost savings, as opposed to a portfolio of independent national registrations.

Madrid now permits the filing, registration and maintenance of trade mark rights in more than one jurisdiction, provided that the target jurisdiction is a party to the system. The Madrid system is administered by the International Bureau of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. There are 90 countries part of the Madrid System.

== History and development ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
The Madrid system comprises two treaties; the ''Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks'',&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;The full name of the Madrid Agreement is the "Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks of April 14, 1891 (as revised at [[Brussels]] on December 14, 1900, at [[Washington, DC|Washington]] on June 2, 1911, at [[The Hague]] on November 6, 1925, at [[London]] on June 2, 1934, at [[Nice]] on June 15, 1957, and at [[Stockholm]] on July 14, 1967, and as amended on September 28, 1979)".&lt;/ref&gt; which was concluded in 1891, and entered into force in 1892, and the ''Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement'', which came into operation on 1 April 1996. The Madrid Agreement and Madrid Protocol were adopted at diplomatic conferences held in [[Madrid, Spain]].

The Madrid Agreement was originally intended to provide for an international registration system, but did not achieve this for two significant reasons:

* The lack of international acceptance. Many non-member countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Central America]]n, [[South America]]n and [[Asia]]n countries, such as [[Japan]], were not adherents, which undermined recognition of the system as a truly "international" regime. Significantly, many of these countries represent the largest numbers of trademark filings and registrations in the world; and
* The mere forwarding by the International Bureau of a uniform application to member countries, rather than the registration of the applicable trademark in the national trademark registers, precludes an actual "registration" system.

Some of the large trading nations like the United States, Japan, and [[Canada]], which have a large number of filings at the national level, did not join the Madrid Agreement due to another perceived flaw in the system:  if the home registration upon which an international registration was based came under 'central attack', the international registration would be cancelled or limited to the same extent that the home registration was cancelled or limited.

During 1966 and 1967, attempts were made to address this issue by establishing a new treaty that would reflect the need of the times rather than the world of the 1890s when the agreement was adopted. This led to the drafting of the Trademark Registration Treaty (TRT) which was adopted in [[Vienna]] in 1973, and entered into effect in 1980, with five contracting states, namely, [[Burkina Faso]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Gabon]], [[Soviet Union]] and [[Togo]]. In the absence of more accessions to the TRT and the low number of registrations since its inception, it was clear that the TRT was unlikely to supplant the Madrid Agreement.

As the realization of the introduction of a multi-jurisdictional (or at least pan-European) European [[Community Trade Mark]] (CTM) approached, the relevancy of the Madrid system came under scrutiny. Pressure increased on [[WIPO]] to maintain its relevance and strengthen the agreement by increasing membership, possibly through amendments. This culminated in the introduction of the Madrid Protocol, pursuant to which a CTM registration could be a 'foundation' or 'home' registration upon which an international registration could then be established. This mechanism is referred to as a "linking provision." The Protocol, after considerable lobbying efforts by WIPO, was signed by many countries, including most of the present members of the Madrid Agreement, and some countries that are members of the European Union, but were not members of the Madrid Agreement.  The Protocol entered into force on December 1, 1995 and became operative on April 1, 1996.

Many countries have needed to modify or consider modifying their trademark laws in order to adhere to the Protocol, in addition to the modifications required by [[GATT]]-[[TRIPS]]/[[World Trade Organization|WTO]].

In Europe, resistance to the Protocol was brought by trademark attorneys who were afraid of losing business because a [[Community Trade Mark]] application could be filed directly through the Madrid Protocol process.&lt;ref name="inta042003"&gt;[http://www.inta.org/Advocacy/Documents/INTAMadridProtocolUSImpact.pdf Report by the International Trademark Association, April 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the proposal bogged down due to a trademark dispute between two businesses who were heavy campaign contributors to certain Congressmen, followed by a repeated reshuffling of the Senate due to elections and a subsequent defection of a Republican senator.&lt;ref name="inta042003"/&gt; The treaty was eventually ratified during the Presidency of [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;WIPO web site, [http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf List of Members of the Madrid System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan revised its trademark law with the official acceptance of the [[International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services|Nice Classification]] (an international trademark classification system for products and services), as well as applications covering service using [[service marks]]. The members of the [[European Community]] have amended their laws to conform to the [[European Community Harmonization Directive]]. In recent years trademark laws in several other countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]] have also been amended to accommodate the changes. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Members ==
[[File:Madrid Protocol 2018.svg|thumb|right|400px|Madrid Union members]]

{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
Adherence to the convention or the protocol includes membership of the "Madrid Union." As of April 2016 there are 97 members. The original treaty has 55 members, all of which are also party to the protocol (when Algeria joined the Madrid Protocol on October 31, 2015, all of the members of the Madrid Agreement were also members of the Madrid Protocol and many of the aspects of the Madrid Agreement ceased to have practical effect).  The term 'Madrid Union' can be used to describe those jurisdictions party to either the Agreement or the Protocol (or both).&lt;ref name="wipo"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf WIPO.int]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary reason the protocol—which has been in operation since 1996 and has 100 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/members/]&lt;/ref&gt; — is more popular than the agreement — which has been in operation for more than 110 years and has 55 members&lt;ref name="wipo" /&gt;—is that the protocol introduced a number of changes to the Madrid system which significantly enhanced its usefulness to trademark owners.

For example, under the protocol it is possible to obtain an international registration based on a pending trade mark application, so that a trade mark owner can effectively apply for international registration concurrently, or immediately after, filing an application in a member jurisdiction. By comparison, the agreement requires that the trade mark owner already holds an existing registration in a member jurisdiction, which may often take many months and sometimes years to obtain in the first place. In addition, the agreement does not provide the option to 'convert' international registrations which have been 'centrally attacked.'

== Advantages ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
The Madrid system provides a mechanism whereby a trademark owner who has an existing trademark application or registration (known as the 'basic application' or 'basic registration') in a member jurisdiction may obtain an 'international registration' for their trademark from the WIPO.  The trademark owner may then extend the protection afforded to the international registration to one or more member jurisdictions, a process known as 'designation'. A useful feature of the Madrid system is that this protection may generally be extended to additional jurisdictions at any time, such that international trade mark protection can be extended to new jurisdictions which subsequently join Madrid, or to such other jurisdictions as the trade mark owner may choose.

In basic terms, the primary advantage of the Madrid system is that it allows a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in any or all member states by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees, and make any changes (e.g. changes of name or address) and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process.

== Disadvantages ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
One disadvantage of the Madrid system is that any refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the basic application or basic registration within five years of the registration date of the international registration will lead to the refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the international registration to the same extent. For example, if a basic application covers 'clothing, headgear and footwear,' and 'headgear' is then deleted from the basic application (for whatever reason), 'headgear' will also be deleted from the international application. Therefore, the protection afforded by the international registration in each designated member jurisdiction will extend only to 'clothing and footwear.' If the basic application is rejected as a whole, the international registration would also be totally refused.

The process of attacking the basic application or basic registration for this purpose is generally known as 'central attack.' Under the Madrid Protocol, the effects of a successful central attack can be mitigated by transforming the international registration into a series of applications in each jurisdiction designated by the international registration, a process known as 'transformation.' Although transformation is an expensive option of last resort, the resulting applications will receive the registration date of the international registration as their filing date.

In 1997, less than half of a percent of international registrations were canceled as a result of central attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en World Intellectual Property Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost savings which usually result from using the Madrid system may be negated by the requirement to use local agents in the applicable jurisdiction if any problems arise.

== Developments since 2000 ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
Two significant recent developments in international trademark law were the accession of the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] to the Madrid Protocol on November 2, 2003, and October 1, 2004, respectively. With the addition of these jurisdictions to the protocol, most major trading jurisdictions have joined the Madrid system.

On 31 July 2015, [[Algeria]] deposited its instrument of accession and will accede to the Madrid Protocol on 31 October 2015. As Algeria was the last member of the Madrid system to adhere to the protocol, the protocol is now effective across the entire Madrid system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/news/2015/news_0016.html Algeria Joins the Madrid Protocol], ''WIPO'', 7 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahan Coal Limited''' is a disputed coal mine project in [[Singrauli district]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India.   The project has been opposed by environmentalists since it seeks to pull down 1200 acres of old sal forests&lt;ref name=fp/&gt; for a coal mine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/mahan-at-all-costs-34230&lt;/ref&gt;  At least 500,000 prime [[sal tree]]s would be chopped, and 54 villages&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/fAB8jZp3H6OUkFxdAUVbXK/A-war-to-save-our-forests.html&lt;/ref&gt; with a considerable tribal population would be displaced.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32443739 | title=How tribal Indians beat big coal firms | date=11 May 2015 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=8 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a group of villagers have also been supporting the mine since it would boost the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/madhya-pradesh-battle-for-coal-divides-mahan-villages/story-yyKkfeKOULc869B9wUVe3I.html | title=Madhya Pradesh: Battle for coal divides Mahan villages  | date=4 February 2015 | newspaper=Hindustan Times | first=Neeraj | last=Santoshi | accessdate=8 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Mahan Coal Ltd is a Rs 5,000-crore joint venture between [[Essar Energy]] and the [[Aditya Birla Group]] (Hindalco).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/essar-hindalcos-mahan-coal-block-lobbying-for-3-yrs-greenpeace-claims-clearance-given-under-pressure/29279/&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the controversy is based on claims by [[Greenpeace India]] that the sanction for the coal mine was given based on a Gram Sabha (village board) resolution that had been forged.&lt;ref&gt;

}}Quote: Greenpeace alleged
that signatures of most of the villagers had been forged and that the
resolution also included signatures of at least six villagers who were not

&lt;/ref&gt;  The land was allocated to the company based on this document.  However, in 2014, the coal block land was deallocated by the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-supreme-court-cancels-214-of-218-coal-block-allocations-gives-operational-mines-6-months-to-wrap-up-2021185&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in sharp drops in the company's stocks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/jspl-hindalco-drop-on-concerns-over-de-allocation-of-coal-mines-114090400273_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Its original allocation in 2006 is part of the [[Indian coal allocation scam]]. During investigations, the Ministry of Power stated that it had opposed a role for Hindalco in the mine,&lt;ref name=fp&gt;

allocation of 
Mahan coal block to Hindalco. Instead, it claimed to have asked the Ministry
of Coal to allocate Mahan to Essar Power.
&lt;/ref&gt; but the coal ministry under [[Manmohan Singh]] allocated the mine to the joint company.

===Opposition by Greenpeace India===
Since the BJP government came to power, the project has seen considerable support, and has been linked in the media for the Government actions against Greenpeace India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/nda-govt-s-grouse-with-greenpeace-mahan-coal-block-protests-115022000023_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This incident was seen

In March 2015, the Ministry of Environment did not give a clearance for the project,&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mahan-coal-block-mp-greenpeace-union-government/1/429588.html&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently Ministry of Coal announced that the Mahan coal block would not be auctioned for mining, which was viewed as a victory by the tribespeople living in the villages.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Motion ''in limine''}}
In [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]], a '''motion ''in limine''''' ({{IPA-la|ɪn ˈliːmɪˌne|lang}}; "at the start", literally, "on the threshold") is a [[motion (legal)|motion]], discussed outside the presence of the [[jury]], to request that certain testimony be excluded.  The motion is decided by a judge in both [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[Criminal law|criminal]] proceedings. It is frequently used at pre-trial hearings or during [[trial]], and it can be used at both the [[State court (United States)|state]] and [[Federal court (United States)|federal]] levels. 

The reasons for the motions are wide and varied, but probably the most frequent use of the motion ''in limine'' in a criminal trial is to shield the jury from information concerning the defendant that could possibly be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant if heard at trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rules.htm#Rule403|title=Federal Rules of Evidence|first=LII|last=Staff|date=30 November 2011|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons arise under the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] for failure to comply with [[discovery (law)|discovery]].&lt;ref name="federalevidence.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://federalevidence.com/rules-of-evidence|title=Federal Rules Of Evidence (2015) - Federal Evidence Review|website=federalevidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|first=LII|last=Staff|date=30 November 2011|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Motion+in+limine|title=motion in limine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (8th ed. 2004) defines "motion ''in limine''" as "a pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or offered at trial."  A motion ''in limine'' can be used to get a ruling to allow for the inclusion of evidence, not only to get a ruling as to whether or not evidence will be precluded from trial.  They are made "preliminary", and it is presented for consideration of the judge, [[arbitration in the United States|arbitrator]] or hearing officer, to be decided without the merits being reached first.&lt;ref name=garner&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Garner|editor-first=Brian A.|chapter=in limine |title=Black's Law Dictionary|edition=7th |year=1999|publisher=[[West Group]]|place=[[St. Paul, Minnesota]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|791}}

== Example ==
Examples of motions ''in limine'' would be that the attorney for the [[defendant]] may ask the judge to refuse to admit into evidence any personal information, or medical, criminal or financial records, using the legal grounds that these records are irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or unduly prejudicial, and/or that their probative value is outweighed by the prejudicial result to the defendant, or that the admittance of such information or evidence would otherwise violate one of the court's rules of evidence.  A party proffering certain evidence can also ask for the admission of certain information or evidence via a motion ''in limine''.  

If the motion ''in limine'' to exclude evidence is granted, then the excluded records are prohibited from being presented without specific approval from the judge at the time the party wants to offer the evidence.  A reference to such "highly prejudicial" evidence contrary to the tribunal's order is a ground for a [[mistrial]].&lt;ref name=garner/&gt;{{rp|1033}}

== Governing laws ==
Most motions ''in limine'' in federal courts are governed by the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]]. Some others arise under the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] for failure to comply with [[discovery (law)|discovery]].&lt;ref name="federalevidence.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"/&gt;

[[File:Breaker-morant-grave.jpg|thumb|Major Thomas, standing behind the grave of Breaker Morant (1902)]]

'''Pardon for Morant, Handcock and Witton''' refers to various attempts to secure a [[pardon]] for three Australian &lt;ref&gt;Note: Morant and the other accused were actually [[British subject|British citizens]] at the time, and were serving in the British Army.&lt;/ref&gt; soldiers convicted of [[war crime]]s - the murder of several Boer prisoners-of-war &lt;ref&gt;Note; technically no such legal status existed at the time relevant as there had been no [[declaration of war]], nor were the Boers recognised as representing any formal government. Legally the deceased were civilians.&lt;/ref&gt; - during the [[Second Boer War]].

Following four [[Court-martial|courts martial]] in early 1902, Lieutenants [[Peter Handcock|Peter Joseph Handcock]] and [[Breaker Morant|Harry "Breaker" Morant]], of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] (BVC) of the [[British Army]], were executed by a firing squad of [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|Cameron Highlanders]], in [[Pretoria|Pretoria, South Africa]], on 27 February 1902, 18 hours after they had been sentenced. Despite the court recommending mercy in both cases, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] confirmed their death sentences. Kitchener personally signed their death warrants.

Following the court also recommending mercy in his case, the sentence of a third brother officer, Lieutenant [[George Witton|George Ramsdale Witton]], was commuted to life imprisonment by Lord Kitchener. Following public pressure, Witton was released on 11 August 1904, but never pardoned.

As part of an extended historical process (dating from the time of the original courts martial in 1902), and seeking to redress alleged injustices towards all three men, and to gain formal recognition that the verdicts convicting the three for murder, were, in each case, "[[Miscarriage of justice|unsafe verdicts]]", an Australian military lawyer, [[Commander#Royal Australian Navy|Commander]] [[James William Unkles]], of the [[Royal Australian Naval Reserve]] sent petitions for pardons for Morant, Handcock, and Witton to both [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and to the Petitions Committee of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in October 2009. The British Government chose to not issue a pardon in November 2010 as there was no historical evidence to justify overturning the court martial decision. The Australian Government announced in May 2012 that it would not seek a pardon for Morant from the British Government as he and the other two men were guilty of killing the prisoners.

== Major James Francis Thomas ==
[[File:2nd Lieutenant James Francis Thomas(1899).jpeg|thumb|upright|right|James Francis Thomas (1899)]]
In their courts-martial, the accused Morant, Handcock, and Witton were all defended by James Francis Thomas (1861–1942),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tenterfield.nsw.gov.au/community/cemeteries|title=Cemeteries|last=Anonymous|date=2015-06-23|website=www.tenterfield.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[solicitor]] from [[Tenterfield, New South Wales]].

He had studied law at [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]], served as an [[articled clerk]] in a reputable Sydney law practice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13657347 Public Notices: James Francis Thomas, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', (Thursday, 26 May 1887), p.2;] [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13653272 Public Notices: James Francis Thomas, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', (Friday, 27 May 1887), p.2;]&lt;/ref&gt; and had been admitted (unconditionally) to practise as a solicitor on 28 May 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71680504 Supreme Court Proceedings: Admission of Attorneys, ''Australian Town and Country Journal'', (Saturday, 4 June 1887), p.14;] [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13649583 Law Report: Supreme Court: Saturday, 28 May: Admission of Attorneys, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', (Monday, 30 May 1887), p.4.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had never been admitted to practise as a [[Barrister#Differences between barristers and solicitors|barrister]], and had no substantial court room experience of any kind.

Thomas had previously served with distinction, with the rank of Captain in the [[Military history of Australia during the Second Boer War#New South Wales|New South Wales Citizens' Bushmen Contingent]]. In 1902, he was unattached, and in South Africa, and solely due to his experience as a solicitor, was suddenly promoted to Major and coerced{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} into representing the three accused; despite having no experience of any sort of the theory or practice of military law, or of the role of a barrister.&lt;ref&gt;Note: it was not usual for a defendant to have any legally-qualified person representing him in his defence during a court martial in-the-field. Normally such qualified persons were simply not available.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle of condonation in British military law ==
The principle of [[condonation]] in British military law is traced back to the "Memorandum on Corporal Punishment" issued by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] on 4 March 1832:
::"The performance of a duty of honour or of trust, after the knowledge of an offence committed by a soldier, ought to convey a pardon for the offence."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/despatchescorre00wellgoog#page/n271/mode/1up Memorandum on Corporal Punishment (4 March 1832), pp.233–239, passage cited is at p.237.]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Clode's ''Military Forces of the Crown (1869):
::"The principle of condonation for criminal offences is peculiar to the Military Code, and is of comparatively modern origin [viz., The Duke of Wellington's Memorandum]. [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] served [[the Crown]] under a special Commission, giving him Supreme Command, with the power of life and death over others, but he was afterwards executed upon his former conviction — the doctrine then laid down being "that the King might use the service of any of his subjects in what employment he pleased, and it should not be any dispensation for former offences". The rule is not so now, as applied to Military offences. "The performance of a duty of honour or of trust, after the knowledge of an offence committed, ought," said the late Duke of Wellington, "to convey a pardon for the offence"…&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LwMLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Clode, C.M., The Military Forces of the Crown: Their Administration and Government, in Two Volumes: Volume I, John Murray, (London), 1869, p.173 (84. Condonation of Military Offences)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal opinion (Isaac Isaacs, 1902) ==
[[File:George Ramsdale Witton-(1901).jpeg|thumb|right|Lieutenant G.R. Witton, Bushveldt Carbineers (1901).]]
On 28 August 1902, the [[Division of Indi|Member for Indi in the Federal Parliament]], the eminent jurist [[Isaac Isaacs]] (also [[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] 1930-31, and [[Governor-General of Australia| Governor-General]] 1931-36) published a [[legal opinion]] which recommended that George Witton petition the British monarch, [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], for a pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, (1902).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Witton petition (1904) ==
In 1904 a printed petition to [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] was circulated in Australia, for signature by interested parties, requesting clemency in the form of (a) a pardon for George Witton, and (b) the immediate release of Witton from his incarceration. At least one copy of the petition, signed by thirty-seven individuals from the town of Colebrook, Tasmania, is extant. The petition, it seems, was never sent on to its final destination, and this was, most likely, because Witton had been released from custody (on 11 August 1904) before it could be sent.&lt;ref&gt;1904 Witton Petition.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907 the publication in Australia of Witton's book ''Scapegoats of the Empire'' revived debate about the convictions. 
[[File:Peter Joseph Handcock (Studio photograph, c.1900).jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Peter Joseph Handcock (1900).]]

== Unkles' petitions (October 2009) ==
[[File:Breaker Morant.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Harry Harbord "Breaker' Morant" (1900).]]
In October 2009, the Australian military lawyer, [[Commander#Royal Australian Navy|Commander]] James William Unkles, of the [[Royal Australian Naval Reserve]] sent petitions for pardons for Morant, Handcock, and Witton to both [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and to the Petitions Committee of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in October 2009.

The first petition was considered by the British Government, on behalf of the Queen—"The petition argued that the convictions were unsafe and that their trial was unfair because the men were denied the right to communicate with the Australian government, refused an opportunity to prepare their cases and blocked from lodging an appeal."&lt;ref name="Malkin 2010"&gt;Malkin 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;—and, in November 2010, the UK Ministry of Defence issued a statement that the appeal had been rejected:
{{quotation|"After detailed historical and legal consideration, the Secretary of State has concluded that no new primary evidence has come to light which supports the petition to overturn the original courts-martial verdicts and sentences". (UK Ministry of Defence).&lt;ref name="Malkin 2010"/&gt;}}

The second petition was considered by the House of Representatives' Petitions Committee at a public hearing on Monday, 15 March 2010. Unkles appeared before the committee, along with others, including the historian Craig Wilcox. On Monday, 27 February 2012, in a speech delivered to the House of Representatives on the 110-year anniversary of the sentencing of the three men, Alex Hawke, M.P. described the case for the pardons as "strong and compelling".&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/genpdf/chamber/hansardr/dfa1725a-aa28-48db-ba56-7995bad31f8c/0195/hansard_frag.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf House of Representatives: Constituency Statement: Alex Hawke: Speech: Lieutenants Morant, Handcock and Witton (Monday, 27 February 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roxon's rejection (May 2012)==
In May 2012, Attorney General [[Nicola Roxon]] informed Unkles that the Australian Government would not seek a pardon for Morant from the British Government, on the grounds that Morant, Handcock and Witton did, in fact, kill unarmed Boer prisoners and others.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Roxon's letter to Unkles stated that in Australia "a pardon for a Commonwealth offence would generally only be granted where the offender is both morally and technically innocent of the offence".&lt;ref name="Roxon rejects Morant pardon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffiths|first=Meredith|title=Roxon rejects Morant pardon plea|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-10/pardon-call-for-morant-rejected/4002716|accessdate=12 May 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, her letter stated that "Despite the time that has passed ... I consider seeking a pardon ... could be rightly perceived as glossing over very grave criminal acts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Brendan|title=Pardon ruled out for Harry 'Breaker' Morant|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/pardon-ruled-out-for-harry-breaker-morant/story-e6frg6nf-1226351421825|accessdate=12 May 2012|newspaper=The Australian|date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Roxon's decision, [[Robert McClelland (Australian politician)|Robert McClelland]], who served as Australia's [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], from 3 December 2007 to 14 December 2011 (immediately preceding Roxon), said that he had "concerns over a failure of procedural fairness for Morant and his two co-accused", and announced that "he had decided on principle to write to the British government in his capacity as a private citizen who was a member of parliament".&lt;ref&gt;Berkovic, 2012, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Court application (2013)==
In July 2013, Unkles said he was planning to file documentation to the High Court in August seeking "a review of the British government decision not to help an independent inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Copping|first=Jasper|title=High Court 'pardon' bid for Boer war soldier 'Breaker' Morant|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/10202624/High-Court-pardon-bid-for-Boer-war-soldier-Breaker-Morant.html|accessdate=2 September 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communication}}
{{Performing arts}}
'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a good [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public speaking can be governed by different rules and structures. For example, speeches about concepts do not necessarily have to be structured in any special way. However, there is a method behind giving it effectively. For this type of speech it would be good to describe that concept with examples that can relate to the audiences life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaker The Tradition and practice of public speaking|last=Valenzano III|first=Joseph M.|last2=Braden|first2=Stephen W.|publisher=Fountainhead press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59871-522-4|location=United States of America|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in [[Lasswell's model of communication]]: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"

Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a [[discourse community]], in which the audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world; in fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Lisa. ''Introduction to Public Speaking.''{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known piece&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from ancient Greece. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one of the first recorded teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who are notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking became seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied ''years'' after their delivery. Among these examples are [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BCE addressing those that died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]; Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863; Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]”; and Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
In addition to simple oratory skills, tools and technologies have been created which allow for more methods of communication for speakers and public orators. [[Lectern]]s hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a [[public address system]] or a [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]] when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use [[audience response systems]], allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.

Telecommunication and [[videoconferencing]] are also a form of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

A '''quasi-foreign corporation''' (also known as a '''pseudo-foreign corporation''') is a [[corporation]] incorporated in a [[jurisdiction]] with which it has minimal business contacts. Corporations may incorporate in foreign jurisdictions in order to minimize liability, taxes, or regulatory interference.

[[Offshore corporation]]s are a common example, as are [[Delaware corporation]]s and [[Nevada corporation]]s in the [[United States]].

==Legal regimes==
Generally, the [[internal affairs doctrine]] provides that a corporation's internal affairs are governed by the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated. However, many jurisdictions apply local law to foreign corporations in certain determinations such as [[piercing the corporate veil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvinc.com/ApplicationOfForumLaw.htm The Application of Forum Law to "Pseudo-Foreign" Corporations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028025437/http://www.nvinc.com/ApplicationOfForumLaw.htm |date=October 28, 2006 }}, Nevada Corporate Planners.&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions have gone further in attempting to control the activities of quasi-foreign corporations.

===California===
[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2100-2117.1 Section 2115] of the [[California]] Corporations Code applies many aspects of California corporate law to foreign corporations operating in California under Californian ownership, including many provisions dealing with director liability and shareholder authority. While these rules may apply in suits brought against foreign corporations in California courts, Delaware courts refuse to apply Section 2115 in suits against Delaware corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Ribstein, [http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2005/05/big_surprise_de.html Big surprise: Delaware applies the internal affairs rule] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326203321/http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2005/05/big_surprise_de.html |date=March 26, 2006 }}, Ideoblog, May 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The [[Japan]]ese corporate statute of 2006 provides that "no foreign company having its main office in Japan or the primary purpose of which is to carry on business in Japan may engage in transactions on a continuous basis in Japan" and that "any person who has engaged in transactions in violation of the provision of the preceding paragraph shall be [[joint and several liability|jointly and severally liable]] with the foreign company to any counterparty for such transactions."&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;Robert Alan Feldman, [http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/20050630-thu.html Japan: Article 821: Finest Hour of Cooperation], Morgan Stanley Global Economic Forum, June 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the statute was passed, many [[bank]]s and other multinational corporations operated in Japan as foreign entities in order to avoid Japanese regulations requiring banking and securities businesses to be separated by [[Chinese wall]]s. These companies, along with international chambers of commerce and other organizations, extensively lobbied the Japanese government to change the language of the draft bill.&lt;ref&gt;David Ibison, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e6e8139c-e128-11d9-a3fb-00000e2511c8.html Businesses wake too late to Japan law's implications], ''Financial Times'', June 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution was for the House of Councillors, the upper house of the [[Diet of Japan]], to add a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] to the bill calling for "all efforts... to ensure that existing foreign companies in Japan and future investments that may be made by foreign companies into Japan will not be adversely impacted."&lt;ref name=morgan /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11982">'''Regulatory science''' is the scientific and technical foundations upon which regulations are based in various industries – particularly those involving health or safety.  Regulatory bodies employing such principles in the US include for example the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for food and medical products, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] for the environment, and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] for work safety.

"Regulatory science" is contrasted with [[regulatory affairs]] and [[regulatory law]], which refer to the administrative or legal aspects of regulation, in that the former is focused on the regulations' ''scientific'' underpinnings and concerns – rather than the regulations' promulgation, implementation, compliance, or enforcement.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==History==
Probably the first investigator who recognized the nature of regulatory science was Alvin Weinberg &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=AM|title=Science and trans science|journal=Minerva|date=1970|volume=10|pages=209–222|doi=10.1007/BF01682418}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described the scientific process used to evaluate effects of ionizing radiation as trans science.  The origin of the term '''regulatory science''' is unknown. It was probably coined sometimes in the late 1970s in an undated memorandum prepared by [[A. Alan Moghissi]] who was describing scientific issues that the newly formed US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was facing. During that period the EPA was forced to meet legally mandated deadlines to make decisions that would require reliance upon science that was not meeting conventional scientific requirements. At that time the prevailing view was that there was no need to establish a new [[scientific discipline]] because “science is science” regardless of how its application. In the spring of 1985 Moghissi established the Institute for Regulatory Science in the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] as a non-profit organization with the objective to perform scientific studies “at the interface between science and the regulatory system”  Moghissi et al.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have provided an extensive description of history of regulatory science including various perception of regulatory science leading to the acceptance of regulatory science by the FDA

==Definition==
Moghissi ''et al''.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have described the history of regulatory science and provide two definitions. The first definition is the generalized definition provided by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) “Regulatory science is a scientific discipline consisting of the development and application of scientific methods, tools, approaches, and other relevant processes derived from various scientific disciplines used to support regulatory and other policy objectives”. An abbreviated definition consists of “regulatory science consists of the application of science to support policy notably regulatory objectives”

The objectives, stated by the FDA in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/scienceresearch/specialtopics/regulatoryscience/ucm228444.pdf|title=Advancing Regulatory Science for Public Health|last=|first=FDA|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will provide a basis to: 

* Improve capacity for safety and efficacy evaluations and monitoring of candidate and licensed products,
* Modernize current regulatory pathways,
* Develop new regulatory pathways where there are currently none.

There have been several attempts to define regulatory science. In many cases there are claims that there is a difference between regulatory science and “normal science”, “academic science”, “research science”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jasanoff|first1=S|title=The fifth branch: science advisors as policy makers|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; or compliance with regulations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gad|first1=SC|title=Regulatory Toxicology|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Philadelphia, PA|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary problem is the lack of appreciation that many branches of science are evolving and much of the evolving science includes inherent uncertainties.

==Application of regulatory science==
Regulatory science is included in every regulation that includes science. The regulatory science community&lt;ref name="j1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Straja|first2=Sorin R.|last3=Love|first3=Betty R.|last4=McBride|first4=Dennis K.|last5=Stough|first5=Roger R.|date=2014|title=Innovation in Regulatory Science: Evolution of a new scientific discipline|journal=Technology and Innovation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=155–165|doi=10.3727/194982414X14096821477027|last1=Moghissi|first1=AA}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of three groups of regulatory scientists: 
*Those who are involved in development of regulations. Typically this group is employed by regulatory agencies 
*Those who must comply with regulations. Typically this group consists of employees or contractors of regulated community.
*Those segments of the scientific community who perform research and development in areas relevant to the relevant regulated community.

The third group is of particular significance as they consist of organizations and individuals who support the first two groups. Included in this group are members of numerous advisory panels, organizations that provide peer reviews, and members of peer review panels. An example of this group is the National Academies consisting of the National Academy of Science, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council.   
The application of regulatory science occurs in three phases. During the first phase the regulators must meet a legislative or court- mandated deadline and promulgate regulations using their best judgment. The second phase provides opportunity to develop regulatory science tools. These include human health and ecological risk assessment procedures and post marketing evaluation method d processes for drugs ad medical devices. The third Standard Operating phase, used tools developed during the second phase to improve the initial decision. ( Moghissi et al.)

==Regulatory engineering==
[[Engineering]] is the development of new products and processes, hence regulatory engineering encompasses principally the development of products and processes to facilitate or better examine regulations or their scientific foundations.  Another related segment of regulatory science deal with the application of engineering design or analysis to operations such as the safety of nuclear and other power plants, chemical production facilities, mining operations, and air transportation.

Sometimes the term "regulatory engineer(ing)" is misused to refer to essentially administrative or regulatory roles dealing with organizing or coordinating regulatory matters for an organization; however, "engineering" refers only to functional design of products and processes, and in many jurisdictions this definition is legally enforced (see [[Regulation and licensure in engineering]]).

==Areas of focus==

===Regulatory pharmaceutical medicine===
Consistent with its mission, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that “Regulatory science is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality and performance of FDA-regulated products.”
Based on several decades of experience regulatory science is logically defined as a distinct scientific discipline constituting the scientific foundation of regulatory, legislative, and judicial decisions. Much like many scientific disciplines that have evolved within the last several decades, regulatory science is both [[interdisciplinary]] and [[multidisciplinary]] and relies upon a large number of basic and applied scientific disciplines.

Regulatory science is an emerging area of interest within pharmaceutical medicine as the shaping and implementation of legislation and guidelines. One definition of “regulatory science” is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to evaluate the efficacy, safety, quality and performance of medical products in order to assess benefit-risk and facilitate a sound and transparent regulatory decision-making. It has been recognized as having a significant impact on the industry’s ability to bring new medicines and medical devices to patients in need. Regulatory science challenges current concepts of benefit/risk assessment, submission and approval strategies, patient’s involvement and ethical aspects. It creates the platform for launching new ideas – not only by the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities, but also by, for example, academia, who wants to contribute to better use of their research activities within medical aspects. Regulatory science &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FDA (Food and Drug Administration)|title=The Promise of regulatory science|url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm228206.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the potential as an enabler for directing companies towards more efficient global development of medical products as well as more robust quality decision-making processes.

===Human health===
By far the predominant foci of Regulatory Science pertain to human health and well-being. This realm covers a broad range of scientific areas – including pollution and [[toxicology]], work safety, food, drugs, and numerous others.

===Ecology===
Regulatory [[ecology]] covers resources the [[Protected species|protection of various species]], [[Wetland conservation|protection of wetlands]], and numerous other regulated areas including [[ecotoxicology]].

For example, the US Clean Water Act is based upon an interest in protecting water quality for its own sake, in contrast with the Clean Air Act which is premised upon protecting air quality only for the sake of human health; however, these are ideological policy premises rather than scientific matters themselves.

The US Department of Agriculture regulates animal care, and the FDA regulates humaneness for animal studies.

The US Department of Interior, [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS), and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], implement the development and enforcement of policies required by the [[Endangered Species Act|Federal Endangered Species Act]] (FESA), [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]], and other biological resources laws. The FESA requires that the decisions to list a species as endangered or threatened are based on the best available scientific data. To that end, the USFWS, and other government agencies fund research to determine the conservation status of proposed species. Regulatory scientists within the Services review, evaluate, and incorporate data from these studies of proposed species in their published regulations. Survey protocols for listed species are also developed from scientific studies of their target species. The purpose of the protocols is to reliably and accurately determine the residency of the target species in a given study area.

==Regulatory economics==
There are numerous [[Regulatory economics|economic decisions]] in the regulatory process including the [[economics]] part of [[cost-benefit analysis]].

==Science in legislation and in courts==
Although often less than fully recognized the scientific foundation of [[Legislation|legislative]] decisions are included in regulatory science and should be based on reliable science. Similarly [[Court of law|courts]] have recognized the need to rely upon information that meets scientific requirements.

The '''Sindh (Repeal of the Sindh Local Government Ordinance, 2001 and Revival of the Sindh Local Government Ordinance, 1979) Act, 2011''' was an act passed by the [[Provincial Assembly of Sindh]] on July 13th, 2011 and assented to by the Acting [[Governor of Sindh]], [[Nisar Ahmed Khuhro]], on July 14th 2011. The act repealed the [[Sindh Local Government Ordinance, 2001]] and restored the [[Sindh Local Government Ordinance, 1979]].&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|title=Government repeals Sindh local government act, MQM protests|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/510520/government-repeals-sindh-local-government-act-mqm-protests/|date=2013-02-21|place=Karachi, Pakistan|access-date=2018-05-23|newspaper=[[The Express Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act restored the tiers of government outlined in the 1979 ordinance: City Government Karachi, District Government, Town/Taluka Municipal Administration, and Union Administration.&lt;ref name="aaj"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://aaj.tv/2011/08/sindh-govt-issues-notification-to-restore-local-govt-depots/|title=Sindh Govt. issues notification to restore local govt. depots|newspaper=[[Aaj News]]|place=Karachi, Pakistan|date=2011-08-09|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting Governor Khuhro stated that the Sindh Local Government Ordinance, 2001 had been introduced by former president [[Pervez Musharraf]] without the consent of the people and that no amendment could be made without Musharraf's approval.&lt;ref name="thenews"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The News International]]|publisher=[[Jang Group of Newspapers]]|place=Karachi, Pakistan|date=2011-07-10|title=Old commissioner, police system restored in Sindh Karachi city govt, its 18 towns become ‘dead’; district status of Hyderabad revived;|access-date=2018-05-23|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/615092-old-commissioner,-police-system-restored-in-sindh-karachi-city-govt,-its-18-towns-become-dead;-district-status-of-hyderabad-revived;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hoisting a slaughtered steer in Benjamin Lutz's slaughterhouse 8d23516v.jpg|thumb|Workers and cattle in a slaughterhouse in 1942.]]

A '''slaughterhouse''' or '''abattoir''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-abattoir.ogg|'|æ|b|@|t|w|ɑr}} is a facility where animals are [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered for consumption as food]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canencia|first=Oliva P|last2=Dalugdug|first2=Marlou D|last3=Emano|first3=Athena Marie|last4=Mendoza|first4=Richard|last5=Walag|first5=Angelo Mark P.|date=2016-08-31|title=Slaughter waste effluents and river catchment watershed contamination in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307931158_Slaughter_waste_effluents_and_river_catchment_watershed_contamination_in_Cagayan_de_Oro_City_Philippines|journal=ResearchGate|volume=9|issue=2|issn=2220-6663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaughterhouses supply meat which then becomes the responsibility of the  [[Meat packing industry|packaging department]].

Slaughterhouses that process meat not intended for human consumption are sometimes referred to as [[Knacker|knacker's yards]] or knackeries, used for animals that are not fit for consumption or can no longer work on a farm such as retired [[working animal|work horses]].

Slaughtering animals on a large scale poses significant logistical problems, [[animal welfare]] problems, [[public health]] requirements, and environmental problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to public aversion in many cultures, determining where to build slaughterhouses is also troubling.

Frequently, animal welfare and [[animal rights]] groups and sometimes academicians raise concerns about the methods of transport, preparation, herding, and killing within some slaughterhouses.&lt;ref&gt;
Terlouw, E., Arnould, C., Auperin, B., Berri, C., Le Bihan-Duval, E., Deiss, V., . . . Mounier, L. (2008). Pre-slaughter conditions, animal stress and welfare: Current status and possible future research. Animal, 2(10), 1501-1517. doi:10.1017/S1751731108002723
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Lovis Corinth 006.jpg|thumb|In the slaughterhouse, [[Lovis Corinth]], 1893.]]
Until modern times, the slaughter of animals generally took place in a [[wikt:haphazard|haphazard]] and unregulated manner in diverse places. Early maps of London show numerous stockyards in the periphery of the city, where slaughter occurred in the open air. A term for such open-air slaughterhouses was ''shambles'', and there are streets named "[[The Shambles]]" in some English and Irish towns (e.g., [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], [[York]], [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]]) which got their name from having been the site on which butchers killed and prepared animals for consumption. [[Fishamble Street]], Dublin was formerly a ''fish-shambles''.

===Reform movement===
The slaughterhouse emerged as a coherent institution in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="humanecologyreview"&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Human Ecology Review|url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her171/Fitzgerald.pdf|title=A Social History of the Slaughterhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of health and social concerns, exacerbated by the rapid [[urbanisation]] experienced during the [[Industrial Revolution]], led [[social reform]]ers to call for the isolation, sequester and regulation of animal slaughter. As well as the concerns raised regarding hygiene and disease, there were also criticisms of the practice on the grounds that the effect that killing had, both on the butchers and the observers, "educate[d] the men in the practice of violence and cruelty, so that they seem to have no restraint on the use of it."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} An additional motivation for eliminating private slaughter was to impose a careful system of regulation for the "morally dangerous" task of putting animals to death.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Image:Smithfield Last day of Old Smithfield ILN 1855.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]] in 1855, before it was reconstructed.]]
As a result of this tension, meat markets within the city were closed and abattoirs built outside city limits. An early framework for the establishment of public slaughterhouses was put in place in Paris in 1810, under the reign of the [[Emperor Napoleon]]. Five areas were set aside on the outskirts of the city and the feudal privileges of the [[guild]]s were curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hdZ2BXP2GEC|title=Meat, Modernity, and the Rise of the Slaughterhouse|author=Paula Young Lee|year=2008|publisher=UPNE|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the meat requirements of the growing number of residents in London steadily expanded, 
the meat markets both within the city and beyond attracted increasing levels of public disapproval. Meat had been traded at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]] as early as the 10th century. By 1726, it was regarded as "without question, the greatest in the world", by [[Daniel Defoe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Defoe|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Defoe|title=A Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain|year=1726|pages=342|isbn=0-300-04980-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 19th century, in the course of a single year 220,000 head of cattle and 1,500,000 sheep would be "violently forced into an area of five acres, in the very heart of London, through its narrowest and most crowded thoroughfares".&lt;ref name="fm" /&gt;

[[Image:Fish market smithfield.jpg|thumb|Part of the original construction of the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]] in 1868.]]
By the early 19th century, pamphlets were being circulated arguing in favour of the removal of the livestock market and its relocation outside of the city due to the extremely poor hygienic conditions&lt;ref name="dodd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodd|first=George|authorlink=George Dodd (19th century writer)|title=The Food of London: A Sketch of the Chief Varieties, Sources of Supply, Probable Quantities, Modes of Arrival, Processes of Manufacture, Suspected Adulteration, and Machinery of Distribution, of the Food for a Community of Two Millions and a Half|year=1856|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans|pages=228|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ERQHAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the brutal treatment of the cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kean|first=Hilda| authorlink = Hilda Kean |title=Animal rights: political and social change in Britain since 1800|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eP9PAAAAIAAJ|pages=59|chapter='Wild' domestic animals and the Smithfield Market|isbn=1-86189-014-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, the ''Farmer's Magazine'' published a petition signed by bankers, salesmen, aldermen, butchers and local residents against the expansion of the livestock market.&lt;ref name="fm"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Farmer's Magazine|publisher=Rogerson and Tuxford, 1849|location=London|year=1849|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eP9PAAAAIAAJ|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Act of Parliament]] was finally passed in 1852. Under its provisions, a new cattle-market was constructed in Copenhagen Fields, [[Islington]]. The new [[Metropolitan Cattle Market]] was also opened in 1855, and West Smithfield was left as waste ground for about a decade, until the construction of the new market began in the 1860s under the authority of the 1860 Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Market Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornbury | first = Walter  | authorlink = George Walter Thornbury  | chapter=The Metropolitan Meat-Market| title = Old and New London: Volume 2| pages = 491–496|year=1878|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45117|accessdate= 2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market was designed by [[architect]] Sir [[Horace Jones (architect)|Horace Jones]] and was completed in 1868.

A [[cut and cover]] railway tunnel was constructed beneath the market to create a triangular junction with the railway between [[Blackfriars railway station|Blackfriars]] and [[London King's Cross railway station|Kings Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonrailways.net/snowhill.htm ''Snowhill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605193008/http://www.londonrailways.net/snowhill.htm |date=2013-06-05 }} (London Railways) accessed 13 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed animals to be transported into the slaughterhouse by train and the subsequent transfer of animal carcasses to the Cold Store building, or direct to the meat market via lifts.

At the same time, the first large and centralized slaughterhouse in Paris was constructed in 1867 under the orders of [[Napoleon III]] at the [[Parc de la Villette]] and heavily influenced the subsequent development of the institution throughout Europe.

===Regulation and expansion===
[[File:Richardson's_abattoir.jpg|thumb|right|Blueprint for a mechanized public abattoir, designed by slaughterhouse reformer [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]].]]
These slaughterhouses were regulated by law to ensure good standards of hygiene, the prevention of the spread of disease and the minimization of needless animal cruelty. The slaughterhouse had to be equipped with a specialized water supply system to effectively clean the operating area of blood and offal. Veterinary scientists, notably [[George Fleming (veterinarian)|George Fleming]] and John Gamgee, campaigned for stringent levels of inspection to ensure that [[epizootics]] such as [[rinderpest]] (a devastating outbreak of the disease covered all of Britain in 1865) would not be able to spread. By 1874, three meat inspectors were appointed for the London area, and the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required local authorities to provide central slaughterhouses (they were only given powers to close insanitary slaughterhouses in 1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The vital city: public analysis, dairies and slaughterhouses in nineteenth-century|author=Chris Otter|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2006|url=http://www.geog.canterbury.ac.nz/powerpoints/Otter%20%282006%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the appointment of slaughterhouse inspectors and the establishment of centralised abattoirs took place much earlier in the British colonies, such as the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria. In Victoria, for example, the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/maa1850n17240.pdf ''Melbourne Abattoirs Act 1850'' (NSW)] "confined the slaughtering of animals to prescribed public abattoirs, while at the same time prohibiting the killing of sheep, lamb, pigs or goats at any other place within the city limits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trabsky|first1=Marc|title=Institutionalising the Public Abattoir in Nineteenth Century Colonial Society|journal=Australian Feminist Law Journal|year=2014|volume=40|issue=2|page=180|doi=10.1080/13200968.2014.981357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts were also made throughout the British Empire to reform the practice of slaughter itself, as the methods used came under increasing criticism for causing undue pain to the animals. The eminent physician, [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]], spent many years in developing more humane methods of slaughter. He brought into use no less than fourteen possible anesthetics for use in the slaughterhouse and even experimented with the use of electric current at the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DNBSupp|wstitle=Richardson, Benjamin Ward|first=D'Arcy|last= Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1853, he designed a lethal chamber that would gas animals to death relatively painlessly, and he founded the Model Abattoir Society in 1882 to investigate and campaign for humane methods of slaughter.

The invention of [[refrigeration]] and the expansion of transportation networks by [[steamship|sea]] and [[rail transport|rail]] allowed for the safe exportation of meat around the world.  Additionally, meat-packing millionaire [[Philip Danforth Armour]]’s invention of the 'disassembly line' greatly increased the productivity and profit margin of the [[meat packing industry]]: "according to some, animal slaughtering became the first [[mass-production]] industry in the United States."  This expansion has been accompanied by increased concern about the physical and mental conditions of the workers along with controversy over the ethical and environmental implications of slaughtering animals for meat.&lt;ref name="humanecologyreview"/&gt;

==Design==
In the latter part of the 20th century, the layout and design of most U.S. slaughterhouses was influenced by the work of [[Temple Grandin|Dr. Temple Grandin]].&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, T. "[http://www.grandin.com/humane/best.practices.handle.stun.html  Best Practices for Animal Handling and Stunning"]", ''Meat &amp; Poultry'', April 2000, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that reducing the stress of animals being led to slaughter may help slaughterhouse operators improve efficiency and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, T. and Deesing, M. "[http://www.grandin.com/inc/book.description.html Humane Livestock Handling]" 2008. Storey Publishing, North Adams, MA, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular she applied an understanding of [[animal psychology]] to design [[pen (enclosure)|pens]] and [[corral]]s which funnel a herd of animals arriving at a slaughterhouse into a single file ready for slaughter. Her corrals employ long sweeping curves&lt;ref name = "Grandin-survey"&gt;{{cite web

A curved chute works more efficiently than a straight one because it prevents cattle from seeing people and other activities at the end of the chute." "A round crowd pen will work better than a straight crowd pen because, as cattle go around a 180° turn, they think they are going back to where they came from "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Grandin-blueprint"&gt;{{cite web

As the animals go around the curve, they think they are going back to where they came from. The animals can not see people and other moving objects at the end of the chute. It takes advantage of the natural circling behaviour of cattle and sheep.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Grandin-teachingPrincip"&gt;{{cite web | last = Grandin | first = Temple | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Teaching Principles of Behavior and Equipment Design for Handling Livestock | work = J. Anim. Sci. | publisher = J. Anim. Sci. | year = 1993 | url = http://www.grandin.com/references/teach.html | doi = | accessdate = 2012-12-10}} Some of the design principles that are taught are the use of solid sides on chutes and crowd pens to prevent animals from seeing out with their wide-angle vision and layout of curved chutes and round crowd pens.  Some people believe the animals can smell or hear death, however, and these may be area that need improvement, such as the use of scent masking agents or acoustical barriers.  As well, some animals in some situations may grow to learn that after their fellows are corralled in that area, their fellows never return.  An improvement could be made by detouring off some of the animals so that they return to the pack (after the odors and sounds are masked so they will return untraumatized).    A circular crowd pen and a curved chute reduced the time spent moving cattle by up to 50% (Vowles and Hollier, 1982 [Vowles, W. J., and T. J. Hollier. 1982. The influence of yard design on the movement of animals. Proc. Aust. Soc. Anim. Prod. 14:597]).&lt;/ref&gt; so that each animal is prevented from seeing what lies ahead and just concentrates on the hind quarters of the animal in front of it. This design – along with the design elements of solid sides, solid crowd gate, and reduced noise at the end point – work together to encourage animals forward in the chute and to not reverse direction.&lt;ref name = "Grandin-be-pr-ani_mov"&gt;{{cite web | last = Grandin | first = Temple | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Improving the Movement of Cattle, Pigs, and Sheep during handling on farms, ranches, and slaughter plants | work =
 | publisher = Dr Temple Grandin | date = July 2010 | url = http://www.grandin.com/behaviour/principles/animal_movement.html | doi = | accessdate = 2012-12-10}} Cattle will move more easily through a curved race.

Solid sides which prevent the cattle from seeing people and other distractions outside the fence should be installed on the chutes (races) and the crowd pen which leads up to the single file chute. The use of solid sides is especially important in slaughter plants, truck loading ramps, and other places where there is lots of activity outside the fence. Solid sides are essential in slaughter plants to block the animal's view of people and equipment.

A curved chute (race) with solid sides at a ranch facility. It works better than a straight chute because cattle think they are going back to where they came from. The outer fence is solid to prevent the cattle from seeing distractions outside the fence... The facility must be located in a pasture that has no nearby equipment, moving vehicles or extra people, or put inside a building that has solid side walls. In many facilities, adding solid fences will improve animal movement...

Solid sides in these areas help prevent cattle from becoming agitated when they see activity outside the fence -- such as people. Cattle tend to be calmer in a chute with solid sides.

Cattle move more easily through the curved race system because they can not see people and other distractions ahead.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, Grandin claimed to have designed over 54% of the slaughterhouses in the United States as well as many others around the world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Mobile design===
Beginning in 2008 the Local Infrastructure for Local Agriculture, a non-profit committed to revitalizing opportunities for "small farmers and strengthening the connection between local supply and demand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23food-t-000.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed a mobile slaughterhouse facility in efforts for small farmers to process meat quickly and cost effectively. Named the Modular Harvest System, or M.H.S. received [[USDA]] approval in 2010. The M.H.S. consists of three separate trailers; one for slaughtering, one for consumable body parts, and one for other body parts. Preparation of individual cuts is done at a butchery or other meat preparation facility.&lt;ref name="Muhlke"&gt;{{cite news|last=Muhlke|first=Christine|title=FIELD REPORT; A Movable Beast|work=The New York Times|page=22|date=23 May 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23food-t-000.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International variations==
The standards and regulations governing slaughterhouses vary considerably around the world. In many countries the slaughter of animals is regulated by custom and tradition rather than by law. In the non-Western world, including the [[Arab world]], the [[Indian sub-continent]], etc., both forms of meat are available: one which is produced in modern [[mechanization|mechanized]] slaughterhouses, and the other from local [[butcher]] shops.

In some communities animal slaughter and permitted species may be controlled by [[religious law]]s, most notably ''[[halal]]'' for [[Muslim]]s and [[Kosher|''kashrut'']] for [[Jew]]ish communities. This can cause conflicts with national regulations when a slaughterhouse adhering to the rules of religious preparation is located in some [[Western countries]]. In Jewish law, captive bolts and other methods of pre-slaughter paralysis are generally not permissible, due to it being forbidden for an animal to be stunned prior to slaughter. Various halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed fail-safe system of head-only [[stunning]] where the shock is non-fatal, and where it is possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock. The use of [[electronarcosis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/electronarcosis |title=electronarcosis - Wiktionary |website=en.wiktionary.org |language=en |access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other methods of dulling the sensing has been approved by the Egyptian Fatwa Committee. This allows these entities to continue their religious techniques while keeping accordance to the national regulations.&lt;ref name="egyptianfatwacommittee"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Egyptian Fatwaa Committee |url=http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/fatwa-stunning.php |title=The Opinions of the Ulema on the Permissibility of Stunning Animals |date=December 18, 1978 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202233118/http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/fatwa-stunning.php |archivedate=December 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some societies, traditional cultural and religious aversion to slaughter led to prejudice against the people involved. In [[Japan]], where the ban on slaughter of livestock for food{{Specify|date=April 2010}} was lifted in the late 19th century, the newly found slaughter industry drew workers primarily from villages of ''[[burakumin]]'', who traditionally worked in occupations relating to death (such as executioners and undertakers). In some parts of [[Honshu|western Japan]], prejudice faced by current and former residents of such areas (''burakumin'' "hamlet people") is still a sensitive issue. Because of this, even the Japanese word for "slaughter" (屠殺 ''tosatsu'') is deemed [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] by some [[pressure group]]s as its inclusion of the [[kanji]] for "kill" (殺) supposedly portrays those who practice it in a negative manner.

Some countries have laws that exclude specific animal species or grades of animal from being slaughtered for human consumption, especially those that are [[Taboo food and drink|taboo food]]. The former [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] suggested in 2004 introducing legislation banning the slaughter of cows throughout [[India]], as [[Hinduism]] holds [[Cattle in religion|cows as sacred]] and considers their slaughter unthinkable and offensive. This was often opposed on grounds of religious freedom. The slaughter of cows and the importation of beef into the nation of [[Nepal]] are strictly forbidden.

Some countries practices sustainable designs that allows minimal waste produced as effluents in nearby bodies of water. In the Philippines, some slaughterhouse were poorly designed as shown by contamination and pollution of nearby rivers &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Freezing works===
Refrigeration technology allowed meat from the slaughterhouse to be preserved for longer periods. This led to the concept as the slaughterhouse as a freezing works. Prior to this, canning was an option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techhistory.co.nz/19thcentury/Meat.htm Techhistory.co.nz]&lt;/ref&gt; Freezing works are common in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. In countries where meat is exported for a substantial profit the freezing works were built near docks, or near transport infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/agricultural-processing-industries/page-7 Teara.govt.nz]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries have laws in regard to the treatment of animals in slaughterhouses. In the [[United States]], there is the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] of 1958, a law requiring that all swine, sheep, cattle, and horses be stunned unconscious with application of a stunning device by a trained person before being hoisted up on the line. There is some debate over the enforcement of this act. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as [[kashrut|kosher]] [[shechita]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-26|title=Shechita|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shechita&amp;oldid=772341805|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dhabihah|dhabiha halal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=|date=2017-03-26|year=|title=Dhabihah|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhabihah&amp;oldid=772308667|journal=Wikipedia|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most strict interpretations of kashrut require that the animal be fully sensible when its [[carotid artery]] is cut.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' detailed unsanitary conditions, fictionalized, in slaughterhouses and the meatpacking industry during the 1800s. This led directly to an investigation commissioned directly by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and to the passage of the [[Meat Inspection Act]] and the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906, which established the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. A much larger body of regulation deals with the public health and worker safety regulation and inspection.

[[File:Israeli slaughterhouse 4.jpg|left|thumb|Many slaughterhouses are called out by workers or outside sources for inhumane treatment of farm animals.]]

In 1997, Gail Eisnitz, chief investigator for the Humane Farming Association (HFA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfa.org Humane Farming Association Website]&lt;/ref&gt; released a book ''Slaughterhouse''. Within, she unveils the interviews of slaughterhouse workers in the U.S. who say that, because of the speed with which they are required to work, animals are routinely skinned while apparently alive and still blinking, kicking and shrieking. Eisnitz argues that this is not only cruel to the animals but also dangerous for the human workers, as cows weighing several thousands of pounds thrashing around in pain are likely to kick out and debilitate anyone working near them.&lt;ref&gt;Eisnitz, Gail A. ''Slaughterhouse''. Prometheus Books, 1997, cited in Torres, Bob. ''Making a Killing''. AK Press, 2007, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

This would imply that certain slaughterhouses throughout the country are not following the guidelines and regulations spelled out by the ''[[Humane Slaughter Act]]'', requiring all animals to be put down and thus insusceptible to pain by some form, typically electronarcosis, before undergoing any form of violent action.

According to the HFA, Eiznitz interviewed slaughterhouse workers representing over two million hours of experience, who, without exception, told her that they have beaten, strangled, boiled and dismembered animals alive or have failed to report those who do. The workers described the effects the violence has had on their personal lives, with several admitting to being physically abusive or taking to alcohol and other drugs.&lt;ref name=HFA&gt;[https://hfa.org/hot_topic/slaughterhouse.html "HFA Exposé Uncovers Federal Crimes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519182758/http://www.hfa.org/hot_topic/slaughterhouse.html |date=2009-05-19 }}, Humane Farming Association. Retrieved March 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The HFA alleges that workers are required to kill up to 1,100 hogs an hour and end up taking their frustration out on the animals.&lt;ref name=HFA/&gt; Eisnitz interviewed one worker, who had worked in ten slaughterhouses, about pig production. He told her:

{{quote|sign=|source=|"Hogs get stressed out pretty easy. If you prod them too much, they have heart attacks. If you get a hog in the chute that's had the shit prodded out of him and has a heart attack or refuses to move, you take a [[meat hook]] and hook it into his [[anus|bunghole]]. You try to do this by clipping the [[hipbone]]. Then you drag him backwards. You're dragging these hogs alive, and a lot of times the meat hook rips out of the bunghole. I've seen [[ham]]s &amp;mdash; [[thigh]]s &amp;mdash; completely ripped open. I've also seen [[intestines]] come out. If the hog collapses near the front of the chute, you shove the meat hook into his [[cheek]] and drag him forward."&lt;ref&gt;Eisnitz, p. 82, cites in Torres, Bob. ''Making a Killing''. AK Press, 2007, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Animal rights movement|Animal rights activists]], [[Anti-speciesism|anti-speciesists]], [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] and [[Veganism|vegans]] are prominent critics of slaughterhouses and have created events such as the [[March to close all slaughterhouses]] to voice concerns about the conditions in slaughterhouses and ask for their abolition.

In [[Law of the United Kingdom|British law]] and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|related]] legal terms, an [[enactment (British legal term)|enactment]] is '''spent''' if it is "exhausted in operation by the accomplishment of the purposes for which it was enacted".&lt;ref&gt;Federation of Nigeria Law Reports. Volume 2. Page 291. Evans Brothers (Nigeria Publishers) Limited. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the explanatory memorandum to the Bill for the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1867]] at [https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA1-PA4&amp;id=QSpcAAAAQAAJ&amp;output=html page 4] of the Bill, printed in Bills, Public: 1867, Session 5 February - 21 August 1867, volume 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The scope of [[Statute Law Revision Bills]] includes the repeal of spent enactments.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bedford (editor). [[Dod's Parliamentary Companion|Dod's Parliamentary Companion 1998]]. 179th Edition. Vacher Dod Publishing Limited. 1998. {{ISBN|0-905702-26-3}}. Page 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeal of spent legislation is primarily the responsibility of the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]]. They prepare [[Bill (proposed law)|Bills]] to be passed as [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act]]s.

The following types of enactment are now spent on [[coming into force]]:

'''Enactments conferring short titles'''

[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1978/cukpga_19780030_en_1#pb5-l1g19 Section 19(2)] of the [[Interpretation Act 1978]] provides that an Act may continue to be cited by the [[short title]] authorised by any enactment notwithstanding the repeal of that enactment. This applies to Acts whenever they were passed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Interpretation Act 1978]], Schedule 2, Part I, paragraph 1 (application of s.19(2) to existing Acts)&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly any enactment whose sole effect is to confer a short title on an Act now becomes spent on coming into force; and any enactment already in force whose sole effect is to confer a short title on an Act is also spent.

Those enactments which conferred short titles on large numbers of statutes have been repealed on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1995]], Schedule 1, Part IV [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1995/ukpga_19950044_en_3#sch1-pt4 OPSI].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] and the [[Scottish Law Commission]], Statute Law Revision: Fifteenth Report, Draft Statute Law Repeals Bill, Law Com 233, Scot Law Com 150, Part IV, pp. 76 - 78 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1995/233.html BAILII] [http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/downloads/rep150.pdf Scottish Law Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014204000/http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/downloads/rep150.pdf |date=14 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enactments which repeal other enactments'''

[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1978/cukpga_19780030_en_1#pb4-l1g15 Section 15] of the [[Interpretation Act 1978]] provides that where an Act repeals a repealing enactment, the repeal does not revive any enactment previously repealed unless words are added reviving it. This applies to Acts passed after the year 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[[Interpretation Act 1978]], Schedule 2, Part I, paragraph 2 (application of s.15 to existing Acts)&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, any enactment whose sole effect is to repeal another enactment now becomes spent on coming into force; and any enactment, which is already in force, whose sole effect is to repeal another enactment is also spent.

'''2016 EU Referendum'''

The [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]]  legislated for the holding of the in-out UK-wide [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] on the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] membership of the [[European Union]].

The '''Treaty of Aigun''' (Russian: Айгунский договор; {{zh|s=瑷珲条约|t=璦琿條約|p=Àihún Tiáoyuē}}) was an 1858 treaty between the [[Russian Empire]], and the empire of the [[Qing Dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers of China, that established much of the modern border between the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Manchuria]] (the original homeland of the [[Manchu people]] and the Qing Dynasty), which is now known as [[Northeast China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/analysis/29263.stm|title=Russia and China end 300 year old border dispute|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=1997-11-10|accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reversed the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] (1689) by transferring the land between the [[Stanovoy Range]] and the [[Amur River]] from China ([[Qing Dynasty|Qing Empire]]) to the [[Russian Empire]]. Russia received over {{convert|600,000|km2|sqmi|sigfig=5}} from China.&lt;ref name = "disputes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sj"/&gt;

==Background==
Since the 18th century, Russia had desired to become a naval power in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. It did so by establishing naval outposts near the [[River Amur]] watershed, encouraging Russians to go there and settle, and slowly developing a strong military presence in the region. China never governed the region effectively or conducted territorial surveys, and these Russian advances went unnoticed.

From 1850 to 1864, China was heavily fighting the [[Taiping Rebellion]], and Governor-General of the Far East [[Nikolay Muraviev]] camped tens of thousands of troops on the borders of [[Mongolia]] and [[Manchuria]], preparing to make legal Russian [[de facto]] control over the Amur from past settlement.&lt;ref name="disputes"/&gt; Muraviev seized the opportunity when it was clear that China was losing the [[Second Opium War]], and threatened China with a war on a second front.&lt;ref name = "sj"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895: perceptions, power, and primacy| last = Paine | first = SCM | publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-81714-1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SHIAEo_qGRIC&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qing Dynasty agreed to enter negotiations with Russia.&lt;ref name = "disputes"&gt;{{Cite book| title= China and international law: the boundary disputes| last = Tzhou | first = Byron N |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]| isbn= 978-0-275-93462-0|year= 1990|page= 47|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OHuybRYYE4YC&amp;pg=PA47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signing==
The [[Russia]]n representative Nikolay Muravyov and the [[Qing]] representative [[Yishan (official)|Yishan]], both military governors of the area signed the treaty on May 28, 1858, in the town of [[Aigun]].&lt;ref name="sj"/&gt;

==Effects==
The resulting treaty established a border between the Russian and Chinese Empires along the Amur River. (Chinese and Manchu residents of the [[Sixty-Four Villages East of the Heilongjiang River]] would be allowed to remain, under the jurisdiction of Manchu government.) The Amur, [[Sungari River|Sungari]], and [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] rivers were to be open exclusively to both Chinese and Russian ships. The territory bounded on the west by the Ussuri, on the north by the Amur, and on the east and south by the [[Sea of Japan]] was to be jointly administered by Russia and China—a "condominium" arrangement similar to that which the British and Americans had agreed upon for the [[Oregon Territory]] in the [[Treaty of 1818]].&lt;ref name="disputes"/&gt; (Russia gained sole control of this land two years later.)&lt;ref name="rl"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/93-4-69.shtml|title=The Sino-Soviet Border Talks|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty research bulletin]]|date=1969-06-26|accessdate=2010-08-14|first=Sally|last=Bissinger|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226110605/http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/93-4-69.shtml|archivedate=2012-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The inhabitants along the Amur, Sungari, and Ussuri rivers were to be allowed to trade with each other.
#The Russians would retain [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Manchu language|Manchu]] copies of the text, and the Chinese would retain Manchu and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] copies of the text.

The '''Treaty of Waitangi''' ({{lang-mi|Te Tiriti o Waitangi}}) is a [[treaty]] first signed on 6 February 1840 by representatives of the [[British Crown]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] chiefs ([[rangatira]]) from the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. It is a document of central importance to the history and political constitution of the state of New Zealand, and has been highly significant in framing the political relations between New Zealand's government and the Māori population.

The Treaty was written at a time when British colonists were pressuring the Crown to establish a colony in New Zealand, and when some Māori leaders had petitioned the British for protection against French forces. It was drafted with the intention of establishing a British [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor of New Zealand]], recognising Māori ownership of their lands, forests and other possessions, and giving Māori the rights of [[British subject]]s. It was intended to ensure that when the declaration of British [[sovereignty]] over New Zealand was made by Lieutenant Governor [[William Hobson]] in May 1840, the Māori people would not feel that their rights had been ignored. Once it had been written and translated, it was first signed by Northern Māori leaders at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]], and subsequently copies of the Treaty were taken around New Zealand and over the following months many other chiefs signed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/treaty-of-waitangi-signings-in-the-south-island/ "Treaty of Waitangi signings in the South Island"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218122042/http://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/treaty-of-waitangi-signings-in-the-south-island/ |date=18 February 2015 }}, [[Christchurch City Libraries]]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 530 to 540 Māori, at least 13 of them women, signed the Treaty of Waitangi, despite some Māori leaders cautioning against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/treaty-of-waitangi/ |newspaper=Waitangi Tribunal |access-date=28 May 2015 |title=Treaty of Waitangi |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706002417/http://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/treaty-of-waitangi |archivedate=6 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orange, ''The Treaty of Waitangi'', [[Bridget Williams Books]], 1987, Appendices p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; An immediate result of the Treaty was that [[Queen Victoria]]'s government gained the sole right to purchase land.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=Patricia |title=Fatal Success: A History of the New Zealand Company | year= 1989 | isbn=0-7900-0011-3 |publisher=Heinemann Reed |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In total there are nine signed copies of the Treaty of Waitangi including the sheet signed on 6 February 1840 at Waitangi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.govt.nz/exhibitions/treaty |title=Treaty of Waitangi – Te Tiriti o Waitangi |publisher=[[Archives New Zealand]] |access-date=10 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811091145/http://archives.govt.nz/exhibitions/treaty |archivedate=11 August 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Treaty includes a preamble and three articles. It is bilingual, with the [[Māori language|Māori]] text translated from the English. Article one of the English text cedes "all rights and powers of sovereignty" to the Crown. Article two establishes the continued ownership of the Māori over their lands, and establishes the exclusive right of pre-emption of the Crown. Article three gives Māori people full rights and protections as British subjects. However, the English text and the Māori text differ in meaning significantly, particularly in relation to the meaning of having and ceding sovereignty. These discrepancies led to disagreements in the decades following the signing, eventually culminating in the [[New Zealand Wars]].&lt;ref name="Meaning-Tribunal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/treaty-of-waitangi/meaning-of-the-treaty/ |title=Meaning of the Treaty |year=2011 |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal |access-date=12 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708084042/http://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/treaty-of-waitangi/meaning-of-the-treaty/ |archivedate=8 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 19th century, Māori generally lost control of the land they had owned, some through legitimate sale, but often due to unfair land deals or outright seizure in the aftermath of the New Zealand War. In the period following the New Zealand Wars, the New Zealand government mostly ignored the Treaty and a court case judgement in 1877 declared it to be "a simple nullity". Beginning in the 1950s, Māori increasingly sought to use the Treaty as a platform for claiming additional rights to sovereignty and to reclaim lost land, and governments in the 1960s and 1970s were responsive to these arguments, giving the Treaty an increasingly central role in the interpretation of land rights and relations between Māori people and the state. In 1975, the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] was established as a permanent commission of inquiry tasked with interpreting the Treaty, researching breaches of the Treaty by the [[British Crown]] or its agents, and to suggest means of redress.&lt;ref name="Meaning-Tribunal" /&gt; In most cases, recommendations of the Tribunal are not binding on the Crown, but settlements totalling almost $1 billion have been awarded to various Māori groups.&lt;ref name="Settlements" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meaning-Tribunal" /&gt; Various legislation passed in the later part of the 20th century has made reference to the Treaty, but the Treaty has never been made part of New Zealand [[municipal law]]. Nonetheless, the Treaty is widely regarded as the [[founding document]] of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="NZ const"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gg.govt.nz/office-governor-general/roles-and-functions-governor-general/constitutional-role/constitution/constitution |title=New Zealand's Constitution |publisher=Government House |access-date=17 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210231805/https://gg.govt.nz/office-governor-general/roles-and-functions-governor-general/constitutional-role/constitution/constitution |archivedate=10 December 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/Documents/Files/NZ%20Constitution%20Cabinet%20Office%20backgrounder.pdf|publisher=Cabinet Office|title=New Zealand's constitution – past, present and future|access-date=17 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424235332/https://www.beehive.govt.nz/Documents/Files/NZ%20Constitution%20Cabinet%20Office%20backgrounder.pdf|archivedate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Palmer |first=Matthew |year=2008 |title=The Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand's Law and Constitution |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1429905 |location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
{{Main|History of New Zealand}}
[[File:JamesBusbyNZ.jpg|thumb|upright|left|James Busby, British Resident in New Zealand. He drafted a document known as the [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand]].]]

The first contact between the Māori and Europeans was in 1642, when Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] arrived and was fought off, and again in 1769 when the English navigator Captain [[James Cook]] claimed New Zealand for Britain at the [[Mercury Islands]]. Nevertheless, the British government showed little interest in following up this claim for over half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The British Inheritance: A Treasury of Historic Documents |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |editor-last=Hallam |editor-first=Elizabeth |pages=90 |editor-last2=Prescott |editor-first2=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of New Zealand in British statutes is in the [[Murders Abroad Act 1817|Murders Abroad Act of 1817]],&lt;ref name="Wilson 1985"&gt;{{cite book |ref= harv |last= Wilson |first= James Oakley |title= New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840–1984 |edition= 4th |origyear=First published in 1913 |year= 1985 |publisher= V.R.

Many of the ships came from Sydney. Trade between Sydney and New Zealand increased as traders sought kauri timber and flax and missionaries purchased large areas of land in the Bay of Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Simpson  | first =Tony | title = Before Hobson | publisher = Blythswood Press |  date = 2015 | location = Wellington  |  isbn = 9780473312848}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trade was seen as mutually advantageous, and Māori tribes competed for access to the services of Europeans that had chosen to live on the islands because they brought goods and knowledge that were essential to the local ''[[iwi]]'' (the Māori word for the social unit often called "tribe" or "people"). At the same time, Europeans living in New Zealand needed the protection that Māori chiefs could provide.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; As a result of trade, Māori society changed drastically up to the 1840s. They changed their society from one of subsistence farming and gathering to cultivating useful trade crops.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

The Māori generally respected the British, partially due to encouragement from missionaries and also due to British status as a major maritime power, which had been made apparent to Māori travelling outside New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; The other major powers in the area around the 1830s included American whalers, whom the Māori accepted as cousins of the British, and French Catholics who came for trade and as missionaries. The Māori were still deeply distrustful of the French, due to a massacre of 250 people that had occurred in 1772, when they retaliated for the killing of [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne|Marion du Fresne]] and some of his crew.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; While the threat of the French never materialised, in 1831 it prompted thirteen [[rangatira]] (major chiefs) from the [[Far North District|far north]] of the country to meet at [[Kerikeri]] to compose a letter to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] asking for help to guard their lands. It is the first known plea for British intervention written by Māori.&lt;ref&gt;Binney, Judith (2007).

Chapter 13, "The Māori Leaders' Assembly, Kororipo Pā, 1831", by Manuka Henare, pp 114–116.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the British government sent [[James Busby]] in 1832 to be the British Resident in New Zealand. In 1834 Busby drafted a document known as the [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand]] which he and 35 northern Māori chiefs signed at Waitangi on 28 October 1835, establishing those chiefs as representatives of a proto-state under the title of the "[[United Tribes of New Zealand]]". This document was not well received by the [[Colonial Office]] in Britain, and it was decided that a new policy for New Zealand was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/declaration-of-independence-taming-the-frontier |title=Taming the frontier Page 4 – Declaration of Independence |date=23 September 2016 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=20 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711075427/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/declaration-of-independence-taming-the-frontier |archivedate=11 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May to July 1836, Royal Navy officer Captain [[William Hobson]], under instruction from Sir [[Richard Bourke]], visited New Zealand to investigate claims of lawlessness in its settlements. Hobson recommended in his report that British sovereignty be established over New Zealand, in small pockets similar to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="birth_certificates"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Zealand Birth Certificates – 50 of New Zealand's Founding Documents|editor=[[Paul Moon]]|year=2010|publisher=AUT Media|isbn=978-0-9582997-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobson's report was forwarded to the Colonial Office. From April to May 1838, the [[House of Lords]] held a [[Select committee (Westminster system)|select committee]] into the "State of the Islands of New Zealand". The [[New Zealand Association]] (later the [[New Zealand Company]]), missionaries, [[Joel Samuel Polack]], and the Royal Navy made submissions to the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-GolHist-t1-body1-d6.html|accessdate=22 June 2017|title=Chapter VI – A select committee on the islands of New Zealand|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington – victoria.ac.nz|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828160410/http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz//tm/scholarly/tei-GolHist-t1-body1-d6.html|archivedate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 1839 new [[Letters Patent]] were issued to expand the territory of [[New South Wales]] to include the entire territory of New Zealand, from latitude 34° South to 47° 10' South, and from longitude 166° 5' East to 179° East.&lt;ref name="Legal System"&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Zealand Legal System|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]|author=Morag McDowell &amp; Duncan Webb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor of New South Wales]] [[George Gipps]] was appointed Governor over New Zealand.&lt;ref name="McLean"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Governors: New Zealand's Governors and Governors-General |last=McLean |first=Gavin |publisher=Otago University Press |year=2006 |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first clear expression of British intent to annex New Zealand.&lt;ref name="McLean" /&gt;

Hobson was called to the Colonial Office on the evening of 14 August 1839 and given instructions to take the constitutional steps needed to establish a British colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1h29/hobson-william|title=Hobson, William. Biography|publisher=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820074742/https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1h29/hobson-william|archivedate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] to New Zealand and was instructed to negotiate a voluntary transfer of sovereignty from the Māori to the British Crown as the House of Lords select committee had recommended in 1837. [[Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby|Normanby]] gave Hobson three instructions – to seek a cession of sovereignty, to assume complete control over land matters, and to establish a form of civil government, but he did not provide a draft of the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Dowell and Webb, ''The NZ Legal System'', LexisNexis, 2006, p 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholefield, G. (1930). ''Captain William Hobson.'' pp. 202–203. (Instructions from Lord Normanby to Captain Hobson – dated 14 August 1839)&lt;/ref&gt; Normanby wrote at length about the need for British intervention as essential to protect Māori interests, but this was somewhat deceptive.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Hobson's instructions gave no provision for Māori government of any kind nor any Māori involvement in the administrative structure of the new colony.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

Historian [[Claudia Orange]] argues that prior to 1839 the Colonial Office had initially planned a "Māori New Zealand" in which European settlers would be accommodated without a full colony&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; where Māori might retain ownership and authority over much of the land and cede some land to settlers as part of a colony governed by the Crown.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange Illustrated" /&gt; However, Normanby's instructions in 1839 show that the Colonial Office had shifted their stance toward colonisation and "a settler New Zealand in which a place had to be kept for Māori", primarily due to pressure from increasing numbers of British colonists.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange Illustrated"&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Illustrated History of the Treaty of Waitangi |last=Orange |first=Claudia |date=2015 |publisher=Bridget Williams Books |page=22 |author-link=Claudia Orange}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colonial Office was forced to accelerate its plans because of both the New Zealand Company's hurried dispatch of the ''[[New Zealand Company ships#Tory|Tory]]'' to New Zealand on 12 May 1839 to purchase land,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/ships-famous/page-4|title=Ships, Famous.

Hobson left London on 15 August 1839 and was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor in Sydney on 14 January, finally arriving in the Bay of Islands on 29 January 1840. Meanwhile, a second New Zealand Company ship, the ''[[New Zealand Company ships#Cuba|Cuba]]'', had arrived in Port Nicholson on 3 January with a survey party to prepare for settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Early History of New Zealand: From Earliest Times to 1840 |last=Arundell |first=Richard |last2=Sherrin |first2=Augur |year=1890 |editor-last=Leys |editor-first=Thompson W. |publisher=H.

On 30 January 1840 Hobson attended the Christ Church at Kororareka (Russell) where he publicly read a number of proclamations. The first was the [[Letters patent|Letters Patent]] 1839, in relation to the extension of the boundaries of [[New South Wales]] to include the islands of New Zealand. The second was in relation to Hobson's own appointment as Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand. The third was in relation to land transactions (notably on the issue of pre-emption).&lt;ref&gt;King, Marie. (1949). ''A Port in the North: A Short History of Russell.'' p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting of the Treaty==
[[File:HenryWilliams, missionary (1792-1867).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]], who translated the Treaty into Māori with the help of his son [[Edward Marsh Williams]].]]
Without a draft document prepared by lawyers or Colonial Office officials, Hobson was forced to write his own treaty with the help of his secretary, James Freeman, and British Resident [[James Busby]], neither of whom was a lawyer.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Historian [[Paul Moon]] believes certain articles of the Treaty resemble the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), the British [[Sherbro people|Sherbro]] Agreement (1825) and the treaty between Britain and Soombia Soosoos (1826).&lt;ref name="moon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10619805&amp;pnum=0|title=Paul Moon: Hope for watershed in new Treaty era|date=13 January 2010|accessdate=15 January 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire Treaty was prepared in four days,&lt;ref name="MKing"&gt;{{cite book | author=Michael King | title=The Penguin History of New Zealand | year= 2003 | isbn=0-14-301867-1 | publisher=Penguin Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it underwent many revisions.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; There were doubts even during the drafting process that the Māori chiefs would be able to understand the concept of relinquishing 'sovereignty'.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

Realising that a treaty in English could not be understood, debated or agreed to by Māori, Hobson instructed missionary [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] and his son [[Edward Marsh Williams]], who was more proficient in ''Te Reo'', the [[Māori language]], to translate the document, and this was done overnight on 4 February.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell and Webb, LexisNexis.2006 P 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation of the Treaty was reviewed by James Busby, and he proposed the substitution of the word ''whakaminenga'' for ''huihuinga'', to describe the "Confederation" or gathering of the chiefs.&lt;ref name="CARv2-2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title= The Life of Henry Williams: "Early Recollections"  written by Henry Williams |url= |accessdate= |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB), University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=12 |pages= |chapter= Vol. II |chapterurl=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1048&amp;page=1&amp;action=null|quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; This no doubt was a reference to the northern confederation of chiefs with whom Hobson preferred to negotiate, who eventually made up the vast majority of signatories to the Treaty.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Hobson believed that elsewhere in the country the Crown could exercise greater freedom over the rights of 'first discoverers', which proved unwise as it led to future difficulties with other tribes in the South Island.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

==Debate and signing==
On 5 February the original English version Treaty and its translation into Māori&lt;ref&gt;Orange, ''The Treaty of Waitangi'', Bridget Williams Books, 1987, ch 3&lt;/ref&gt; were put before a gathering of northern chiefs inside a large [[Tent#Marquees and larger tents|marquee]] on the lawn in front of Busby's house at Waitangi. Hobson read the Treaty aloud in English and Williams read his Māori version.&lt;ref name="CARv2-3"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title= The Life of Henry Williams: "Early Recollections"  written by Henry Williams |url= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB), University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=11–15 |chapter= Vol. II |chapterurl=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1048&amp;page=1&amp;action=null|quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Māori chiefs (''rangatira'') then debated the Treaty for five hours, much of which was recorded and translated by the [[Paihia]] missionary station printer, [[William Colenso]].&lt;ref name="colenso"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Authentic and Genuine History of the Signing of the Treaty of Waitangi |last=Colenso |first=William |authorlink=William Colenso |year=1890 |publisher=By Authority of George Didsbury, Government Printer |location=Wellington |url=http://www.waitangi.com/colenso/colhis1.html |accessdate=31 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816123405/http://www.waitangi.com/colenso/colhis1.html |archivedate=16 August 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewa, a Catholic chief, who had been influenced by the French Catholic Bishop [[Jean Baptiste Pompallier|Pompallier]], said "The Māori people don't want a governor! We aren't European. It's true that we've sold some of our lands. But this country is still ours! We chiefs govern this land of our ancestors". [[Moka 'Kainga-mataa']] argued that all land unjustly purchased by Europeans should be returned.&lt;ref name="orange"&gt;{{cite book |last=Orange |first=Claudia |title=An Illustrated History of the Treaty of Waitangi |year=2004 |publisher=Bridget Williams Books |location=Wellington |isbn=1-877242-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whai asked: "Yesterday I was cursed by a white man. Is that the way things are going to be?". Protestant Chiefs such as [[Hōne Heke]], Pumuka, [[Te Wharerahi]], [[Tamati Waka Nene]] and his brother [[Eruera Maihi Patuone]] were accepting of the Governor.&lt;ref name="orange" /&gt; Hōne Heke said:

{{blockquote|Governor, you should stay with us and be like a father. If you go away then the French or the rum sellers will take us Māori people over. How to you. Some of you tell Hobson to go. But that's not going to solve our difficulties. We have already sold so much land here in the north. We have no way of controlling the Europeans who have settled on it. I'm amazed to hear you telling him to go! Why didn't you tell the traders and grog-sellers to go years ago? There are too many Europeans here now and there are children that will unite our races&lt;ref name="orange" /&gt;}}

Bishop Pompallier, who had been counselling the many Catholic Māori in the north concerning the Treaty, urged them to be very wary of the Treaty and not to sign anything. He left after the initial discussions and was not present when the chiefs signed.&lt;ref name="CARv2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="low"&gt;P.Lowe. ''The French and The Maori'', Heritage 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NZ-Waitangi.png|thumb|right|The location of Waitangi within New Zealand]]
For Māori chiefs, the signing at Waitangi would have needed a great deal of trust. Nonetheless, expected benefits of British protection must have outweighed their fears. In particular, the French were also interested in New Zealand, and there were fears that if they did not side with the British that the French would put pressure on them in a similar manner to that of other Pacific Islanders farther north in what would become [[French Polynesia]]. Māori at the signing were further encouraged by English Missionaries, who believed that British regulation would be invaluable to the future welfare of Māori as European settlers continued to arrive.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

Afterward, the chiefs then moved to a river flat below Busby's house and lawn and continued deliberations late into the night. Busby's house would later become known as the [[Treaty House]] and is today New Zealand's most visited historic building.&lt;ref name="treaty house"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/the-treaty-house |title=The Treaty House |date=5 February 2013 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=24 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415085207/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/the-treaty-house |archivedate=15 April 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobson had planned for the signing to occur on 7 February however on the morning of 6 February 45 chiefs&lt;ref name="colenso" /&gt; were waiting ready to sign. Around noon a ship carrying two officers from [[HMS Herald (1822)|''HMS Herald'']] arrived and were surprised to hear they were waiting for the Governor so a boat was quickly despatched back to let him know.&lt;ref name="colenso" /&gt; Although the official painting of the signing shows Hobson wearing full naval regalia, he was in fact not expecting the chiefs that day and was wearing his dressing gown&lt;ref&gt;Michael King, ''Nga Iwi O Te Motu'', Reed, 2001, p 34.&lt;/ref&gt; or "in plain clothes, except his hat".&lt;ref name="colenso" /&gt; The Treaty signing began in the afternoon.

Hobson headed the British signatories. Hōne Heke was the first of the Māori chiefs who signed that day.&lt;ref name="CARv2-3"/&gt; As each chief signed, Hobson said "''He iwi tahi tātou''", meaning "We are [now] one people".&lt;ref name="orange" /&gt; Two chiefs, [[Marupō]] and [[Ruhe (Māori chief)|Ruhe]], protested strongly against the Treaty as the signing took place but they eventually signed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/signatory/1-24 |title=Ruhe |date=17 June 2016 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=20 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518181234/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/signatory/1-24 |archivedate=18 May 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after [[Marupō]] shook the Governor's hand, seized hold of his hat which was on the table and gestured to put it on.&lt;ref name="colenso" /&gt;

===Later signings===
Hobson considered the signing at Waitangi to be highly significant, he noted that twenty-six of the forty-six 'head chiefs' had signed.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Hobson had no intention of requiring the unanimous assent of Māori to the Treaty, but was willing to accept a majority, as he reported that the signings at Waitangi represented "Clear recognition of the sovereign rights of Her Majesty over the northern parts of this island".&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; However, those that signed at Waitangi did not even represent the north as a whole; an analysis of the signatures shows that most were from the Bay of Islands only, and that not many of the chiefs of the highest rank had signed on that day.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Hobson considered the initial signing at Waitangi to be the "de facto" treaty, while later signings merely "ratified and confirmed it",&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

To enhance the Treaty's authority, eight additional copies were sent around the country to gather additional signatures:&lt;ref name="Journey"/&gt;
* the [[Manukau Harbour|Manukau]]-[[Kawhia]] copy,
* the [[Waikato]]-Manukau copy,
* the [[Tauranga]] copy,
* the [[Bay of Plenty]] copy,
* the [[HMS Herald (1822)|Herald]]-[[Thomas Bunbury (British Army officer)|Bunbury]] copy,
* the [[Henry Williams (missionary)#Treaty of Waitangi|Henry Williams]] copy,
* the [[William Williams (bishop)#Treaty of Waitangi – te Tiriti|Tūranga (East Coast)]] copy, and
* the Printed copy.

About 50 meetings were held from February to September 1840 to discuss and sign the copies, and a further 500 signatures were added to the Treaty. While most did eventually sign, especially in the far north where most Māori lived, a number of chiefs and some tribal groups ultimately refused, including [[Pōtatau Te Wherowhero]] [[Waikato (iwi)|(Waikato iwi)]], [[Tuhoe]], [[Te Arawa]] and [[Ngāti Tuwharetoa]] and possibly [[Moka 'Kainga-mataa']]. A number of non-signatory Waikato and Central North Island chiefs would later form a kind of confederacy with an elected monarch called the [[Kīngitanga]].&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; (The Kīngitanga Movement would later form a primary anti-government force in the [[New Zealand Wars]].) While copies were moved around the country to give as many tribal leaders as possible the opportunity to sign, some missed out, especially in the South Island, where inclement weather prevented copies from reaching [[Otago]] or [[Stewart Island]].&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Assent to the Treaty was unanimous in [[Kaitaia]], as well as possibly the [[Wellington]] to [[Whanganui]] region, but there were at least some holdouts in every other part of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

Nonetheless, on 21 May 1840, Lieutenant-Governor Hobson proclaimed sovereignty over the whole country, (the North Island by Treaty and the South Island and Stewart Island by discovery) and New Zealand was constituted as a colony separate from [[New South Wales]] on 16 November 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/hobson-proclaims-sovereignty-over-all-of-new-zealand |title=Hobson proclaims British sovereignty over New Zealand |date=20 December 2016 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=23 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518121838/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/hobson-proclaims-sovereignty-over-all-of-new-zealand |archivedate=18 May 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government was told that the North Island had been ceded with "unanimous adherence" (which was not accurate) and while Hobson claimed the South Island by discovery based on the "uncivilised state of the natives", in actuality he had no basis to make such a claim.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; In reality, Hobson issued the proclamation because he felt it was forced on him by settlers from the New Zealand Company who had attempted to form an independent settlement government at Port Nicholson and claimed legality from local chiefs.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Hobson also failed to report to the British government that the Māori text of the Treaty was substantially different from the English one (which he might not have known at the time) and also reported that both texts had received 512 signatures, where in truth the majority of signatures had been on the Māori copies that had been sent around the country, rather than on the single English copy.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Basing their decision on this information, on 2 October 1840,  the Colonial Office approved Hobson's proclamation. They did not have second thoughts when later reports revealed more detail about the inadequacies of the Treaty negotiations, and they did not take issue with the fact that large areas of the North Island had not signed. The government had never asked for Hobson to obtain unanimous agreement from the indigenous people.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

==Extant copies==
[[File:Treaty of Waitangi all documents.jpg|thumb|494x494px|The group of nine documents that make up the Treaty of Waitangi.]]
In 1841, Treaty documents, housed in an iron box, narrowly escaped damage when the government offices at Official Bay in [[Auckland]] were destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name="Journey"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/files/documents/Journey.pdf |title=The Journey of the Treaty |publisher=State Services Commission |year=2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414152742/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/files/documents/Journey.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They disappeared from sight until 1865 when a Native Department officer worked on them in Wellington at the request of parliament and produced an erroneous list of signatories. The papers were fastened together and then deposited in a safe in the [[Colonial Secretary (New Zealand)|Colonial Secretary]]'s office.&lt;ref name="treatylost"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Orange | first = Claudia  | author-link = Claudia Orange | title =The Treaty of Waitangi | publisher =Allen &amp; Unwin |  date = 1987 | location = Wellington | pages = 236 |  isbn =0868614270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, the English-language rough draft of the Treaty was published along with photolithographic [[facsimiles]], and the originals were returned to storage. In 1908, historian and bibliographer Dr [[Thomas Hocken]], searching for historical documents, found the Treaty papers in poor condition, damaged at the edges by water and partly eaten by rodents.&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt; The papers were restored by the [[New Zealand Dominion Museum building|Dominion Museum]] in 1913 and kept in special boxes from then on. In February 1940, the Treaty documents were taken to Waitangi for display in the [[Treaty House]] during the [[New Zealand Centennial Exhibition|Centenary]] celebrations.&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt; It was possibly the first time the Treaty document had been on public display since it was signed.&lt;ref name="treatylost" /&gt; After the outbreak of war with Japan, they were placed with other state documents in an outsize [[trunk (luggage)|luggage trunk]] and deposited for secure custody with the [[Public Trustee]] at [[Palmerston North]] by the local [[Member of parliament|MP]], who did not tell staff what was in the case. However, as the case was too large to fit in the safe, the Treaty documents spent the war at the side of a back corridor in the Public Trust office.

In 1956, the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]] placed the Treaty documents in the care of the [[Alexander Turnbull Library]] and they were displayed in 1961. Further preservation steps were taken in 1966, with improvements to the display conditions.&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt; From 1977 to 1980, the library extensively restored the documents before the Treaty was deposited in the Reserve Bank.&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt;

In anticipation of a decision to exhibit the document in 1990 (the sesquicentennial of the signing), full documentation and reproduction photography was carried out. Several years of planning culminated with the opening of the climate-controlled Constitution Room at the [[Archives New Zealand|National Archives]] by [[Mike Moore (New Zealand politician)|Mike Moore]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]], in November 1990.&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt; It was announced in 2012 that the nine Treaty of Waitangi sheets would be relocated to the [[National Library of New Zealand]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=45636 |title=Treaty of Waitangi to be moved from Archives to National Library |publisher=Wellington.scoop.co.nz |accessdate=2 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306091917/http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=45636 |archivedate=6 March 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English text (from which the Māori text is translated) starts with the preamble and presents Queen Victoria "being desirous to establish a settled form of Civil Government", and invites Māori chiefs to concur in the following articles. The first article of the English text grants the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of England]] "absolutely and without reservation all the rights and powers of Sovereignty" over New Zealand. The second article guarantees to the chiefs full "exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties." It also specifies that Māori will sell land only to the Crown (Crown pre-emption). The third article guarantees to all Māori the same rights as all other British subjects.&lt;ref name="Read English" /&gt;

The Māori text has the same overall structure, with a preamble and three articles. The first article indicates that the Māori chiefs "give absolutely to the Queen of England for ever the complete government over their land" (according to a modern translation by [[Hugh Kāwharu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/treaty-of-waitangi/translation-of-te-reo-maori-text/ |title=Translation of the te reo Māori text |website=www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz |language=en-NZ |access-date=25 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123203137/https://waitangitribunal.govt.nz/treaty-of-waitangi/translation-of-te-reo-maori-text/ |archivedate=23 January 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Waitangi_Revisited.html?id=sLqyAAAACAAJ |title=Waitangi Revisited: Perspectives on the Treaty of Waitangi |last=Belgrave |first=Michael |last2=Kawharu |first2=Merata |last3=Williams |first3=David Vernon |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=9780195584004 |pages=390–393 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no adequate word available to substitute for 'sovereignty', as it was not a concept in Māori society at the time, the translators instead used ''kāwanatanga'' (governorship or government). The second article guarantees all Māori "chieftainship over their lands, villages and all their treasures" (translated), with 'treasures' here translating from ''taonga'' to mean more than just physical possessions (as in the English text), but also other elements of cultural heritage. The second article also says: "Chiefs will sell land to the Queen at a price agreed to by the person owning it and by the person buying it (the latter being) appointed by the Queen as her purchase agent" (translated), which does not accurately convey the [[Preemption (land)|pre-emption]] clause of the English text. The third article gives Māori the "same rights and duties of citizenship as the people of England" (translated); roughly the same as the English text.

===Differences===

The differences between the two texts have made it difficult to interpret the Treaty and continues to undermine its effect. The most critical difference between the texts revolves around the interpretation of three Māori words: ''[[Kawanatanga|kāwanatanga]]'' (governorship), which is ceded to the Queen in the first article; ''[[rangatiratanga]]'' (chieftainship) not ''[[Mana#In New Zealand|mana]]'' (leadership) (which was stated in the Declaration of Independence just five years before the Treaty was signed), which is retained by the chiefs in the second; and ''[[taonga]]'' (property or valued possessions), which the chiefs are guaranteed ownership and control of, also in the second article. Few Māori involved with The Treaty negotiations understood the concepts of [[sovereignty]] or "governorship", as they were used by 19th-century Europeans, and lawyer [[Moana Jackson]] has stated that "ceding mana or sovereignty in a treaty was legally and culturally incomprehensible in Māori terms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facing the truth about the Maori Wars|publisher=The Mana Trust|year=2016|url=http://www.e-tangata.co.nz/news/moana-jackson-facing-the-truth-about-the-wars|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003110533/http://www.e-tangata.co.nz/news/moana-jackson-facing-the-truth-about-the-wars|archivedate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, ''[[kāwanatanga]]'' is a [[Calque|loan translation]] from 'governorship' and was not part of the Māori language. The term had been used by [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] in his translation of the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand which was signed by 35 northern [[Māori people|Māori]] chiefs at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] on 28 October 1835.&lt;ref name="nzhistory dec of independence"&gt;{{cite web| work = Translation from Archives New Zealand, New Zealand History online| title = The Declaration of Independence| url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/interactive/the-declaration-of-independence| accessdate = 18 August 2010| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707130520/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/interactive/the-declaration-of-independence| archivedate = 7 July 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration of Independence of New Zealand had stated "''Ko te Kīngitanga ko te mana i te w[h]enua''" to describe "all sovereign power and authority in the land".&lt;ref name="nzhistory dec of independence"/&gt; There is considerable debate about what would have been a more appropriate term. Some scholars, notably Ruth Ross, argue that ''[[mana]]'' (prestige, authority) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ross |first=R. M. |year=1972 |title=Te Tiriti o Waitangi: Texts and Translations |journal=New Zealand Journal of History |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has more recently been argued by others, including Judith Binney, that ''mana'' would not have been appropriate. This is because ''mana'' is not the same thing as sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their ''mana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Binney |first=Judith|year=1989|chapter=The Maori and the Signing of the Treaty of Waitangi|title=Towards 1990: Seven Leading Historians Examine Significant Aspects of New Zealand History|pages=20–31|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English-language text recognises Māori rights to "properties", which seems to imply physical and perhaps intellectual property. The Māori text, on the other hand, mentions "[[taonga]]", meaning "treasures" or "precious things". In Māori usage the term applies much more broadly than the English concept of legal property, and since the 1980s courts have found that the term can encompass intangible things such as language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Maori Broadcasting Claim: A Pakeha Economist's Perspective|publisher=Brian Easton|year=1990|url=http://www.eastonbh.ac.nz/?p=293|accessdate=1 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927093405/http://www.eastonbh.ac.nz/?p=293|archivedate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Waitangi Tribunal on Claims Concerning the Allocation of Radio Frequencies (Wai 26) |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal |year=1990 |url=https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/WT/reports/reportSummary.html?reportId=wt_DOC_68476762 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622091906/https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/WT/reports/reportSummary.html?reportId=wt_DOC_68476762 |archivedate=22 June 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Radio Spectrum Management and Development Final Report (Wai 776)|publisher= Waitangi Tribunal|year= 1999|url= https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/WT/reports/reportSummary.html?reportId=wt_DOC_68205950|accessdate= 1 September 2011|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170819231417/https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/WT/reports/reportSummary.html?reportId=wt_DOC_68205950|archivedate= 19 August 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even where physical property such as land is concerned, differing cultural understandings as to what types of land are able to be privately owned have caused problems, as for example in the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|foreshore and seabed controversy]] of 2003–04.

The pre-emption clause is generally not well translated.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; While pre-emption was present in the Treaty from the very first draft, it was translated to ''hokonga'', a word which simply meant 'to buy, sell, or trade'.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Many Māori apparently believed that they were simply giving the British Queen first offer on land, after which they could sell it to anyone.&lt;ref name="Signing the treaty"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/making-the-treaty/signing-the-treaty |title=Signing the Treaty |date=1 July 2016 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=23 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708174636/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/making-the-treaty/signing-the-treaty |archivedate=8 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Another, less important, difference is that ''Ingarani'', meaning England alone, is used throughout in the Māori text, whereas "the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]" is used in the first paragraph of the English.

Based on these differences, some Māori academics argue that the two versions of the Treaty are distinctly different documents they refer to as "Te Tiriti o Waitangi" and "The Treaty of Waitangi",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonising Myths: Maori Realities-He Rukuruku Whakaaro|last=Mikaere|first=Ani|publisher=Huia|year=2011|isbn=|location=Wellington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tekaharoa.com/index.php/tekaharoa/article/view/6/4|title=View of Te Arewhana Kei Roto i Te Rūma: An Indigenous Neo-Disputatio on Settler Society, Nullifying Te Tiriti, ‘Natural Resources’ and Our Collective Future in Aotearoa New Zealand|website=www.tekaharoa.com|language=en-US|access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Māori text should take precedence, because it was the one that was signed at Waitangi and by the most signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/14137 |title=Constitutional Intentions: The Treaty Texts |last=Margaret |first=Mutu, |date= Feb 2010 |access-date= 15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Waitangi Tribunal, tasked with deciding issues raised by the differences between the two texts, also gives additional weight to the Māori text in its interpretations of the Treaty.&lt;ref name="Waitangi Tribunal Meaning"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/treaty-of-waitangi/meaning-of-the-treaty/ |title= Meaning of the Treaty |via= ''Waitangi Tribunal'' |website= waitangitribunal.govt.nz |language=en-NZ |access-date= 15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire issue is further complicated by the fact that, at the time, Māori society was an oral rather than literate one. Māori present at the signing of the Treaty would have placed more value and reliance on what Hobson and the missionaries said, rather than the words of the actual Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Belich, James (1996), ''Making Peoples: A History of the New Zealanders from Polynesian Settlement to the End of the Nineteenth Century'', pp.195–6.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the signing by over 600 "chiefs" only 12 could sign their own name and most of these had a very shaky, uncertain style indicating inexperience with writing. The rest put an X or drew part of their ''[[Tā moko|moko]]'' (personal facial tattoo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Simpson  | first =Tony | title = Before Hobson | publisher = Blythswood Press |  date = 2015 | location = Wellington |  isbn = 9780473312848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Māori beliefs and attitudes towards ownership and use of land were different from those prevailing in Britain and Europe. The chiefs would traditionally grant permission for the land to be used for a time for a particular purpose. A northern chief, [[Nōpera Panakareao]], also early on summarised his understanding of the Treaty as "''Ko te atarau o te whenua i riro i a te kuini, ko te tinana o te whenua i waiho ki ngā Māori''" (The shadow of the land will go to the Queen [of England], but the substance of the land will remain with us). Nopera later reversed his earlier statement – feeling that the substance of the land had indeed gone to the Queen; only the shadow remained for the Māori.&lt;ref name="EncNZ"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Story: Muriwhenua tribes, Page 4 – European contact| publisher =The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand| url =http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/muriwhenua-tribes/page-4| accessdate =26 November 2013| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131203204010/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/muriwhenua-tribes/page-4| archivedate =3 December 2013| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in New Zealand society==
===Effects on Māori land and rights (1840–1960)===
In November 1840 a [[royal charter]] was signed by Queen Victoria,&lt;ref name="Colony date"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/letters-patent-issued-making-new-zealand-a-colony-separate-from-new-south-wales |title=New Zealand officially becomes British colony |date=23 December 2016 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=25 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518113743/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/letters-patent-issued-making-new-zealand-a-colony-separate-from-new-south-wales |archivedate=18 May 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing New Zealand as a [[Crown colony]] separate from New South Wales from May 1841.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of the British Empire"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire |last=Panton |first=Kenneth |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2015 |isbn=9780810878013 |location=London |pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short-term effect of the Treaty was to prevent the sale of Māori land to anyone other than the Crown. This was intended to protect Māori from the kinds of shady land purchases which had alienated [[indigenous people]]s in other parts of the world from their land with minimal compensation. However, before the Treaty had been finalised the New Zealand Company had made several hasty land deals and shipped settlers from Great Britain to New Zealand, hoping the British would be forced to accept its land claims as a [[Glossary of French expressions in English#Fait accompli|fait accompli]], in which it was largely successful.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

In part the Treaty was an attempt to establish a system of property rights for land with the Crown controlling and overseeing land sale to prevent abuse. Initially this worked well with the Governor and his representatives having the sole right to buy and sell land from the Māori.&lt;ref name="Donald McLean" /&gt; Māori were eager to sell land, and settlers eager to buy.&lt;ref name="Donald McLean"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Best Man who Ever Served the Crown?: A Life of Donald McLean |last=Fargher |first=Ray |publisher=Victoria University Press |year=2007 |isbn=9780864735607 |location=Wellington |pages=54–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown was supposed to mediate the process to ensure that the true owners were properly identified (difficult for tribally owned land) and fairly compensated, by the standards of the time. In particular, the Governor had the responsibility to protect Māori interests.&lt;ref name="Donald McLean" /&gt; Still, Hobson, as Governor of New Zealand, and his successor [[Robert FitzRoy]] both took seriously their duty as protectors of Māori from unscrupulous settlers, working actively to prevent shady land deals.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=KahxQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%2522Ranginui+Walker%2522&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq8ejU1urYAhUJXbwKHUo1CVEQ6AEIKDAA |title=Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou |last=Walker |first=Ranginui |date=2004 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780143019459 |pages=105, 106, 135, 136, 137, 139, 142, 143 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072245/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=KahxQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%2522Ranginui+Walker%2522&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq8ejU1urYAhUJXbwKHUo1CVEQ6AEIKDAA |archivedate=23 January 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobson created a group of 'Protectors of the Aborigines'; officials specifically appointed to verify owners, land boundaries, and sales.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt; Lack of funds often prevented land deals at this time, which created discontent among those who were willing but unable to sell.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Combined with a growing awareness of the profit margins that the government was receiving by reselling the land at a profit, there was growing discontent among Māori with the pre-emption clause.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; At this time Māori and others argued that the government's abuse of the pre-emption clause was incompatible with article three of the Treaty which guaranteed Māori equal rights to those of British subjects.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; FitzRoy was sympathetic to their pleas and decided to waive the pre-emption clause in 1844, allowing land sales directly to individuals.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

FitzRoy's successor [[George Grey]] was appointed Governor in 1845. He viewed the 'Protectors' as an impediment to land acquisition and replaced them with new officials whose goals were not to protect Māori interests, but rather to purchase as much land as possible.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt; Grey restored pre-emption by passing the [[List of statutes of New Zealand (1840–90)|Native Land Purchase Act]] in 1846, which contemporary writers viewed as a "first step towards a negation of the Treaty of Waitangi".&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; This ordinance also tightened government control of Māori lands, prohibiting Māori from leasing their land and restricting the felling of timber and harvesting of flax.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; A high court case in 1847 ([[R v Symonds]]) upheld the Crown's right to pre-emption, and allowed Grey to renegotiate deals made under Fitzroy's waiving of the pre-emption clause.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''R v Symonds'' (1847) NZPCC 388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Governor Grey set out to buy large tracts of Māori land in advance of settlement at low prices, later selling it to settlers at higher prices and using the difference to develop land access (roads and bridges).&lt;ref name="Donald McLean" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt; Donald McLean acted as Grey's intermediary and negotiator, and as early as 1840 was aware that Māori had no concept of the sale of land in British sense.&lt;ref name="Donald McLean" /&gt; Soon Māori became disillusioned and less willing to sell, while the Crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy.&lt;ref name="Donald McLean" /&gt; Consequently, government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases, agreements were sometimes negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased from the wrong people altogether.&lt;ref name="Donald McLean" /&gt; The whole of the South Island was purchased by 1860 in several large deals, and while many of the sales included provisions of 10 percent of the land set aside for native inhabitants, these land area amounts were not honoured or were later transmuted to much smaller numbers.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt; In some cases Grey or his associates bullied the owners into selling by threatening to drive them out with troops or employ rival chiefs to do so.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt;

The growing discontent over sovereignty of the country led to several minor skirmishes and disputes through the 1840s, in which the government cracked down on dissidents.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; The [[Māori King Movement]] (''Kīngitanga'') began in the 1850s partly as a means of focusing Māori power in a manner which would allow them to negotiate with the Governor and Queen on equal footing. Chiefs justified the King's role by the Treaty's guarantee of ''rangatiratanga'' (chieftainship).&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; Tensions continued to escalate in the early 1860s, when the government used the Maori King movement as an excuse to invade lands in the eastern parts of the North Island, culminating in the [[New Zealand land confiscations|Crown's confiscation]] of large parts of the [[Waikato]] and [[Taranaki]] from the Māori there.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Wars"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/new-zealands-19th-century-wars/introduction |title=New Zealand's 19th-century wars |date=15 August 2015 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=25 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706044724/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/new-zealands-19th-century-wars/introduction |archivedate=6 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; The armed conflicts eventually became known as the [[New Zealand Wars]].

In July 1860, during the conflicts, Governor Thomas Gore Browne convened a group of some 200 Māori (including over 100 Chiefs) to discuss the Treaty and land at Kohimarama, Auckland. This became known as the Kohimarama Conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paterson|first=Lachy|date=2011|title=The Kohimärama Conference of 1860: A Contextual Reading|url=https://ojs.victoria.ac.nz/jnzs/article/view/487/619|journal=Journal of New Zealand Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an attempt to prevent the spread of fighting to other regions of New Zealand. Those at the conference reaffirmed the Treaty and the Queen's sovereignty, and suggested that a native council be established, but this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/treaty-timeline/treaty-events-1850-99 |title=Treaty events 1850–99 – Treaty timeline  |date=17 May 2017 |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |language=en |access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/36360/kohimarama-conference-1860 |title=Treaty of Waitangi – Dishonouring the treaty – 1860 to 1880 – Kohimarama conference, 1860 |last=Orange |first=Claudia |date=20 June 2012 |website=teara.govt.nz |publisher=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |language=en |access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Māori Land Court|Native Land Court]] (later renamed the Māori Land Court) was established under the Native Land Court Act of 1862, which also finally abolished the Crown right to pre-emption. It was through this court that much Māori land was alienated, and the way in which it functioned is much criticised today.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt; A single member of a tribal group could claim ownership of communal tribal land, which would trigger a court battle in which other tribal members were forced to participate in, or else lose out.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt; The accumulation of court fees, lawyers fees, survey costs, and the cost of travelling to attend court proceedings resulted in mounting debts that could only be paid by the eventual sale of the land.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt; In effect, Māori were safe from the court only until a single tribal member broke ranks and triggered a case, which would invariably result in sale of the land.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt; By the end of the century, nearly all of the highest quality Māori land had been sold, with only two million hectares remaining in Māori possession.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt;

Although the Treaty had never been incorporated into New Zealand [[municipal law]],&lt;ref name="palmer" /&gt; its provisions were first incorporated into legislation as early as the Land Claims Ordinance 1841 and the Native Rights Act 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Nigel J. (2004), ''Talking Through the Treaty – Truly a Case of Pokarekare Ana or Troubled Waters'', New Zealand Association for Comparative Law Yearbook 10&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1877 ''[[Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington]]'' judgement, Judge Prendergast argued that the Treaty was a 'simple nullity' in terms of transferring sovereignty from Māori to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington (1877) 3 NZ Jurist Reports (NS) Supreme Court, p72.&lt;/ref&gt; This remained the legal orthodoxy until at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Robinson, 'Simple Nullity or Birth of Law and Order? The Treaty of Waitangi in Legal and Historiographical Discourse from 1877 to 1970', ''NZ Universities Law Review'', 24, 2 (2010), p262.&lt;/ref&gt; Māori have since argued that Prendergast's decision, as well as laws later based on it were a politically convenient and deliberate ploy to legitimise the seizure of Māori land and other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=sdhBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=inauthor:%2522Hiwi+Tauroa%2522&amp;dq=inauthor:%2522Hiwi+Tauroa%2522&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeluD4zevYAhUIS7wKHYr5CikQ6AEIMjAC |title=Healing the Breach: One Maori's Perspective on the Treaty of Waitangi |last=Tauroa |first=Hiwi |date=1989 |publisher=Collins New Zealand |isbn=9781869500078 |pages=26, 27, 28 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072248/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=sdhBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=inauthor:%2522Hiwi+Tauroa%2522&amp;dq=inauthor:%2522Hiwi+Tauroa%2522&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeluD4zevYAhUIS7wKHYr5CikQ6AEIMjAC |archivedate=23 January 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Māori frequently used the Treaty to argue for a range of demands, including greater independence and return of confiscated and unfairly purchased land.&lt;ref name="First Decades4" /&gt; This was especially the case from the mid-19th century, when they lost numerical superiority and generally lost control of most of the country and had little representation in government or the councils where decisions that impacted their affairs were made.&lt;ref name="First Decades4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt; Simultaneously, Māori rights over fisheries (guaranteed in article 2 of the Treaty) were similarly degraded by laws passed in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Walker 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

Over the longer term, the land purchase aspect of the Treaty declined in importance, while the clauses of the Treaty which deal with sovereignty and Māori rights took on greater importance.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; In 1938, the judgement of the case ''Te Heuheu Tukino v Aotea District Maori Land Board'' considered the Treaty as valid in terms of the transfer of sovereignty, but the judge ruled that as it was not part of New Zealand law it was not binding on the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Robin |date=1994 |title=The Harkness Henry lecture: the challenge of Treaty of Waitangi jurisprudence |url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/law/research/waikato_law_review/pubs/volume_2_1994/2 |journal=Waikato Law Review |volume=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720060441/http://www.waikato.ac.nz/law/research/waikato_law_review/pubs/volume_2_1994/2 |archivedate=20 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treaty returned to the public eye after the [[Treaty House]] and grounds were purchased by the Governor-General, [[Viscount Bledisloe]], in the early 1930s and donated to the nation.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; The dedication of the site as a national reserve in 1934 was probably the first major event held there since the 1840s. The profile of the Treaty was further raised by the centenary of 1940.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; For most of the twentieth century, text books, government publicity and many historians touted the Treaty as the moral foundation of colonisation and argued that it set [[race relations]] in New Zealand above those of colonies in North America, Africa and Australia.&lt;ref name="Treaty Debated"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-practice/the-treaty-debated |title=The Treaty debated |date=7 July 2015 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=25 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819232504/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-practice/the-treaty-debated |archivedate=19 August 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was some popular acceptance of the idea that the Treaty transferred sovereignty since the early twentieth century. Popular histories of New Zealand and the Treaty often claimed that the Treaty was an example of British benevolence and therefore an honourable contract.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 'Simple Nullity or Birth of Law and Order?', p264.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though Māori continued to challenge this narrative,&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt; its lack of legal significance in 1840 and subsequent breaches tended to be overlooked until the 1970s, when these issues were raised by the [[Māori protest movement]].&lt;ref name="Treaty Debated" /&gt;

===Resurgence and place in New Zealand Law (1960–present)===
The [[Waitangi Day Act]] of 1960 was a token gesture towards acknowledging the Treaty of Waitangi, and somewhat proceeded the Māori protest movement as a whole. It established [[Waitangi Day]], although it did not make it a public holiday, and the English text of the Treaty appeared as a schedule of the Waitangi Day Act but this did not make it a part of statute law. Subsequent amendments to the Act, as well as other legislation, eventually acquiesced to campaigns to make Waitangi Day a national holiday in 1976.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

During the late 1960s and 1970s, the Treaty of Waitangi became the focus of a strong Māori protest movement which rallied around calls for the government to "honour the treaty" and to "redress treaty grievances."&lt;ref name="Maori Protests" /&gt; Maori boycotted Waitangi Day in 1968 over the [[Māori protest movement#The Māori Affairs Amendment Act|Māori Affairs Amendment Act]] (which was perceived as a further land grab) and Māori expressed their frustration about continuing violations of the treaty and subsequent legislation by government officials, as well as inequitable legislation and unsympathetic decisions by the Māori Land Court continuing alienation of Māori land from its owners.&lt;ref name="Maori Protests"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/nga-ropu-tautohetohe-maori-protest-movements/page-1 |title=Ngā rōpū tautohetohe – Māori protest movements |last=Keane |first=Basil |date=20 June 2012 |website=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=23 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814054727/https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/nga-ropu-tautohetohe-maori-protest-movements/page-1 |archivedate=14 August 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest movement can be seen as part of the worldwide [[civil rights movement]], which emerged in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Orange 2011" /&gt;

As a response to the protest movement, the Treaty finally received limited recognition in 1975 with the passage of the [[Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975]], which established the [[Waitangi Tribunal]], but this initially had very limited powers to make findings of facts and recommendations only.&lt;ref name="NZhistory Treaty Debated"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-practice/the-treaty-debated | title=The Treaty in practice: Page 6 – The Treaty Debated | work=NZHistory.net.nz | date=7 July 2014 | accessdate=16 February 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210135046/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-practice/the-treaty-debated | archivedate=10 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was amended in 1985 to enable it to investigate Treaty breaches back to 1840,&lt;ref name="NZhistory Treaty Debated" /&gt; and also to increase the Tribunal membership. The membership was further increased in another amendment in 1988.&lt;ref name="Palmer Maori law review" /&gt;

The Treaty was incorporated in a limited way into New Zealand law by the [[State-owned enterprises of New Zealand|State Owned Enterprises]] Act 1986. Section 9 of the act said "Nothing in this Act shall permit the Crown to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi".&lt;ref name="state owned enterprises"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/state-owned-enterprises/page-2 |title=State-owned enterprises |last=Laking |first=Rob |date=17 February 2017 |website=Te Ara |access-date=25 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618072053/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/state-owned-enterprises/page-2 |archivedate=18 June 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government had proposed a transfer of assets from former Government departments to [[State-owned enterprises of New Zealand|state-owned enterprises]], but because the state-owned enterprises were essentially private firms owned by the government, there was an argument that they would prevent assets which had been given by Māori for use by the state from being returned to Māori by the Waitangi Tribunal and through Treaty settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0124/latest/whole.html#DLM98028|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|accessdate=12 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220122401/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0124/latest/whole.html#DLM98028|archivedate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was challenged in court in 1987, and the judgement of ''[[New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General]]''
defined the "Principles of the Treaty" and the proposed sale of government assets was found to be in breach of this proviso. This allowed the courts to consider the Crown's actions in terms of compliance with the Treaty and established the principle that if the Treaty is mentioned in strong terms in a piece of legislation, it takes precedence over other parts of that legislation should they come into conflict.&lt;ref name="state owned enterprises" /&gt; The "[[Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi|Principles of the Treaty]]" became a common topic in contemporary New Zealand politics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=He Tirohanga ō Kawa ki te Tiriti o Waitangi: a guide to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi as expressed by the Courts and the Waitangi Tribunal |publisher=Te Puni Kokiri |year=2001 |url=https://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/a-matou-mohiotanga/crownmaori-relations/he-tirohanga-o-kawa-ki-te-tiriti-o-waitangi |accessdate=12 August 2012 |isbn=0-478-09193-1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123090454/http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/a-matou-mohiotanga/crownmaori-relations/he-tirohanga-o-kawa-ki-te-tiriti-o-waitangi |archivedate=23 January 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1989, the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] responded by adopting the ''"Principles for Crown Action on the Treaty of Waitangi"'' a similar list of principles to that established in the 1987 court case.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | title=Principles for Crown Action on the Treaty of Waitangi, 1989 | publisher=Treaty of Waitangi Research Unit, Victoria University of Wellington | year=2011 | location=Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation after the State Owned Enterprises case has followed suit in giving the Treaty an increased legal importance.&lt;ref name="Palmer Maori law review" /&gt; In ''New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney General'' (1990) the case concerned FM radio frequencies and found that the Treaty could be relevant even concerning legislation which did not mention it and that even if references to the Treaty were removed from legislation, the Treaty may still be legally relevant.&lt;ref name="Mason Durie"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Te mana te kāwanatanga = the Politics of Māori Self-Determination |last=Durie |first=Mason |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780195583670 |location=Auckland |pages=179, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waitangi Tribunal claim6"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/waitangi-tribunal-claim |title=Waitangi Tribunal claim |date=8 December 2016 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=26 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707215921/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/waitangi-tribunal-claim |archivedate=7 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the ownership of the radio spectrum and the protection of the [[Māori language]].&lt;ref name="Mason Durie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waitangi Tribunal claim6"/&gt;

Some have argued that the Treaty should be further incorporated as a part of the New Zealand constitution, to help improve relations between the Crown, Māori and other New Zealanders.&lt;ref name="palmer" /&gt; The Fourth Labour Government's ''Bill of Rights White Paper'' proposed that the Treaty be entrenched in the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]. However, this proposal was never carried through to the legislation, with the attitude of many Māori towards it "suspicious, uneasy, doubtful or undecided."&lt;ref name="Palmer Maori law review"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2013/06/maori-the-treaty-and-the-constitution-rt-hon-sir-geoffrey-palmer-qc/ | title=Māori, the Treaty and the Constitution – Rt.

During the 1990s there was broad agreement between major political parties that the settlement of historical claims was appropriate. Some disagreed however, and claims of a "Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry", which profits from making frivolous claims of violations of the Treaty of Waitangi, were made by a number of political figures in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including former National Party leader [[Don Brash]] in his 2004 "[[Orewa Speech]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=aORaAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq |title=The Treaty of Waitangi Companion: Maori and Pakeha from Tasman to Today |last=O'Malley |first=Vincent |publisher=Auckland University Press |year=2010 |isbn=9781869406813 |pages=391–398 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124195702/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=aORaAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq |archivedate=24 January 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orewaspeech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0401/S00220.htm |title=NATIONHOOD – Don Brash Speech Orewa Rotary Club |last=Dr [[Donald Brash]] |date=27 January 2004 |access-date=20 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103621/http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0401/S00220.htm |archivedate=14 May 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3550487 |title=Non-Maori say they've had enough |last=Cumming |first=Geoff |date=4 February 2004 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Deletion Bill" was introduced in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] in 2005 as a [[private member's bill]] by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Doug Woolerton]].

Treaty Settlements minister [[Chris Finlayson]] emphasised that: "The Tribunal doesn't reach any conclusion regarding the sovereignty the Crown exercises in New Zealand. Nor does it address the other events considered part of the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty or how the Treaty relationship should operate today".&lt;ref name="Never gave up sovereignty"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/northland-age/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503402&amp;objectid=11360308 | title=Ngapuhi 'never gave up sovereignty' | work=The Northland Age | date=18 November 2014 | accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommendations of the Tribunal are not binding on the Crown, but have often been followed.&lt;ref name="Settlements" /&gt;

The anniversary of the signing of the Treaty – 6 February – is the New Zealand [[national day]], [[Waitangi Day]]. The day was first commemorated in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day|title=Waitangi Day – Introduction|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the site of the original signing, [[Treaty House]], was made a public reserve (along with its grounds).&lt;ref name="treaty house" /&gt; However, it was not until 1974 that the date was made a [[Public holidays in New Zealand|public holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day|accessdate=9 February 2017|title=Waitangi Day – Introduction|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210033650/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day|archivedate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/waitangi-day-1940s-50s|accessdate=8 February 2017|title=Waitangi Day 1940s–1950s|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208134029/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/waitangi-day-1940s-50s|archivedate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waitangi Day has been the focus of [[Māori protest movement|protest by Māori]] (as was particularly the case from the 1970s through to the 1990s), but today the day is often used as an opportunity to discuss the history and lasting effects of the Treaty.&lt;ref name="Waitangi Day 1970s"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/waitangi-day-1970s |title=Waitangi Day 1970s |date=5 July 2014 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=26 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008080132/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/waitangi-day-1970s |archivedate=8 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waitangi Day 21sts"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/21st-century-waitangi-day |title=Waitangi Day in the 21st century |date=5 July 2014 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=14 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014133138/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/21st-century-waitangi-day |archivedate=14 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anniversary is officially commemorated at the [[Treaty House]] at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]], where it was first signed.&lt;ref name="treaty house"/&gt;

===Commemorative stamps===
In 1940, New Zealand issued a 2{{fraction|1|2}}d stamp recognising the centenary of the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Treaty Of Waitangi |url=https://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/128659-Treaty_Of_Waitangi-Centennial-New_Zealand |website=Colnect |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Zealand Post]] issued a [[miniature sheet]] of two stamps in 1990 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Treaty of Waitangi |url=https://stamps.nzpost.co.nz/new-zealand/1990/treaty-waitangi |website=New Zealand Post |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Virtual Private Network overview.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|VPN connectivity overview]]
A '''virtual private network''' ('''VPN''') extends a [[private network]] across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mason, Andrew G. |title=Cisco Secure Virtual Private Network |publisher= Cisco Press |date= 2002 |page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VPN technology was developed to allow remote users and branch offices to access corporate applications and resources. To ensure security, the private network connection is established using an encrypted layered tunneling protocol and VPN users use authentication methods, including passwords or certificates, to gain access to the VPN. In other applications, Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent [[Geo-blocking|geo-restrictions]] and [[censorship]], or to connect to [[proxy server]]s to protect personal identity and location to stay anonymous on the Internet. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions, and many VPN providers have been developing strategies to get around these roadblocks.

A VPN is created by establishing a virtual [[point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] connection through the use of dedicated connections, virtual [[tunneling protocol]]s, or traffic [[encryption]]. A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a [[wide area network]] (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Microsoft Technet]] |title= Virtual Private Networking: An Overview |url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx |date=September 4, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional VPNs are characterized by a point-to-point topology, and they tend not to support or connect [[broadcast domain]]s, so services such as [[Microsoft Windows]] [[NetBIOS]] may not be fully supported or work as they would on a [[local area network]] (LAN). Designers have developed VPN variants, such as [[Virtual Private LAN Service]] (VPLS), and [[Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol]]s (L2TP), to overcome this limitation.

==Types==
Early data networks allowed VPN-style connections to remote sites through [[dial-up modem]] or through [[leased line]] connections utilizing [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) virtual circuits, provided through networks owned and operated by [[Telephone company|telecommunication carriers]]. These networks are not considered true VPNs because they passively secure the data being transmitted by the creation of logical data streams.&lt;ref&gt;Cisco Systems, et al. ''Internet working Technologies Handbook, Third Edition''. Cisco Press, 2000, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been replaced by VPNs based on IP and IP/[[Multiprotocol Label Switching|Multi-protocol Label Switching]] (MPLS) Networks, due to significant cost-reductions and increased bandwidth&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Mark. ''Comparing, Designing. And Deploying VPNs''. Cisco Press, 2006, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; provided by new technologies such as digital subscriber line (DSL)&lt;ref&gt;International Engineering Consortium. ''Digital Subscriber Line 2001''. Intl. Engineering Consortium, 2001, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and fiber-optic networks.

VPNs can be either remote-access (connecting a computer to a network) or site-to-site (connecting two networks). In a corporate setting, remote-access VPNs allow employees to access their company's [[intranet]] from home or while traveling outside the office, and site-to-site VPNs allow employees in geographically disparate offices to share one cohesive virtual network. A VPN can also be used to interconnect two similar networks over a dissimilar middle network; for example, two [[IPv6]] networks over an [[IPv4]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Technet Lab |title=IPv6 traffic over VPN connections |url=http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615203602/http://lab.technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc138002 |archivedate=15 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VPN systems may be classified by:
* the tunneling protocol used to [[IP tunnel|tunnel]] the traffic
* the tunnel's termination point location, e.g., on the customer [[Edge device|edge]] or network-provider edge
* the type of topology of connections, such as site-to-site or network-to-network
* the levels of security provided
* the [[OSI model|OSI layer]] they present to the connecting network, such as Layer 2 circuits or Layer 3 network connectivity
* the number of simultaneous connections.

==Security mechanisms==
VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and [[Encryption software|encryption]] techniques.

The VPN security model provides:
* [[Information security#Confidentiality|confidentiality]] such that even if the network traffic is sniffed at the packet level (see [[Packet analyzer|network sniffer]] and [[deep packet inspection]]), an attacker would see only [[Encryption|encrypted data]]
* sender [[authentication]] to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the VPN
* message [[Data integrity|integrity]] to detect any instances of tampering with transmitted messages.

Secure VPN protocols include the following:
* [[Internet Protocol Security]] ([[Internet Protocol Security|IPsec]]) was initially developed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) for [[IPv6]], which was required in all standards-compliant implementations of [[IPv6]] before {{IETF RFC|6434}} made it only a recommendation.&lt;ref name=rfc6434&gt;{{IETF RFC|6434}}, "IPv6 Node Requirements", E. Jankiewicz, J. Loughney, T. Narten (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This standards-based security protocol is also widely used with [[IPv4]] and the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol. Its design meets most security goals: authentication, integrity, and confidentiality. IPsec uses encryption, encapsulating an IP packet inside an IPsec packet. De-encapsulation happens at the end of the tunnel, where the original IP packet is decrypted and forwarded to its intended destination.
* [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]]) can tunnel an entire network's traffic (as it does in the [[OpenVPN]] project and [[SoftEther VPN]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softether.org/1-features/1._Ultimate_Powerful_VPN_Connectivity#SoftEther_VPN's_Solution:_Using_HTTPS_Protocol_to_Establish_VPN_Tunnels|title=1. Ultimate Powerful VPN Connectivity |publisher=SoftEther VPN Project|website=www.softether.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or secure an individual connection. A number of vendors provide remote-access VPN capabilities through SSL. An SSL VPN can connect from locations where IPsec runs into trouble with [[Network Address Translation]] and firewall rules.
* [[Datagram Transport Layer Security]] ([[Datagram Transport Layer Security|DTLS]]) – used in Cisco [[AnyConnect]] VPN and in [[OpenConnect]] VPN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/index.html |title = OpenConnect |accessdate =2013-04-08 |quote =&lt;nowiki&gt;OpenConnect is a client for Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN [...] OpenConnect is not officially supported by, or associated in any way with, Cisco Systems. It just happens to interoperate with their equipment.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt; to solve the issues [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] has with tunneling over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]  (tunneling TCP over TCP can lead to big delays and connection aborts &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html|title=Why TCP Over TCP Is A Bad Idea|website=sites.inka.de|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
* [[Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption]] ([[Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption|MPPE]]) works with the [[Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol]] and in several compatible implementations on other platforms.
* Microsoft [[Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol]] ([[Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol|SSTP]]) tunnels [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP) or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol traffic through an [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] 3.0 channel (SSTP was introduced in [[Windows Server 2008]] and in [[Windows Vista]] Service Pack 1).
* Multi Path Virtual Private Network (MPVPN). Ragula Systems Development Company owns the registered [[trademark]] "MPVPN".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78063238&amp;action=Request+Status|title=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval|website=tarr.uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Secure Shell (SSH) VPN – [[OpenSSH]] offers VPN tunneling (distinct from [[port forwarding]]) to secure remote connections to a network or to inter-network links. OpenSSH server provides a limited number of concurrent tunnels. The VPN feature itself does not support personal authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1#SSH-BASED_VIRTUAL_PRIVATE_NETWORKS|title=ssh(1) – OpenBSD manual pages|website=man.openbsd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cb.vu/unixtoolbox.xhtml#vpn|title=Unix Toolbox|first=Colin Barschel|last=c@cb.vu|website=cb.vu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH_VPN|title=SSH_VPN – Community Help Wiki|website=help.ubuntu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authentication===
Tunnel endpoints must be authenticated before secure VPN tunnels can be established. User-created remote-access VPNs may use [[passwords]], [[biometrics]], [[two-factor authentication]] or other [[cryptographic]] methods. Network-to-network tunnels often use passwords or [[digital certificates]]. They permanently store the key to allow the tunnel to establish automatically, without intervention from the administrator.

==Routing==
Tunneling protocols can operate in a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[network topology]] that would theoretically not be considered as a VPN, because a VPN by definition is expected to support arbitrary and changing sets of network nodes. But since most [[Router (computing)|router]] implementations support a software-defined tunnel interface, customer-provisioned VPNs often are simply defined tunnels running conventional routing protocols.

===Provider-provisioned VPN building-blocks===
Depending on whether a provider-provisioned VPN (PPVPN) operates in layer 2 or layer 3, the building blocks described below may be L2 only, L3 only, or combine them both. [[Multiprotocol label switching|Multi-protocol label switching]] (MPLS) functionality blurs the L2-L3 identity.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}{{original research inline|date=June 2013}}

{{IETF RFC|4026}} generalized the following terms to cover L2 and L3 VPNs, but they were introduced in {{IETF RFC|2547}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2547.txt |rfc=2547 |title=BGP/MPLS VPNs |author=E. Rosen &amp; Y. Rekhter |date=March 1999 |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) }}&lt;/ref&gt; More information on the devices below can also be found in Lewis, Cisco Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Mark|title=Comparing, designing, and deploying VPNs|year=2006|publisher=Cisco Press|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|isbn=1587051796|pages=5–6|edition=1st print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Customer (C) devices
A device that is within a customer's network and not directly connected to the service provider's network. C devices are not aware of the VPN.

; Customer Edge device (CE)
A device at the edge of the customer's network which provides access to the PPVPN. Sometimes it is just a demarcation point between provider and customer responsibility. Other providers allow customers to configure it.

; Provider edge device (PE)
A PE is a device, or set of devices, at the edge of the provider network which connects to customer networks through CE devices and presents the provider's view of the customer site. PEs are aware of the VPNs that connect through them, and maintain VPN state.

; Provider device (P)
A P device operates inside the provider's core network and does not directly interface to any customer endpoint. It might, for example, provide routing for many provider-operated tunnels that belong to different customers' PPVPNs. While the P device is a key part of implementing PPVPNs, it is not itself VPN-aware and does not maintain VPN state. Its principal role is allowing the service provider to scale its PPVPN offerings, for example, by acting as an aggregation point for multiple PEs. P-to-P connections, in such a role, often are high-capacity optical links between major locations of providers.

==User-visible PPVPN services==
===OSI Layer 2 services===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
;Virtual LAN
[[Virtual LAN]] (VLAN) is a Layer 2 technique that allow for the coexistence of multiple [[local area network]] (LAN) broadcast domains, interconnected via trunks using the [[IEEE 802.1Q]] trunking protocol. Other trunking protocols have been used but have become obsolete, including Inter-Switch Link (ISL), IEEE 802.10 (originally a security protocol but a subset was introduced for trunking), and ATM LAN Emulation (LANE).

;Virtual private LAN service (VPLS)
Developed by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[Virtual LAN]]s (VLANs) allow multiple tagged LANs to share common trunking. VLANs frequently comprise only customer-owned facilities. Whereas VPLS as described in the above section (OSI Layer 1 services) supports emulation of both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint topologies, the method discussed here extends Layer 2 technologies such as [[802.1d]] and [[802.1q]] LAN trunking to run over transports such as [[Metro Ethernet]].

As used in this context, a [[VPLS]] is a Layer 2 PPVPN, emulating the full functionality of a traditional LAN. From a user standpoint, a VPLS makes it possible to interconnect several LAN segments over a packet-switched, or optical, provider core; a core transparent to the user, making the remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/howto-openvpn-as/214-how-to-setup-layer-2-ethernet-bridging.html |title=Ethernet Bridging (OpenVPN)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a VPLS, the provider network emulates a learning bridge, which optionally may include VLAN service.

;Pseudo wire (PW)
PW is similar to VPLS, but it can provide different L2 protocols at both ends. Typically, its interface is a WAN protocol such as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] or [[Frame Relay]]. In contrast, when aiming to provide the appearance of a LAN contiguous between two or more locations, the Virtual Private LAN service or IPLS would be appropriate.

; Ethernet over IP tunneling
EtherIP ({{IETF RFC|3378}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3378|title=EtherIP: Tunneling Ethernet Frames in IP Datagrams|first1=Scott|last1=Hollenbeck|first2=Russell|last2=Housley|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Ethernet over IP tunneling protocol specification. EtherIP has only packet encapsulation mechanism. It has no confidentiality nor message integrity protection. EtherIP was introduced in the [[FreeBSD]] network stack&lt;ref&gt;Glyn M Burton: [https://securethoughts.com/9-rfc-3378-etherip-with-freebsd/ RFC 3378  EtherIP with FreeBSD], 03 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SoftEther VPN]]&lt;ref name="net-security.org"&gt;net-security.org news: [http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=16171 Multi-protocol SoftEther VPN becomes open source], January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; server program.

;IP-only LAN-like service (IPLS)
A subset of VPLS, the CE devices must have Layer 3 capabilities; the IPLS presents packets rather than frames. It may support IPv4 or IPv6.

===OSI Layer 3 PPVPN architectures===
This section discusses the main architectures for PPVPNs, one where the PE disambiguates duplicate addresses in a single routing instance, and the other, virtual router, in which the PE contains a virtual router instance per VPN. The former approach, and its variants, have gained the most attention.

One of the challenges of PPVPNs involves different customers using the same address space, especially the IPv4 private address space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt Address Allocation for Private Internets], {{IETF RFC|1918}}, Y. Rekhter ''et al.'', February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The provider must be able to disambiguate overlapping addresses in the multiple customers' PPVPNs.

;BGP/MPLS PPVPN
In the method defined by {{IETF RFC|2547}}, BGP extensions advertise routes in the IPv4 VPN address family, which are of the form of 12-byte strings, beginning with an 8-byte [[route distinguisher]] (RD) and ending with a 4-byte IPv4 address. RDs disambiguate otherwise duplicate addresses in the same PE.

PEs understand the topology of each VPN, which are interconnected with MPLS tunnels, either directly or via P routers. In MPLS terminology, the P routers are [[Label Switch Router]]s without awareness of VPNs.

;Virtual router PPVPN
The virtual router architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|2917}}, ''A Core MPLS IP VPN Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|2918}}, E. Chen (September 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to BGP/MPLS techniques, requires no modification to existing routing protocols such as BGP. By the provisioning of logically independent routing domains, the customer operating a VPN is completely responsible for the address space. In the various MPLS tunnels, the different PPVPNs are disambiguated by their label, but do not need routing distinguishers.

===Unencrypted tunnels===
Some virtual networks use tunneling protocols without encryption for protecting the privacy of data. While VPNs often do provide security, an unencrypted [[overlay network]] does not neatly fit within the secure or trusted categorization.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} For example, a tunnel set up between two hosts with [[Generic Routing Encapsulation]] (GRE) is a virtual private network, but neither secure nor trusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview of Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN) |url=https://securethoughts.com/overview-provider-provisioned-virtual-private-networks-ppvpn/ |publisher=Secure Thoughts |accessdate = 29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|1702}}: Generic Routing Encapsulation over IPv4 networks. October 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Native [[plaintext]] tunneling protocols include Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) when it is set up without [[IPsec]] and [[Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol]] (PPTP) or [[Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption]] (MPPE).&lt;ref&gt;IETF (1999), {{IETF RFC|2661}}, Layer Two Tunneling Protocol "L2TP"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trusted delivery networks==
Trusted VPNs do not use cryptographic tunneling, and instead rely on the security of a single provider's network to protect the traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Multi-Protocol Label Switching]] (MPLS) often overlays VPNs, often with quality-of-service control over a trusted delivery network.
* L2TP&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2661.txt Layer Two Tunneling Protocol "L2TP"], {{IETF RFC|2661}}, W. Townsley ''et al.'', August 1999&lt;/ref&gt; which is a standards-based replacement, and a compromise taking the good features from each, for two proprietary VPN protocols: Cisco's [[L2F|Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2341.txt IP Based Virtual Private Networks], {{IETF RFC|2341}}, A. Valencia ''et al.'', May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; (obsolete {{As of | 2009 | alt =as of 2009}}) and Microsoft's [[Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol|Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2637.txt Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)], {{IETF RFC|2637}}, K. Hamzeh ''et al.'', July 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

From the security standpoint, VPNs either trust the underlying delivery network, or must enforce security with mechanisms in the VPN itself. Unless the trusted delivery network runs among physically secure sites only, both trusted and secure models need an authentication mechanism for users to gain access to the VPN.

==VPNs in mobile environments==
Users utilize [[mobile virtual private network]]s in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single [[IP address spoofing|IP address]], but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple [[Wi-Fi]] access points.&lt;ref name="Phifer"&gt;Phifer, Lisa. [http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid40_gci1210989_mem1,00.html "Mobile VPN: Closing the Gap"], ''SearchMobileComputing.com'', July 16, 2006. &lt;!--accessed November 10, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile VPNs have been widely used in [[public safety]], where they give law-enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as [[computer-assisted dispatch]] and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.&lt;ref&gt;Willett, Andy. [http://www.officer.com/print/Law-Enforcement-Technology/Solving-the-Computing-Challenges-of-Mobile-Officers/1$30992 "Solving the Computing Challenges of Mobile Officers"], ''www.officer.com'', May, 2006. &lt;!--accessed November 10, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Field service management]] and by healthcare organizations,&lt;ref name="Cheng"&gt;
Cheng, Roger. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119717610996418467 "Lost Connections"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', December 11, 2007. &lt;!--accessed November 10, 2009--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2018}}
among other industries, also make use of them.

Increasingly, mobile [[professional]]s who need reliable connections are adopting mobile VPNs.&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;{{qn|date=June 2018}} They are used for roaming seamlessly across networks and in and out of wireless coverage areas without losing application sessions or dropping the secure VPN session. A conventional VPN can not withstand such events because the [[network tunnel]] is disrupted, causing applications to disconnect, time out,&lt;ref name="Phifer"/&gt; or fail, or even cause the computing device itself to [[crash (computing)|crash]].&lt;ref name="Cheng"/&gt;

Instead of logically tying the endpoint of the network tunnel to the physical IP address, each tunnel is bound to a permanently associated IP address at the device. The mobile VPN software handles the necessary network-authentication and maintains the network sessions in a manner transparent to the application and to the user.&lt;ref name="Phifer"/&gt; The [[Host Identity Protocol]] (HIP), under study by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]], is designed to support mobility of hosts by separating the role of [[IP address]]es for host identification from their locator functionality in an IP network. With HIP a mobile host maintains its logical connections established via the host identity identifier while associating with different IP addresses when roaming between access networks.

==VPN on routers==
With the increasing use of VPNs, many have started deploying VPN connectivity on routers for additional security and encryption of data transmission by using various cryptographic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Encryption and Security Protocols in a VPN|url = http://computer.howstuffworks.com/vpn7.htm|accessdate = 2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home users usually deploy VPNs on their routers to protect devices, such as [[smart TV]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or [[Video game console|gaming consoles]], which are not supported by native VPN clients. Supported devices are not restricted to those capable of running a VPN client.&lt;ref name=draytek&gt;{{cite web |title=VPN |website=Draytek |date= |url=http://www.draytek.co.uk/information/our-technology/vpn-overview |author= |accessdate= 19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many router manufacturers supply routers with built-in VPN clients. Some use open-source firmware such as [[DD-WRT]], [[OpenWRT]] and [[Tomato (firmware)|Tomato]], in order to support additional protocols such as [[OpenVPN]].

Setting up VPN services on a router requires a deep knowledge of network security and careful installation. Minor misconfiguration of VPN connections can leave the network vulnerable. Performance will vary depending on the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/answer/How-can-incorrectly-configuring-VPN-clients-lead-to-a-security-breach|title=How can incorrectly configuring VPN clients lead to a security breach?|work=SearchEnterpriseWAN|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Networking limitations==
One major limitation of traditional VPNs is that they are point-to-point, and do not tend to support or connect [[broadcast domain]]s. Therefore, communication, software, and networking, which are based on [[OSI layer|layer 2]] and broadcast [[Network packet|packets]], such as [[NetBIOS]] used in [[My Network Places|Windows networking]], may not be fully supported or work exactly as they would on a real [[Local area network|LAN]]. Variants on VPN, such as [[Virtual Private LAN Service]] (VPLS), and layer 2 tunneling protocols, are designed to overcome this limitation.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

A VPN connection may not be as robust as a direct connection to a network. A VPN connection depends on the VPN provider and the ISP. If either fails, the connection fails.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1852">'''The Williamsburg Charter''' is a document that was drafted in 1986 by several [[United States|Americans]], each a member of a prominent religious community and/or non-religious philosophy in the United States.  The Charter was signed by 100 nationally prominent figures on June 22, 1988, in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Virginia's call for a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]].  Among the signers were Presidents [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]; the late Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court [[William Rehnquist]]; the late activist [[Coretta Scott King]] (wife of slain civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Junior]]) and [[Focus on the Family]] founder [[James Dobson]]. The lead drafter was [[Os Guinness]].

The document is an affirmation for a lively and reasoned debate on the role of [[religion]] in the public life of the United States.  Its primary focus is on the [[Establishment Clause]] and [[Free Exercise Clause]], contained within the first amendment of the [[United States Constitution]], and the goal of the writers is to "affirm both their cardinal assumptions and the reasons for their crucial national importance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/wil_burg.htm THE 1988 WILLIAMSBURG CHARTER ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The writers believe that the problems surrounding the religion clauses can only be solved by first understanding the nature of the clauses.  Among the points raised in the charter is that non-religious hostility towards religion is just as dangerous to a democracy as religious hostility towards non-religion or to other religions.
