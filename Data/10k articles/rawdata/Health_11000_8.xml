'''''A Counterblaste to Tobacco''''' is a [[treatise]] written by [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]] in 1604, in which he expresses his distaste for [[tobacco]], particularly [[tobacco smoking]].&lt;ref name="thecompleteguide"&gt;Steve Luck, ''The Complete Guide to Cigars: An Illustrated Guide to the World's Finest Cigars'', Bath, UK: Parragon, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is one of the earliest anti-tobacco publications. 

==Style and content==
It is written in [[Early Modern English]] and refers to medical theories of the time (e.g. the [[four humours]]).&lt;ref name=counterblaste&gt;[http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/james/blaste/ ''A Counterblaste to Tobacco'' (retrieved February 22, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; In it, James blames [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for bringing tobacco to Europe, complains about [[passive smoking]], warns of dangers to the [[lung]]s, and decries tobacco's odour as "hatefull to the nose."&lt;ref name=counterblaste/&gt;

==Effects and legacy==
James's dislike of tobacco led him in 1604{{r|ley196512}} to authorize [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset]], to levy an [[excise tax]] and [[tariff]] of six [[shilling]]s and eight [[pence]] per pound of tobacco [[import]]ed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/james/blaste/blaste.app.html''Commissio pro Tobacco'', James I, 1616]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or £1 per three pounds, a large sum of money for the time.

Because of continued high demand for tobacco in England and negative effects on the economies of the American colonies, the king in 1624 instead created a royal monopoly for the crop.&lt;ref name="ley196512"&gt;{{Cite magazine

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10648">The '''Abortion Caravan''' was a feminist protest movement formed in Canada in 1970 by members of the [[Vancouver Women's Caucus]]. It was created to oppose the 1969 amendments to the Criminal Code which restricted legal access to abortion. Members formed a caravan, emulating previous peripatetic protest movements, traveled from Vancouver to Ottawa and gathered support along the way. Hundreds of women across Canada engaged in protests at the Prime Minister's official residence, burning effigies and leaving a black coffin at the front door. These protests sparked wider debate and contributed to abortion laws being struck down in 1988.

==History==
In February 1970, members of the [[Vancouver Women's Caucus]] (VWC) (1968–1971) gathered to begin planning the Abortion Caravan, Canada's first national feminist protest.&lt;ref name="CPHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpha100.ca/12-great-achievements/fighting-good-fight-legalized-abortion-canada |title=Fighting the Good Fight: Legalized Abortion in Canada |publisher=Canadian Public Health Association |date=May 2010 |accessdate=April 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103224418/http://cpha100.ca/12-great-achievements/fighting-good-fight-legalized-abortion-canada |archivedate=January 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of VWC were part of [[New Left]] organizations and were either students or worked on university campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Stettner, Shannon.

The Abortion Caravan arrived in Ottawa on [[Mother's Day]] weekend 1970. A convoy of Canadian women, over five hundred strong in support, arrived - coat hangers and a black coffin in tow - to demand the [[Support for the legalization of abortion|legalization]] of unrestricted access to abortion services for all Canadian women.&lt;ref name="TenThousandRoses" /&gt;

Participants of the Abortion Caravan declared "war on the Government of Canada",&lt;ref name="TenThousandRoses" /&gt;  with hundreds of women from across Canada rallying for two days on [[Parliament Hill]]. At [[24 Sussex Drive]], the official residence of the Prime Minister, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] was burned in effigy.&lt;ref name="Ormsby"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/816511--the-abortion-caravan-succeeded-or-did-it | title=The 'Abortion Caravan' Succeeded.

On May 11, 1970, about 80 women donning black headscarves arrived at the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].

Just before 3 p.m., one of the women rose from her seat in the gallery and began reciting the Abortion Caravan's prepared speech, interrupting debate on the floor of the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="Gallop" /&gt; As parliamentary guards approached the woman, a second woman stood up in another area of the gallery and continued to give the group's speech. One by one, the women rose from their seats, adding their voices to the group's speech and chanting "free abortions on demand".&lt;ref name="Ormsby" /&gt;

As Parliamentary guards moved through the galleries apprehending the protesters and forcibly removing the women from their seats, one woman reportedly "hurled a water bomb at the government benches before being rushed by security officers and marched from the building"; other women had their chains "removed by bolt-cutting guards and were heckled by onlookers as they were escorted from House".&lt;ref name="Ormsby" /&gt;  The gallery disturbance caused by activists served as the climax of the Abortion Caravan, provoking the first adjournment of Parliament in its 103-year history, shutting down the House of Commons for over an hour.&lt;ref name="Conference"&gt;{{cite conference | title=The Fight for Reproductive Choice - The Vancouver Women's Caucus (Binder Sheet - Participant Manual) | publisher=Women's Conference | date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abortion Caravan brought national attention to the opposition to the 1969 amendments and the movement for “unrestricted access to legal abortion.”&lt;ref&gt;Stettner, Shannon and Christabelle Sethna, [http://activehistory.ca/2015/05/reassessing-the-abortion-caravan/ “Reassessing the Abortion Caravan.”] ''Activehistory.ca.''

==The "New Abortion Caravan"==
In 2012, a counter-protest movement was formed to highlight what they see as the injustice brought about by the original. On May 29, a team of young people set out re-tracing the steps of the 1970 Caravan. This team from the Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform (CCBR) used graphic images in order to force attention on what is being chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Abortion Caravan|url=https://www.endthekilling.ca/caravan|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program ('''BenMAP''') is an [[open source software|open source]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based computer program created by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] that estimates the health benefits from improvements in [[air quality]]. State, local and international users have used BenMAP to estimate the health benefits of improved air quality. BenMAP includes information users need to start performing a benefits analysis; advanced users can customize the program to meet their needs. Because BenMAP is based on a [[GIS]], the results can be mapped for ease of presentation.

BenMAP can be used for:
*Generation of population/community level ambient pollution exposure maps;
*Comparison of benefits across multiple regulatory programs;
*Estimation of health impacts associated with exposure to existing air pollution concentrations;
*Estimation of health benefits of alternative ambient air quality standards;
*Performance of sensitivity analyses of health or valuation functions, or of other inputs; and
*Hypothetical, or “what-if,” type analyses.

A [[United Nations]] case study concluded that it had "proven to be a remarkable tool in helping decision-makers understand the health and economic implications of possible air pollution control policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA 5: BenMAP International – Model to Estimate Health Benefits of Air Quality Improvements|url=https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/casestudies/a3_usa.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013 the proprietary BenMAP 4 was rewritten as an open-source program and issued as BenMAP-Community Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BenMAP - Community Edition|url=http://www.epa.gov/airquality/benmap/ce.html|publisher=EPA|accessdate=February 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303162837/http://www.epa.gov/airquality/benmap/ce.html|archivedate=March 3, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

BenMAP is intended as a tool for estimating the health impacts, and associated economic values, associated with changes in ambient air pollution. It accomplishes this by running health impact functions, which relate a change in the concentration of a pollutant with a change in the incidence of a health endpoint.

Inputs to health impact functions typically include:
*the change in ambient air pollution level,
*health effect estimate,
*the baseline incidence rate of the health endpoint, and
*the exposed population.
* '''Air Pollution Change'''. The air quality change is calculated as the difference between the starting air pollution level, also called the baseline, and the air pollution level after some change, such as that caused by a regulation. In the case of particulate matter, this is typically estimated in micrograms per meter cubed (μg/m3).
* '''Mortality Effect Estimate'''. The mortality effect estimate is an estimate of the percentage change in mortality due to a one unit change in ambient air pollution. Epidemiological studies provide a source for effect estimates.
* '''Mortality Incidence'''. The mortality incidence rate is an estimate of the average number of people that die in a given population over a given period of time. For example, the mortality incidence rate might be the probability that a person will die in a given year. Mortality incidence rates and other health data are typically collected each country’s government. The World Health Organization is a good source for data.
* '''Exposed Population'''. The exposed population is the number of people affected by the air pollution reduction. The government census office is a source for this information. Private companies may collect this information and offer it for sale.

BenMAP also calculates the economic value of health impacts. After the calculation of the mortality change, these premature deaths can be valued by multiplying the change in mortality reduction by an estimate of the value of a statistical life:

'''Value of Statistical Life''': The value of a statistical life is the economic value placed on eliminating the risk of one premature death.

BenMAP also serves as a Geographic Information System (GIS), allowing users to create, utilize, and visualize maps of air pollution, population, incidence rates, incidence rate changes, economic valuations, and other types of data.

==Users==
Users may include scientists, policy analysts, and decision makers. Advanced users can explore options such as using the map querying features and exploring the impacts of different health impact and valuation functions.

'''''Bengt'' Olof Torsten Falck''' (born 16 January 1927 in [[Malmö]]) is a Swedish scientist, who is [[professor emeritus]] at the Faculty of Medicine at [[Lund University]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lu.se/lucat/user/13d08db70c771958048accae99f2103b|title=Bengt Falck|work=Lunds universitet|access-date=2018-02-28|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falck has published numerous works in the fields of histology, [[endocrinology]] and [[neurobiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/sv/persons/bengt-falck(e82ad1cc-8ae0-4d2c-917d-c9cb66cdeb45).html|title=Bengt Falck - Lunds universitet|website=portal.research.lu.se|language=sv|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bengt Falck is the son of Hans Falck, city court judge in Malmö, Sweden, and Maria Hagander. He married Eva Torp in 1951, and together they had four children. In 1994 he married Inger Vestvik.

== Scientific career ==
Falck became Doctor of Medical Science, equivalent of [[PhD]], in 1959. His thesis focused on the production of [[estrogen]] in the [[Ovary|ovaries]], and he attempted to show that this production is dependent on an interplay of two different hormone producing systems. His hypothesis has come to be called "Falck's two-cell hypothesis of oestrogen synthes".&lt;ref&gt;Falck, B. Site of production of oestrogen in rat ovary as studied in microtransplants. Acta physiol.scand. Suppl. 163, 1959, 47: 1-101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baird|first=D.

In 1960–61 Falck and [[Nils-Åke Hillarp]] developed the [[Falck-Hillarp fluorescence method]]. This technique made it possible to study biologically active substances called [[monoamines]] – [[dopamine]], [[noradrenaline]], [[adrenaline]] and [[serotonin]] – on the cellular level employing fluorescence microscope. Consequently, it was then possible to demonstrate their presence in the central as well as peripheral nervous system. Thereby, it could be established that these monoamines were actually functioning as interneuronal transmitters (signal substances). The method has since its development been used several times, within fields such as [[dermatology]] and [[histochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Henschen, A. &amp; Olson, L. Acta Neuropathol (1983) 59: 109. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi-org.ezp.sub.su.se/10.1007/BF00691595&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul E, Illig L.

Accessed February 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication on the chemical background was named among the 200 most cited papers of all time in 1991, and had at the time been cited 2,435 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falck|first=Bengt|date=December 2, 1991|title=This Week's Citation Classic|url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1991/A1991GP23800001.pdf|journal=CC|volume=48|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Lund arranged a symposium “From Nerve to Pills” celebrating the 50th anniversary of the initial publication of the F-H method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.med.lu.se/kalendarium/120427_falckhillarp|title=Från nerv till piller - Falck-Hillarp-symposium {{!}} Medicinska fakulteten, Lunds universitet|last=University|first=Faculty of Medicine, Lund|website=www.med.lu.se|language=sv|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 his latest publication ”Mediated exodus of L-Dopa from human epidermal Langerhans cells", was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falck|first=Bengt|last2=Bendsöe|first2=Niels|last3=Ronquist|first3=G.|date=2004|title=Mediated exodus of L-dopa from human epidermal Langerhans cells.|url=http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/sv/publications/mediated-exodus-of-ldopa-from-human-epidermal-langerhans-cells(e3bc007c-f162-4340-97a1-28232c35df13).html|journal=Amino Acids|language=engelska|volume=26|issue=2|pages=133–138|doi=10.1007/s00726-003-0052-6|issn=0939-4451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CAREN''' (Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment) protocol—is a versatile, multi-sensory virtual reality system used for treatment and rehabilitation of human locomotion, or walking, as well as pain, posture, balance spinal stability and motor control integration.&lt;ref name=pmid10538390/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid23884905/&gt;&lt;ref name=GeijtenbeekSteenbrinkOttenEven-Zohar2011/&gt;

==History==
[[Motek|MOTEK]] was founded in 1993{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} as a privately held motion capture, animation and visualization studio.
 
The early mission of MOTEK focused on the development and implementation of innovative animation and visualization techniques focusing on real time generation of realistic animation.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
 
The company managed project work to ensure growth without the need for venture capital or going public until 1998. In 1997, MOTEK had applied for a research grant to the European commission in order to develop the system now known as CAREN. This grant was received in 1998 and enabled the development of CAREN's 1st prototype.
 
The company also received external funding through TWINNING and NPM capital, both Dutch based investment companies.
 
The 1st production grade CAREN system was sold to the University of Groningen in 2000.
Within the annals of CAREN’s beginnings, the technology was being used primarily by scientific and military organizations because of the sheer complexity of its modern intricacies and somewhat complicated testing.&lt;ref name=pmid25167904/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24811543/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid23820145/&gt;

'''Cao Guojiu''', literally '''Imperial Brother-in-law  Cao''', is a [[Chinese mythology|Chinese mythological]] figure and one of the [[Eight Immortals]] in the [[Taoism|Taoist]] pantheon. His real name was '''Cao Yi''' while his [[courtesy name]] was '''Jingxiu''', and he was better known to his contemporaries as '''Cao Jingxiu'''.

Cao Guojiu is believed to be a descendant of [[Cao Bin]], a general of the early [[Song dynasty]], and a younger brother of [[Empress Cao (Song dynasty)|Empress Cao]], the wife of [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]] of the Song dynasty. As none of Emperor Renzong's sons survived their father, the emperor designated a younger male relative, who later became [[Emperor Yingzong of Song|Emperor Yingzong]], as his successor. As such, Cao could not have been a maternal uncle of Emperor Yingzong, so his "Imperial Uncle" status seemed ambiguous. However, as the Chinese character ''jiu'' (舅), which means "maternal uncle", can also mean "wife's brother", it is believed that the latter meaning should apply to Cao. In other words, Cao was the "Imperial Brother-in-Law" of Emperor Renzong rather than an "Imperial (Maternal) Uncle" of any Song dynasty emperor.

Cao's younger brother, Cao Jingzhi (曹景植), abused his relationship with the imperial family by bullying others and engaging in corrupt practices. Cao  tried to persuade his brother to change his ways but he did not listen. In the meantime, he also used his family fortune to help the poor and tried to make up for his brother's misdeeds. One day, Cao Jingzhi was accused by other officials in the imperial court of corruption and abuse of power. Cao felt so ashamed and disappointed by his brother's misconduct that he gave up his official career and went to the countryside to lead a reclusive life. During this time, he met the immortals [[Zhongli Quan]] and [[Lü Dongbin]], who taught him Taoist magical arts. After many years of practice and cultivation, Cao himself also became an immortal.

Cao is often depicted dressed in official robes and holding a jade tablet or [[castanets]]. He is also regarded as the patron deity of acting and theatre.

==Modern references==
In the television show ''[[Jackie Chan Adventures]]'', Cao was shown to be the Immortal who sealed away [[List of Jackie Chan Adventures characters#Tchang Zu|Tchang Zu, The Thunder Demon]].  He was depicted as missing his lower right leg.

A '''clear well''' (sometimes spelled as "clearwell") is a component of a municipal [[water purification|drinking water purification]] system. It refers to the final storage stage in the system, following the [[rapid sand filter|filtration]] and [[Water purification#Treatment#Disinfection|disinfection stages]]. The filtered water is held in a storage basin to allow the disinfectant to inactivate any remaining [[pathogen]]s.

'''Delta Sigma Delta''' ('''ΔΣΔ'''), founded on November 15, 1882, is the oldest and largest of the international professional [[Dentistry|dental]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Delta Sigma Delta International Dental Fraternity |url=http://www.deltsig.com |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; pre-dating [[Xi Psi Phi]] (1889), [[Psi Omega]] (1892) and [[Alpha Omega Fraternity|Alpha Omega]] (1907).

Two dental students, Lou Mitchell and Chas Howard, at the [[University of Michigan]] School of Dentistry in [[Ann Arbor]] were invited to join [[Nu Sigma Nu]], a medical fraternity.  However, they decided to decline as their intentions were to create a dental fraternity. On November 15, 1882, seven dental students met at Mrs. Slattery's [[boarding house]] at #10 North State St., Ann Arbor, Michigan,  and founded the first dental fraternity in the world.  For a name, they [[transpose]]d the initials of the [[D.D.S.]] degree, which they were soon to receive,  to D.S.D. and substituted the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters DSD for the English. Thus, Delta Sigma Delta was born and the new chapter became known as the Alpha Chapter.

After graduation these men became scattered in all directions but they strongly desired to maintain their associations and friendships of college days.  This was the beginning of the Supreme (or [[Alumni]]) Chapter, which was  founded in Detroit, MI after their graduation from dental school in 1895.

Soon a second chapter, Beta, was formed at the [[Chicago College of Dental Surgery]] in 1885 by Dr. L.L. Davis who had migrated there to practice dentistry. Then a third, Gamma, at [[Harvard]] was begun.

Undergraduate Chapters are located in dental schools and Graduate Chapters are located throughout the United States and Canada, as well as [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]]. The Supreme Council is designated as the administrative or governing body of the fraternity.

As of 2016 there are 33 active chapters.

'''Electronarcosis''', also called '''electric stunning''' or '''electrostunning''', is a profound [[stupor]] produced by passing an electric current through the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electronarcosis |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Service]] |date=2018 |url=https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004580 |accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electronarcosis may be used as a form of  [[electrotherapy]] in treating certain mental illnesses in humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Merriam-Webster's medical dictionary | publisher =[[Merriam-Webster]] Inc | location = Springfield, Mass | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-87779-914-8 |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/electronarcosis |accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may be used to rendering [[livestock]] unconscious prior to [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]].&lt;ref name="meat"&gt;{{cite web |title=Electrical Stunning of Red Meat Animals |publisher=Humane Slaughter Association |url=https://www.hsa.org.uk/downloads/publications/electricalstunningdownload.pdf |accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1902, Stephen Luduc discovered he could produce a narcotic-like state in animals, and eventually he tried it on himself, where he remained conscious, but unable to move in a dream-like state.&lt;ref name="Helliwell1950"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Helliwell|first1=P. J.|title=ELECTRONARCOSIS|journal=Anaesthesia|volume=5|issue=4|year=1950|pages=166–170|issn=0003-2409|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1950.tb12679.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1951, an American psychiatrist [[Hervey M. Cleckley]] published a paper on the results of treating 110 patients having anxiety neuroses with electronarcosis therapy.  He argued that patients may benefit from electronarcosis after other treatments have failed.&lt;ref name="EstesCleckley1951"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Estes|first1=Marion M.|last2=Cleckley|first2=Hervey M.|title=ELECTRONARCOSIS IN A GENERAL HOSPITAL|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=107|issue=11|year=1951|pages=814–820|issn=0002-953X|doi=10.1176/ajp.107.11.814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1974 paper discussed the advantage of using electronarcosis for short term general anesthesia. Researchers achieved electronarcosis by applying 180 mA at a frequency of 500 Hertz to the [[mastoid part of the temporal bone]].&lt;ref name="NegovskyTabak1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Negovsky|first1=V.A.|last2=Tabak|first2=V.Ya.|last3=Pechkin|first3=Ye.N.|title=Short-term electronarcosis: a new method of general anaesthesia for defibrillation|journal=Resuscitation|volume=3|issue=3|year=1974|pages=223–227|issn=0300-9572|doi=10.1016/0300-9572(74)90011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases==
Electronarcosis results in a conditions similar to an [[epileptic seizure]], with the three phases called ''tonic'', ''clonic'', and ''recovery''.

During the tonic phase the patient or animal collapses and becomes rigid.

During clonic muscles relax and some movement occurs.

During recovery the patient or animal becomes aware.

==Livestock==
Electronarcosis is one of the  [[Stunning#Electrical_stunning|methods used]] to render animals unconscious before slaughter and unable to feel pain. Electronarcosis may be followed immediately by [[electrocution]] or by bleeding.

Modern electronarcosis is typically performed by applying 200 [[Volt]]s of high frequency [[alternating current]] of about 1500 [[Hertz]] for 3 seconds to the animal's head.  High frequency current is not felt as an electric shock and does not cause skeletal muscle contractions.{{cn|date=April 2018}}  A wet animal will pass a current of over an [[Ampere]].  If electronarcosis is not followed by other procedures, the animal will usually recover.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt;

Studies have been used to determine optimal parameters for effective electronarcosis.&lt;ref name="BarbosaAdamczuk2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbosa|first1=RL|last2=Adamczuk|first2=GO|last3=Dvojatzki|first3=P|last4=Trentin|first4=MG|last5=Lima|first5=JD|title=Efficiency of Electrical Stunning by Electronarcosis: Current Situation and Perspective of Improvement in a Medium-Size Processing Plant|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ciência Avícola|volume=18|issue=2|year=2016|pages=331–336|issn=1516-635X|doi=10.1590/1806-9061-2015-0113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

'''The two main objectives of the project are''':

* To improve the nutritional habits of employees by raising their awareness to health issues.
* To improve the nutritional quality of the food on offer in restaurants.&lt;ref name="fenetre"&gt;[http://www.fenetreeurope.com/php/page.php?section=actu&amp;id=15471 Santé: Un projet européen visant à promouvoir l’accès à une alimentation équilibrée], ''Fenêtre sur l'Europe''. Retrieved 26-05-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The specific objectives are''':

* To evaluate the needs and expectations regarding nutrition information of restaurants and employees in companies
* To collect experts’ recommendations after the understanding of the needs
* To adapt the recommendations into practical messages and communication tools
* To adapt the offer in restaurants to the demand of the consumers
* To organize useful trainings according to the countries
* To enable a large access to detailed information to the targets.

===Methodology===

To meet the objectives, the FOOD project has created essential channels of communication between the companies and the restaurants using its unique network of contacts through the Ticket Restaurant® solution, following five complementary sets of actions:

# An inventory of existing health promotion programmes in the workplace and in restaurants was followed by two questionnaires. The first was a quantitative survey, addressing employees (52,000) and restaurants (5,000) to better understand the project’s needs. The second, a qualitative study, was done by conducting 60 interviews in restaurants in 12 countries.
# Following a comparative study of the surveys’ results, recommendations were made by the partners.
# Simple tools were developed, adapted and piloted for restaurants and companies.
# Pilots were evaluated.
# Following the evaluation, tools were adapted and best practices disseminated.&lt;ref name="final"&gt;[http://www.food-programme.eu/IMG/pdf/PublicationFinale_BD_31052011_VA.pdf FOOD programme Final Publication, 2012], Retrieved 2014-05-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==The programme==

The partners have decided to continue developing and disseminating the project after the end of the funding period and the support from the European Commission. The partners are motivated to take advantage of the actions, experience and results of the project and create an adaptable programme.

A new consortium agreement linking 23 partners in 8 countries was signed in Brussels on December 14, 2011. The Consortium agreement was renewed for another 3 years with 23 partners in 9 countries on November 27, 2015 .

The programme is meant to be developed with new partners and in new countries.

==Activities==

===The FOOD Road Show===

In October 2009, a double-decker bus customised with the FOOD colours drove through the main cities of the six participating countries, officially launching the communication campaign to the target audiences. The tour enabled the partners, with the collaboration of nutritionists, dietitians and chefs, to explain the FOOD project and to show the first communication tools created. The journey started in [[Paris]] and then continued on to [[Brussels]], [[Stockholm]], [[Prague]], and [[Milan]] ending in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name="roadshow1"&gt;[http://trashfood.com/2009/11/17/foodfighting-obesity-through-offer-and-demand/ ''Food: Chef Fight Obesity through Offer and Demand'', ''Trash Food - Randomestrale di Incultura Alimentare'' 2009-11-17], Retrieved 2014-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roadshow2"&gt;[http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/sociedad/noticias/1649282/10/09/Llega-a-espana-food-un-proyecto-europeo-para-mejorar-los-habitos-alimentarios-de-los-trabajadores.html#.Kku8vDAKY868Req ''Llega a espana food, un proyecto europeo para mejorar los hábitos alimentarios de los trabajadores'', ''El Economista'', 2009-10-27], Retrieved 2014-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The conference at the European Parliament===

Following the wish of the partners to continue the FOOD project by adapting it into a programme, a conference had been organised to mark the transition. The conference was held on 31 May 2011, at the [[European Parliament]], during the Hungarian [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union#List of rotations|Presidency of the European Union]].&lt;ref name="conference2"&gt;[http://www.freshplaza.it/article/32044/Pubblico-e-Privato-si-incontrano-al-Parlamento-Europeo-per-rinnovare-il-proprio-impegno-nella-lotta-allobesita ''Pubblico e Privato si incontrano al Parlamento Europeo per rinnovare il proprio impegno nella lotta all’obesita'', ''Freshplaza.it'', 2011-06-09], Retrieved 2014-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The FOOD restaurants network===

A network of dedicated restaurants that adhere to the national FOOD recommendations was created in the participating countries, thought as the most effective way to reconnect the offer and the demand sides of balanced nutrition. The network is composed of almost 3000 restaurants.&lt;ref name="resnet"&gt;Mendes, D. "Certificação para restaurantes que aceitem cozinhar sem sal", ''Diário de Notícias'', 2014-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The FOOD Awards===

The Spanish partners of the FOOD programme organised the ''Premios FOOD 2014'' [translation: FOOD Awards 2014], with the objective of rewarding the healthiest restaurant already part of the FOOD network in [[Spain]]. The final step took place in [[Madrid]] on 6 May 2014, with the reputed Spanish Chef Pedro Larumbe cooking the three finalists' menus. The jury was composed of four gastronomy bloggers and a FOOD partner's representative, who attributed the first prize to ''Sportdiet'' restaurant.&lt;ref name="awards1"&gt;[http://www.periodismogastronomico.com/eventos/final-food-awards-con-pedro-larumbe-y-alejandra-feldman-jurado/ ''Final Food Awards con Pedro Larumbe y Alejandra Feldman jurado'', ''Periodosmo Gastronomico'', 2014-05-06], Retrieved 2014-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="awards2"&gt;[http://diariodegastronomia.com/nutricion/comer-sano/16170-el-menu-mas-saludable-de-espana.html ''El menú más saludable de España'', ''Diario de Gastronomía'', 2014-05-07], Retrieved 2014-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="awards3"&gt;[http://www.madridactualidad.es/restaurante-premios-food/118883 ''Un restaurante madrileño, ganador de los Premios Food 2014'', ''Madrid Actualidad'', 07-05-2014], Retrieved 2014-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fairness for American Families Act''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|2668}}) is a bill that would "amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]], as amended by the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], to delay until 2015 the requirement that individuals maintain minimal essential health care coverage."&lt;ref name="2668sum"/&gt; The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

On July 2, 2013, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] announced that it would be delaying one of the key requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as "Obamacare").&lt;ref name=housereleasestexts&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House releases texts of health insurance mandate delays|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/310711-house-releases-texts-of-health-insurance-mandate-delays|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement that all companies which employed more than 50 workers must offer an employee health insurance plan or pay a fine would now be delayed until 2015, according to the Administration.&lt;ref name=cannonDelayIllegal&gt;{{cite web|last=Cannon|first=Michael F.|title=Yes, Delaying Obamacare's Employer Mandate Is Illegal|url=http://www.cato.org/blog/yes-delaying-obamacares-employer-mandate-illegal|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Administration, however, did not do anything to delay the individual health insurance mandate which was directed and individual people and families, rather than at companies and unions.  In response, on July 11, 2013 by [[Todd Young|Rep. Todd Young (R-IN)]] introduced the Fairness for American Families Act, which would apply the same delay to the [[Health insurance mandate|individual mandate]] requirement.&lt;ref name="housereleasestexts"/&gt;

A second bill, the [[Authority for Mandate Delay Act (H.R. 2667; 113th Congress)|Authority for Mandate Delay Act]] ({{USBill|113|H.R.|2667}}), was introduced on July 11, 2013 by [[Timothy Griffin|Rep. Timothy Griffin (R-AR)]].&lt;ref name=2667allCongActions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2667 - All Congressional Actions|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.113hr2667|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This bill would authorize the Obama Administration's decision to delay the employer mandate, a delay that many would consider illegal without explicit Congressional authorization.&lt;ref name="housereleasestexts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cannonDelayIllegal"/&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act}}

The '''Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act''' ('''PPACA'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|111|148}}, {{USStat|124|119}}, to be codified as amended at scattered sections of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] and in [[Title 42 of the United States Code|42 U.S.C.]]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly called '''Obamacare'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/mar/20/romneycare-and-obamacare-can-you-tell-difference/ |title=RomneyCare &amp; ObamaCare: Can you tell the difference? |last=Holan |first=Angie D. |author= |authorlink= |date=March 20, 2012 |work=PolitiFact.com |publisher=Tampa Bay Times |location= |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Affordable Care Act''' ('''ACA'''), is a [[United States]] [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal statute]] signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] on March 23, 2010. Together with the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act]], it represents the most significant government expansion and regulatory overhaul of the [[Health care in the United States|U.S. healthcare system]] since the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=overhaul&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/28/usa-healthcare-court-idUSL2E8HS4WG20120628|title=US top court upholds healthcare law in Obama triumph|publisher=Reuters|author=James Vicini and Jonathan Stempel|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACA is aimed at increasing the affordability and [[health insurance coverage in the United States|rate of health insurance coverage for Americans]], and reducing the overall costs of health care (for individuals and the government). It provides a number of mechanisms — including [[Health insurance mandate|mandates]], [[subsidy|subsidies]], and [[tax credits]] — to employers and individuals to increase the coverage rate and health insurance affordability.&lt;ref name="nyt-critics"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |title= Health Law Critics Prepare to Battle Over Insurance Exchange Subsidies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/us/critics-of-health-care-law-prepare-to-battle-over-insurance-exchange-subsidies.html |first=Robert |last=Pear |date=July 7, 2012 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law has failed to meet many of these goals, with some supporters now becoming opponents - including some unions.  In May 2013, the [[United Food and Commercial Workers International Union]], [[United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers]], and [[International Association of Firefighters]] complained about the increased costs caused by "requiring health plans to cover dependents up to age 26, eliminate annual or lifetime coverage limits and extend coverage to people with pre-existing conditions."&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unions-now-angry-health-care-overhaul-074904729.html Some unions now angry about health care overhaul], Associated Press, May 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2013, a letter signed by the leaders of the [[Teamsters]], [[UFCW]], and [[UNITE-HERE]] stated, "the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class...  the law creates an incentive for employers to keep employees’ work hours below 30 hours a week... we can no longer stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our members along with millions of other hardworking Americans..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/07/12/union-letter-obamacare-will-destroy-the-very-health-and-wellbeing-of-workers/ Union Letter: Obamacare Will ‘Destroy The Very Health and Wellbeing’ of Workers], Wall St. Journal, July 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA in the case ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Supreme Court Supports Obamacare, Bolsters Obama |last=Barrett |first=Paul M. |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-28/supreme-court-supports-obamacare-and-bolsters-obama |newspaper=BloombergBusinessweek |date=June 28, 2012 |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obamacare upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court |author=National Post Wire Services |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/28/obamacare-upheld-by-the-u-s-supreme-court/ |newspaper=National Post |date=June 28, 2012 |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}, including a major provision which requires all Americans purchase health insurance coverage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was championed by President Barack Obama and supported by most [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], but [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] have tried numerous times to overturn the law.&lt;ref name=nytJuly9&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisman|first=Jonathan|title=Seeing Opening, House G.O.P. Pushes Delay on Individual Mandate in Health Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/politics/house-gop-pushes-delay-on-individual-mandate-in-health-law.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Obama Administration announced that it would be delaying the implementation of part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was seen as a new opportunity to fight against the bill, leading to the proposal of the Authority for Mandate Delay Act and the Fairness for American Families Act.

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=2668sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2668 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2668|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairness for American Families Act would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]], as amended by the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], to delay until 2015 the requirement that individuals maintain minimal essential health care coverage.

==Procedural history==
The Fairness for American Families Act was introduced into the House on July 11, 2013 by [[Todd Young|Rep. Todd Young (R-IN)]].&lt;ref name=2668allCongActions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2668 - All Congressional Actions|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:H.R.2668:@@@X|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]].The bill passed the House on July 17, 2013, by 251- 174 in Roll Call 363.&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll363.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
When he introduced the Fairness for American Families Act, Rep. Young argued that "rather than driving healthcare costs down, the individual mandate is imposing a new tax and burdensome costs on middle class families" and therefore "hardworking Americans deserve the same exemptions that President Obama is unilaterally granting to businesses and labor unions."&lt;ref name="housereleasestexts"/&gt;  House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] agreed with this, announcing that the House would work on this bill the week of July 15, 2013.&lt;ref name="housereleasestexts"/&gt;

[[The New York Times]] (NYT) described Obama's decision to delay the employer mandate as a "self-inflicted wound" which Republicans saw as an opportunity.&lt;ref name="nytJuly9"/&gt;  The NYT suggested that a Republican strategy might begin by having multiple votes - one on affirming/legalizing President Obama's decision to delay the employer mandate (which Democrats would back) and then one on delaying the individual mandate (which Democrats might now have difficulty voting against).&lt;ref name="nytJuly9"/&gt;  The Obama Administration's response to the criticism about this issue was seen as not very strong; the Administration refused to send a representative to a hearing about the matter being held at the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="nytJuly9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=reasonJuly10&gt;{{cite news|last=Suderman|first=Peter|title=Does the Obama Administration Have the Authority to Delay Obamacare's Employer Mandate?|url=http://reason.com/blog/2013/07/10/does-the-obama-administration-have-the-a|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=Reason Magazine|date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Republicans may be able to use these two bills to put pressure on the Democrats, because opposing the Fairness for American Families Act while supporting the Authority for Mandate Delay Act "will make it appear as if they are providing a break to big business but not individuals."&lt;ref name=cosbyig&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosby|first=Steven|title=House To Vote On Delaying Obamacare's Individual Mandate|url=http://www.cosbyig.com/tag/fairness-for-american-families-act/|publisher=Cosbyig|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Sweet's syndrome Crohn's disease.gif|thumb|Pustular lesions with central necrosis on the left leg of a patient with Sweet's syndrome associated with [[Crohn's disease]].]]
[[Image:Sweet's syndrome pathology.jpg|thumb|Punch biopsy of a skin lesion showing neutrophilic infiltration in the dermis, with no evidence of vasculitis (same patient with Crohn's disease).]]
Acute, tender, erythematous plaques, nodes, pseudovesicles and, occasionally, blisters with an annular or arciform pattern occur on the head, neck, legs, and arms, particularly the back of the hands and fingers.  The trunk is rarely involved. Fever (50%); arthralgia or arthritis (62%); eye involvement, most frequently conjunctivitis or iridocyclitis (38%); and oral aphthae (13%) are associated features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
==Cause==
SS can be classified based upon the clinical setting in which it occurs: classical or idiopathic SS, malignancy-associated SS, and drug-induced SS.&lt;ref name="pmid17655751"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen PR |title=Sweet's syndrome--a comprehensive review of an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=2 |issue= |pages=34 |year=2007 |pmid=17655751 |pmc=1963326 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-34 |url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/2//34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic diseases===
SS is a reactive phenomenon and should be considered a cutaneous marker of systemic disease.&lt;ref name="pmid17655751"/&gt;  Careful systemic evaluation is indicated, especially when cutaneous lesions are severe or hematologic values are abnormal. Approximately 20% of cases are associated with malignancy, predominantly hematological, especially [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] (AML). An underlying condition ([[streptococcal infection]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], nonlymphocytic leukemia and other [[Hematologic malignancy|hematologic malignancies]], solid tumors, pregnancy) is found in up to 50% of cases. Attacks of SS may precede the hematologic diagnosis by 3 months to 6 years, so that close evaluation of patients in the “idiopathic” group is required.

There is now good evidence that treatment with hematopoietic growth factors — including [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] (G-CSF), which is used to treat AML, and [[granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] — can cause SS.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Lesions typically occur when the patient has leukocytosis and neutrophilia but not when the patient is neutropenic. However, G-CSF may cause SS in neutropenic patients because of the induction of stem cell proliferation, the differentiation of neutrophils, and the prolongation of neutrophil survival.

===Associations===
Although it may occur in the absence of other known disease, SS is often associated with [[Hematology|hematologic]] disease (including [[leukemia]]), and [[Immunology|immunologic]] disease ([[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[Behçet's syndrome]]).

A genetic association has been suggested,&lt;ref name="pmid12833027"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parsapour K, Reep MD, Gohar K, Shah V, Church A, Shwayder TA |title=Familial Sweet's syndrome in 2 brothers, both seen in the first 2 weeks of life |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=132–8 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12833027 |doi=10.1067/mjd.2003.328 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190962203004250}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no specific genetic link has been identified.

==Diagnosis==
The clinical differential diagnosis includes [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], infection, [[erythema multiforme]], adverse drug reactions, and [[urticaria]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Recurrences are common and affect up to one third of patients.

===Laboratory studies===
Studies show a moderate neutrophilia (less than 50%), elevated [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] (greater than 30&amp;nbsp;mm/h) (90%), and a slight increase in [[alkaline phosphatase]] (83%). Skin biopsy shows a papillary and mid-dermal mixed infiltrate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with nuclear fragmentation and histiocytic cells. The infiltrate is predominantly perivascular with endothelial-cell swelling in some vessels, but vasculitic changes ([[thrombosis|blood clots]]; deposition of [[fibrin]], complement, or [[immunoglobulin]]s within the vessel walls; red blood cell extravasation;inflammatory infiltration of vascular walls) are absent in early lesions.

Perivasculitis occurs secondarily, because of cytokines released by the lesional neutrophils. True transmural vasculitis is not an expected finding histopathologically in SS.
===Definition===
Sweet described a disease with four features: fever; leukocytosis; acute, tender, red plaques; and a [[wiktionary:Papilla|papillary]] [[Dermis|dermal]] infiltrate of [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]]. This led to the name acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Larger series of patients showed that fever and neutrophilia are not consistently present.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The diagnosis is based on the two constant features, a typical eruption and the characteristic histologic features;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} thus the eponym "Sweet's syndrome" is used.

==Treatment==
Systemic [[corticosteroids]] such as ([[prednisone]]) can produce rapid improvement and are the “gold standard” for treatment.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The temperature, white blood cell count, and eruption improve within 72 hours. The skin lesions clear within 3 to 9 days. Abnormal laboratory values rapidly return to normal. There are, however, frequent recurrences. Corticosteroids are tapered within 2 to 6 weeks to zero.

Resolution of the eruption is occasionally followed by milia and scarring. The disease clears spontaneously in some patients. Topical and/or intralesional corticosteroids may be effective as either monotherapy or adjuvant therapy.
Oral [[potassium iodide]] or [[colchicine]] may induce rapid resolution.

Patients who have a potential systemic infection or in whom corticosteroids are contraindicated can use these agents as a first-line therapy.
In one study, [[indomethacin]], 150&amp;nbsp;mg per day, was given for the first week, and 100&amp;nbsp;mg per day was given for 2 additional weeks. Seventeen of 18 patients had a good initial response; fever and arthralgias were markedly attenuated within 48 hours, and eruptions cleared between 7 and 14 days.

Patients whose cutaneous lesions continued to develop were successfully treated with prednisone (1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg per day). No patient had a relapse after discontinuation of indomethacin.
Other alternatives to corticosteroid treatment include [[dapsone]], [[doxycycline]], [[clofazimine]], and [[cyclosporine]]. All of these drugs influence migration and other functions of neutrophils.

[[File:LentSpace - Food trucks.jpg|thumb|[[Food truck rally]]]]
A '''foodie''' is a person who has an ardent or refined interest in food and who eats food not out of hunger but due to their interest or hobby.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|year=1992|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-395-82517-4|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "gastronome" and "gourmet" define the same thing, i.e. a person who enjoys food for pleasure.

== Earliest uses of the word ==
The "foodie"—not as elitist as a [[gourmet]], more discriminating than a [[gluttony|glutton]]—was first named in print in the early 1980s. The term came into use almost simultaneously in the United States and Britain. Priority goes to [[Gael Greene]], who, in June 1980, wrote in ''[[New York Magazine]]'' of a character who "slips into the small Art Deco dining room of Restaurant d'Olympe ... to graze cheeks with her devotees, serious foodies."&lt;ref&gt;G. Greene in ''[[New York Magazine]]'' (2 June 1980); ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' at "foodie"&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately afterwards the foodie was defined in the British press. [[Ann Barr]], features editor of the London magazine ''[[Harper's &amp; Queen]]'', had asked readers to comment on a then-new obsession with food. Several readers' responses named [[Paul Levy (journalist)|Paul Levy]], food writer on the same magazine, as the perfect example. Levy played along,&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;Paul Levy, "[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2007/jun/14/whatisafoodie What is a foodie?]" in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (14 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; contributing an anonymous article in August 1982, defining the term ("Foodies are foodist. They dislike and despise all non-foodies")&lt;ref&gt;V. Woods [editor] in  ''Harpers &amp; Queen'' (August 1982); ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' at "foodie"&lt;/ref&gt; and characterizing himself as the "ghastly, his-stomach-is-bigger-than-his-eyes, original, appetite-unsuppressed, lip-smacking 'king foodie'".&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt; The word gained currency rapidly, partly because Barr and Levy followed up with a book, ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/85994679 The Official Foodie Handbook]'', published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Barr and Paul Levy,  ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/85994679 The Official Foodie Handbook]''. London: Ebury Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0 85223 348 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pursuits ==

Foodies are a distinct [[hobbyist]] group. Typical foodie interests and activities include the [[food industry]], [[wineries]] and [[wine tasting]], breweries and beer sampling, [[food science]], following [[restaurant]] openings and closings and occasionally reopenings, [[food distribution]], food [[fads]], [[health]] and [[nutrition]], cooking classes, [[culinary tourism]], and [[restaurant management]].  A foodie might develop a particular interest in a specific item, such as the best [[egg cream]] or [[burrito]].  Many publications have [[food column]]s that cater to foodies and many of the [[websites]] carrying the name foodie have become popular amongst the foodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brewchew.in/|title=Brew &amp; Chew|publisher=Jayanth Dev India's Best Online Review Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest by foodies in the 1980s and 1990s gave rise to [[the Food Network]] and other specialized food [[television programming|programming]], popular films and television shows about food such as [[Top Chef]] and [[Iron Chef]], a renaissance in specialized [[cookbooks]], specialized periodicals such as [[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet Magazine]] and [[Cook's Illustrated]], growing popularity of [[farmers' markets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=The Healthy Foodie| url=http://blogs.lifestyle.aol.ca/2008/07/31/canadian-farmers-markets-where-to-find-them/ | title = Canadian Farmers Markets: Where to Find Them | date = July 31, 2008 | publisher=AOL Life &amp; Style}}&lt;/ref&gt; food-oriented websites like [[Zagat's]] and [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]], publishing and reading food [[blogs]] like [[Foodbeast]] and foodieworld, specialized kitchenware stores like [[Williams-Sonoma]] and [[Sur La Table]], and the institution of the [[celebrity chef]].

Foodies have a significant [[social media]] presence; food lovers have created their own [[YouTube]] channels where they show what they cook and where they eat around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-holmberg/food-and-social-media-a-c_b_4898784.html|title=Food And Social Media — A Complicated Relationship|last=Holmberg|first=Christopher|date=2014-03-05|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-01-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also become a common practice to take photos of food and beverages consumed at home or outside and share them on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], or other media in a form of [[food porn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/295126|title=How 'Food Porn' Posted on Social Media Has Become an Industry|last=Kugel|first=Alison|date=2017-06-01|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-01-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Chris Onstad, author of the webcomic ''[[Achewood]]'' and the author of ''The Achewood Cookbook'', stated a dislike for the term. Onstad said "There are so many words that already describe the concept of people who like food, or enjoy cooking, or enjoy knowing about cooking. "Foodie": It's like the infantile diminutive—you put a "y" on the end of everything to make it childlike. We don't need it. It's embarrassing. 'Girl, I'm a foodie.' Like oh my God."&lt;ref&gt;Norton, James. [http://www.salon.com/life/food/eat_drink/2007/04/10/onstad_qa/ Chow down, dude]. ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]''. Tuesday April 10, 2007. Retrieved on July 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many journalists, like Roberto A. Ferdman, author of ''Stop Calling Yourself a 'Foodie''' in the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]], also criticize the word saying "There is a great irony in describing yourself as a food insider in a way no actual food insider ever would."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/01/why-the-word-foodie-is-terrible-and-needs-to-go-away/|title=Stop calling yourself a ‘foodie’|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdman claims that people who associate themselves with being a "foodie" are in fact distancing themselves from the group they wish to be associated with. The author then states that there is nothing wrong with having an interest in food, in fact this popular trend is helping the food movement thrive. Ferdman's main argument is that since the word is so widely used, its meaning has become ubiquitous and some meaning is lost upon the need to constantly announce how much someone likes to eat.

Dutch pranksters tricked self-identified foodies at a [[food]] [[Trade fair|Expo]] to mistake [[McDonald's]] fast food for refined gourmet presentations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2014/10/22/dutch-pranksters-trick-foodies-into-thinking-macdonalds-is-gourmet-food-4916793/ Dutch pranksters trick foodies into thinking McDonald’s is gourmet food]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10921">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''g'' factor in non-humans}}The [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], or general factor, of [[intelligence]] is a [[psychometric]] construct that summarizes observed correlations between an individual’s scores on various measures of [[cognitive abilities]]. First described in [[humans]], a ''g'' factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;Reader, S. M., Hager, Y., &amp; Laland, K. N. (2011). The evolution of primate general and cultural intelligence. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 366(1567), 1017-1027.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of variance explained by ''g'' varies widely among species. The reasons for this are not clear; J. P. Rushton has attempted to place g in an evolutionary frame of reference.&lt;ref&gt;Rushton, J. P. (2004). Placing intelligence into an evolutionary framework or how ''g'' fits into the r–K matrix of life-history traits including longevity.Intelligence, 32(4), 321-328.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human [[model organisms|models]] of ''g'' have been used in [[genetics|genetic]]&lt;ref name="Plomin"&gt;Plomin, R. (2001). The genetics of ''g'' in human and mouse. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 2(2), 136-141.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neurological]]&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, B. (2000). The ''g'' factor in non-human animals. The nature of intelligence, (285), 79.&lt;/ref&gt; research on intelligence to help understand the mechanisms behind variation in ''g''.

==Methods==

Most measures of ''g'' in humans, including most [[IQ]] tests, rely heavily on [[language]] and verbal ability, and so they cannot be directly applied to non-human animals. Several alternative measures have been developed to study intelligence in animals, relying on the observation of animals in natural situations or on behavioral tasks in experimental settings. The tasks focus on such things as innovation and problem solving, response to novelty, habit reversal and inhibition, and social learning and culture. A comprehensive assessment often includes a battery of tests involving several sorts of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M., &amp; Call, J. (1997). Primate cognition. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation &amp; problem solving===
Innovation and problem solving tasks are the most widely used experimental measures of non-human intelligence. The same assessment often uses several tasks, which may involve [[memory]], [[spatial reasoning]], visual and auditory discrimination,  and object manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, K., Chabris, C. F., Johnson, V. E., Lee, J. J., Tsao, F., &amp; Hauser, M. D. (2009). General intelligence in another primate: individual differences across cognitive task performance in a New World monkey (Saguinus oedipus). PLoS One, 4(6), e5883.&lt;/ref&gt;  Innovation has often been observed in animals, typically involving novel solutions to everyday problems or the use of tools to achieve a goal. Instances include [[tool use by animals|termite fishing]] in [[chimpanzees]] or [[tool use by animals|nut cracking]] in [[robust capuchin monkey|robust capuchins]]. Such observations provide [[ecological validity|ecologically valid]] measures without the need for experimentation.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;

===Response to novelty===

Response to novelty is often used in intelligence measures in human infants.,&lt;ref&gt;Berg, C. A., &amp; Sternberg, R. J. (1985). Response to novelty: Continuity versus discontinuity in the developmental course of intelligence. Advances in child development and behavior, 19, 1-47.&lt;/ref&gt; for the amount of interest in novel objects and the time spent exploring a novel environment correlate with intelligence later in life. Responses to novelty in non-humans are thought to correlate similarly, though it can often be difficult to quantify this measure appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;Day, R. L., Coe, R. L., Kendal, J. R., &amp; Laland, K. N. (2003). Neophilia, innovation and social learning: a study of intergeneric differences in callitrichid monkeys. Animal Behaviour, 65(3), 559-571.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habit reversal &amp; inhibition===

[[Habit]] reversal and [[Social inhibition|inhibition]] are commonly used to test primate intelligence. These tasks require the animal to suppress a learned response or instinctive action in order to receive a reward. For example, in the detour problem, a food reward behind an obstacle must be retrieved by following an indirect route.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, W. (1927). The mentality of apes (rev. edn). New York: Harcourt&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, the subject must inhibit its tendency to move straight towards the goal.

===Social learning===

A number of intelligence tests for animals include [[social learning theory|social learning]]. The more an individual participates in and gains from social learning, the higher its intelligence is judged to be. Such data are most widely available for primates in social situations, often in wild populations, rather than experimental set-ups&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; Such observations are more [[ecological validity|ecologically valid]] than some other measures.&lt;ref&gt;Reader, S. M., &amp; Biro, D. (2010). Experimental identification of social learning in wild animals. Learning &amp; Behavior, 38(3), 265-283.&lt;/ref&gt; One basis for their inclusion in IQ studies centers around the theory of [[cultural intelligence]].&lt;ref name="van Schaik"&gt;van Schaik, C. P., &amp; Burkart, J. M. (2011). Social learning and evolution: the cultural intelligence hypothesis. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 366(1567), 1008-1016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herrmann"&gt;Herrmann, E., Call, J., Hernández-Lloreda, M. V., Hare, B., &amp; Tomasello, M. (2007). Humans have evolved specialized skills of social cognition: the cultural intelligence hypothesis. science, 317(5843), 1360-1366.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''g'' in non-human mammals==

A large portion of the research into non-human ''g'' factors has focused on mammals. Being mammals themselves, humans have a great deal in common with other mammals, sharing similarities in aspects such as [[physiology]] and [[neurochemistry]]. [[Social learning theory|Social learning]] and [[culture]] may have played a large role in the [[evolution of intelligence]] in humans&lt;ref name="van Schaik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herrmann" /&gt; (including its factor structure) and as such it follows that other animals may have similar single-factor models of intelligence.

===Primates===

Due to their close [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] proximity to humans, [[primates]] ([[great apes]] in particular) have been the focus of a large part of the research into the prevalence of a ''g'' factor in non-human animals.

A [[meta-analysis]] of 4000 [[ethology|primate behaviour]] academic papers searching for instances of [[innovation]], [[social learning theory|social learning]], [[tool use]], and [[foraging|extractive foraging]] was conducted to investigate the components of these behaviours in 62 species of primates.&lt;ref name="Reader"/&gt; A [[Principal Components Analysis]] of these cognitive measures (as well as three socio-ecological variables, (diet breadth, percentage fruit in diet, and group size) revealed a single factor explaining 47% of the variance onto which the cognitive measures and diet breadth (somewhat) loaded. This would suggest that non-human primates, as a whole, have a ''g'' factor similar to that observed in humans.

===Rodents===

[[laboratory mouse|Mice]] and [[laboratory rat|rats]] have been used as [[model organisms]] in research for hundreds of years&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J. G., Barthold, S., Davisson, M., Newcomer, C. E., Quimby, F. W., &amp; Smith, A. (2006). The Mouse in Biomedical Research: Normative biology, husbandry, and models (Vol. 3). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been a staple of [[experimental psychology]] for decades.  Both have been proposed as easily accessible models for studying ''g''.&lt;ref name="Plomin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matzel, L. D., Han, Y. R., Grossman, H., Karnik, M. S., Patel, D., Scott, N., ... &amp; Gandhi, C. C. (2003). Individual differences in the expression of a “general” learning ability in mice. The Journal of Neuroscience, 23(16), 6423-6433.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''g'' factor loadings in [[Long-Evans]] rats has been shown to range from .43 to as high as .70 in cognitive ability tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, A. R. The ''g'' Factor: The Science of Mental Ability (Praeger, Westport, Connecticut, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In mice, about 55-60% of the individual variance in tests of cognitive ability can be explained by ''g''.&lt;ref&gt;Locurto, C., &amp; Durkin, E. Problem-solving and individual differences in mice (Mus musculus) using water reinforcement. J Comp Psychol.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Locurto, C. &amp; Scanlon, C. Individual differences and a spatial learning factor in two strains of mice (Mus musculus). J. Comp. Psychol. 112, 344–352 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Genetic research===

Non-human [[Scientific modelling|models]] of intelligence can be used in [[individual differences]] research for study designs that are difficult or [[unethical]] to perform using human subjects. Examples of this include [[experimental drug]] testing and [[genetics|multi-generational studies]] that would take a very long time in humans.

One such aspect of intelligence well suited for a non-human model is the experimental study of [[genetics|genetic]] aspects of ''g''. [[laboratory mouse|Mice]] are currently being considered as a potential model due to their widespread availability, detailed knowledge of their [[genome]], and the ease with which strains can be [[bred]] to exhibit individual differences in [[cognitive ability]].&lt;ref name="Plomin" /&gt;

===Neuroscience===

Non-human models can also be used in [[neuroscience]] for [[neuroanatomical]] studies investigating intelligence and the influence of ''g'' on the neurological level. Rats have been used in experimental manipulations of intelligence using chemicals administered [[prenatal development (biology)|prenatally]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; These effects are partially reversed by stimulation of [[neurology|neurological development]] and suggest that neuronal and synaptic numbers have an effect on ''g''.

==Criticism==

A 2012 study identifying individual chimpanzees that consistently performed highly on cognitive tasks found clusters of abilities instead of a general factor of intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, E., &amp; Call, J. (2012). Are there geniuses among the apes?.Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,367(1603), 2753-2761.&lt;/ref&gt; This study used individual-based data and claim that their results are not directly comparable to previous studies using group data that have found evidence for ''g''. The authors propose a future research should test multiple individuals of multiple species on a variety of tasks to investigate this discrepancy.

"'''Get Your Sexy Back'''" (GYSB) is a youth-led anti-binge drinking initiative that aims to promote responsible drinking behaviour, by raising the [[social currency]] of moderation. The first such initiative in Singapore, the programme was launched in December 2007 and spearheaded by [[Asia Pacific Breweries]] (APBS), an Asian Brewery listed on the [[Singapore Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaone.com/Health/News/Story/A1Story20080211-49017.html Anti-binge drinking campaign: Get serious] Asiaone News, 11 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring message of the campaign is that consuming 5 or more units of alcohol at a single sitting constitutes [[binge drinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2008, GYSB released the findings of a survey into the drinking habits of young adults in Singapore aged between 18 and 25. The findings of this survey showed an increasing prevalence of binge drinking among youths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== History ==

Get Your Sexy Back was originally conceived by four students from the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (NTU), as part of a school project. The students identified several factors responsible for [[binge drinking]] among youths in Singapore and approached APBS for support. The programme was subsequently adopted by APBS as part of its [[corporate social responsibility]] initiatives in Singapore.

GYSB was first launched in December 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketing-interactive.com/news/4477 Moderate drinking keeps you sexy]
 Marketing-Interactive, 11 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of encouraging responsible drinking behaviour among young adults from 18&amp;nbsp;– 25 years old by raising the social currency of [[moderation]]. The programme engages its target audience through various youth-related activities and platforms, broadly spanning the areas of music, fashion, sports and friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; GYSB's slogan: “It’s not the drinking, it’s how you’re drinking” was adapted with permission from a New Zealand campaign by the Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand (ALAC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alac.org.nz/MediaRelease.aspx?PostingID=3109 Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand (ALAC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme has been present at a number of youth-oriented events, particularly in conjunction with tertiary student associations and national youth bodies. These events include the NTU Surf n Sweat, National Vertical Marathon, the Seventeen magazine Queen of Queens and the [[Singapore Management University]] (SMU) Waikiki. In partnering these events, the programme has frequently drawn on support from other corporate partners including Singaporean fashion label NewUrbanMale.com, outdoor media specialists [[Clear Channel]] Singapore, as well as convenience chains Cheers and [[7-Eleven]].

The campaign has also been actively involved in the recruitment of youth volunteers and volunteer ambassadors to pledge their support for the cause of moderate drinking. Recruitment of volunteers has mainly been conducted online via the campaign website, in the various tertiary [[campuses]], as well as at roadshows held at shopping malls.

In February 2010, an article in the TODAY newspaper cited GYSB as an example of a highly successful youth-oriented campaign. The article also stated that more and more youths have been pledging their support for moderate drinking since the launch of GYSB in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayonline.com/Business/Impact/EDC100209-0000046/Young-guns "Young Guns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622000014/http://www.todayonline.com/Business/Impact/EDC100209-0000046/Young-guns |date=22 June 2011 }}, Today Newspaper, 9 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms==
The GYSB programme encourages youths to live active, healthy social lives by engaging in activities other than [[binge drinking]]. It has grouped these activities into four main youth-oriented platforms.

===Music===
To coincide with the relaunch of GYSB on 16 October 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20081219-108979.html Cheers! Drink moderately and Get Your Sexy Back!], Asiaone News, 19 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; singer-songwriter Jillian-Marie Thomas, also a volunteer ambassador, wrote and composed a theme song for the GYSB programme.

GYSB also entered into a collaboration with [[Sony Music Entertainment]], producing a set of GYSB CD inserts which were released together with the launch of the 'Capricorn' album from Taiwanese singer [[Jay Chou]] in October 2008.

On 4 April 2009, GYSB staged a concert at The Heeren shopping mall featuring a Singaporean band, "Da Feng Chui". The band, who was an on [[MediaCorp Channel U|Channel U]]'s Superband 2008 talent-search, and also launched their debut album in conjunction with the concert dedicating one of the songs on the album to the Get Your Sexy Back campaign.

On 9 December 2009, GYSB staged a music concert in support of responsible drinking at popular nightspot Velvet Underground. The concert featured regional superstar JJ Lin, SuperBand 2008 runners-up Da Feng Chui, Project Superstar alumni Chen Diya and Carrie Yeo, homegrown singer/songwriter Jillian Marie Thomas, and indie-alternative band en(x).&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.omy.sg/blogclub/2009/12/16/get-your-sexy-back-by-drinking-responsibly/ |title=Get Your Sexy Back, by drinking responsibly |date=16 December 2009|publisher=OMY}}&lt;/ref&gt; All proceeds from the concert were donated to sporting clubs and student associations from Singapore's three main universities. Also announced at the concert were a new range of GYSB T-shirts, designed by local fashionistas, designers and fashion bloggers; and the details of a new membership benefits programme dubbed the GYSB Friends Card.

===Fashion===
Singaporean fashion and lifestyle label NewUrbanMale.com (NUM) designed an exclusive range of 'NUMXGYSB' T-shirts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayonline.com/articles/282201.asp "Drinking’s not Sexy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018210922/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/282201.asp |date=18 October 2008 }}. ''TODAY'', 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2008. The shirts, each bearing the [[slogan]] "Two beers or not two beers" were retailed at selected NUM stores island-wide and were designed by NUM founder Shenzi Chua who has likened the slogan to a question on the difficult choices confronting youths when dealing with alcohol.

In December 2009, GYSB launched the third generation of GYSB T-shirts with a collection of three designs by local fashion bloggers Dinnie &amp; Ridhwan, design student Sid Lim and T-shirt printing specialists Ministry of Press.

===Sports===
On 18 Oct 2008, GYSB teamed up with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Sports Club to reach out to students at the NTU Street Challenge, the university's largest annual on-campus sporting event.

GYSB was also supported by the National Vertical Marathon 2009, Singapore Management University (SMU) Surf n Sweat 2009, SMU Waikiki, Freshmen Sports Orientation Camp and Sports Fiesta.

===Friends===
In 2007, the student founders of GYSB created a group page on the popular [[social media]] platform, Facebook to serve as an avenue where like-minded youths could come together and share their thoughts and experiences on moderate drinking.

In April 2009, a group of [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS) students, created and distributed a game via Facebook called "GYSB Matching Fury" as a way of spreading the message of moderate drinking via [[social networks]].

In December 2009, GYSB announced the launch of a membership benefits programme called the GYSB Friends Card. Given away free to programme supporters, the card gives discounts and other privileges at retailers across Singapore. Current commercial partners include Leftfoot, Times the Bookshop and Ministry of Press.

'''Glomerulopathy''' is a set of diseases affecting the [[glomeruli]] of the [[nephron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000045119|glomerulopathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such diseases can include processes that are inflammatory or noninflammatory. Because the term ''glomerulitis'' exists for inflammatory conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000045095|glomerulitis}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''glomerulopathy'' sometimes carries a noninflammatory implication.

'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NO''' refers to an [[upselling]] campaign by [[Coca-Cola]] to dissuade consumers from ordering [[tap water]] drinks at restaurants, and to instead order more profitable [[soft drink]]s, non-carbonated beverages, or [[bottled water]]. The campaign's title, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NO, reflects the program's purpose, which is to have customers say ''No'' to ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'', the [[chemical formula]] for water. The program taught waiters how to use "suggestive selling techniques" to offer a variety of alternative beverages when diners asked for water.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"&gt;{{cite news| title=Forget Tap Water, Serve Coke, Restaurants Told |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=September 5, 2001 |last=Willey |first=Jo |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-77850308.html}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, a link to a story about the program's success at [[Olive Garden]] was posted to [[Cockeyed.com]]. The link was reposted around the internet, until the story was taken down by Coca-Cola on August 2, 2001, for fears it might be misinterpreted. On August 20, 2001, the story was covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/02/weekinreview/word-for-word-deep-water-just-say-no-to-h20-unless-it-s-coke-s-own-brew.html&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently by a number of news providers.

The campaign ran only in the United States.&lt;ref name="Evening Standard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowan|first=David|title=Coke's war on water; Drinks giant trains waiters to boost sales in 'H2No' campaign.|url=http://business.highbeam.com/5729/article-1G1-77822850/coke-war-water-drinks-giant-trains-waiters-boost-sales|accessdate=29 August 2012|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=September 4, 2001 |page=21}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a success story on Coca-Cola's online public relations portal, entitled "The Olive Targets Tap Water &amp; WINS", Coca-Cola described the purpose, implementation, and success in reducing "tap water incidence".

Coca-Cola stated that customers chose tap water out of habit, and that selling alternative beverages would increase guest satisfaction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Water. It's necessary to sustain life, but to many Casual Dining restaurant chains it contributes to a dull dining experience for the customer. Many customers choose tap water not because they enjoy it, but because it is what they always have drunk in the past. In response, some restaurant chains are implementing programs to help train crews to sell alternative choices to tap water, like soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages, with the goal of increasing overall guest satisfaction.&lt;ref name=ccp1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olive Garden Targets Tap Water &amp; WINS|url=http://customer.coca-cola.com/html/olivegard_article_ss.html|publisher=[[Coca-Cola]]|accessdate=29 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/public/coke.html|archivedate=August 1, 2001|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Olive Garden]]'s stated goal was "to influence customers to abandon their default choice of tap water and experience other beverage choices to improve their dining experience".&lt;ref name=ccp2&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olive Garden Targets Tap Water &amp; WINS|url=http://customer.coca-cola.com/html/olivegard_article_ss2.html|publisher=[[Coca-Cola]]|accessdate=29 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/public/coke.html|archivedate=August 1, 2001|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olive Garden suffered from a "high water incidence rate" and "wanted their restaurant crews to emphasize the broad array of alternative beverage selections available" so as "to influence customers to abandon their default choice of tap water and experience other beverage choices to improve their dining experience."&lt;ref name="ccp1"/&gt; In response, the Coca-Cola USA-Fountain offered the tap water reduction program H2NO.&lt;ref name="ccp1"/&gt; The H2NO program featured "beverage suggestive selling techniques (a technique used when a server suggests a profitable beverage in place of water to the customer during the ordering process)."&lt;ref name="ccp2"/&gt; Alternative beverages including soft drinks, non-carbonated beverages and alcohol would be offered which would lead to higher "overall check averages" and greater profits.&lt;ref name="ccp2"/&gt; To further improve the effectiveness of the program, the "Olive Garden developed an employee incentive contest linked to H2NO with CCUSA-Fountain called 'Just Say No to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.'"&lt;ref name="ccp2"/&gt;

The success story noted how "because of its own successful campaign against water, The Olive Garden has recently sent a powerful message to the entire restaurant industry - less water and more beverage choices mean happier customers"&lt;ref name="ccp1"/&gt; stating how:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the contest was completed, almost all participating restaurants realized significant increases in beverage sales and reduced levels of tap water incidence - a strong indication that Olive Garden restaurants succeeded in enhancing the customer's dining experience. And perhaps most importantly, Olive Garden expects to see this trend continue as the skills learned become part of the crew's everyday interaction with restaurant customers.&lt;ref name="ccp2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The program and Olive Garden success story were widely ridiculed.&lt;ref name="journal record"&gt;{{cite news|title=Replacing water with Coke?|url=http://journalrecord.com/2001/08/21/replacing-water-with-coke063-business-world/|accessdate=29 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Journal Record]]|date=August 21, 2001 }}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Olive Garden just says no to H2O!|url=http://www.metafilter.com/9399/The-Olive-Garden-just-says-no-to-H2O|publisher=[[MetaFilter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2001, [[Peter Gleick]], the director of the [[Pacific Institute]], wrote a [[letter to the editor]] of ''The New York Times'', criticizing the campaign, noting how "both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola use perfectly potable tap water as the source of their bottled waters, Aquafina and Dasani.

The '''Hybrid Assistive Limb''' (also known as '''HAL''') is a [[powered exoskeleton]] suit developed by Japan's [[Tsukuba University]] and the robotics company [[Cyberdyne Inc. (Japanese company)|Cyberdyne]]. It is designed to support and expand the physical capabilities of its users, particularly people with physical disabilities. There are two primary versions of the system: HAL 3, which only provides leg function, and HAL 5, which is a full-body exoskeleton for the arms, legs, and torso.

In 2011, Cyberdyne and Tsukuba University jointly announced that hospital trials of the full HAL suit would begin in 2012, with tests to continue until 2014 or 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110311/business/robot-suit-offers-glimmer-of-hope-to-the-paralysed |title=Robot suit offers glimmer of hope to the paralysed |work=Times of Malta |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2012, HAL suits were in use by 130 different medical institutions across Japan.&lt;ref name=October2012/&gt; In February 2013, the HAL system became the first powered exoskeleton to receive global safety certification.&lt;ref name=Certified2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gOWaBQ0XAy5M5crIrhO2uyTSyvEA?docId=CNG.722c21ce71c2b2203f35cd3432c15546.631|title=Japan robot suit gets global safety certificate|publisher=AFP via Google|date=27 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, HAL received [[European Commission|EC]] certification for clinical use in Europe as the world's first non-surgical medical treatment robot.&lt;ref name=EcAug2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuv.com/jp/japan/about_us_jp/press_2/news_1/news_contentjp_en_168321.html|title=TÜV Rheinland Issues EC certificate for Cyberdyne’s Medical Robot Suit HAL®|publisher=TÜV Rheinland|date=7 August 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TK2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanpolicyforum.jp/en/archives/economy/pt20131125174131.html|title=Global Companies from Japan|publisher=Weekly Toyo Keizai|date=14 September 2013|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its medical applications, the HAL exoskeleton has been used in construction and disaster response work.&lt;ref name=ConstructOb/&gt;&lt;ref name=18October2012/&gt;

==History==
The first HAL prototype was proposed by [[Yoshiyuki Sankai]], a professor at Tsukuba University. Fascinated with robots since he was in the third grade, Sankai had striven to make a robotic suit in order “to support humans.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy7ipDAyXtI |title=Cyberdyne power suit |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, after receiving his Ph.D. in robotics, he began the development of HAL. Sankai spent three years, from 1990 to 1993, mapping out the [[neurons]] that govern leg movement. It took him and his team an additional four years to make a prototype of the hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/nipponia/nipponia38/en/feature/feature02.html|title=HAL, a friend for people with disabilities|work=Nipponia|publisher=Web Japan|date=15 September 2006|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third HAL prototype, developed in the early 2000s, was attached to a computer. Its battery alone weighed nearly {{convert|22|kg|lb}} and required two helpers to put on, making it very impractical. By contrast, later HAL-5 model weighs only {{convert|10|kg|lb}} and has its battery and control computer strapped around the waist of the wearer.

Cyberdyne began renting the HAL suit out for medical purposes in 2008. By October 2012, over 300 HAL suits were in use by 130 medical facilities and [[nursing home]]s across Japan. The suit is available for institutional rental, in Japan only, for a monthly fee of US$2,000.&lt;ref name=October2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/robots-to-the-rescue-as-an-aging-japan-looks-for-help/story-e6frg6so-1226494698495|title=Robots to the rescue as an aging Japan looks for help|work=[[The Australian]]|date=13 October 2012|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Cyberdyne was certified [[ISO 13485]] – an international quality standard for design and manufacture of medical devices – by [[UL (safety organization)|Underwriters Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://database.ul.com/certs/PDWS.A18103.pdf|title=The design, manufacture and servicing of wearable lower limb exoskeleton devices for rehabilitation and physical training|publisher=Underwriters Laboratories|date=11 December 2012|accessdate=16 July 2013 |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late February 2013, the HAL suit received a global safety certificate, becoming the first powered exoskeleton to do so.&lt;ref name=Certified2013/&gt; In August 2013, the suit received an EC certificate, permitting its use for medical purposes in Europe as the first medical treatment robot of its kind.&lt;ref name=EcAug2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=TK2013/&gt;

==Design and mechanics==
When a person attempts to move their body, nerve signals are sent from the brain to the muscles through the motor neurons, moving the [[musculoskeletal system]]. When this happens, small [[biosignal]]s can be detected on the surface of the skin. The HAL suit registers these signals through a sensor attached to the skin of the wearer. Based on the signals obtained, the power unit moves the joint to support and amplify the wearer's motion. The HAL suit possesses a cybernic control system consisting of both a user-activated “voluntary control system" known as Cybernic Voluntary Control (CVC) and a “robotic autonomous control system" known as Cybernic Autonomous Control (CAC) for automatic motion support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1163/156855307781746061#.Uybvcl46xfY|title=Intention-based walking support for paraplegia patients with Robot Suit HAL|work=Advanced Robotics. 2007, vol. 21, pp1441-1469.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2007|accessdate=17 March 2014|doi=10.1163/156855307781746061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2377/13/141|title=Pilot study of locomotion improvement using hybrid assistive limb in chronic stroke patients|work=BMC Neurology. 2013, vol. 13, p141.|publisher=BMC|year=2013|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cybernics.tsukuba.ac.jp/english/research/index.html|title=Research Program Cybernics University of Tsukuba|work=Global COE Program, Cybernics|publisher=University of Tsukuba|date=1 April 2007|accessdate=17 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027145913/http://www.cybernics.tsukuba.ac.jp/english/research/index.html|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Users==
HAL is designed to assist the disabled and elderly in their daily tasks, but can also be used to support workers with physically demanding jobs such as disaster rescue or construction. HAL is mainly used by disabled patients in hospitals, and can be modified so that patients can use it for longer-term rehabilitation. In addition, scientific studies have shown that, in combination with specially-created therapeutic games, powered exoskeletons like the HAL-5 can stimulate cognitive activities and help disabled children walk while playing.&lt;ref name=computerdisabled2002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=646269.684335 |title=Computers for the Development of Young Disabled Children – Introduction to the Special Thematic Session|year=2002|publisher=ACM.org|accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abledata2010JNERv7n15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abledata.com/abledata.cfm?pageid=160377&amp;ksectionid=160164&amp;atlitid=198393 |title=Influence of Virtual Reality Soccer Game on Walking Performance in Robotic Assisted Gait Training for Children|publisher=AbleData.com|date=April 2010|accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further scientific studies have shown that [[HAL Therapy]] can be effectively used for rehabilitation after [[spinal cord injury]] or [[stroke]].&lt;ref name=HalResearch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walk-again.com/research/|title= Current scientific studies to exoskeleton therapy with Hybrid Assistive Limb|publisher=WALK AGAIN Center|accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">The '''Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018''' is a proposed [[bill (law)|bill]] before the [[Oireachtas]] that would allow for [[abortion in the Republic of Ireland]]. Under [[Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013|current law]], a termination is permissible only where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman. The proposal of the bill by the [[Government of Ireland]] follows the approval of the [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Thirty-sixth Amendment]] by referendum on 25 May 2018, thereby repealing the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]] which had prohibited abortion in other circumstances.
==History==
The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill was introduced into the [[Dáil Éireann]] on 27 September 2018 by the [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]] [[Simon Harris (politician)|Simon Harris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 |url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2018/105/ |website=Oireachtas |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be debated on 4 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lehane |first1=Mícheál |title=Legislation providing for abortion approved by Cabinet |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2018/0927/998329-eighth-amendment/ |website=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dáil schedule |url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/dail-schedule/?selecteddate=2018-10-04 |website=Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general scheme for the bill was published by the [[Department of Health (Ireland)|Department of Health]] in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Updated-General-Scheme-of-the-Health-Regulation-of-Termination-of-Pregnancy-Bill-2018.pdf|title=General Scheme of a bill entitled Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy Bill 2018|website=Department of Health|date=10 July 2018|access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous version of the General Scheme of a Bill to Regulate Termination of Pregnancy had been published by the Department of Health in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/General-Scheme-for-Publication.pdf|title=General Scheme of a Bill to Regulate Termination of Pregnancy|website=Department of Health|date=27 March 2018|access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2495">Health standards have greatly improved throughout the Bahamas in recent years.  New hospitals and healthcare facilities have opened  in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and [[Grand Bahama]].

There are high levels of health and economic inequality and most of the population are unable to obtain private health insurance. Catastrophic spending on healthcare has bankrupted many patients and their families.

==Diseases==
Vaccination against diseases such as measles and diphtheria has lowered the infection and death rate among children. The infection rate of HIV/AIDS is quite high — in 2013, an estimated 500 people died from AIDS in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Healthcare in the Bahamas |url=https://www.internations.org/bahamas-expats/guide/living-in-the-bahamas-15742/healthcare-in-the-bahamas-2 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=InterNations |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of [[non-communicable disease]]s have risen to the point where treatment costs challenge the viability of the healthcare system.

==Healthcare==
Free care is only provided to legal residents. The National Health Insurance program was established in 2017. 42,000 Bahamians, about 10% of the population, have enrolled. Membership is voluntary. The [[Out Islands]] are serviced by small government clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas/health |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 80 primary care providers, including 4 private labs which provides care across [[New Providence]], [[Grand Bahama]], [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] and [[Exuma]].

About 8% of GDP is spent on healthcare in 2018.   The Bahamas is one of the least efficient nations in the world when it comes to value-based care, according to the [[National Health Insurance Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=National Health Insurance A Shared Responsibility |url=http://www.nhibahamas.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/20181019-Policy-Paper-Bahamas-Public-Consultation-Final.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=NHI Bahamas |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tax on wages to fund  National Health Insurance was proposed in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NHI consultation period with stakeholders extended |url=https://ewnews.com/nhi-consultation-period-with-stakeholders-extended |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=EyeWiness News |date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macau has a universally accessible single-payer system funded by taxes collected by the government from corporations and residents.

Macau is served by one major public hospital, the [[Hospital Conde S. Januário]], and one major private hospital, the [[Kiang Wu Hospital]], both located in [[Macau Peninsula]], as well as a university associated hospital called [[Macau University of Science and Technology Hospital]] in [[Cotai]]. Currently none of the Macau hospitals have [[international healthcare accreditation]].

In addition to hospitals, Macau also has numerous health centres providing free basic medical care to residents. Consultation in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcs.gov.mo/files/spage/CFA10_E.html|title=Macau Factsheet|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=The Govt. of Macau SAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently none of the Macau hospitals is independently assessed through [[international healthcare accreditation]]. There are no western-style medical schools in Macau and thus all aspiring physicians in Macau have to obtain their education and qualification elsewhere (such as at the [[University of Hong Kong]] or [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]).&lt;ref&gt;Macau Yearbook 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Local nurses are trained at the [[Macau Polytechnic Institute]] and the [[Kiang Wu Nursing College of Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.edu.mo/ess/|title=Macau Polytechnic Institute General Information|accessdate=2007-12-03|publisher=Macau Polytechnic Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwnc.edu.mo/web/cmain.htm|title=Homepage of the College of Nursing and Midwifery|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=College of Nursing and Midwifery, Macau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are no training courses in [[midwifery]] in Macau. 

The Health Bureau in Macau is mainly responsible for coordinating the activities between the public and private organisations in the area of [[public health]], and assure the health of citizens through specialised and [[primary health care]] services, as well as disease prevention and [[health promotion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/introduction/e_introduce_fs.htm|title=The introduction of Health Bureau, Macau SAR|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=The Govt. of Macau SAR|language=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912141127/http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/introduction/e_introduce_fs.htm|archivedate=2007-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention was established in 2001, which monitors the operation of hospitals, health centres, and the [[blood transfusion]] centre in Macau. It also handles the organisation of care and prevention of diseases affecting the population, sets guidelines for hospitals and private health care providers, and issues [[medical license|licences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/organization/e_legis_fs.htm|title=The policy and functions of the department of health, Macau SAR|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=The Govt. of Macau SAR|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912140926/http://www.ssm.gov.mo/design/organization/e_legis_fs.htm|archivedate=2007-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idiosyncratic drug reactions''', also known as '''type B reactions''', are [[Adverse drug reaction|drug reactions]] that occur rarely and unpredictably amongst the population. This is not to be mistaken with [[idiopathic]], which implies that the cause is not known. They frequently occur with exposure to new drugs, as they have not been fully tested and the full range of possible side-effects have not been discovered; they may also be listed as an [[adverse drug reaction]] with a drug, but are extremely rare. Some patients have  multiple-[[drug intolerance]]. Patients who have multiple idiopathic effects that are nonspecific are more likely to have anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name="pmid12622606"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies SJ, Jackson PR, Ramsay LE, Ghahramani P |title=Drug intolerance due to nonspecific adverse effects related to psychiatric morbidity in hypertensive patients |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=163 |issue=5 |pages=592–600 |year=2003 |pmid=12622606 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.5.592}}&lt;/ref&gt;Idiosyncratic drug reactions appear to not be concentration dependent. A minimal amount of drug will cause an immune response, but it is suspected that at a low enough concentration, a drug will be less likely to initiate an [[immune response]].

== Mechanism ==
In adverse drug reactions involving overdoses, the toxic effect is simply an extension of the pharmacological effect (Type A adverse drug reactions). On the other hand, clinical symptoms of idiosyncratic drug reactions (Type B adverse drug reactions) are different from the pharmacological effect of the drug.

The proposed mechanism of most idiosyncratic drug reactions is immune-mediated toxicity. To create an immune response, a foreign molecule must be present that antibodies can bind to (i.e. the antigen) and cellular damage must exist. Very often, drugs will not be immunogenic because they are too small to induce immune response. However, a drug can cause an immune response if the drug binds a larger molecule. Some unaltered drugs, such as [[penicillin]], will bind avidly to proteins. Others must be bioactivated into a toxic compound that will in turn bind to proteins. The second criterion of cellular damage can come either from a toxic drug/drug metabolite, or from an injury or infection.
These will sensitize the immune system to the drug and cause a response.
Idiosyncratic reactions fall conventionally under toxicology.

[[File:Santeria333.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Inle]]
'''Inle''' is the [[orisha]] of health and all medicinal healing in [[Santería|Santeria]], and also in [[Candomblé]] and [[palo (religion)|Palo Mayombe]]. Inle is a man with fine features as of a woman. He has long silky hear and wears the finest clothes. For him to look as elegant as he does, he also became the patron of homosexuals. Inle is also said to be good acquaintances with [[Yemoja|Yemaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://agolaroye.com/Inle.php ''Inle''] in AgoLaroye.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In one [[Cuba]]n Santería "pataki", or mythological story, the sea goddess [[Yemaha]] (Yemoja) is tricked into incestuous sex with her son [[Shango]]. To hide her shame at this event, she banished her other two sons, Inle and Abbata, to live at the bottom of the ocean, additionally cutting out Inle's tongue and making Abbata deaf. As a result of their isolation and loneliness, Inle and Abbata become passionate friends and then lovers, able to communicate emphatically. This pataki is used to explain the origin of [[incest]], [[muteness]], and [[deafness]] in addition to [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 39, "Abbata"&lt;/ref&gt;

The main aim of the regulations as defined by the 1999 official code of practice was to "establish a framework for ensuring that exposure to ionising radiation arising from work activities, whether man made or natural radiation and from external radiation or internal radiation, is kept [[ALARP|as low as reasonably practicable]] (ALARP) and does not exceed dose limits specified for individuals".&lt;ref name="COP intro page 6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Work with ionising radiation Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 Approved Code of Practice and guidance |date=2000 |publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]] |isbn=978 0 7176 1746 3 |edition=1st |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pUbns/priced/l121.pdf |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100409190759/http://www.hse.gov.uk///pubns/priced/l121.pdf |archivedate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
[[File:International policy system radiological protection.png|thumb|400px|International policy relationships in radiological protection]]

The regulations came into force on 1 January 2000, replacing the 'Ionising Radiations Regulations 1985'. They effectively implement the majority of the European Basic Safety Standards Directive '96/29/Euratom' under the auspices of the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]].&lt;ref name="COP intro page 6" /&gt; This [[Directive (European Union)|European Directive]] is in turn a reflection of the recommendations of the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radioprotection/doc/legislation/9629_en.pdf The Council of the European Union | Council directive 96/29/Euratom laying down the basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123022701/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radioprotection/doc/legislation/9629_en.pdf |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulations are aimed at employers and are enforced by the [[Health and Safety Executive]](HSE). They form the legal basis for ionising radiation protection in the United Kingdom (UK), although work with ionising radiation is also controlled in the UK through other statutory instruments such as the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and the [[Radioactive Substances Act 1993]].&lt;ref name="COP intro page 6" /&gt;

The IRR99 make legal requirements including prior authorisation of the use of [[particle accelerators]] and [[x-ray]] machines, the appointment of ''radiation protection supervisors (RPS) and advisers (RPA)'', control and restriction of exposure to ionising radiation (including dose limits), and a requirement for local rules. Local rules including the designation of ''controlled areas'', defined as places where "special procedures are needed to restrict significant exposure".

In 2013 the [[European Union]] adopted directive 2013/59/Euratom which requires updated Ionising Radiations Regulations to implement the directive in UK law by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directive 2013/59/Euratom - protection against ionising radiation|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/directive-2013-59-euratom-protection-against-ionising-radiation|website=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes include reduced eye dose limits as a result of updated ICRP recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revision of Radiation Protection directives including Basic Safety Standards (BSS) and  Outside Workers directives|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/europe/euronews/dossiers/radiationprotect.htm|website=Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on Tissue Reactions|url=http://www.icrp.org/page.asp?id=123|website=ICRP|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ionising and non-ionising radiation and associated health risks===
The regulations impose duties on employers to protect employees and anyone else from radiation arising from work with radioactive substances and other forms of ionising radiation.&lt;ref name="explanatory note" /&gt;  In the United Kingdom the [[Health and Safety Executive]] is one of a number of public bodies which regulates workplaces which could expose workers to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/radiation/index.htm HSE | Radiation]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Radiation itself is energy that travels either as electromagnetic waves, or as subatomic particles and can be categorised as either 'ionising' or 'non-ionising radiation'.&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, T.  'Health and safety for managers, supervisors and safety representatives', Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, 2008 p. 240 {{ISBN|978-1-904306-84-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Ionising radiation]] occurs naturally but can also be artificially created.  Generally people can be exposed to radiation externally from radioactive material or internally by inhaling or ingesting radioactive substances.&lt;ref name="hse ionising radiation"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/radiation/ionising/ HSE | Ionising radiation]&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure to electromagnetic rays such as x-rays and gamma rays can, depending on the time exposed, cause sterility, genetic defects, premature ageing and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/health/chip/od/radiation/#xfive National Institute of Health | What are the adverse effects of Ionising radiation]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Non-ionising radiation]] is the terms used to describe the part of the electromagnetic spectrum covering 'Optical radiation', such as ultraviolet light and 'electromagnetic fields' such as microwaves and radio frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/radiation/nonionising/index.htm HSE | Non Ionising radiation]&lt;/ref&gt;  Health risks caused by exposure to this type of radiation will often be as a result of too much exposure to ultraviolet light either from the sun or from sunbeds which could lead to [[skin cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/cancer-questions/radiation-microwaves-and-cancer#non Cancer help | Non Ionising radiation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key areas of the regulations===
The regulations are split into seven parts containing 41 regulations.&lt;ref name="explanatory note"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3232/note/made Legislation.gov.uk | The Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999 - explanatory note]&lt;/ref&gt; under the following sections.

* Interpretation and General
* General Principles and Procedures
* Arrangements for The Management of Radiation Protection
* Designated Areas
* Classification and Monitoring of Persons
* Arrangements for the Control of Radioactive Substances, Articles and Equipment
* Duties of Employees and Miscellaneous

===Dose limits===
In addition to requiring that radiation employers ensure that doses are kept as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) the IRR99 also defines dose limits for certain classes of person. Dose limits do not apply to people undergoing a medical exposure or to those acting as "comforters and carers" to such.

===Key changes===
The main changes in the 2017 regulations are summarised in the approved code of practice.&lt;ref name="2017 COP" /&gt; These include:
* Reduced eye dose limit
* "Graded approach" to authorisation
* Broader definition of outside worker
* Requirement for procedures to estimate dose to the public
* Changes to guidance on cooperation of employees and timescale for medical appeals

The introduction of the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2017 (IRMER17, the legislation that governs medical exposures in the UK) amended IRR17 to remove the regulation concerning medical equipment. These requirements are now under IRMER17.&lt;ref name="2017 COP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2017: guidance |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ionising-radiation-medical-exposure-regulations-2017-guidance |website=GOV.UK |publisher=Department of Health and Social Care |accessdate=3 July 2018 |language=en |date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dose limits===
The dose limit to the lens of the eye has been reduced based on [[ICRP]] recommendation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clement |first1=C.H. |last2=Stewart |first2=F.A. |last3=Akleyev |first3=A.V. |last4=Hauer-Jensen |first4=M. |last5=Hendry |first5=J.H. |last6=Kleiman |first6=N.J. |last7=MacVittie |first7=T.J. |last8=Aleman |first8=B.M. |last9=Edgar |first9=A.B. |last10=Mabuchi |first10=K. |last11=Muirhead |first11=C.R. |last12=Shore |first12=R.E. |last13=Wallace |first13=W.H. |title=ICRP PUBLICATION 118: ICRP Statement on Tissue Reactions and Early and Late Effects of Radiation in Normal Tissues and Organs — Threshold Doses for Tissue Reactions in a Radiation Protection Context |journal=Annals of the ICRP |date=February 2012 |volume=41 |issue=1-2 |pages=1–322 |doi=10.1016/j.icrp.2012.02.001 |url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20118}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new limits are now as follows

Many reasons have been proposed for JUUL's popularity among teenagers. Among these are its ease of concealment, sleek high-tech design, and JUUL pod flavors. JUUL's resemblance to a flash drive makes it easy to conceal,&lt;ref name=Chen2017 /&gt; and its low vapor output and subtle scent,&lt;ref name=Teitell2017 /&gt; which can be passed off as perfume,&lt;ref name=Teitell2017 /&gt; mean that it can be used discreetly, even in class.&lt;ref name=Chen2017 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tobin /&gt; Similarly, the device's small size allows it to be concealed in clothing or elsewhere; a high school in [[Newton, Massachusetts]] discovered a JUUL disguised as a sharpie, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vaping In School Raises Concerns From Administration, Parents |url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/11/16/vape-ecigarette-juul-high-school/ |work=CBS Boston |date=16 November 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; JUUL's sleek and high-tech design, which is often compared to that of the iPhone, is also often cited as a reason for its popularity with young people.&lt;ref name=Tobin /&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huang2018 /&gt; Finally, JUUL's sweet flavors, especially the fruit and [[crème brûlée]] ones, are especially attractive to children, according to journalists,&lt;ref name=NewYorker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Teitell2017 /&gt; academics,&lt;ref name=Chen2017 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huang2018 /&gt; and the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name=Gottlieb9 /&gt; In response, JUUL renamed some flavors—"cool cucumber" to "cucumber" and "crème brûlée" to "creme"—saying that it “heard the criticism” and “responded by simplifying the names and losing the descriptors.”&lt;ref name=life /&gt;

A 2018 Truth Initiative survey found that 74% of JUUL users ages 12–17 got their device from a brick and mortar store, 52% got theirs from a friend or family member, and only 6% got theirs online (respondents could select multiple answers).&lt;ref name=TI0418&gt;{{cite web |title=Where are kids getting JUUL? |url=https://truthinitiative.org/news/where-are-kids-getting-juul |website=Truth Initiative |accessdate=October 28, 2018 |language=en |date=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For context, JUUL estimates that 90% of its sales are in brick and mortar stores.&lt;ref name=LaVito /&gt;

== Food and Drug Administration investigations ==

=== International ===
In May 2018, JUUL started selling in Israel, which did not regulate e-cigarettes at the time.&lt;ref name=Linder-Ganz2018&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/juul-warns-it-will-fight-israel-over-potential-ban-on-its-e-cigarettes-1.6140058|title=Juul Warns It Will Fight Israel Over Potential Ban on Its E-cigarettes|first=Ronny |last=Linder-Ganz|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel later banned JUUL in August 2018, citing public health concerns, according to a statement by the [[Ministry of Health (Israel)|Ministry of Health]].&lt;ref name=Ben-Ozer2018/&gt; Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], acting in his capacity as Health Minister,&lt;ref name=Linder-Ganz08/&gt; placed a complete ban on JUUL because it delivers nearly three times Israel's recommended amount of 20&amp;nbsp;mg/ml of nicotine.&lt;ref name=Ben-Ozer2018&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ben-Ozer|first1=Tamar|last2=Levi|first2=Sarah|url=https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/Israel-bans-JUUL-electronic-cigarettes-565442|title=Israel bans high-nicotine Juul e-cigarettes|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=August 23, 2018|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Linder-Ganz08 /&gt; JUUL has appealed the ban to Israel's [[Supreme Court of Israel#High Court of Justice|High Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name=Linder-Ganz08&gt;{{cite news |last1=Linder-Ganz |first1=Ronny |title=Juul Asks Israel's Top Court to Block Ban on E-cigarettes |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/juul-asks-israel-s-top-court-to-block-ban-on-e-cigarettes-1.6411472 |accessdate=29 August 2018 |work=Haaretz |date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, JUUL announced it would launch in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-juul-britain/fast-growing-e-cigarette-maker-juul-to-launch-in-uk-idUSKBN1K62WC|title=Fast-growing e-cigarette maker Juul to launch in UK|last=Geller|first=Martinne|work=Reuters |date=July 16, 2018 |access-date=September 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, JUUL introduced its products into Canada, starting with an online launch before introducing them to vape shops, gas stations, and convenience stores in early September.&lt;ref name=Peng&gt;{{cite news |last1=Peng |first1=Jenny |title=Vaping giant Juul plans Canadian e-cig domination amid concerns from youth groups |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2018/08/30/vaping-giant-juul-plans-canadian-e-cig-domination-amid-success-and-controversy-in-us.html |accessdate=September 28, 2018 |work=The Star |date=August 30, 2018 |location=Vancouver |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==

JUUL is intensively marketed via Instagram and other [[social media]].&lt;ref name="cumb_Stud"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Study says vaping by kids isn't up, but some are skeptical| last = Stobbe | first = Mike| work = The Sentinel| date = June 11, 2018| accessdate = June 25, 2018| url = https://cumberlink.com/live_well_in_the_cumberland_valley/study-says-vaping-by-kids-isn-t-up-but-some/article_35fe8093-dabe-5c24-969c-eaebdbfbe51b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the $2.2 million JUUL spent on marketing in 2015 and 2016, $1 million went to online marketing, according to data from [[Kantar Media]].&lt;ref name=Huang2018&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2018-054382| last1 = Huang| first1 = Jidong| last2 = Duan| first2 = Zongshuan| last3 = Kwok| first3 = Julian| last4 = Binns| first4 = Steven| last5 = Vera| first5 = Lisa E.| last6 = Kim| first6 = Yoonsang| last7 = Szczypka| first7 = Glen| last8 = Emery| first8 = Sherry L.| title = Vaping versus JUULing: how the extraordinary growth and marketing of JUUL transformed the US retail e-cigarette market| journal = Tobacco Control| accessdate = 2018-09-26| date = May 2018| url = https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2018/05/31/tobaccocontrol-2018-054382| pmid = 29853561}}&lt;/ref&gt; JUUL's heavy reliance on social media marketing is unique among major e-cigarette brands in the US—blu and NJOY were initially promoted mainly with television advertising while Vuse and MarkTen relied on promotional expenditures to consumers and retailers—and is touted as a major reason for its success.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huang2018 /&gt; JUUL's use of social media marketing is also relatively inexpensive: to promote Vuse, [[R. J. Reynolds Vapor Company]] spent over $16 million on television ads alone in 2015 and 2016, according to Kantar data.&lt;ref name=Huang2018 /&gt; A 2018 study found that "JUUL’s social media activities were highly correlated with JUUL retail sales."&lt;ref name=Huang2018 /&gt; 

JUUL's marketing has been criticized for targeting youth. The themes emphasized in JUUL's marketing, especially freedom, relaxation, and sex appeal;&lt;ref name=Huang2018 /&gt; the use of young models and imagery claimed to be appealing to young people;&lt;ref name=life /&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorker /&gt; and the use of social media "[[influencer]]s" and affiliates popular among youth are three reasons why some consider JUUL's marketing to be targeting youth.&lt;ref name=NewYorker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huang2018 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tiku2018 /&gt; In 2015, John Schachter, director of state communications for Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK), voiced concern regarding the youth of men and women portrayed in JUUL's advertising, particularly in combination with the design, stating that "We're seeing more and more irresponsible marketing of unregulated products such as e-cigarettes."&lt;ref name=Harty2015&gt;{{cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/juul-hopes-reinvent-e-cigarette-ads-campaign/299142/|title=Juul Hopes To Reinvent E-Cigarette Ads with 'Vaporized' Campaign|first=Declan |last=Harty |work=[[Advertising Age]]|date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, CTFK Vice President of Communications Wilmore stated that JUUL Labs "used the same imagery and themes that tobacco companies have always used to appeal to kids, and they fueled it with social media."&lt;ref name=Tobin /&gt;

JUUL Labs argues that its marketing is targeted at adult cigarette smokers who are looking to quit.&lt;ref name=Davis6 /&gt; The rectangular design of the JUUL e-cigarette, for example, was chosen to avoid reminding smokers of a cigarette,&lt;ref name=NewYorker /&gt; according to a JUUL executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teens are hooked on Juul, but a top exec insists that was never the company's intention |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/juul-ecigarette-executive-addresses-concerns-product-appeals-directly-to-teens-vaping/ |accessdate=September 28, 2018 |work=CBS News |date=June 14, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, JUUL implemented a new marketing code to avoid the appearance of targeting youth.&lt;ref name=Davis6&gt;{{cite press release |last=David |first=Victoria |date= June 14, 2018 |title=JUUL Labs Implements New Social Media Policy for Instagram, Facebook and Twitter in Ongoing Effort to Combat Underage Use and Drive Awareness of Mission to Help Adult Smokers |url=https://support.juul.com/learn/read/juul-labs-implements-new-social-media-policy |location=San Francisco |publisher=JUUL Labs |access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes brought about by the new code include only showcasing former smokers age 35 or older in ads,&lt;ref name=life /&gt; no longer featuring models on social media,&lt;ref name=Davis6 /&gt; removing social media accounts that marketed to teenagers, including @Doit4JUUL, which had more followers than the main JUUL account,&lt;ref name=NewYorker /&gt; and adding the label "the alternative for adult smokers" to its packaging and many of its ads.&lt;ref name=NewYorker /&gt;

JUUL's marketing has been the focus of two lawsuits filed against the company since April 2018. The suits, both filed in California, claim that JUUL was deceptively marketed as safe even though a JUUL pod contains as much nicotine as an average pack of cigarettes.&lt;ref name=Peng /&gt; According to the first suit, filed in US District Court in April, "the intense dosage of nicotine salts delivered by the Juul products resulted in an increased nicotine addiction, and an increased consumption of nicotine by [plaintiff] Colgate."&lt;ref name=Tiku2018&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tiku |first1=Nitasha |title=Users Sue Juul for Addicting Them to Nicotine |url=https://www.wired.com/story/users-sue-juul-for-addicting-them-to-nicotine/ |accessdate=September 24, 2018 |work=Wired |date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health concerns ==

JUUL's health concerns have been debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Pierce|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/pax-juul-ecig/|title=This Might Just Be the First Great E-Cig|work=Wired |date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ari Atkins, Pax Labs' R&amp;D engineer, said "We don’t think a lot about addiction here because we’re not trying to design a cessation product at all."&lt;ref name=Tiku2015/&gt; He added, "anything about health is not on our mind."&lt;ref name=Tiku2015&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/21/8458629/pax-labs-e-cigarette-juul|title=Startup behind the Lambo of vaporizers just launched an intelligent e-cigarette|first=Nitasha |last=Tiku |work=[[The Verge]]|date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb stated that the nicotine in JUUL is sufficient to result in addiction.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb/&gt; Gottlieb further stated, "In some cases, our kids are trying these products and liking them without even knowing they contain nicotine. And that’s a problem, because as we know the nicotine in these products can rewire an adolescent’s brain, leading to years of addiction."&lt;ref name=Gottlieb/&gt;

Concerns about the effect of nicotine delivered by JUUL on the developing adolescent brain have led to a lawsuit against the company. The suit, filed in US District Court in New York in June 2018, alleges that JUUL contains more nicotine than necessary to satisfy an adult smoker, and that use of JUUL by the 15-year old son of the [[plaintiff]] made him "heavily addicted to nicotine" causing him to be "anxious, highly irritable and prone to angry outbursts."&lt;ref name=Tiku2018 /&gt;

[[File:James Graham Cooper 1865.jpg|thumb|James Graham Cooper.]]  
'''James Graham Cooper''' (June 19, 1830 – July 19, 1902) was an American surgeon and naturalist.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;

Cooper was born in New York. He worked for the [[California Geological Survey]] (1860–1874) with [[Josiah Dwight Whitney]], [[William Henry Brewer]] and [[Henry Nicholas Bolander]]. He was primarily a [[zoologist]], but he also made significant [[Botany|botanical]] collections from [[San Diego]] to [[Fort Mohave, Arizona]] in 1861. Cooper was active in the [[California Academy of Sciences]], eventually becoming Director of the Museum.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;

He obtained his medical degree in 1851 and practiced in New York City until 1853. [[Spencer F. Baird]], the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution at that time, helped Cooper work with the Pacific railroad survey parties working in the Washington Territory. He joined this survey under Captain [[George McClellan]] as a surgeon until 1854. In 1855 he visited San Francisco and the Panama Isthmus. He collected many birds during this expedition.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;

In 1860, her returned west and joined the Blake Expedition that went from St. Louis up to the Missouri River and into Idaho and Washington. He worked as a contract surgeon for brief periods with the US Army and Josiah Whitney, the chief of the California Geological Survey. Along with Baird he wrote a book on the birds of California "Ornithology, Volume I, Land Birds" in 1870.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;

His marriage in 1866 made it difficult for him to balance his interest in natural history. He worked in San Mateo, Oakland, San Francisco and finally settled in 1875 in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]]. He wrote on his difficulties in a letter in 1870

{{quote|In this country, like most others, the pursuit of science as a private business is a losing game ... Almost all the 'enlightened' people of this city know me as a 'naturalist,' which is the title of all the taxidermists also, and ... they avoid employing me professionally as they would a bird-stuffer. The consequence is that ... my patients are among the poor and ignorant, who don't know much about me and don't pay either ... My time is much taken up now in running about trying to raise money enough to pay expenses ... As I am not worse off than most other naturalists, I ought not to complain, I suppose, ... Hoping you may not get down to my condition (the best of wishes), I remain, ...}}

His father [[William Cooper (conchologist)|William Cooper]] was also a naturalist.&lt;ref name="Emerson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emerson|first=W. O.|title=[[s:The Condor/1 (1)/Dr. James G.

'''Krasnoyarsk Reservoir''', known also as the '''Krasnoyarsk Sea''', is an [[artificial lake]] which was created by the construction of the [[Krasnoyarsk Dam]]. It is one of the largest artificial reservoirs in the world. In Russia, it now ranks second (after the [[Bratsk Reservoir]]).

The top point of the reservoir is located near the town of Abakan, at the confluence of the Yenisei river Abakan. Lower spot - Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric power station dam. The distance from the top point to the Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric power station on the line - about 250 kilometers, but the total length of the reservoir is much more - 388 kilometers. Width at widest points is 15 kilometers. Height of the water's edge - 243 meters above sea level.

In the reservoir flow some pretty major rivers, including the right bank - Tuba, Sisim, Syda, on the left - Biryusa. At the confluence of the rivers flow directly into the previously Yenisei, creating reservoirs formed bays. The most significant of them - Tubin, Syda, Karasug, Sisim, Durbin, Biryusinsk.

The largest settlements located on the shore of the reservoir are regional centers Abakan, Krasnoturansk (located on the Bay Syda) and Novoselovo. Bridges over the reservoir absent nearest bridge across the Yenisei located a few kilometers above and below the reservoir. However, through the reservoir ferry connections, particularly from the villages and Novoselovo Bellyk. Until the early 1990s, there was a passenger-carrying hydrofoil in the reservoir.

When creating the reservoir, the location of one of the first Russian settlements in Siberia was flooded. It had been populated by Khakassky tribes - Abakan fort (near modern Krasnoturansk).

{{nihongo|'''Lake Tanuki '''|田貫湖|Tanuki-ko}} is a [[lake]] near [[Mount Fuji]], [[Japan]]. It is located in [[Fujinomiya, Shizuoka|Fujinomiya]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], and is part of the [[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]].

==History==
Originally a swampy area, the lake was created in 1935 by diverting the waters of nearby Shiba River to create a reservoir for use in irrigation. The lake is now a popular vacation location, with camp sites, fishing, boating and is noted for its views of Mount Fuji.

'''''Lipsett Diaries''''' ({{lang-fr|Les journaux de Lipsett}}) is a 2010 short [[animated documentary]] about the life and art of [[collage film]]maker [[Arthur Lipsett]], animated and directed by [[Theodore Ushev]] and written by [[Chris Robinson (writer)|Chris Robinson]].&lt;ref name=Larissa&gt;{{cite news|last=Cahute|first=Larissa|title=Genie Awards: Finding the 'crazy manic sides'|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/health/Genie+Awards+Finding+crazy+manic+sides/4414021/story.html#ixzz1GXELGIXa|accessdate=14 March 2011|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14-minute film was produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in [[Montreal]], where Lipsett had worked from 1958 to 1972, before committing suicide in 1986. The film is narrated by [[Xavier Dolan]].&lt;ref name="coll"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lipsett Diaries|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=57550|work=Collection|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
Ushev was inspired to make a film about Lipsett, after Robinson had forwarded him an email where the late filmmaker was discussed. Until that point, Ushev had never heard of Lipsett. He began to do some research and was surprised to learn that Lipsett had lived on the same street as him in Montreal. Ushev went to the building where Lipsett once lived and met with the [[concierge]], who showed him a locker where belongings from former tenants were stored. There, Ushev discovered a small blue notebook with "Lipsett" written on it, containing notes by the late filmmaker.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Chris|title=Animators Unearthed: A Guide to the Best of Contemporary Animation|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-2956-8|pages=130–131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oozKz8Hu4xIC&amp;pg=PA130 |authorlink=Chris Robinson (Ottawa)|accessdate=8 September 2011|date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film was animated by hand-painting the frames, using computer editing to link the images. Ushev estimated that 40 frames were painted per day during production.&lt;ref name=Wilger/&gt; ''Lipsett Diaries'' was Robinson's first attempt at screenwriting. A year after completing his script detailing Lipsett's troubled life, including his battle with [[bipolar disorder]], Robinson was himself diagnosed with a mild form of the condition.&lt;ref name=Larissa/&gt;

==Reception==
''Lipsett Diaries'' received the [[Genie Award for Best Animated Short]] at the [[31st Genie Awards]].&lt;ref name=WilnerGenie&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilner|first=Norman|title=Divvying up the Genies|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/daily/movies/story.cfm?content=179583|accessdate=13 March 2011|newspaper=[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, it received three awards at the 2011 [[Golden Sheaf Awards]]: for Animation, the Founder’s Award, and Best of Festival.&lt;ref name=Wilger&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilger|first=Devin|title=Lipsett Diaries captures top honor|url=http://www.yorktonnews.com/article/20110602/YORKTONNEWS0101/306029986/-1/YORKTONNEWS/lipsett-diaries-captures-top-honor|accessdate=8 September 2011|newspaper=Yorkton News Review|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miyako Nanseien Sanatorium''', ('''National Sanatorium Miyako Nanseien''') is a sanatorium for [[leprosy]] and ex-leprosy patients at [[Miyakojima, Okinawa|Miyakojima]], [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]], starting in 1931.

==History==

===Background===
Following the establishment of 5 prefectural sanatoriums in 1909, the treatment of patients in Okinawa Prefecture was inconsistent, because of the presence of resistance to the establishment of sanatoriums. On the [[Miyako Island]], however, the resistance was relatively low.

===Miyako Hoyoen and Miyako Sanatorium===
* March 6, 1931: Okinawa Prefectural Miyako Hoyoen Sanatorium was opened.
* Oct 6, 1933: National (transient) Sanatorium Miyako Santorium.

===Miyako Nanseien Sanatorium===
* Jul 1, 1941: National Sanatorium Miyako Nanseien
* Mar 1945: Destroyed by air raids.
* Jan 1946: Under [[United States|American]] rule.
* Apr 1, 1951: [[Ryukyu Government]] Sanatorium Miyako Nanseien.
* May 15, 1972: National Sanatorium Miyako Nanseien.
* Apr 1996: The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law was abolished.
* Jul 1998: The trial for compensation started.
* May 11, 2001: The trial for compensation ruled that the previous Leprosy Prevention was unconstitutional.
* May 25, 2001: The trial for compensation was confirmed. The compensation of 8,000,000 [[yen]] to 14,000,000 yen was given to patients depending on the duration of unconstitutional periods.

===Number of in-patients===
* The number of in-patients is the sum of patients which changed not only by the newly diagnosed hospitalized and those who died among in-patients, by other factors such as the number of patients who escaped or were discharged, depending on the condition of the times. Recently they were encouraged to be discharged, but the long period of the segregation policy causing leprosy stigma might influence the number of those who went into the society.

==Miyako Nanseien and war==
* Oct 10, 1944:The first air attack at [[Miyakojima]].
* Mar 26, 1945: The second raid, and 1 patient was killed, and 4 or 5 wounded, who later died. Patients began to live in caves or other places.
* April 3, 1945: the sanatorium was completely destroyed.
* Aug 1945: the end of [[World War II]].
* Sept 1945: Patients knew the end of war.
* In 1945, a total of 110 patients died, mostly of [[malaria]] and [[malnutrition]].

==Nusudogama (Pirates' cave)==
* This is a [[stalactite]] cave situated in the middle of a cliff some hundred meters from the sanatorium. Genroku Shimoji went to the cave escaping the air raids with several people. He was born in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Testimonies concerning Hansen's disease, Miyako Nanseien-hen, 2007, p240&lt;/ref&gt;
** "There was a big air raid. Airplanes attacked with machine-guns. I went to the [[Nusudogama]], with a child and an old man. Every day people died, and the child and the old man, who was a principal of a school, died.　It was an awful task to bring his body to the sanatorium. I got malaria, but I was lucky since I was young. In September, I went out of the cave. All buildings had been burned down and we made small hatches with Adan trees. We planted vegetables and [[tapioca]]. Later, American soldiers presented food and clothes (Licensed agencies for relief in Asia)."

The '''Nancy School''' was a French hypnosis-centered school of psychotherapy. The origins of the thoughts were brought about by [[Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault]] in 1866, in [[Nancy, France]].  Through his publications and therapy sessions he was able to gain the attention/support from Hippolyte Bernheim: another Nancy Doctor that further evolved Liébeault's thoughts and practices to form what is known as the Nancy School.

It is referred to as the Nancy School to distinguish it from the antagonistic "[[The Salpêtrière School of Hypnosis|Paris School]]" that was centred on the hysteria-centred hypnotic research of [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] at the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière Hospital]] in Paris.

==Origins==

;Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault (1823&amp;ndash;1904)&lt;ref name="Pioneers"&gt;Fancher, Raymond E., and Alexandra Rutherford. "Chapter 10: Social Influence and Social Psychology." Pioneers of Psychology: A History. New York: W.W. Norton, 2012. 415-29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Liébeault was born to a peasant family in Farrières France.&lt;ref name="Ambroise"&gt;Carlos S. Alvarado (2009) "Ambroise August Liébeault and Psychic Phenomena", ''American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis'', 52:2, 111-121&lt;/ref&gt; While expected to become a priest, he rather started his medical studies at [[Strasbourg]], where he obtained his medical degree in 1850.&lt;ref name="Ambroise" /&gt; At Strasbourg, he stumbled upon an old book about animal magnetism and became fascinated with it.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt;

He moved to Nancy, France in 1860 and opened up his own clinic.&lt;ref name="Ambroise" /&gt; Having finally established a successful practice, his thoughts turned back to that book on animal magnetism and he decided to start experimenting with hypnotic therapies.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt; He did this by offering his patients a strange bargain: they could either continue their standard methods of treatment and continue their usual fee or they could be treated hypnotically, through suggestion, for free.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt; Naturally, at first, many patients stayed with their standard methods because hypnosis at this time was still controversial. As more and more patients started receiving the hypnotic treatment and spreading news of its success, Liébeault became known as "Good Father Liébeault." &lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt;

In 1866 he published his first book titled ''Le sommeil et les états analogues, considérés surtout du point de vue de l'action du moral sur le physigue'' (Sleep and its analogous states considered from the perspective of the action of the mind upon the body)&lt;ref name="Hypnological"&gt;Carrer, L., ''Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault: The Hypnological Legacy of a Secular Saint'', Virtualbookwork.com, (College Station), 2002&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the similarities between induced sleep (or trance) and natural sleep, the features of the hypnotic state, how the induction of sleep relates to the nervous system, and the phenomena of hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Ambroise" /&gt;  Within this theory, he labeled the key difference between sleep and the hypnotic state to be "produced by suggestion and concentration on the idea of sleep and that the patient was "en rapport" with the hypnotist."&lt;ref name="Theories"&gt;Lynn, S. J., &amp; Rhue, J. W. (1991). ''Theories of hypnosis: Current models and perspectives''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was largely ignored by the medical profession&lt;ref name="Ambroise" /&gt;  due to the fact that it was obscurely written and sold very few copies.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt; However, Liébeault's theory on the hypnotic state that he devised within this book engrossed the attention of a prominent Nancy doctor, and soon to be student of Liébeault himself, [[Hippolyte Bernheim]].,&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;

;Hippolyte Bernheim (1840&amp;ndash;1919) &lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt;
Bernheim, born in [[Alsace]], received his medical degree from Strasbourg for internal medicine, specializing in heart disease and typhoid fever.,&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/20338759&lt;/ref&gt; From hearing of the reputation Liébeault was establishing with his work in hypnosis and from reading his first publication, Bernheim skeptically visited the hypnotic clinic to see for himself if all of the stories he had been hearing were true.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt; His amazement of what was happening led him to regularly visit the clinic to lean Liébeault's methods, and eventually to abandon his practice with internal medicine to become a full-time hypnotherapist.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt; Bernheim humbly became a student of Liébeault and eventually came to study the hypnotic state with him as a colleague.

Bernheim was able to bring Liébeault's ideas about suggestibility into the attention of the medical world.&lt;ref name="Ambroise" /&gt; His focus was on the patients rather than the hypnotist because he believed that the patients held the important factors to be hypnotized.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt; He believed that every human being has the trait of [[suggestibility]] but each just varied to the degree of which.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt; This idea became a staple in the train of thought of the Nancy doctors.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt; He wrote these thoughts and others, like how "suggestible patients could be successfully treated by straightforward persuasion techniques as well as by hypnosis," in his book ''De la Suggestion et de ses Applications à la Thérapeutique'' (Suggestive Therapeutics).&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt;
Although Bernheim was the leading proponent of suggestion accounting for hypnotic phenomena, he never took full credit for it all.&lt;ref name="Ambroise" /&gt;  He argued that "while suggestion was proposed by [[Abbé Faria]], and was applied by [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]], it was perfected by Liébeault."&lt;ref name="Ambroise" /&gt;

==Hypnotism==

Liébeault and his followers did not agree with the views of Charcot and the Salpêtrière hospital's school of thought. In fact they were opposed to the ideas of the hysteria-centered school of thought that was the hallmark of [[Jean-Martin Charcot]]'s Paris school. Instead they believed that:
*Hypnosis is a physiological condition, which can be induced in healthy individuals.&lt;ref name="Bremwell"&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1540701&amp;pageno=5&lt;/ref&gt; The Nancy school believed the state of mind of hypnosis was a "nonpathological psychological state of mind".&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt; This view was in direct opposition to the hysteria-centered view of hypnosis by the Paris school, which stated that hypnosis was a mental disorder.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;
*Everyone has a tendency to respond to suggestion, but while under hypnosis this condition is artificially increased.&lt;ref name="Bremwell" /&gt; They believed that suggestion was a trait that could be measured and varied within the subject.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;
*Suggestion explains all. It is a form of automatism.&lt;ref name="Bremwell" /&gt;
They believed that the deeply hypnotized subject responds automatically to suggestion before his intellectual centers have had time to bring their inhibitory action into play.&lt;ref name="Bremwell" /&gt;

Liebeault, Bernheim, and the school in Nancy believed that hypnosis was due to the physiological property in the brain of suggestibility.&lt;ref name="Phenomena"&gt;Ernest R. Hypnotic Phenomena: The Struggle for Scientific Acceptance: Modern experiments are bringing hypnotic phenomena out of the fringe area of pseudoscience into the domain of normal psychological science&lt;/ref&gt; Bernheim discovered that if he gave a subject a suggestion to return to him at ten o'clock in 13 days while under hypnosis, the subject would show up at the exact time Bernheim had suggested. The subject showed no recollection of receiving a suggestion, and stated that the "idea presented itself to his mind only at the moment at which he was required to execute it."&lt;ref name="Bernheim"&gt;Bernheim, H. (1883–1884). De la suggestion dans l'état hypnotique et dans l'état de veille. Revue Médicale de l'Est&lt;/ref&gt; In Bernheim's ''Latent Memories and Long-Term Suggestions'', he proposed that post-hypnotic suggestions were a result of his subjects periodically falling into a hypnotic state and remembering the suggestions they received from him while previously under hypnosis.&lt;ref name="Souvenirs"&gt;Bernheim, H. (1886). Souvenirs latents et suggestions à longue échéance. Revue Médicale de l'Est, 17, 97–111&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a description of one of his experiments on post-hypnotic suggestion.
"To one, I tell her during her sleep:—"Next Thursday (in five days) you will take the glass that is on the night table and put it in the suitcase that is at the foot of your bed." Three days later, having put her back to sleep, I say to her: "Do you remember what I ordered you to do?" She answers: "Yes, I must put the glass in my suitcase Thursday morning, at eight o'clock."—"Have you thought about it since I told you?"—"No"—"Think hard."—"I thought about it the following morning at eleven o'clock."—"Were you awake or asleep?"—"I was in a drowsy state." (Bernheim, 1886a, pp.&amp;nbsp;109–110)"&lt;ref name="Souvenirs" /&gt;
Bernheim theorized that memories of suggestions subjects received under hypnosis were not unconscious, instead they were latent, or dorminant until it is revived when the subject drifts into a hypnotic state.&lt;ref name="Souvenirs" /&gt;

On the other hand Charcot was the director of the Paris's large Salpetriere Hospital. He claimed that "hypnotizability and hysteria were aspects of the same underlying abnormal neurological condition."&lt;ref name="Francher"&gt;Fancher, Raymond E. ''The Nancy-Salpetriere Controversy''. 4th ed. W.W Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1996. 416. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he doubted the view of the Nancy school: that hypnotic susceptibility was a normal characteristic. Instead, "Charcot speculated that the root cause of hysteria lay in a hereditary, progressive, and generalized degeneracy of the nervous system that interferes with the ability to integrate and interconnect memories and ideas in the normal way."&lt;ref name="Francher" /&gt; While studying hysteria in Charcot's famous patient Lucie, Charcot and Janet theorized that all post-hypnotic suggestions were performed by a "dissociated consciousness". They came to this conclusion because when Lucie would have symptoms of hysteria, she would recall childhood fears. Janet then used this research as evidence that tramautic events of the past lead to the onset of symptoms of hysteria which resulted in a dissociated conscious that was expressed in hypnotic neurosis. Charcot believed that hypnotic neurosis could be described to follow three stages: catalepsy, lethargy, and somnambulism. These ideas were implemented into Charcot's grand theory of hypnotism.&lt;ref name="LeBlanc"&gt;LeBlanc, A. (2004), Thirteen days: Joseph Delboeuf versus Pierre Janet on the nature of hypnotic suggestion. J. Hist. Behav. Sci., 40: 123–147. doi: 10.1002/jhbs.20000&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of grand hypnotism was presented by Charcot to the French scientific organization and was accepted as a legitimate study.

Bernheim countered Charcot, by stating that provoked sleep was simply a consequence of suggestion.&lt;ref name="Regine"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(98)00024-7 | volume=21 | title=Hysteria, Hypnosis, and Moral Sense in French 19th-Century Forensic Psychiatry | journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry | pages=397–407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the exact opposite of the belief held by Charcot that suggestion was due to provoked sleep from the disorder of hypnotic neurosis. Bernheim believed that the "..automatic execution of suggested acts could happen while awake and without somnambulism."&lt;ref name="Regine" /&gt; He stated that "Sleep, which suspends the power of will and reasoning, merely facilitated the brain's acceptance of the suggested idea." This idea led Bernheim to accuse Charcot of "creating a cultural hysteria" at the Salpêtrière hospital that was in fact due to the suggestion and charisma of Charcot's showmanship.&lt;ref name="Regine" /&gt; Bernheim pointed out that Charcot's subjects were aware of what was expected of them while under hypnosis, Charcot and his colleagues even discussed what they expected of the patient in front of them.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt;  This included Charcot's convulsions which he implemented as a hallmark symptom of hypnotic neurosis.&lt;ref name="Regine" /&gt; Charcot's hysteria-stricken subjects gained much popularity in the hospital at Paris, and in turn the entire country.

In the end, around 1891 the Salpetriere protagonists admitted openly that they have been wrong. "Charcot too, admitted his errors on hypnotism and privately predicted that his theories of hysteria would not long survive him" Besides his mistakes, "Charcot was among the first to explore interactions between emotional and physical factors, and he raised the important subjects of hysteria and hypnosis out of scientific obscurity"&lt;ref name="Francher" /&gt;

==Influences==
One of the first influential researchers of hypnotism was Indo-Portuguese monk, [[Abbé Faria]]. He was a pioneer of the scientific study of hypnotism who believed hypnosis worked purely through the power of suggestion.

The Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]], focused on the susceptibility of the subjects and not on what the hypnotist was doing.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt; By doing this Braid was able to make a revolutionary observation and conclusion by having his subjects stare at and concentrate on a shiny object.&lt;ref name="Medicine"&gt;Conis, Elena. "MEDICINE; ESOTERICA MEDICA; Under its Spell; from Sideshows to Scientific Studies, Hypnosis Still Intrigues." Los Angeles Times: 0. Oct 02 2006. ProQuest. Web. 24 Nov. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  He notice that "the starting paralyzed the eye muscles, he concluded, and the fixed attention weakened the mind, resulting in an unusual state of the nervous system, halfway between sleep and wakefulness." &lt;ref name="Medicine" /&gt;

From this conclusion Braid announced this discovery as being neurohypnology, or nervous sleep.&lt;ref name="Pioneers" /&gt;  Braid also proposed that hypnosis would and could have a number of clinical uses, including being useful for surgical anaesthesia; all of which helped pave the way for the establishment of scientific hypnotism—and, because Braid approached hypnotism as a scientist and natural philosopher, he was able to move hypnotism beyond controversy and mystery, and give it a respectable face.&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:11299/SOURCE01 Yeates, L.B., ''James Braid: Surgeon, Gentleman Scientist, and Hypnotist'', Ph.D. Dissertation, School of History and Philosophy of Science, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, January 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernheim was a great asset to Liébeault's studies and research on hypnotism. Unlike Liébeault, Bernheim was proficient at writing effectively and communicating all of their elaborate ideas. In the book ''Pioneers of Psychology'', it states that "Bernheim was effective at elaborating these ideas in several books and articles that came to be identified as the main statements of the Nancy school."&lt;ref name="Francher" /&gt;

==Impact==
The research and theories produced by the Nancy School has had a great impact on our society today. Multiple research studies have been tested to show that these techniques are safe and effective in certain situations. D. Barrett stated that it is also "becoming clear that the skills one needs to respond to hypnosis are similar to those necessary to experience trance-like states in daily life."&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200101/the-power-hypnosis&lt;/ref&gt; According to K. Cherry, "the technique has also been clinically proven to provide medical and therapeutic benefits, most notably in the reduction of pain and anxiety. It has even been suggested that hypnosis can reduce the symptoms of dementia."&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;http://psychology.about.com/od/statesofconsciousness/a/hypnosis.htm&lt;/ref&gt; While reading through articles and research, hypnosis can affect people differently depending on their state of mind. Experiments today have given us enough information to show that hypnosis and the power of suggestion can help with certain problems in daily life; whether it be trying to quit smoking or to relieve the pain of consistent headaches.

There were many influential people in the history of psychology that have been themselves influenced by Nancy School and the concept that it believed in.  With this influence many of these psychology figures have been able to accomplish great things for psychology. These figures include, but are not limited to:
*[[Morton Prince]] who has become known for his work with dissociative disorders, or multiple personality disorders.
*[[Auguste Forel]] was a Swiss myrmecologist, neuroanatomist, and psychiatrist who is most known for his "investigations into the structure of the human brain and that of ants."
*[[Josef Breuer]] who was an Austrian physician who made crucial discoveries in neurophysiology, and also helped to lay the foundation for Freud's theory of [[psychoanalysis]] with his work with Bertha Pappenheim, more commonly known as [[Anna O]].
*[[Sigmund Freud]] who was an Austrian neurologist, and studied with Bernheim, has become to be known as "the founding father of psychoanalysis." Freud was able to translate Bernheim's first two books on hypnotism and suggestion, arguing in his preface to the first (1888) that hypnotism linked up with "familiar phenomena of normal psychological life and sleep".&lt;ref name="Quote"&gt;Quoted in Peter Gay, Freud (1988) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; His visit to Nancy to see what he called "Bernheim's astonishing experiments" gave him "the profoundest impression of the possibility that there could be powerful mental processes which nevertheless remained hidden from the consciousness of man".&lt;ref name="Quoted"&gt;Quoted in Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud () p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud read the ideas of both Charcot and Bernheim and used hypnosis as a therapeutic method in his and Breur's Studies in Hysteria (1895).&lt;ref name="Phenomena" /&gt;
*[[Émile Coué]] developed the Coué Method;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:47777/bin55efd6f6-374a-478d-8f8d-cf96f616d62f?view=true Yeates, Lindsay B. (2016a), "Émile Coué and his ''Method'' (I): The Chemist of Thought and Human Action", ''Australian Journal of Clinical Hypnotherapy &amp; Hypnosis'', Volume 38, No.1, (Autumn 2016), pp.3-27.]; [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:47760/bin73f48d52-f4cb-443f-a9c2-a5c23331c372?view=true (2016b), "Émile Coué and his ''Method'' (II): Hypnotism, Suggestion, Ego-Strengthening, and Autosuggestion", ''Australian Journal of Clinical Hypnotherapy &amp; Hypnosis'', Volume 38, No.1, (Autumn 2016), pp.28-54.]; and [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:47938/bin566a3d8c-5812-4b3a-8b19-37dffb21ecfc?view=true (2016c), "Émile Coué and his ''Method'' (III): Every Day in Every Way", ''Australian Journal of Clinical Hypnotherapy &amp; Hypnosis'', Volume 38, No.1, (Autumn 2016), pp.55-79.].&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes considered to have represented a second Nancy School.&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;Henri Ellenberger, The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970) p. 842&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Baudouin]] continuously spoke of a “New Nancy School”: e.g., [https://archive.org/details/suggestionandau00baudgoog Baudouin, C. (Paul, E &amp; Paul, C. trans.), ''Suggestion and Autosuggestion: A Psychological and Pedagogical Study Based on the Investigations made by the New Nancy School'', George Allen &amp; Unwin, (London), 1920], p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is significant that Coué never adopted Baudouin’s designation "New Nancy School"; and, moreover, according to [[Bernard Glueck Sr.|Bernard Glueck]] — Glueck, B., "New Nancy School", ''The Psychoanalytic Review'', Vol.10, (January 1923), pp.109-112; at p.112 — who had visited Coué at Nancy in 1922, Coué was “rather annoyed” with Baudouin’s unauthorized characterization of his enterprise.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye surgery, also known as ocular surgery, is surgery performed on the eye or its adnexa by an ophthalmologist.The eye is a fragile organ, and requires extreme care before, during, and after a surgical procedure. An expert eye surgeon is responsible for selecting the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient, and for taking the necessary safety precautions.

==Subspecialties==
Ophthalmology includes subspecialities which deal either with certain diseases or diseases of certain parts of the eye. Some of them are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Yolanda|title=Subspecialties of Ophthalmology|url=https://www.news-medical.net/health/Subspecialties-of-Ophthalmology.aspx|publisher=News Medical Life Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anterior segment]] surgery
* [[Cornea]], ocular surface, and external disease
* [[Glaucoma]]
* [[retina|Medical retina]], deals with treatment of retinal problems through non-surgical means.
* [[Eye surgery#Vitreo-retinal surgery|Vitreo-retinal surgery]], deals with surgical management of retinal and posterior segment diseases. Medical retina and vitreo-retinal surgery sometimes together are called [[posterior segment]] subspecialisation.
* [[Neuro-ophthalmology]]
* [[Ocular oncology]]
* [[Oculoplastics]] and orbit surgery
* [[Ophthalmic pathology]]
* [[Pediatric ophthalmology]]/[[strabismus]] (misalignment of the eyes)
* [[Refractive surgery]]
* [[Uveitis]]
* [[Veterinary medicine|Veterinary]] specialty training programs in veterinary ophthalmology exist in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acvo.com/ |title=Acvo.com |publisher=Acvo.com |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecvo.org/ |title=Ecvo.org |publisher=Ecvo.org |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Greek language|Greek]] roots of the word ophthalmology are ὀφθαλμός (''ophthalmos'', "eye") and -λoγία (-''logia'', "study, discourse"),&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=ophthalmology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ophthalmology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|o)fqalmo/s|ὀφθαλμός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., "the study of eyes". The discipline applies to all animal eyes, whether human or not, since the practice and procedures are quite similar with respect to disease processes, while differences in anatomy or disease prevalence, whether subtle or substantial, may differentiate the two.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==History==
===Ancient near east and the Greek period===
In the [[Ebers Papyrus]] from ancient Egypt dating to 1550 BC, a section is devoted to eye diseases.&lt;ref name="mrcophth" /&gt;

The pre-[[Hippocrates|Hippocratics]] largely based their anatomical conceptions of the eye on speculation, rather than [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="mrcophth" /&gt; They recognized the sclera and transparent cornea running flushly as the outer coating of the eye, with an inner layer with pupil, and a fluid at the centre. It was believed, by [[Alcamaeon]] (5th century BC) and others, that this fluid was the medium of vision and flowed from the eye to the brain by a tube. [[Aristotle]] advanced such ideas with empiricism. He dissected the eyes of animals, and discovering three layers (not two), found that the fluid was of a constant consistency with the lens forming (or congealing) after death, and the surrounding layers were seen to be juxtaposed. He and his contemporaries further put forth the existence of three tubes leading from the eye, not one. One tube from each eye met within the skull.

The Greek physician [[Rufus of Ephesus]] (1st century AD) recognised a more modern eye, with [[conjunctiva]], extending as a fourth epithelial layer over the eye.&lt;ref name="mrcophth" /&gt; Rufus was the first to recognise a two-chambered eye, with one chamber from cornea to lens (filled with water), the other from lens to retina (filled with an egg white-like substance).

[[Celsus]] the Greek philosopher of the 2nd century AD gave a detailed description of cataract surgery by the [[couching]] method.
 
The Greek physician [[Galen]] (2nd century AD) remedied some mistakes including the curvature of the cornea and lens, the nature of the optic nerve, and the existence of a [[posterior chamber of eyeball|posterior chamber]]. Though this model was a roughly correct modern model of the eye, it contained errors. Still, it was not advanced upon again until after [[Vesalius]]. A [[ciliary body]] was then discovered and the sclera, retina, choroid, and cornea were seen to meet at the same point. The two chambers were seen to hold the same fluid, as well as the lens being attached to the choroid. Galen continued the notion of a central canal, but he dissected the optic nerve and saw that it was solid. He mistakenly counted seven optical muscles, one too many. He also knew of the [[tear duct]]s.

===Ancient India===
The Indian surgeon [[Sushruta]] wrote ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' in [[Sanskrit]] in about 6th century &lt;small&gt;CE&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boslaugh|first1=Sarah|title=Encyclopedia of epidemiology|date=2007|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1412928168|page=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes 76 ocular diseases (of these 51 surgical) as well as several ophthalmological surgical instruments and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Bidyadhar, N.K. (1939), Sushruta's Ophthalmic Operations, [[Archives of Ophthalmology]], 22, page 553.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R.K. (1965), Ancient Indian Ophthalmology, The Ophthalmic Optician, 5(21),1093-1100 (the title of this journal was changed to Optometry Today in 1985), published by the Association of Optometrists, London, England.&lt;/ref&gt; His description of [[cataract surgery]] was compatible with the method of [[Couching (ophthalmology)|couching]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy, P.N., Mehra, K.S. and Deshpande, P.J. (1975), Cataract surgery performed before 800 BC, [[British Journal of Ophthalmology]], 59, page 171&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as one of the first cataract surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_agraw_susruta.htm |title=Susruta: The Great Surgeon of Yore |publisher=Infinityfoundation.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kansupada | first1 = K.

===Medieval Islam===
{{Main|Ophthalmology in medieval Islam}}
[[Image:Cheshm manuscript.jpg|thumb|240px|Anatomy of the Eye, 1200 CE]]
Medieval Islamic Arabic and Persian scientists (unlike their classical predecessors) considered it normal to combine theory and practice, including the crafting of precise instruments, and therefore found it natural to combine the study of the eye with the practical application of that knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science in the Middle Ages|author=David C. Lindberg|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1980|isbn=0-226-48233-2|page=21|authorlink=David C. Lindberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]], and others beginning with the medieval Arabic period, taught that the crystalline lens is in the exact center of the eye.&lt;ref name="Clinical Ophthalmology"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leffler CT, Hadi TM, Udupa A, Schwartz SG, Schwartz D |title=A medieval fallacy: the crystalline lens in the center of the eye |journal=Clinical Ophthalmology |volume=2016 |issue=10 |pages=649–662 |year=2016 |url=https://www.dovepress.com/a-medieval-fallacy-the-crystalline-lens-in-the-center-of-the-eye-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH#}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea was propagated until the end of the 1500s.&lt;ref name="Clinical Ophthalmology"/&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen), in his [[Book of Optics]] explained that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed to one's eyes.

[[Ibn al-Nafis]], an Arabic native of Damascus, wrote a large textbook, ''The Polished Book on Experimental Ophthalmology'', divided into two parts, ''On the Theory of Ophthalmology'' and ''Simple and Compounded Ophthalmic Drugs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|editor=Helaine Selin|author=David C. Lindberg|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=1997|isbn=0792340663|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avicenna]] wrote in his Canon "rescheth" which means "retiformis" and [[Gerard of Cremona]]
translated this around 1150 into the new word "retina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Jong|first1=Paulus T. V.

===Modern Period===
[[Image:A double sheet showing various ophthalmology instruments, ey Wellcome V0016255.jpg|thumb|240px|Early Ophthalmology instruments]]
In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[hand lens]]es were used by [[Malpighi]], and [[microscope]]s by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]], preparations for fixing the eye for study by [[Frederik Ruysch|Ruysch]], and later the freezing of the eye by [[Francois Pourfour du Petit|Petit]]. This allowed for detailed study of the eye and an advanced model. Some mistakes persisted, such as: why the pupil changed size (seen to be vessels of the iris filling with blood), the existence of the [[posterior chamber of eyeball|posterior chamber]], and the nature of the retina. Unaware of their functions, [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] noted the existence of photoreceptors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Dates in Vision Science|url=http://www.arts.rpi.edu/~ruiz/stereo_history/text/visionsc.html|website=www.arts.rpi.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they were not properly discovered until [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]] in 1834.

[[Georg Joseph Beer]] (1763–1821) was an Austrian ophthalmologist and leader of the First Viennese School of Medicine. He introduced a flap operation for treatment of [[cataract]] (Beer's operation), as well as popularizing the instrument used to perform the surgery (Beer's knife).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U2Iigywli08C&amp;printsec=titlepage |title=Fuchs, Ernst, and Alexander Duane.Text-book of Ophthalmology.

In North America, indigenous healers treated some eye diseases by rubbing or scraping the eyes or eyelids.&lt;ref name="Ophthalmology and Eye Diseases"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leffler CT, et al. |title=Ophthalmology in North America: Early Stories (1491-1801) |journal=Ophthalmology and Eye Diseases|volume=9 |pages=1–51 |year=2017 |pmid=28804247 |pmc=5533269 |doi= 10.1177/1179172117721902 |url=http://insights.sagepub.com/ophthalmology-in-north-america-early-stories-1491-1801-article-a6480 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ophthalmic surgery in Great Britain===
The first ophthalmic surgeon in Great Britain was [[John Freke (surgeon)|John Freke]], appointed to the position by the Governors of [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in 1727.  A major breakthrough came with the appointment of Baron de Wenzel (1724–90), a German who became oculist to [[King George III]] of England in 1772. His skill at removing cataract legitimized the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wyman A.L. | year = 1991 | title = Baron De Wenzel, Oculist to King George III: His Impact on British Ophthalmologists | url = | journal = Medical History | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 78–88 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300053138| pmid = 2008123 | pmc = 1036270}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first dedicated ophthalmic hospital opened in 1805 in London; it is now called [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]].  Clinical developments at Moorfields and the founding of the Institute of Ophthalmology (now part of the [[University College London]]) by [[Stewart Duke-Elder|Sir Stewart Duke-Elder]] established the site as the largest eye hospital in the world and a nexus for ophthalmic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davidson Luke | year = 1996 | title = 'Identities Ascertained': British Ophthalmology in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century | url = | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 313–333 | doi=10.1093/shm/9.3.313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===
[[File:(King1893NYC) pg479 NEW-YORK OPHTHALNIC HOSPITAL, THIRD AVENUE AND EAST 23D STREET.jpg|thumb|New York Ophthalmic Hospital, 1893]]
The prominent opticians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries included  [[Ernst Abbe]] (1840–1905), a co-owner of  at the Zeiss Jena factories in Germany where he developed numerous optical instruments. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1821-1894) was a polymath who made contributions to many fields of science and invented the [[ophthalmoscope]] in 1851. They both made theoretical calculations on image formation in optical systems and had also studied the optics of the eye. In Berlin, [[Albrecht von Graefe]] introduced [[iridectomy]] as a treatment for glaucoma and improved cataract surgery, he is also considered the founding father of the German Ophthalmological Society.

===Central Europe===
Numerous ophthalmologists fled Germany after 1933 as the Nazis began to persecute those of Jewish descent.  A representative leader was [[Joseph Igersheimer]] (1879–1965), best known for his discoveries with arsphenamine for the treatment of syphilis.  He fled to [[Turkey]] in 1933. As one of eight emigrant directors in the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Istanbul]], he built a modern clinic and trained students. In 1939, he went to the United States, becoming a professor at Tufts University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Namal Arin, Reisman Arnold | year = 2007 | title = Joseph Igersheimer (1879–1965): A Visionary Ophthalmologist and his Contributions before and after Exile | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Biography | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 227–234 | doi=10.1258/j.jmb.2007.06-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; German ophthalmologist, [[Gerhard Meyer-Schwickerath]] is widely credited with developing the predecessor of laser coagulation, photocoagulation. In 1946, he conducted the first experiments on light coagulation. In 1949, he performed the first successful treatment of a retinal detachment with a light beam (light coagulation) by with a self-constructed device on the roof of the ophthalmic clinic at the [[University of Hamburg|University of Hamburg-Eppendorf]].&lt;ref name="Goes"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/813930522|title=Eye in history|last=Goes|first=Frank|date=2013|publisher=Jaypee Brothers|isbn=9789350902745|location=New Delhi|oclc=813930522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/720191230|title=Modern ophthalmology : the highlights : the account of a master wintnessing a 60 year epoch of evolution and progress (1950-2010)|last=Boyd|first=Benjamin|date=2010|publisher=Jaypee-Highlights Medical Publishers|isbn=9789962678168|location=Panama|oclc=720191230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish  ophthalmology dates to the 13th century. The Polish Ophthalmological Society was founded in 1911. A representative leader was [[Adam Zamenhof]] (1888–1940), who introduced certain diagnostic, surgical, and nonsurgical eye-care procedures and was shot by the Nazis in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wincewicz Andrzej ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Dr Adam Zamenhof (1888-1940) and his insight into ophthalmology | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Biography | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 18–22 | doi=10.1258/jmb.2008.008037 | pmid=19190194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zofia Falkowska (1915–93) head of the Faculty and Clinic of Ophthalmology in Warsaw from 1963 to 1976, was the first to use lasers in her practice.

==Professional requirements==
Ophthalmologists are [[physicians]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD/DO in the US or MBBS in the UK and elsewhere]] or [[D.O.]]/DOMS/ DNB, not [[Doctor of Optometry|OD or BOptom]]) who have completed a college degree, [[medical school]], and [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in ophthalmology. Ophthalmology training equips eye specialists to provide the full spectrum of eye care, including the prescription of glasses and contact lenses, medical treatment, and complex microsurgery. In many countries, ophthalmologists also undergo additional specialized training in one of the many subspecialties. Ophthalmology was the first branch of medicine to offer [[board certification]], now a standard practice among all specialties.

===Australia and New Zealand===
{{See also|Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists}}
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the FRACO/FRANZCO is the equivalent postgraduate specialist qualification. It is a very competitive speciality to enter training and has a closely monitored and structured training system in place over the five years of postgraduate training. Overseas-trained ophthalmologists are assessed using the pathway published on the RANZCO website. Those who have completed their formal training in the UK and have the CCST/CCT are usually deemed to be comparable.

===Bangladesh===
In [[Bangladesh]] to be an ophthalmologist the basic degree is an MBBS. Then they have to obtain a postgraduate degree or diploma in specialty ophthalmology. In Bangladesh, these are Diploma in Ophthalmology, Diploma in Community Ophthalmology, Fellow or Member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in ophthalmology, and Master of Science in ophthalmology.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], an ophthalmology residency after medical school is undertaken. The residency lasts a minimum of five years after the MD degree which culminates in fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada (FRCSC). Subspecialty training is undertaken by about 30% of fellows (FRCSC) in a variety of fields from [[anterior segment]], [[cornea]], [[glaucoma]], [[vision rehabilitation]], [[uveitis]], [[oculoplastics]], medical and surgical retina, [[ocular oncology]], [[Pathology|Ocular pathology]], or [[neuro-ophthalmology]]. About 35 vacancies open per year for ophthalmology residency training in all of Canada. These numbers fluctuate per year, ranging from 30 to 37 spots. Of these, up to ten spots are at French-speaking universities in Quebec. At the end of the five years, the graduating ophthalmologist must pass the oral and written portions of the [[Royal College]] exam in either English or French.

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], physicians willing to become ophthalmologists must undergo a five-year specialization which includes practical training and theoretical studies.

===India===
In [[India]], after completing MBBS degree, postgraduate study in ophthalmology is required. The degrees are Doctor of Medicine, Master of Surgery, Diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery, and Diplomate of National Board. The concurrent training and work experience is in the form of a junior residency at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution under the supervision of experienced faculty. Further work experience in form of fellowship, registrar, or senior resident refines the skills of these eye surgeons. All India Ophthalmologist Society and various state-level ophthalmologist societies hold regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.

===Nepal===
In [[Nepal]],  to become an ophthalmologist, three years postgraduate study is required after completing MBBS degree. The postgraduate degree in ophthalmology is called MD in Ophthalmology.  This degree is currently provided by Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, Tilganga, Kathmandu, BPKLCO, Institute of Medicine, TU, Kathmandu, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel and  National Academy of Medical Science, Kathmandu. Few Nepalese citizen also study this subject in Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and other countries. All the graduates have to pass Nepal Medical Council Licensing Exam to become a registered Ophthalmology in Nepal. The concurrent residency training is in the form of a PG student (resident) at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution according to the degree providing university's rules and regulations. Nepal Ophthalmic Society holds regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.

===Ireland===
{{See also|Irish College of Ophthalmologists}}
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland]] grants Membership (MRCSI (Ophth)) and Fellowship (FRCSI (Ophth)) qualifications in conjunction with the Irish College of Ophthalmologists. Total postgraduate training involves an intern year, a minimum of three years of basic surgical training and a further 4.5 years of higher surgical training. Clinical training takes place within public, [[Health Service Executive]]-funded hospitals in [[Dublin]], [[Sligo]], [[Limerick]], [[Galway]], [[Waterford]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. A minimum of 8.5 years of training is required before eligibility to work in [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] posts. Some trainees take extra time to obtain [[MSc]], [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|MD]] or [[PhD]] degrees and to undertake clinical fellowships in the UK, Australia and the United States.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], after MBBS, a four-year full-time residency program leads to an exit-level FCPS examination in ophthalmology, held under the auspices of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan. The tough examination is assessed by both highly qualified Pakistani and eminent international ophthalmic consultants. As a prerequisite to the final examinations, an intermediate module, an optics and  refraction module, and a dissertation written on a research project carried out under supervision is also assessed.
Moreover, a two-and-a-half-year residency program leads to an MCPS while a two-year training of DOMS is also being offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpsp.edu.pk |title=College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan |publisher=Cpsp.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For candidates in the military, a stringent two-year graded course, with quarterly assessments, is held under Armed Forces Post Graduate Medical Institute in Rawalpindi.
The M.S. in ophthalmology is also one of the specialty programs. In addition to programs for doctors, various diplomas and degrees for allied eyecare personnel are also being offered to produce competent optometrists, orthoptists, ophthalmic nurses, ophthalmic technologists, and ophthalmic technicians in this field. These programs are being offered notably by the College of Ophthalmology and Allied Vision Sciences in  Lahore and the Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology in Peshawar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kemu.edu.pk/pipo.html |title=King Edward Medical University |publisher=Kemu.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subspecialty fellowships are also being offered in the fields of [[pediatric ophthalmology]] and vitreoretinal ophthalmology. [[King Edward Medical University]], Al Shifa Trust Eye Hospital Rawalpindi, and Al- Ibrahim Eye Hospital Karachi have also started a degree program in this field.

===Philippines===
Ophthalmology is a considered a medical specialty that uses medicine and surgery to treat diseases of the eye. There is only one, duly recognized by the PMA and the PCS, professional organization in the country: the Philippine Academy of Ophthalmology (PAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pao.org.ph |title=Pao.org.ph |publisher=Pao.org.ph |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAO and the state-standard Philippine Board of Ophthalmology (PBO) regulates ophthalmology residency programs and board certification. To become a general ophthalmologist in the Philippines, a candidate must have completed a Doctor of Medicine degree (MD) or its equivalent (e.g. MBBS), have completed an internship in Medicine, have passed the physician licensure exam, and completed residency training at a hospital accredited by the Philippine Board of Ophthalmology (accrediting arm of PAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pao.org.ph/pbo.php |title=PBO Officers &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; |publisher=Pao.org.ph |date=2012-12-01 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attainment of board certification in ophthalmology from the PBO is essential  in acquiring privileges in most major health institutions. Graduates of residency programs can receive further training in ophthalmology subspecialties, such as neuro-ophthalmology, retina, etc. by completing a fellowship program which varies in length depending on each program's requirements.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], three colleges grant postgraduate degrees in ophthalmology. The [[Royal College of Ophthalmologists]] (RCOphth) and the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] grant MRCOphth/FRCOphth and MRCSEd/FRCSEd, (although membership is no longer a prerequisite for fellowship), the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow|Royal College]] of Glasgow grants FRCS. Postgraduate work as a [[specialist registrar]] and one of these degrees is required for specialization in [[eye disease]]s. Such clinical work is within the NHS, with supplementary private work for some consultants.
Only 2.3 ophthalmologists exist per 100,000 population in the UK – fewer ''pro rata'' than in any other nation in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uems.net |title=European Union of medical specialists |publisher=Uems.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Medical education in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], ophthalmologists must complete four years of undergraduate studies, four years of medical school, one year medical or general surgical residency, three years of ophthalmology residency and optional one to two years of speciality training. Ophthalmologists are Doctors of Medicine that specialize in the eye and related structures. They perform medical and surgical eye care and can also write prescriptions for corrective lenses (glasses and contacts). They often deal with advanced forms of eye disease in patients with significant systemic illness. 


Physicians must complete the requirements of [[continuing medical education]] to maintain licensure and for recertification. Professional bodies like the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] and American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery organize conferences, help physician members through [[continuing medical education]] programs for maintaining [[board certification]], and provide political advocacy and peer support.

==Notable ophthalmologists==
The following is a list of physicians who have significantly contributed to the field of Ophthalmology:

===18th–19th centuries===
[[Image:Albrecht v Graefe3.jpg|thumb|160px|Albrecht von Graefe]]
* [[Theodor Leber]] discovered Leber's congenital amaurosis, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, Leber's miliary aneurysm, and Leber's stellate neuroretinitis.
* [[Carl Ferdinand von Arlt]] (1812–1887), the elder (Austrian), proved that myopia is largely due to an excessive axial length, published influential textbooks on eye disease, and ran annual eye clinics in needy areas long before the concept of volunteer eye camps became popular. His name is still attached to some disease signs, e.g., von [[Arlt's line]] in trachoma. His son Ferdinand Ritter von Arlt, the younger, was also an ophthalmologist.
* [[Jacques Daviel]] (France) claimed to be the 'father' of modern [[cataract]] surgery in that he performed extracapsular extraction instead of needling the cataract or pushing it back into the vitreous. He is said to have carried out the technique on 206 patients in 1752–53, of which 182 were reported to be successful. These figures are not very credible, given the total lack of both anaesthesia and aseptic technique at that time.
* [[Franciscus Donders]] (1818–1889) (Dutch) published pioneering analyses of ocular biomechanics, intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and physiological optics. He made possible the prescribing of combinations of spherical and cylindrical lenses to treat astigmatism.
* [[Joseph Forlenze]] (1757–1833) (Italy), specialist in [[cataract surgery]], became popular during the [[First French Empire]], healing, among many, personalities such as the minister [[Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis]] and the poet [[Ponce Denis Écouchard Lebrun|Ponce Denis Lebrun]]. He was nominated by [[Napoleon]] "chirurgien oculiste of the lycees, the civil hospices and all the charitable institutions of the departments of the Empire".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan E. Goldstein|Jan Ellen Goldstein]], ''Console and Classify. The French Psychiatric Profession in the Nineteenth Century'', Chicago Press, 2002, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; He was known also for his free interventions, mainly in favour of poor people.
[[File:Allvar Gullstrand 02.jpg|thumb|160px|Allvar Gullstrand]]
* [[Albrecht von Graefe]] (1828–1870) (Germany) Along with Helmholtz and Donders, one of the 'founding fathers' of ophthalmology as a specialty. He was a brilliant clinician and charismatic teacher who had an international influence on the development of ophthalmology, and was a pioneer in mapping visual field defects and diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. He introduced a cataract extraction technique that remained the standard for over 100 years, and many other important surgical techniques such as iridectomy. He rationalised the use of many ophthalmically important drugs, including mydriatics and miotics. He also was the founder of one of the earliest ophthalmic societies (German Ophthalmological Society, 1857) and one of the earliest ophthalmic journals (''Graefe's Archives of Ophthalmology''). He was probably the most important ophthalmologist of the 19th century.
* [[Allvar Gullstrand]] (Sweden) was a [[Nobel Prize]]-winner in 1911 for his research on the eye as a light-refracting apparatus. He described the 'schematic eye', a mathematical model of the [[human eye]] based on his measurements known as the 'optical constants' of the eye. His measurements are still used today.
* [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], a great German [[polymath]], invented the ophthalmoscope (1851) and published important work on physiological optics, including colour vision (1850s).
* [[Julius Hirschberg]] (Germany) in 1879 became the first to use an [[electromagnet]] to remove metallic [[foreign body|foreign bodies]] from the [[human eye|eye]] and in 1886 developed the [[Hirschberg test]] for measuring [[strabismus]].
* [[Polara family|Socrate Polara]] (1800–1860, Italy) founded the first dedicated ophthalmology clinic in Sicily in 1829, entirely as a philanthropic endeavor; later he was appointed as the first director of the ophthalmology department at the Grand Hospital of Palermo, Sicily, in 1831 after the Sicilian government became convinced of the importance of state support for the specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parisi|first=Antonino|title=Annuario Storico del Regno della Due Sicilie, dal Principio del Governo, di Ferdinando II Borbone|year=1838|publisher=Tipografica Trani (Napoli)|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Herman Snellen]] (Netherlands) introduced the [[Snellen chart]] to study [[visual acuity]].

===20th–21st centuries===
* [[Volodymyr Filatov|Vladimir Petrovich Filatov]] (1875–1956) (Ukraine) contributed the tube flap grafting method, corneal transplantation, and preservation of grafts from cadaver eyes and tissue therapy. He founded thFyodoe [[Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy]], Odessa, one of the leading eye-care institutes in the world.
* [[Shinobu Ishihara]] (1879-1963) (Japan), in 1918, invented to [[Ishihara Test|Ishihara Color Vision Test]], a common method for determining [[Color blindness]]. He also made major contributions to the study of [[Trachoma]] and [[Myopia]].
* [[Ignacio Barraquer]] (1884–1965) (Spain), in 1917, invented the first motorized vacuum instrument (erisophake) for intracapsular [[cataract]] extraction. He founded the Barraquer Clinic in 1941 and the Barraquer Institute in 1947 in Barcelona, Spain.
*[[Ernst Fuchs (doctor)|Ernst Fuchs]] (1851-1930) was an Austrian ophthalmologist known for his discovery and description of numerous ocular diseases and abnormalities including [[Fuchs' dystrophy]] and [[Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Müller |first1=Andreas |title=Professor Ernst Fuchs (1851-1930) |journal=Archives of Ophthalmology |date=1 June 2003 |volume=121 |issue=6 |pages=888 |doi=10.1001/archopht.121.6.888}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tsutomu Sato (ophthalmologist)|Tsutomu Sato]] (Japan) Pioneer in incisional refractive surgery, including techniques for astigmatism and the invention of [[radial keratotomy]] for myopia.
* [[Jules Gonin]] (1870–1935) (Switzerland) was the "father of retinal detachment surgery".
* [[Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist)|Sir Harold Ridley]] (United Kingdom), in 1949, may have been the first to successfully implant an artificial intraocular lens after observing that plastic fragments in the eyes of wartime pilots were well tolerated. He fought for decades against strong reactionary opinions to have the concept accepted as feasible and useful.
* [[Charles Schepens]] (Belgium) was the "father of modern retinal surgery" and developer of the Schepens indirect binocular ophthalmoscope whilst at Moorfields Eye Hospital. He was the founder of the Schepens Eye Research Institute, associated with Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].
*[[Marshall M. Parks]] was the "father of pediatric ophthalmology".
* [[José Ignacio Barraquer]] (1916–1998) (Spain) was the "father of modern refractive surgery". In the 1960s, he developed lamellar techniques, including [[keratomileusis]] and keratophakia, as well as the first [[microkeratome]] and corneal [[microlathe]].
* [[Frank M Polack]] (1929 – 2007) was an American ophthalmologist who designed the Polack forceps for corneal transplants.
* [[Tadeusz Krwawicz]] (Poland), in 1961, developed the first cryoprobe for intracapsular cataract extraction.
* [[Svyatoslav Fyodorov]] (Russia) was the "father of ophthalmic microsurgery". He improved and popularized [[radial keratotomy]], invented a surgical cure for cataract, and developed scleroplasty.
* [[Charles Kelman]] (United States) developed the ultrasound and mechanized irrigation and aspiration system for [[phacoemulsification]], first allowing cataract extraction through a small incision.
* [[Ioannis Pallikaris]] (Greece) performed the first laser-assisted intrastromal keratomileusis ([[LASIK]]) surgery.

Organ donation is when a person gives their [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] after they die to someone in need of new [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. [[Organ transplantation|Transplantation]] is the process of  transplanting the organs donated into another person. This process extends the [[life expectancy]] of a person suffering from [[Organ dysfunction|organ failure]]. Unfortunately the number of [[patient]]s requiring [[Organ transplantation|organ transplants]] outweighs the number of donor organs available.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Organ donation|author1=Wilkinson, K.  |author2=Peet, D.|date = 2014|journal = InnovAiT  |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=|doi = 10.1177/1755738013506565|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Donor types ==
There are two types of donors; living donors and deceased donors.

=== Living donors ===
In Australia the most common living donations not including [[blood donation]]s are [[kidney]]s and [[bone marrow]]. The [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] that are able to be donated by a living donor are:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nhmrc.gov.au|title = Organ and tissue donation by living donors, guidelines for ethical practice for health professionals (2007)|date = |accessdate = August 2015|website = Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council.|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bone marrow|Bone Marrow]]
* [[Kidney]]
* Part of the [[liver]]
* [[Lung]] (this requires two living donors. One donates a lobe from their left lung and the other donates a lobe from their right lung) 
* Part of the [[Small intestine|intestine]]
* Part of the [[pancreas]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Eligibility for donation ====
The minimum age for living donation is 18 years of age. A person may be eligible to be a donor if they are free from [[HIV]], [[cancer]], [[Systemic disease|systemic infection]], [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anaemia]], [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|creutzfeldt-jakob disease]] and they are not a previous [[IV drug user]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com|title = Organ Donation (2015)|date = |accessdate = August 2015|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Motives for living donation ====
Donation to a family member is a common scenario. The reasons for a family member to want to be a living donor to their relatives are; a desire to help, self benefit (from loved ones improved health), a feeling of moral duty, pressure identification with the recipient, increased [[Self-esteem|self esteem]] from doing a good deed. It is the [[Health professional|health professional's]] role to understand the difficulty of these situations involving relationships of loved friends or relatives and they are to determine whether or not the offer of donation is genuine or the living donor feels pressured into donating because of the seriousness of their loved ones [[Organ dysfunction|organ failure.]] However most donations result in a positive psychological benefit to both the donor and recipient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If a donor is wanting to donate to someone who is not a relative or friend they are intensively [[Psychological testing|psychologically tested]] to determine their motives and suitability for donation as there can occasionally be harmful motives such as [[attention seeking]] or [[Mental Illness|mental illness]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Deceased donors (non-heart beating donors) ===
[[Death|Deceased]] donors have been declared [[Death|dead]] and are maintained in [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] on [[Medical ventilator|ventilators]] so [[Perfusion|tissue oxygenation]] continues until the procedure of organ retrieval and cold preservation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Non heart beating donors.|last = Van Raemdonck, D.E.M., Rega, F.R., Neyrinck, A.P., Jannis, N., Verledenn, G.M., and Lerut, T.E.|date = 2004|journal = Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery  |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=309–321|doi = 10.1053/j.semtcvs.2004.09.014|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death|Deceased]] donors are divided into two sub-classes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Donation after [[brain death]]. A person is declared brain dead if there is complete loss of all brain function 
* Donation after cardiac death. A person is declared cardiac dead if there is complete loss of all cardiac function&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Both types of [[Death|deceased]] donors have complete and irreversible damage and returning to life is impossible. Thorough testing is carried out prior to confirming a person [[Brain death|brain dead]] or cardiac dead.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

One deceased donor is able to save up to ten lives by donating the following:
* [[Organ (anatomy)|Organ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s; [[Kidney|Kidneys,]] [[pancreas]], [[liver]], [[lung]]s, [[heart]] and [[intestines]]
* [[Tissue (biology)|Tissues]]; [[Bone]]s, [[skin]], [[heart valve]]s, [[vein]]s and [[cornea]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://organdonor.gov|title = Organ Donation|date = |accessdate = August 2015|website = U.S Department of Health and Human Services|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whole body donation ===
After [[death]] some people choose to donate their bodies to [[science]]. These bodies are used in many teaching facilities and aid in teaching [[anatomy]], surgical techniques or [[research]]. Whole body donation involves the [[Death|deceased]] person contacting the university or teaching institution prior to death to obtain [[consent]] and cover the legalities involved. After [[death]] it is up to the family of the deceased to contact the chosen facility and arrange donation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Opt in versus opt out ==
Currently [[Australia|Australia's]] organ donation system is 'opt-in'. This means a person had to give [[consent]] (opt-in) in be a donor prior to their [[death]], or their family can make the decision for them if they are considered a viable donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.seslhd,health.nsw.gov.au|title = Organ and Tissue Donation Frequently Asked Questions|date = |accessdate = August 2015|website = NSW Government Health|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'opt-out' system is used in several countries around the [[world]]. For this system everyone is placed on the donor list and must 'opt-out' if they do not wish to donate their [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Whether [[Australia]] changes to the 'opt-out' system is constantly coming into question. In a discussion paper compiled in 2011 it was stated 35% of family members of a potential donor would refuse donation if they were unsure of the family members intentions on donating. However, if an 'opt-out' system was put into place and the potential donor did not opt-out prior to [[death]], it was estimated only 20% of families would refuse donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au|title = Adopting an Opt-Out Registration System for Organ and Tissue Donation in Western Australia.|date = 2011|accessdate = August 2015|website = Parliament of Western Australia|publisher = |author1=Delriviere, L.  |author2=Boronovskis, H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study carried out in 2002 investigated donor rates of countries with 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' systems. The countries chosen for the study were ones that had relatively similar backgrounds and [[health system]]s. After the donation rates were calculated to match the [[mortality rate]]s it concluded the difference in donor rates between the two systems were marginal. The results as follows (Table 1.2).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Opting-out systems: No guarantee for higher donation rates.|last = Coppen, R., Friele. R.D., Marquet, R.L. and Gevers, S.K.M.|date = 2005|journal = Transplant International (18) 1275-1279|doi = 10.1111/j.1432-2277.2005.00202.x|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many pros and cons for each of the two systems thus making it a [[Controversy|controversial]] topic and as seen above some studies can be contradicting. Ultimately it is the family of the deceased who will make the final decision on organ donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical nursing skills and techniques (5th ed.)|author1=Perry, A.G.  |author2=Potter, P.A.|publisher = Mosby/Elsevier|year = 2004|isbn = |location = St.louis, Missouri|pages = 1254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 57% of Australians know the wishes of their family members in regards to organ donation, which has a large impact on families giving [[consent]] for organ donation. Donation cannot go ahead without families [[consent]] even if the person is on the [[Australian Organ Donor Register|donor register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://media.amsa.org.au|title = Organ and tissue donation policy.|date = |accessdate = August 2015|website = Australian Medical Students Association|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Donation in religion ==
In most cases religions support organ donation. There are a few aspects of each religion that make the logistics of organ donation difficult however most of these can be overcome in some way.

=== Islam ===
Most [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] donations in predominately [[Muslim]] countries are live donations, for example in [[Iran]] in 2006 only 13% of [[Kidney transplantation|renal transplants]] were from [[Death|deceased]] donation. In [[Islamic religion]], violating the human body whether living or [[Death|dead]] is forbidden, this includes organ donation. However, saving a life is ranked extremely highly in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. Brain stem death [[Brain death|(brain dead)]] is controversial in [[Islamic religion]]. This, along with burial customs of [[Muslim]]s being they have to be buried within 24 hours of death makes if difficult for organ donation.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Organ donation, transplantation and religion.|last = Oliver, M., Woywodt, A., Ahmed, A., and Saif, I.|date = 2011|journal = Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=437–444|doi = 10.1093/ndt/gfq628|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
Generally [[Christianity]] approves of organ donation although some Christians believe principle healing is achieved through [[prayer]]. The majority of [[Christian]]s see organ donation as Christian love or an act of devotion to God and mankind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Judaism ===
The [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] places great significance on avoiding unnecessary interference with [[cadaver]]s and receiving benefit from a [[cadaver]] is prohibited. The body must also be buried within 24 hours of death. It is custom in [[Judaism]] to not interfere with death; organ donation procedures may be part of this. Only 8% of the [[Israel]] population are registered organ donors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
[[Hinduism|Hindu's]] believe in [[reincarnation]] and the good deeds of one's current lifetime will determine the fate of the next lifetime. Organ donation is seen as a good deed. Hasmukh Velji Shah of the World Council of Hindus stated "The import issue for Hindu is that which sustains life should be accepted and promoted as [[Dharma]] (righteous living). Organ donation is an integral part of our living."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
[[Buddhism|Buddhists]] believe in [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. [[Brain death]] is also [[Controversy|controversia]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l for [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] as they believe the [[Spirituality|spirit]] remains in the body days after [[death]] and interfering with the body may affect a person's next [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. However [[Selfless action|selfless]] giving is integral to [[Buddhism]] therefore organ donation is up to the individual.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Donor rates in Australia ==
Australian donor rates are on the rise. Between 2009 and 2013, donor numbers increased by 29%. In 2009 there were 11.4 donors per million of the population. By 2013 there were 16.9 donors per million of the population. (Table 1.3). In [[Australia]] around 1600 people are on the [[Organ transplantation|organ transplant]] waiting list at any time. Less than 1% of persons whose [[death]] is in hospital can be potential donors because of the limited circumstances for which organ donation is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.donatelife.gov.au|title = 2013-2014 Annual Report|date = 2014|accessdate = August 2015|website = Australian Government Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 only 40% of patients on the organ wait list received a transplant and 2% of the patients on the waiting list died while waiting for an organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.donatelife.gov.au|title = Patients Listed for Solid Organ Transplantation Statistics 2013|date = 2013|accessdate = August 2015|website = Australian Government Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1058">The '''reduced enamel epithelium''', sometimes called '''reduced dental epithelium''', overlies a [[tooth development|developing]] [[tooth]] and is formed by two layers: a layer of [[ameloblast]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and the adjacent layer of [[cuboidal cell]]s (outer enamel epithelium) from the [[dental lamina]].  As the cells of the reduced enamel epithelium degenerate, the tooth is revealed progressively with its eruption into the [[mouth]].  The degeneration of reduced enamel epithelium also mediates the initial [[epithelium|epithelial]] attachment to the tooth, which is called the junctional epithelium.

The reduced enamel epithelium consist of:

*  [[Outer enamel epithelium]]

'''San Carlo al Lazzaretto''' is a small [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style octagonal church now in largo Bellintani Fra Paolo, number 1 in the quartiere Porta Venezia of Milan. It is located about three blocks northwest of the [[Porta Venezia]]. Its present situation, amidst crowded 19th and 20th century apartment blocks, has little relationship to its original placement, in the central park of a massive rectangular cloister-like 15th-century leprosarium ([[Lazaretto]]). The church, once called ''Tempietto di Santa Maria della Sanità'' or ''San Carlino'', escaped the late-nineteenth century demolition of the Lazzaretto.

[[Image:Braun Milano HAAB.jpg|thumb|Map of Milan 1573, with rectangular Lazzaretto just outside the city walls on the right of the print]]

==History==
The Lazzaretto of Milan was a quadrangle with 400 yard long sides, designed by [[Lazzaro Palazzi]] in the late 15th century. It was located outside the city walls and Porta Orientale. In the center an altar had been placed in the open ground. After the Lazzaretto was used for housing the ill during the plague epidemic of 1576, the archbishop [[Carlo Borromeo]] commissioned a new church from [[Pellegrino Tibaldi]]. Construction from 1558 to 1592, erected this centralized church with open circumferential arches which allowed the ill to see services from all corners of the surrounding porticos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitamilano.it/turismo/arte_storia/index.html?id=35263&amp;idbonsainode=7 Milan Tourism site.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lombardiabeniculturali.it/architetture/schede/LMD80-00390/ Lombardia Beni Culturali.]&lt;/ref&gt; After the French occupation of the Duchy, the lazzaretto was used as barracks. During the [[Cisalpine Republic]], the architect [[Giuseppe Piermarini]] was commissioned to transform the church into a secular Temple of the Nation (''Tempio della Patria''). Piermarini Demolished the cupola, and walled the sides, but reconstruction soon ceased. During the 19th century, the central fields of the Lazzaretto were used for agriculture, and the surrounding cloister was used by peasants. In the late 19th century, the Lazaretto buildings were nearly entirely demolished, and the church was reconsecrated by 1884, with a new dome and an added facade portico.

The church is the backdrop for a scene at the end of the Manzoni novel ''[[I Promessi Sposi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiorno.it/milano/cronaca/2012/11/25/807455-sancarlo-allazzaretto-alessandro-manzoni-peste-promessi-sposi-restauro.shtml Il Giorno], November 2012 article about needed reconstruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the vibrations produced by the underground train under viale Tunisia which have damaged the dome the church has been subject to studies to reinforce its structure. After a failed fund raising for restoration among the public the church has been completely restored by Rocca Foundation in memory of [[Roberto Rocca]]. The goal was to use the church both for religious activities and as a concert hall. For this goal the rooms added at the end of 1800 for the sacristy and the priest house on the northern side have been transformed to host concert players. The altar has been moved towards the wall to have more space for concerts. 

Work begun in September 2015 was completed in June 2017. The architectural design was by Studio 02 Arch, the static consolidation has been followed by Studio Associato Brambilla Ferrari and restoration was undertaken by Naos Restauri. 
A new organ has been installed with 1800 pipes, designed by Martino Lurani Cernuschi with a romantic-synphonic approach. The church was inaugurated by Milan archbishop [[Mario Delpini]] on 3 November 2017 at 8.30 pm.

The church is open every day from 9 to 12 am, masses are organized Wednesday and Friday at 10 am.

The municipality has completed in 2016 a project to reserve to pedestrians Largo Bellintani around the church. The project is from arch. Loredana Brambilla of Milan Municipality.

'''Shuai Shou Gong''' ({{zh|t=甩手功|s=甩手功|p=Shuǎishǒu gōng|l=Swinging hand workout}})
is a hand-swinging exercise pioneered by [[Taiwan]] [[Qigong]] (气功）[[cmn:李鳳山|master Li Feng-shan  ('''李鳳山'''）]]

Standing with both legs apart at a width roughly equal to that of the shoulder, Shuai Shou Gong involves moving both arms in parallel, swinging first to the front of the body until they are the same height as the shoulder, then swinging the arms back with a little effort until both arms are behind the body. On every fifth swing, the knee should slightly bend down and spring back quickly - once when the arms are swinging towards the back of body and another on the return swing to the front of body.

This exercise should be carried out 3 times a day and last at least 10 minutes each time. It will help to improve the blood circulation and starts the healing process if there are any ailments. It is recommended to avoid drinking cold water immediately after the exercise.

Shuai Shou Gong is claimed to cure many ailments including cancer, with anecdotal cases reported in Taiwan. However, there is a lack of peer reviewed evidence supporting these claims, which likely arose due to the [[placebo]] effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49245">'''Sterilization''' (or '''sterilization''') refers to any process that eliminates, removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of [[life]] and other [[biological agent]]s (such as [[fungi]], [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, spore forms, [[prion]]s, [[unicellular]] [[eukaryotic]] organisms such as [[Plasmodium]], etc.) present in a specified region, such as a surface, a volume of fluid, medication, or in a compound such as biological [[growth medium|culture media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/MSM_98_4/MSM_98_4_glossary.en.html|title=WHO Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/anthapha_def_a.html|title=Definitions|first=Ralph R.|last=Frerichs|website=www.ph.ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including: [[heat]], [[chemical]]s, [[irradiation]], [[high pressure food preservation|high pressure]], and [[filtration]]. Sterilization is not distinct from [[disinfection]], sanitization, and [[pasteurization]], in that sterilization kills, deactivates, or eliminates all forms of life and other biological agents which are present.

==Applications==

===Foods===
One of the first steps toward sterilization was made by [[Nicolas Appert]] who discovered that thorough application of heat over a suitable period slowed the decay of foods and various liquids, preserving them for safe consumption for a longer time than was typical. [[Canning]] of foods is an extension of the same principle and has helped to reduce [[food borne illness]] ("food poisoning"). Other methods of sterilizing foods include [[food irradiation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dkNQqbXY3loC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Food irradiation: principles and applications|last=Molins|first=Ricardo A.|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|page=23|isbn=978-0-471-35634-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high pressure ([[pascalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edPzm5KSMmYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Food: Principles and Preparation|last=Brown|first=Amy Christian|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|edition=3|isbn=978-0-495-10745-3|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine and surgery===
[[File:Joseph Lister c1855.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] was a pioneer of [[antiseptic#Usage in surgery|antiseptic surgery]].]]
[[File:Der Apparat zur Sterilisierung der Operationsinstrumente - CH-BAR - 3240236.tif|thumb|Apparatus to sterilize surgical instruments, Verwaltungsgebäude der Schweiz. Kranken- und Hilfsanstalt, 1914-1918]]

In general, surgical instruments and medications that enter an already [[Asepsis|aseptic]] part of the body (such as the bloodstream, or penetrating the skin) must be sterile. Examples of such instruments include [[scalpel]]s, [[hypodermic needle]]s, and [[artificial pacemaker]]s. This is also essential in the manufacture of [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] pharmaceuticals.

Preparation of injectable medications and intravenous solutions for [[fluid replacement]] therapy requires not only sterility but also well-designed containers to prevent entry of [[infection|adventitious agents]] after initial product sterilization.

Most medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of materials that are able to go under [[steam]] sterilization. However, since 1950, there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials (e.g., plastics) that require low-temperature sterilization. [[Ethylene oxide]] gas has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices. Within the past 15 years, a number of new, low-temperature sterilization systems (e.g., [[vaporized hydrogen peroxide]], [[peracetic acid]] immersion, [[ozone]]) have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/13_0Sterilization.html] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam sterilization is the most widely used and the most dependable. Steam sterilization is nontoxic, inexpensive, rapidly microbicidal, sporicidal, and rapidly heats and penetrates fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/13_0Sterilization.html#a1] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spacecraft===
There are strict international rules to [[planetary protection|protect the contamination of Solar System bodies]] from biological material from Earth. Standards vary depending on both the type of mission and its destination; the more likely a planet is considered to be [[planetary habitability|habitable]], the stricter the requirements are.

Many components of instruments used on spacecraft cannot withstand very high temperatures, so techniques not requiring excessive temperatures are used as tolerated, including heating to at least {{Cvt|120|C|}}, chemical sterilization, oxidization, ultraviolet, and irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sci.esa.int/home/30313-no-bugs-please-this-is-a-clean-planet/ |title=No bugs please, this is a clean planet! |publisher=European Space Agency |date=30 July 2002 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantification==
The aim of sterilization is the reduction of initially present microorganisms or other potential pathogens. The degree of sterilization is commonly expressed by multiples of the decimal reduction time, or [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]], denoting the time needed to reduce the initial number &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; to one tenth (&lt;math&gt;10^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) of its original value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm071261.htm|title= Guidance for Industry: Biological Indicators|date= 4 October 2007|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the number of microorganisms &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; after sterilization time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{N_0}= 10^{\left(-\frac{t}{D}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.
The D-value is a function of sterilization conditions and varies with the type of microorganism, [[temperature]], [[water activity]], [[pH]] etc.. For steam sterilization (see below) typically the temperature, in degrees [[Celsius]], is given as an index.

Theoretically, the likelihood of the survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the [[bioburden]] present on or in the item being sterilized. This provides a [[sterility assurance level]] (SAL) equal to the probability of a non-sterile unit.

For high-risk applications, such as medical devices and injections, a sterility assurance level of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; is required by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070342.pdf|title= Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing|date= September 2004|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat==

===Steam===
{{See also|Moist heat sterilization}}

A widely used method for heat sterilization is the [[autoclave]], sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to {{Cvt|121–134|C|}} under [[pressure]]. To achieve sterility, the article is placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a temperature and time setpoint. Almost all the air is removed from the chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differs from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint for a period of time which varies depending on what [[bioburden]] is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance ([[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]]) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lso-inc.com/sterilization-validation-services/iso17665-steam-sterilization.html|title=Steam Sterilization for Medical Devices - ISO 17665 - Sterilization Validation Services|website=www.lso-inc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; at {{Cvt|121|C|}} at {{Cvt|100|kPa|}}, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for a product with a bioburden of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and a D-value of 2.0 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sterislifesciences.com/sitecore/content/Sites/LifeSciences_com/Home/News-and-Events/News/2013/November/~/media/Files/LifeSciences_com/PDF/13ND-Dion.ashx|title= Steam Sterilization Principles|date= November 2013|accessdate= |website= |publisher= STERIS Life Sciences|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.

Proper autoclave treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial [[spore]]s in addition to [[fungi]], bacteria, and viruses, but is not expected to eliminate all [[prion]]s, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state {{Cvt|121–132|C|}} for 60 minutes or {{Cvt|134|C|}} for at least 18 minutes.{{citation needed|date= April 2016}} The 263K [[scrapie]] prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of scrapie, and strains of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CKD) and [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) are more resistant. Using [[laboratory mouse|mice]] as test animals, one experiment showed that heating BSE positive [[brain]] tissue at {{Cvt|134–138|C|}} for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 [[logarithm|log]] decrease in prion infectivity.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.tma.uz/gps/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/09/ASEPSIS-ANTISEPTICS-INTRODUCTION.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most autoclaves have meters and charts that record or display information, particularly temperature and pressure as a function of time. The information is checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. [[Autoclave tape|Indicator tape]] is often placed on the packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/When_using_autoclave_we_use_autoclave_tape_which_changes_color_to_black_indicating_autoclaving_was_successful_what_is_the_molecular_mechanism|title=When using autoclave we use autoclave tape which changes color to black indicating autoclaving was successful, what is the molecular mechanism?|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bioindicators]] can also be used to independently confirm autoclave performance. Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available, based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat-resistant microbe ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]'' (formerly ''Bacillus stearothermophilus''), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside [[glassine]] envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.

For autoclaving, cleaning is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can be achieved through physical scrubbing, [[sonication]], [[ultrasound]], or pulsed air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decontamination and Sterilization|url=http://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/BioSafety/decon/Pages/decontamination.aspx|website=NIH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pressure cooking]] and [[canning]] is analogous to autoclaving, and when performed correctly renders food sterile.

Moist heat causes the destruction of microorganisms by [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of macromolecules, primarily proteins. This method is a faster process than dry heat sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://biodifferences.com/difference-between-moist-heat-and-dry-heat-sterilization.html|title=Difference Between Moist Heat and Dry Heat Sterilization (with Comparison Chart) - Bio Differences|date=2018-02-22|work=Bio Differences|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry heat===
{{See also|Dry heat sterilization}}

[[File:2003-12-03-Heissluft-Sterilisator.JPG|thumb|Dry heat sterilizer]]Dry heat was the first method of sterilization and is a longer process than moist heat sterilization. The destruction of microorganisms through the use of dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casolari|first1=A.|title=FOOD STERILIZATION BY HEAT|url=http://www.vency.com/sterilization.html|website=Liberty Knowledge Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The standard setting for a hot air oven is at least two hours at {{Cvt|160|C|}}. A rapid method heats air to {{Cvt|190|C|}} for 6 minutes for unwrapped objects and 12 minutes for wrapped objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.ab.ca/resources/publications/PersonalServicesPt1.pdf |title=– Alberta Health and Wellness |publisher=Health.gov.ab.ca |access-date=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com/content/medical/14274/css/14274_146.htm|title=Chemical Vapor Sterilization|website=www.tpub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry heat has the advantage that it can be used on powders and other heat-stable items that are adversely affected by steam (e.g. it does not cause rusting of steel objects).

===Flaming===
Flaming is done to [[Inoculation loop|inoculation loops]] and straight-wires in microbiology labs for [[Streaking (microbiology)|streaking]]. Leaving the loop in the flame of a [[Bunsen burner]] or [[alcohol burner]] until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see [[Sterilisation (microbiology)#Incineration|Incineration]] below). However, during the initial heating, infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in a 70% or more concentrated solution of [[ethanol]], then briefly touch the object to a [[Bunsen burner]] flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame.

===Incineration===
[[Incineration]] is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other [[Biomedical waste|biohazardous waste]] before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces that incinerate and kill off any microorganisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Incineration]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyndallization===
{{Main|Tyndallization}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an obsolete and lengthy process designed to reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are left by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, and then repeating the process a total of three to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.

===Glass bead sterilizers===
Glass bead sterilizers work by heating glass beads to {{Cvt|250|C|}}. Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. Glass bead sterilizers were once a common sterilization method employed in [[dentistry|dental]] offices as well as biological laboratories,&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zadik Y, Peretz A |title=The effectiveness of glass bead sterilizer in the dental practice |journal=J Isr Dent Assoc |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=36–9 |date=Apr 2008 |pmid=18780544}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are not approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to be used as a sterilizers since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.CDC.gov/OralHealth/InfectionControl/faq/bead.htm 2008-09-11&lt;/ref&gt; They are still popular in [[Europe]]an and [[Israel]]i dental practices, although there are no current [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] guidelines for using this sterilizer.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;

==Chemical sterilization==
[[File:2003-12-03-Chemiclav.JPG|thumb|Chemiclav]]

Chemicals are also used for sterilization. Heating provides a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, but it is not always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, [[fiber optic]]s, electronics, and many [[plastic]]s. In these situations chemicals, either in a gaseous or liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that the article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for [[Workplace safety and health|workplace safety]], as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.

===Ethylene oxide===
[[Ethylene oxide]] (EO, EtO) gas treatment is one of the common methods used to sterilize, pasteurize, or disinfect items because of its wide range of material compatibility. It is also used to process items that are sensitive to processing with other methods, such as radiation (gamma, electron beam, X-ray), heat (moist or dry), or other chemicals. Ethylene oxide treatment is the most common chemical sterilization method, used for approximately 70% of total sterilizations, and for over 50% of all [[disposable]] medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/ethylene-oxide-factsheet.pdf|title=Ethylene oxide|last=|first=|date=|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=OSHA|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between {{Cvt|30 and 60|C|}} with [[relative humidity]] above 30% and a gas concentration between 200 and 800&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naspco.com/sterilization/|title=Sterilization {{!}} NASP|website=North American Sterilization &amp; Packaging|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all [[porous materials]], and it can penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms, such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when repeatedly applied. It is flammable, toxic, and [[Carcinogen|carcinogenic]]; however, only with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide sterilizers and processes require biological [[validation (drug manufacturer)|validation]] after sterilizer installation, significant repairs or process changes.

The traditional process consists of a preconditioning phase (in a separate room or cell), a processing phase (more commonly in a vacuum vessel and sometimes in a pressure rated vessel), and an aeration phase (in a separate room or cell) to remove EO residues and lower by-products such as [[ethylene chlorohydrin]] (EC or ECH) and, of lesser importance, [[ethylene glycol]] (EG). An alternative process, known as all-in-one processing, also exists for some products whereby all three phases are performed in the vacuum or pressure rated vessel. This latter option can facilitate faster overall processing time and residue dissipation.

The most common EO processing method is the gas chamber method. To benefit from [[economies of scale]], EO has traditionally been delivered by filling a large chamber with a combination of gaseous EO either as pure EO, or with other gases used as diluents; diluents include chlorofluorocarbons ([[CFCs]]), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and [[carbon dioxide]].

Ethylene oxide is still widely used by medical device manufacturers. Since EO is explosive at concentrations above 3%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=730&amp;tid=133|title=ATSDR - Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs): Ethylene Oxide|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; EO was traditionally supplied with an [[Inert gas|inert]] carrier gas, such as a CFC or HCFC. The use of CFCs or HCFCs as the carrier gas was banned because of concerns of [[ozone depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/snap/sterilants/sterilants.pdf |title=Substitute Sterilants under SNAP as of September 28, 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Halogenated hydrocarbon|halogenated hydrocarbons]] are being replaced by systems using 100% EO, because of regulations and the high cost of the blends. In hospitals, most EO sterilizers use single-use cartridges because of the convenience and ease of use compared to the former plumbed gas cylinders of EO blends.

It is important to adhere to patient and healthcare personnel government specified limits of EO residues in and/or on processed products, operator exposure after processing, during storage and handling of EO gas cylinders, and environmental emissions produced when using EO.

The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) at 1 ppm – calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) – and 5 ppm as a 15-minute excursion limit (EL). The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]'s (NIOSH) immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for EO is 800 ppm.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=NIOSH: Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH) / NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95) - intridl4 |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Odor Threshold|odor threshold]] is around 500 ppm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg137.html |title=ATSDR - MMG: Ethylene Oxide |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; so EO is imperceptible until concentrations are well above the OSHA PEL. Therefore, OSHA recommends that continuous gas monitoring systems be used to protect workers using EO for processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hospital/central/central.html |title=Hospital eTool: Central Supply Module |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nitrogen dioxide===
[[Nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas is a rapid and effective sterilant for use against a wide range of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores. The unique physical properties of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of [[DNA]] in the spore core through [[nitration]] of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;Görsdorf S, Appel KE, Engeholm C, Obe G.; Nitrogen dioxide induces DNA single-strand breaks in cultured Chinese hamster cells: Carcinogenesis. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a boiling point of {{Cvt|21|C|}} at sea level, which results in a relatively highly saturated [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is often referred to by the name of its [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no [[condensation]] occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle.&lt;ref name="Mechanism Overview, June 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mechanism Overview, June 2012|url=http://noxilizer.com/pdf/news/WhitePaper-Mechanism_Overview_6_14_12.pdf|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also less [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.&lt;ref name="Mechanism Overview, June 2012"/&gt;

The most-resistant organism (MRO) to sterilization with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas is the spore of [[Geobacillus stearothermophilus|''Geobacillus stearothermophilus'']], which is the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of ''G. stearothermophilus'' has been well characterized over the years as a [[biological indicator]] in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of ''G. stearothermophilus'' with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas proceeds rapidly in a [[Log-linear graph|log-linear]] fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for [[medical devices]] at its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noxilizer Contract Sterilization Services|url=http://noxilizer.com/services.php|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer’s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residual gases through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.&lt;ref name="Mechanism Overview, June 2012"/&gt;

===Ozone===
[[Ozone]] is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to [[oxidize]] most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced on-site, so it is not practical to use in many settings.

Ozone offers many advantages as a sterilant gas; ozone is a very efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties ([[Oxidation number|E]]=2.076 vs [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 76th Ed|last= |first= |publisher= |year= 1995|isbn= |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) capable of destroying a wide range of pathogens, including prions, without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from medical-grade [[oxygen]]. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH's immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for ozone is {{nowrap|5 ppm,}} {{nowrap|160 times}} smaller than the {{nowrap|800 ppm}} IDLH for ethylene oxide. NIOSH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html|title=CDC - Index of Chemicals - NIOSH Publications and Products|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OSHA has set the PEL for ozone at {{nowrap|0.1 ppm}}, calculated as an {{nowrap|eight-hour}} time-weighted average. The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring of exposure to ozone, in order to provide a rapid warning in the event of a leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.

===Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde===

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}

[[Glutaraldehyde]] and [[formaldehyde]] solutions (also used as [[fixation (histology)|fixatives]]) are accepted liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]], and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf-life (&lt;2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf-life if some [[methanol]] is added to inhibit [[polymerization]] to [[paraformaldehyde]], but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original [[Salk Polio Vaccine|Salk polio vaccine]], are sterilized with formaldehyde.

===Hydrogen peroxide===
[[Hydrogen peroxide]], in both liquid and as [[vaporized hydrogen peroxide]] (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong [[oxidant]], which allows it to destroy a wide range of pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat- or temperature-sensitive articles, such as rigid [[Endoscope|endoscopes]]. In medical sterilization, hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aspjj.com/emea/products-and-services/low-temperature-sterilization/sterrad-nx|title= Sterrad NX|accessdate= 25 March 2015|website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawbacks of hydrogen peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing [[nylon]] may become brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/Disinfection_Nov_2008.pdf|title= Guidelines for Disinfection|date= 2008|accessdate= |website= |publisher= [[Center for Disease Control]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The penetrating ability of hydrogen peroxide is not as good as ethylene oxide{{citation needed|date= January 2013}} and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of the lumen of objects that can be effectively sterilized. Hydrogen peroxide is a primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause [[Skin whitening|bleaching]] or [[ulceration]] depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (&gt; 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the IDLH at 75 ppm,&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9992|title= 29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1|accessdate= 25 March 2015|website= |publisher= [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilizer manufacturers go to great lengths to make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers documented in the FDA MAUDE database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM |title=MAUDE - Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using any type of gas sterilizer, prudent work practices should include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for hydrogen peroxide and good work practices and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/hydrogenperoxide/recognition.html |title=Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Hydrogen Peroxide |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg174.html |title=ATSDR - MMG: Hydrogen Peroxide |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide]] (VHP) is used to sterilize large enclosed and sealed areas, such as entire rooms and aircraft interiors.

Although toxic, VHP breaks down in a short time to water and oxygen.

===Peracetic acid===
[[Peracetic acid]] (0.2%) is a recognized sterilant by the FDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/ReprocessingofReusableMedicalDevices/ucm437347.htm|title= Cleared Sterilants and High Level Disinfectants with General Claims for Processing Reusable Medical and Dental Devices|date= March 2015|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in sterilizing medical devices such as [[endoscope]]s.

===Potential for chemical sterilization of prions===
Prions are highly resistant to chemical sterilization. Treatment with [[aldehyde]]s, such as formaldehyde, have actually been shown to increase prion resistance. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) for one hour was shown to be ineffective, providing less than 3 logs (10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) reduction in contamination. [[Iodine]], formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and peracetic acid also fail this test (one hour treatment). Only [[chlorine]], [[phenols|phenolic compounds]], [[guanidinium thiocyanate]], and sodium hydroxide reduce prion levels by more than 4 logs; chlorine (too corrosive to use on certain objects) and sodium hydroxide are the most consistent. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref name="Prion NaOH"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauman|first1=PA|author2=Lawrence LA |author3=Biesert L |author4=Dichtelmüller H |author5=Fabbrizzi F |author6=Gajardo R |author7=Gröner A |author8=Jorquera JI |author9=Kempf C |author10=Kreil TR |author11=von Hoegen I |author12=Pifat DY |author13=Petteway SR Jr |author14=MCai K|title=Critical factors influencing prion inactivation by sodium hydroxide.|journal=Vox Sang|date=July 2006|volume=91|issue=1|pages=34–40|pmid=16756599|doi=10.1111/j.1423-0410.2006.00790.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation sterilization==
Sterilization can be achieved using [[electromagnetic radiation]], such as [[electron beam]]s, [[X-rays]], [[gamma rays]], or irradiation by [[subatomic particle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/iachem/publications.html Trends in Radiation Sterilization of Health Care Products], IAEA, Vienna,24 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Electromagnetic or particulate radiation can be energetic enough to ionize atoms or molecules ([[ionizing radiation]]), or less energetic ([[non-ionizing radiation]]).

===Non-ionizing radiation sterilization===
{{Further|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}[[Ultraviolet]] [[light]] irradiation (UV, from a [[germicidal lamp]]) is useful for sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are transparent to [[visible light]] absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of [[biological safety cabinet]]s between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, so that it is very difficult to remove). It also damages some plastics, such as [[polystyrene]] foam if exposed for prolonged periods of time.
===Ionizing radiation sterilization===
[[File:E-beam-x-ray-gamma-efficiency.jpg|thumb|Efficiency illustration of the different radiation technologies (electron beam, X-ray, gamma rays)]]

The safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency]] and monitored by the different national [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|Nuclear Regulatory Commissions]] (NRC). The radiation exposure accidents that have occurred in the past are documented by the agency and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such improvements are then mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.

[[Gamma Radiation|Gamma radiation]] is very penetrating, and is commonly used for sterilization of disposable medical equipment, such as syringes, needles, [[cannula]]s and IV sets, and food. It is emitted by a [[radioisotope]], usually [[cobalt-60]] (&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co) or [[caesium-137]] (&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs), which have [[photon]] energies of up to 1.3 and 0.66 [[MeV]], respectively.

Use of a radioisotope requires shielding for the safety of the operators while in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. One variant keeps the radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated in the water in hermetically-sealed bells; no further shielding is required for such designs. Other uncommonly used designs use dry storage, providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. An incident in [[Decatur, Georgia]], US, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool, requiring NRC intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1989/in89082.html|title=NRC: Information Notice No. 89-82: Recent Safety-Related Incidents at Large Irradiators|website=www.nrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to use of this radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favour of the more costly, non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma [[photon]]s have about twice the energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of caesium-137-produced radiation.

[[Electron beam processing]] is also commonly used for sterilization. [[Electron beams]] use an on-off technology and provide a much higher dosing rate than gamma or X-rays. Due to the higher dose rate, less exposure time is needed and thereby any potential degradation to polymers is reduced. Because [[Electron|electrons]] carry a charge, electron beams are less penetrating than both gamma and X-rays. Facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.

[[High-energy X-rays]] (produced by [[bremsstrahlung]]) allow irradiation of large packages and [[pallet]] loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization does not require chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an [[X-ray generator]] that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as [[tantalum]] or [[tungsten]] with high-energy electrons, in a process known as bremsstrahlung conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.

[[Irradiation]] with X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons does not make materials [[radioactive]], because the energy used is too low. Generally an energy of at least 10 MeV is needed to [[induced radioactivity|induce radioactivity]] in a material.&lt;ref name="ThomadsenNath2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomadsen|first1=Bruce|last2=Nath|first2=Ravinder|last3=Bateman|first3=Fred B.|last4=Farr|first4=Jonathan|last5=Glisson|first5=Cal|last6=Islam|first6=Mohammad K.|last7=LaFrance|first7=Terry|last8=Moore|first8=Mary E.|last9=George Xu|first9=X.|last10=Yudelev|first10=Mark|title=Potential Hazard Due to Induced Radioactivity Secondary to Radiotherapy|journal=Health Physics|volume=107|issue=5|year=2014|pages=442–460|issn=0017-9078|doi=10.1097/HP.0000000000000139}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neutron|Neutrons]] and very high-energy particles can make materials radioactive, but have good penetration, whereas lower energy particles (other than neutrons) cannot make materials radioactive, but have poorer penetration.

Sterilization by irradiation with gamma rays may however affect material properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bharati |first= S |author2=Soundrapandian C |author3=Basu D |author4=Datta S |title= Studies on a novel bioactive glass and composite coating with hydroxyapatite on titanium based alloys: Effect of γ-sterilization on coating |journal= [[J.

Irradiation is used by the [[United States Postal Service]] to sterilize mail in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. Some foods (e.g. spices and ground meats) are [[food irradiation|sterilized by irradiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:wZcjSTjqaYkJ:scholar.google.com/+food+sterilization+by+irradiation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,33&amp;as_vis=1|title=Employing Ionizing Radiation to Enhance Food Safety – a Review The Purpose of Food Irradiation In recent decades, food irradia|website=scholar.googleusercontent.com|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subatomic particles may be more or less penetrating and may be generated by a radioisotope or a device, depending upon the type of particle.

==Sterile filtration==
Fluids that would be damaged by heat, irradiation or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by [[microfiltration]] using [[membrane filter]]s. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and [[protein]] solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size 0.2 [[micrometre|µm]] will usually effectively remove [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="DeptHealth"&gt;

Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. [[Cross-flow filtration|Tangential flow filtration]] (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.

Membrane filters used in production processes are commonly made from materials such as mixed [[cellulose ester]] or [[polyethersulfone]] (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The nondestructive integrity test assures the filter is undamaged and is a regulatory requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/ucm070342.pdf|title= Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing|date= September 2004|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, terminal pharmaceutical sterile filtration is performed inside of a [[cleanroom]] to prevent contamination.

==Preservation of sterility==
[[File:Curette in sterile packaging.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[curette]] in sterile packaging.]]
Instruments that have undergone sterilization can be maintained in such condition by containment in sealed packaging until use.

[[Aseptic technique]] is the act of maintaining sterility during procedures.

==Preparation==
Tongba actually is the vessel which holds the fermented millet beverage known as mandokpenaa thee.&lt;ref&gt;P.75 Handbook of Plant-Based Fermented Food and Beverage Technology, Second Edition By Y. H. Hui, E. Özgül Evranuz
CRC Press, 17 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Mandokpenaa thee is prepared by cooking and fermenting [[whole grain]] millet. The cooked millet is cooled and mixed with khesung (which is a source of molds, bacteria and yeast).&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic Fermented Foods and Alcoholic Beverages of Asia, Front Cover By Jyoti Prakash Tamang, Springer, 5 Aug 2016 - Technology &amp; Engineering - 409 pages, P.59&lt;/ref&gt; Then the mass is collected and placed in a woven bamboo basket lined with green leaves or plastic, covered with thick fold of cloth and allowed to remain in a warm place for 1–2 days depending upon the temperature. The sweet mass is then packed tightly into an earthenware pot or plastic jars and the opening is usually sealed off to prevent air from entering. After 7–15 days also depending upon the temperature, the fermentation is complete and the mass is converted to mandokpenaa thee.

The time mandokpenaa thee is left to remain undisturbed in the pot after completion of fermentation leads to maturing of the mandokpenaa thee. During the maturing the flavours and taste intensifies yet become more mellowed. Traditionally, it is stored for about six months.

It is consumed in a unique way: the fermented millet is put in a container, also traditionally called a Tongba, and boiled water is poured in it to the brim. It is then left undisturbed for about five minutes. Once the five minutes has passed it is ready to drink. A fine bamboo straw with a blind end, but perforated on the side to act as a filter, is inserted into the container to suck out the warm water and alcohol from the millet grains. More hot water is added as the tongba becomes dry, and the process is repeated until the alcohol is exhausted.

The UCSF '''Truth Tobacco Industry Documents''' (formerly known as Legacy Tobacco Documents Library) is a digital [[archive]] of [[tobacco industry]] documents, funded by [[Truth Initiative]] and created and maintained by the [[University of California, San Francisco]].  The Library is a part of the larger UCSF [[Industry Documents Library]] which also includes the [[Drug Industry Document Archive]].  TTID contains over 14 million documents produced by major tobacco companies and organizations, many of them internal strategic memoranda made public as a consequence of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]]. The documents deal with the tobacco industry’s advertising, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and scientific research activities for the last century. Researchers, journalists, students, and activists interested in tobacco control issues and [[public health]] policies use the Library extensively to investigate tobacco industry strategies.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of how this collection of documents has been utilized, see the [https://www.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docsbiblio UCSF Library Tobacco Documents Bibliography], which cites publications and scholarly articles based on research and analysis of tobacco industry documents.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
In 1994, the [[Attorney general|Attorneys General]] of four states—[[Mississippi Attorney General|Mississippi]], [[Minnesota Attorney General|Minnesota]], [[Florida Attorney General|Florida]], and [[Texas Attorney General|Texas]]—separately filed lawsuits against the tobacco industry in an effort to secure reimbursement for health care expenditures arising from tobacco-related illnesses. During the course of this litigation, 42 other states joined in similar legal actions.  The library of the [[University of California San Francisco]] (USCF) had started digitizing and hosting internal tobacco industry documents in 1995 - these efforts were part of wider efforts to make public what the tobacco industry had done and helped drive the turning of public sentiment and litigation against the tobacco companies.&lt;ref name=Hurt2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurt|first1=RD|last2=Ebbert|first2=JO|last3=Muggli|first3=ME|last4=Lockhart|first4=NJ|last5=Robertson|first5=CR|title=Open doorway to truth: legacy of the Minnesota tobacco trial.|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=May 2009|volume=84|issue=5|pages=446–56|doi=10.1016/S0025-6196(11)60563-6|pmid=19411441|pmc=2676127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a [[Master Settlement Agreement]] (MSA) was signed by the Attorneys General of 46 states and the nation's five major tobacco companies: [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], [[R. J. Reynolds]], [[Lorillard]], [[Brown &amp; Williamson]], and the [[American Tobacco Company]].&lt;ref name=Hurt2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;  The MSA effectively settled the outstanding lawsuits by requiring yearly payments by the tobacco companies to the states and placing restrictions on the advertising and marketing of tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;http://oag.ca.gov/tobacco/msa&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Master Settlement Agreement, the U.S. tobacco companies were ordered to release the internal documents produced for the case for public access in both a physical depository in Minnesota and on their own document websites. The international tobacco company, [[British American Tobacco]], was not ordered to provide a document website but they were required to deposit documents into a depository in [[Guildford]], [[England]]. The [[National Association of Attorneys General]] (NAAG) provides oversight and enforcement of this operation. In 2006, U.S. District Judge [[Gladys Kessler]] ruled in a separate case that the nation's top tobacco companies violated [[racketeering]] laws, misleading the public for years about the health hazards of smoking.  These companies were convicted under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO Act). Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds filed an appeal but Judge Kessler's ruling was upheld. As a result of this case and its appeals, the companies are now obliged to make available any documents produced for litigation on smoking and health until 2021.&lt;ref&gt;For more background on the RICO case, please access the Public Health Law Center at - http://publichealthlawcenter.org/topics/tobacco-control/tobacco-control-litigation/united-states-v-philip-morris-doj-lawsuit&lt;/ref&gt;

The MSA provisions also created and funded the American Legacy Foundation, subsequently renamed to the [[Truth Initiative]], an anti-smoking advocacy group, and in the early 2000s the foundation gave around $10 million of the settlement funds it managed to UCSF to formalize the collection it already hosted into the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and to expand their efforts.&lt;ref name=Hurt2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: American legacy foundation's $15 million gift creates permanent home for tobacco industry documents at UCSF|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2001/D/200114836.html|work=University of California - San Francisco|date=January 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409200744/http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2001/D/200114836.html|archivedate=April 9, 2005|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2002, NAAG gave the UCSF Library a large number of document index records and images to further develop the LTDL.  Documents are continually added to the MSA collections through the use of spidering (also known as "[[web crawler|web crawling]]") applications that identify and download index records and document images directly from the tobacco companies’ websites.&lt;ref name=Hurt2009/&gt;

== Collections ==
The Library collects and maintains the internal documents of the tobacco companies and their trade organizations that were a party to the Master Settlement Agreement as well as documents from other litigation or companies not party to the settlement. Among the documents are more than 8,000 tobacco industry video and audio tapes including recordings of focus groups, internal corporate meetings, depositions of tobacco industry employees, government hearings, corporate communications, and commercials. Many of the acquired tapes are available for viewing or listening on the [[Internet Archive]] at the [https://archive.org/details/tobaccoarchives UCSF Tobacco Industry Videos Collection].

* [[Lorillard]]
* [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]]
* [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]]
* [[Tobacco Institute]]

=== Additional collections include... ===
;[[British American Tobacco]]
: This collection was originally maintained in a separate digital archive known as the British American Tobacco Documents Archive (BATDA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://bat.library.ucsf.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, the BAT documents were added to the Library in an effort to provide researchers, as well as the general public, with unhindered access to the entire body of internal tobacco industry documents. The British American Tobacco (BAT) collection contains close to 7 million pages of internal corporate documents related to British American Tobacco Company (BATCo) and its parent, BAT Industries PLC.
;[[U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company]]
:The U.S. Smokeless Tobacco collection contains internal corporate documents from the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company, the largest manufacturer of [[moist snuff]] smokeless tobacco products in the U.S. and producer of the well-known brands, [[Skoal (tobacco)|Skoal]] and [[Copenhagen (tobacco)|Copenhagen]].
;UCSF Brown &amp; Williamson
:Thousands of pages of [[Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation]] documents were donated unsolicited to the UCSF Tobacco Control Archives in 1994. These documents consist primarily of scientific studies on the [[Nicotine#Dependence and withdrawal|addictive nature]] of [[nicotine]] and other health effects of tobacco smoke. Brown &amp; Williamson sought to permanently remove the disputed material from the Library with a suit filed in [[San Francisco Superior Court]]. The [[University of California]] argued that all of the documents were in the [[public domain]] and should be available to scholars and other interested parties. In May 1995, the Superior Court ruled that these documents should be made available for public review. Brown &amp; Williamson appealed that decision, but the [[California Supreme Court]] rejected the company's appeal allowing UCSF to release the documents.
;Mangini ("[[Joe Camel]]") Documents
:This collection consists of internal documents from the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, produced as part of the discovery process in the 1994 civil case ''Mangini v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company''. A majority of the documents span the period 1970s–1990s, when R. J. Reynolds Tobacco developed the Joe Camel advertising campaign.
;Pollay Advertising Collection
:A collection of over 8,500 examples of cigarette print advertising compiled and given to the Library by Richard W. Pollay, Professor Emeritus at Sauder Business School, [[University of British Columbia]].
;[[Liggett &amp; Myers]]
:This collection contains approximately 400,000 pages of [[Liggett &amp; Myers]] (L&amp;M) internal documents. In 1997, Liggett &amp; Myers, the smallest of the five major tobacco companies, became the first to settle lawsuits in 22 states and to help state prosecutors litigate against the nation's biggest cigarette manufacturers by providing evidence of industry strategies and tactics. Because of their early compliance with prosecutors, L&amp;M was not included in the Master Settlement Agreement stipulation for creation of company document websites, meaning these documents exist nowhere else in electronic format.
;Tobacco Depositions and Trial Testimony Archive (DATTA)
:DATTA contains transcripts from tobacco-related litigation, collected from a variety of sources by the Center for Tobacco Use Prevention and Research in [[Okemos, Michigan]].
;Canadian Tobacco Trials
:The Canadian Tobacco Trials collection consists of court records (transcripts, depositions, exhibits) from four major national Canadian trials: the 1989 Tobacco Products Control Act (TPCA) Trial, the 1997 Tobacco Act Trial, and the Blais-LeTourneau trials concluding in 2015.

Members of the [[United States]] population between the ages of 18 and 29 who decide that it is in their financial best interest to forgo health insurance are sometimes referred to as  '''young invincibles''' by the insurance industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Stephanie|title=Young invincibles' OK with risk of no insurance|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/17/cdc.young.people/ |publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term coined to express the idea that the young demographic perceives themselves as immune to sickness and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colorado Health Access Survey|title=Young Invincibles? Why Young Adults Have Colorado’s Highest Uninsured Rate.|journal=The Colorado Trust|year=2011|volume=6|url=http://www.coloradotrust.org/attachments/0001/9634/CHAS_YoungInvinciblesBrief_vF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument is that these individuals are young and in good health, so they have a low risk of experiencing substantial health issues that would lead to large amounts of spending on health care.&lt;ref name="cunningham" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=P.J.|author2=A.M. Bond |title=If the Price is Right, Most Uninsured—Even Young Invincibles—Likely to Consider New Health Insurance Marketplaces|journal=esearch Brief: Health System Change|date=September 2013|volume=28|series=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, this group tends to have a mentality of “it won’t happen to me” with regards to most causes of injury. Together, these beliefs lead to the young invincibles not purchasing insurance.&lt;ref name=CNBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Obamacare Math may not Add Up for ‘Young Invincibles’: Study|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101343022|accessdate=12 February 2014|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance market effects==
There are risks associated with the young invincibles choosing to operate outside of the health insurance market, stemming from the economic phenomenon of [[adverse selection]].&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt; Adverse selection is a principle describing the situation where people purchase insurance based on their expected use.&lt;ref name="cutler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutler|first=David M.|author2=Richard J. Zeckhauser |title=Adverse Selection In health Insurance|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|year=1997|volume=w6107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who anticipate using the most medical services purchase the most generous insurance plans, while people who do not expect to use many medical services are inclined not to purchase insurance at all.
 
Due to the risk-spreading design of insurance, the adverse selection associated with the young invincibles leads to higher premiums for people who choose to purchase health insurance. As insurance premiums rise, more healthy people decide that it is not worth the higher prices, and drop out of the market, leading to what is called the "adverse selection [[death spiral (insurance)|death spiral]]."&lt;ref name="cutler" /&gt; By contrast, if young adults purchase insurance but continue to utilize very little health care services, the money they pay in premiums can go towards support the expenditures of people utilizing many health care services.

==The Affordable Care Act and young adults==

This problem of ballooning health insurance premiums has persisted for years, and was important in the debate over the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], commonly called the Affordable Care Act (ACA). One set of ACA provisions eliminated the insurance industry’s ability to charge different premiums to people with differing health status and the ability to exclude individuals with pre-existing conditions.&lt;ref name=ACA&gt;{{cite web|last=CMS|first=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|title=Affordable Care Act|url=http://www.medicaid.gov/AffordableCareAct/Provisions/Eligibility.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Implemented alone, these provisions would greatly increase the risk in the health insurance market, and premiums would increase to cover associated increases in expenditure.&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt; Therefore, the ACA includes a number of provisions aimed at incentivizing young invincibles to enter into the health insurance market.&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt;

'''Individual mandate.''' The [[individual mandate]] applies to young adults and young adults may be eligible for a [[premium tax credit]], lowering or eliminating the cost of insurance.&lt;ref name=HA&gt;{{cite journal|title=Young adults and the Affordable Care Act: The health care law promises to extend coverage to millions of young adults, yet many will remain uninsured.|journal=Health Affairs|date=December 6, 2013|url=http://healthaffairs.org/healthpolicybriefs/brief_pdfs/healthpolicybrief_105.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is particularly significant for young adults because they disproportionately compose those with incomes between 133-400% of the Federal Poverty Line who are entering the workforce for the first time. It is estimated that approximately nine million young adults ages 18–34 could be eligible for a subsidy.&lt;ref name=HA/&gt;

'''Dependent coverage.''' Legislation requires family insurance plans with dependent coverage to extend this coverage until young adults reach the age of 26.&lt;ref name="white house"&gt;{{cite web|title=Young adults and the Affordable Care Act: Protecting young adults and eliminating burdens on businesses and families.|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/qa_young_adults_may.pdf|publisher=White House|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the ACA, most employer-based health insurance plans stopped dependent coverage when the child turned 18 or 19, or had graduated from college.&lt;ref name=HA /&gt; Effective September 23, 2010, young adults can join or remain on their parents’ insurance plans even if they are married, not living with their parents, attending school, financially independent from their parents, or eligible to enroll in an employer’s insurance plan.&lt;ref name="white house"/&gt; The coverage extension applies to both employer-based and private plans.
 
'''Catastrophic coverage.''' Adults who are under the age of 30 and have experienced certain hardship may qualify for a cheaper “catastrophic” health plan. The catastrophic health plan is meant to protect young adults from very high medical costs. Purchased through the Exchanges, the plan covers three primary care visits per year at no cost to the individual and covers free preventive services.&lt;ref name=ACA/&gt;  Reasons for exemption vary, such as homelessness or experience of domestic violence, and some require documented proof, such as an eviction or foreclosure notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Application for exemption from the shared responsibility payment for individuals who experience hardships|url=http://marketplace.cms.gov/getofficialresources/publications-and-articles/hardship-exemption.pdf|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, regardless of income, young adults must pay the standard price for the catastrophic plan (i.e., individuals purchasing these plans are not eligible for lower monthly premiums or lower out-of-pocket costs based on income).&lt;ref name=ACA/&gt;

'''Other provisions.''' Many other ACA provisions are also relevant to young adults and effectively encourage young adults to buy insurance:
 
·       The expansion of [[Medicaid]], if universally adopted, could cover nearly 7.8 million young adults under the age of 35.&lt;ref name=HA/&gt; As of December 11, 2013, 25 states and the District of Columbia planned to expand their Medicaid programs beginning in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Status of State Action on the Medicaid Expansion Decision, as of December 11, 2013.|url=http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/#note-2|publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
·       As with other individuals, young adults cannot be denied health coverage due to a pre-existing condition.&lt;ref name=ACA/&gt;

==Challenges to enrollment==
The White House faces the challenge of proving the value of health insurance to at least 2.7 million young invincibles who have historically been under-represented in the insurance pool.&lt;ref name=CNBC/&gt;

Many studies reporting on this effort conclude that insurance may be too great an expense and provide too little benefit to healthy young adults, making them willing to pay the penalty instead.&lt;ref name=CNBC/&gt; Analysis suggests that healthy young adults who opt out of insurance could spend an average of five times less on health care than those who sign up for insurance.&lt;ref name=CNBC/&gt; Another barrier to enrolling young adults is political or ideological opposition to the ACA. As health care reform under the ACA is closely associated with the Obama Administration and the Democratic Party, some young Americans may base their support on political affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamblin|first=James|title=Some Americans Say They Support the Affordable Care Act but Not Obamacare|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/some-americans-say-they-support-the-affordable-care-act-but-not-obamacare/280165/|accessdate=11 February 2014|newspaper=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political groups opposed to reform have developed campaigns  encouraging young adults to refrain from purchasing insurance in the Marketplaces. One example is Generation Opportunity’s digital and grassroots “Opt-Out” initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Opt Out of Obamacare?|url=http://optout.org|publisher=Generation Opportunity|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to enroll young adults were impeded as this subset of the population and people across the United States had great difficulty in accessing and using Healthcare.gov (the site intended to help people enroll in the Federally facilitated Exchange) during the initial enrollment launch in 2013.&lt;ref name=CNBC/&gt;

==Outreach and enrollment strategies==
'''Campaigns.''' Leading up to and throughout the first annual enrollment period, health insurance Marketplaces and advocacy groups released social media and other forms of campaigns. Many of these campaigns were aimed at encouraging young adults in particular to sign up for insurance. Examples include [[Covered California]]’s “Tell a Friend - Get Covered”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tell A Friend - Get Covered|url=http://tellafriendgetcovered.com/|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and “Got Insurance,” a project of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and ProgressNow Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Got Insurance? Thanks Obamacare!|url=http://thanksobamacare.org/|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maryland’s Maryland Health Connection partnered with 2013 [[Super Bowl]] champions, the [[Baltimore Ravens]], to connect with residents on the importance of developing a “health coverage game plan.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lt. Governor Brown and Maryland Health Connection Unveil Advertising and Outreach Campaign|url=http://dhmh.maryland.gov/newsroom1/Pages/LT--GOVERNOR-BROWN-AND-MARYLAND-HEALTH-CONNECTION-UNVEIL-ADVERTISING-AND-OUTREACH-CAMPAIGN-.aspx|publisher=Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Association of Retired Persons ([[AARP]]) developed a series of e-cards for parents to send to their children as a reminder to sign up before the enrollment deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affordable Care Act E-Cards|url=http://www.aarp.org/ws/affordable-care-act/mom-means-it/|publisher=AARP|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celebrity endorsements.''' Celebrities including pop icon [[Lady Gaga]], singers [[Adam Levine]] and [[John Legend]], and actresses [[Olivia Wilde]] and [[Amy Poehler]], have shown public support for the ACA and Marketplace enrollment via [[Twitter]] and other social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavender|first=Paige|title=Adam Levine, Kal Penn Among Celebrities Involved In Obamacare Push|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/12/adam-levine-obamacare_n_4432192.html|accessdate=11 February 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Youth Enrollment Day.'''  A National Youth Enrollment Day launched on February 15, 2014.&lt;ref name=yed&gt;{{cite web|title=Are you ready for National Youth Enrollment Day?|url=http://www.getcoveredamerica.org/ready-national-youth-enrollment-day/|work=Get Covered America|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initiative was led by the non-profits Young Invincibles and Get Covered America.&lt;ref name=yed/&gt;

==Enrollment figures (2013-2014)==
;Federally facilitated exchange.
Initial enrollment data from the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] show that young adults are signing up for plans in the Federally facilitated Exchange. Numbers from the first quarter of Marketplace activity (October 1, 2013 to December 28, 2013) demonstrated that nearly one-quarter (24%) of the population who had selected a Marketplace plan were between the ages of 18 and 34, reflective of the proportion of young adults making up the same age group in the general population.&lt;ref name=hhs&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Insurance Marketplace: January Enrollment Report|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2014/MarketPlaceEnrollment/Jan2014/ib_2014jan_enrollment.pdf|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   An eight-fold increase was observed in the cumulative number of 18- to 34-year-olds who signed up for a marketplace plan in the last month of the reported period. At the same time, the Commonwealth Fund’s Affordable Care Act Tracking Study revealed that 41% of visitors to Marketplaces were between the ages of 19 and 34, suggesting that overall enrollment numbers would continue to increase as the March 31, 2014 deadline approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans’ Experiences in the Health Insurance Marketplaces: Results From the First Three Months|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Data-Briefs/2014/Jan/Experiences-in-the-Health-Insurance-Marketplaces.aspx|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;State Marketplaces.
At the state level, initial Marketplace enrollment data for young adults generally reflected that of the Federally facilitated Exchange. Most states reported 21-27% participation by this key age group.&lt;ref name=hhs/&gt; States at lower extremes included [[Arkansas]], [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], with initial enrollment rates by young adults hovering between 17-18%.&lt;ref name=hhs/&gt; [[Massachusetts]] and the [[District of Columbia]] are among those reporting higher initial rates of enrollment by young adults, at 31% and 43%, respectively.&lt;ref name=hhs/&gt;
