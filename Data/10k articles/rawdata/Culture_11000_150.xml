'''Baenan''' (''Baenã, Baenán, Baena'') is a poorly attested language of [[Brazil]].  The last remaining speaker lived in [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]] in 1940.  The language of this speaker was associated with the Baenan language as the last members of the Baenan tribe lived in Paragaçú, [[Bahia]], near where the language was attested.

A '''board of education''', '''school committee''' or '''school board''' is the [[board of directors]], board of trustees of a school, local [[school district]] or equivalent.

The elected council determines the educational policy in a small regional area, such as a [[city]], [[county]], [[Federated state|state]], or [[province]]. Frequently, a board of directors power with a larger institution, such as a higher government's department of education. The name of such board is also often used to refer to the school system under such board's control.

The government department that administered [[education in the United Kingdom]] before the foundation of the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]] was formerly called the [[Board of Education (United Kingdom)|Board of Education]].

== History  ==
The American board of education traces its origins back to 1647, with the formation of the first American public school system, the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] mandated that every town establish a public school within its jurisdiction. Committees sprang up to run the institutions, and in the 1820s the state of [[Massachusetts]] required such committees to be independent of local governments, establishing the current model for the autonomous school districts that exist throughout the [[United States]]. The [[United States Constitution]] reserved educational authority in the hands of the states pursuant to the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], wherein most states have passed such authority to local '''school boards'''. For over a century, '''local boards''' were solely responsible for public education funding, standards, instruction, and results, which to a certain extent remains true today. At their height in the 1930s there were as many as 127,500 boards. Some sparsely populated states had more school board members than teachers and for much of their history, such boards presided over school systems serving agrarian and industrial economies.&lt;ref&gt;url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=66423636&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">'''Bottle cutting''' is an activity in which a person cuts a [[bottle]] using one of a variety of techniques, to create a new product.  Techniques can include [[saw]]ing or using [[Hot-wire foam cutter|hot wire]]. Around the late 1950s and early 1960s, some [[restaurant]]s began making [[List of glassware|glasses]] by cutting [[wine bottle]]s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, bottle cutting kits started to appear on the market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ephremsbottleworks.com/&lt;/ref&gt; By 1972, the technique had "caught on like wildfire"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA190&amp;dq=%22Bottle+cutting%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cFv5TujiC4mJmQW6hf2jAg&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bottle%20cutting%22&amp;f=false | title=Popular Mechanics | date=November 1972 | accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later described as a [[fad]] of the previous decade in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0n0gAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Bottle+cutting%22&amp;dq=%22Bottle+cutting%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFr5TpqVK4eGmQWduoSDAg&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBTgK | title=Mechanix illustrated , Volume 79, Issues 656-661 | publisher=CBS Publications | year=1983 | accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final step in bottle cutting is [[polishing]], because no matter how carefully one cuts a bottle, the edges will be rough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aP9GAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Bottle+cutting%22&amp;dq=%22Bottle+cutting%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NVn5ToWcOs3DmQXz1rGXAg&amp;ved=0CHEQ6AEwCQ | title=Re/uses: 2133 ways to recycle and reuse the things you ordinarily throw away | accessdate=December 27, 2011 | author=Jabs, Carolyn | pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bottom''''' is a British TV [[British sitcom|sitcom]] created by [[Adrian Edmondson]] and [[Rik Mayall]] that originally aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] from 17 September 1991 to 10 April 1995 across three series. The show stars Edmondson and Mayall as Edward Elizabeth "Eddie" Hitler and Richard "Richie" Richard, two flatmates who live in [[Hammersmith]], [[West London (sub region)|West London]]. The show is noted for its chaotic, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] humour and violent comedy [[slapstick]].&lt;ref name="bsg1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/bottom/| title=British Sitcom Guide - Bottom| accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bottom'' also spawned five stage-show tours between 1993 and 2003, and a feature film, ''[[Guest House Paradiso]]'' (1999). Plans for a spin-off series titled ''[[Hooligan's Island]]'' featuring various ''Bottom'' characters were cancelled in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-15/bbc-bottom-reunion-series-hooligans-island-scrapped | title=BBC Bottom reunion series Hooligan's Island scrapped | work= Radio Times | date=15 October 2012 | first=Tom | last=Cole | accessdate=15 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''Bottom'' came in at No. 45 in the "Britain's Best Sitcom" poll by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/top11to100.shtml| title=BBC - Britain's Best Sitcom - Top 11 to 100| accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Eddie and Richie are two pathetic, misogynistic, slobby flatmates living in a filthy, damp flat at 11 Mafeking Parade in [[Hammersmith]], London. Mayall described them as "unemployed survivors".&lt;ref&gt;https://rikmayallinterviews.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/whos-laughing-now/&lt;/ref&gt; They spend their time concocting desperate schemes to convince women to have sex with them, including buying sex spray, forging money, and pretending to be aristocrats. Their plans are never successful however, and the stress of their miserable lives can cause them to become irritable with each other.  Whenever tensions hit breaking point, Richie and Eddie end up fighting (albeit in a comical, Tom and Jerry-style, with adult themes). Both men are immature. Richie is a [[virgin]]; he is insecure and clueless on how to talk to women. Despite being a penniless slob, he occasionally projects a pompous sort of snobbery in an attempt to impress others and boost his [[self-esteem]]; he is [[sexually frustrated]] and obsessed with losing his virginity. Eddie, the more popular of the two, enjoys drinking regularly, and often secretly steals family heirlooms and cash from Richie, although he occasionally has inventive moments, like building a cash forger, an electric toilet, and a time machine. Eddie's friends — the gormless Spudgun and Dave Hedgehog — both fear Richie, believing him to be [[psychosis|psychotic]]. Although the four of them sometimes venture out, usually to the local [[pub]], the Lamb and Flag, most of the episodes are set within the confines of the squalid flat.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
[[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]] and [[Rik Mayall]] had been a [[double act]] since their first meeting at [[20th Century Coyote]], while they were students at [[Manchester University]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/rick_mayall_person_page.shtml| title=BBC - Comedy - People A-Z - Rik Mayall'| accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timeout1991/&gt; They developed the Eddie and Richie characters over the course of their career, which were loosely based on their own friendship. The names themselves come from Edmondson's and Mayall's own nicknames for each other; many of Mayall's characters are referred to by some variation of the name Richard, and Edmondson's character is taken from Eddie Monsoon, his nickname since university. The duo used their characters similar to Eddie and Richie in their past television comedy shows ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', ''[[The Dangerous Brothers]]'', and ''[[Filthy, Rich &amp; Catflap]]''.

''Bottom'' was developed while Edmondson and Mayall planned their [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''  at the [[Queen's Theatre]]. According to Mayall, it was the first project that the two wrote in "some time", and it was their best work, marking "a new chapter in their relationship".&lt;ref name=timeout1991&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bums The Word|first=Steven|last=Grant|journal=Time Out|date=25 September 1991|accessdate=5 January 2016|url=https://rikmayallinterviews.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/bums-the-word/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was initially as a joke, and originally intended to be "Your Bottom", giving viewers the fun of saying things like "I saw Your Bottom last night", and "I love Your Bottom"; Mayall said that [[Alan Yentob]], then head of BBC2, took a dislike to the name and so he and Edmondson went with it. He added, "It's about two guys at the bottom of the heap ... we called it ''Bottom'' to make people think we were doing bottom jokes".&lt;ref name=arena1991&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Arena|title=Who's Laughing Now?|date=1991|url=https://rikmayallinterviews.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/whos-laughing-now/}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's rude, stupid, and a waste of license payers' money".&lt;ref name=nme1991&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Dead from the Bottom Up |date=12 October 1991|journal=NME|accessdate=5 January 2016|url=https://rikmayallinterviews.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/dead-from-the-bottom-up/}} Rik Mayall Interviews and Articles Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
Each episode was filmed in front of a [[studio audience|live audience]] at 35 minutes in length, then edited to 30 minutes. The original-length scripts can be found in the published script books, and several completely removed scenes were included in the [[VHS]] release ''Fluff'' that consisted mostly of [[bloopers]]. Several (but not all) of these scenes, as well as some smaller sections of dialogue also removed for timing reasons, are included in [[DVD]] releases.

The final episode of the second series, "[['s Out]]", was not broadcast as part of the original series, or as a part of the first repeat airing of the series. This episode was set on [[Wimbledon Common]] involving the antics of a [[exhibitionism|flasher]], and prior to broadcast on 15 July 1992, after the episode was filmed but before it had aired, [[Rachel Nickell]] was murdered on Wimbledon Common. In consequence the BBC delayed the episode's broadcast before the VHS release of the second series. The episode was first broadcast as part of a rerun of the second series on 10 April 1995.

Following the second series, Edmondson and Mayall pursued other projects, including the ''Bottom'' theatrical productions. They reconvened in 1994 to film the third series. A fourth series was written but turned down by the BBC.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Further plans for ''Bottom''==
Though the pair were working apart, a fourth series was at one point written{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, but the BBC declined the script, despite announcing that ''Bottom'' would return in a voice-over during the end-credits of the original broadcast of the final episode{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. (Mayall had commented, in typical style, that it was "rejected by some [[lesbian]] bitch"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}). Edmondson had, however, stated in interviews that he would have liked to make another series of ''Bottom'' with Mayall, but "in about fifteen years' time, when they are old men". Rik Mayall maintained that they would work together, they just needed "a good idea".{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

However, in December 2004, almost exactly a year after the ''Weapons Grade Y-Fronts'' tour had ended, Edmondson told the British ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper that the pair felt it was "[...] definitely time to stop. We're both getting too old. We both realised that the show wasn't as engaging as it used to be. We were starting to look a bit ridiculous. [...] We're both nearly fifty and we're starting to feel slightly undignified talking about wanking and knobs constantly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-125541184.html|title=The Young Ones Have Grown Old. So It's Time for Rik and I to Split|date=1 December 2004|first=Barbara|last=Davies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, Edmondson confirmed to the ''[[Daily Express]]'' that he had quit comedy, stating that his interest in it has declined for many years, and wanted to focus more on his band, claiming it is 'more fun than doing comedy.' He also dismissed the idea of a potential reunion with Mayall, saying it is 'very unlikely'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Daily Express]]|url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/adrian-edmondson-unlikely-to-work-with-bottom-244883 |title= Adrian Edmondson 'unlikely' to work with Bottom partner Rik Mayall again after quitting comedy |author= Alun Palmer |date=27 January 2012 |origyear=1 September 2010 |id= "[http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/172120/I%92ve-had-last-laugh%2C-says-Adrian/ I've had last laugh says Adrian]" at Express.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 5 March 2011, the duo made a surprise reunion when Edmondson partook in ''[[Let's Dance for Comic Relief]]''. The pre-recorded show ended with Mayall hurling a custard pie in Edmondson's face. During his performance, dubbed "The Dying Swan," Mayall appeared again, this time live on stage, to abruptly end Edmondson's performance by hitting him several times with a frying pan. Backstage, Edmondson mentioned that it had been eight years since they've "done anything like that." He went on to come out on top of the voting results and won a place in the final, in which Mayall returned, once again, to drop a ton weight upon Edmondson.

Following this, Edmondson mentioned that he and Mayall had conceived an idea for a sitcom set in a retirement home:
{{quote|Rik and I have an idea for a sitcom for when we are very, very old. We want to set it in an old people's home 30 years hence. It will be like 'Bottom', but we will be hitting each other with colostomy bags!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Mayall and Edmondson write retirement home comedy |url= http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000508/rik_mayall_adrian_edmondson_oap_retirement_comedy/ |work= British Comedy Guide |accessdate= 14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 2011, Edmondson appeared on the Sunday-morning cooking show ''Something for the Weekend'' and confirmed to presenter [[Tim Lovejoy]] that he and Mayall were planning to reunite and make another series of ''Bottom'', set in a retirement home. However, no specific dates were stated regarding the project.

===''Hooligan's Island''===
On 19 August 2012, Edmondson tweeted that he and Mayall had begun writing a new project together, possibly a series based on their 1997 stage show, ''[[Bottom Live 3: Hooligan's Island]]''. On 23 August the BBC announced that they had commissioned a series of ''[[Hooligan's Island]]'' to be aired on BBC2 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/bbctwo-commissions.html |title=BBC Two announces raft of new commissions |date=23 August 2012 |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Skipper |first=Ben |url= http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/bottom-to-return-after-18-years.html |title=Yahoo |publisher= Uk.tv.yahoo.com |date=23 August 2012 |accessdate= 19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was cancelled that October prior to production as Edmondson said that he wished to pursue other interests.

== Spin-offs ==
=== Stage show ===
Edmondson and Mayall toured ''Bottom'' across five UK tours. The first tour, ''Bottom Live'', lasted 43 dates across 10 weeks in 1993.&lt;ref name=gq1993&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=GQ|date=June 1993|title=Direct Mayall|accessdate=5 January 2016|url=https://rikmayallinterviews.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/direct-mayall/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage shows were often cruder than the television series with stronger language and new elements such as Richie's latent [[bisexuality]] and occasional desire to have sex with Eddie, such is Richie's desperation to have sex with anything. A show from each tour was recorded and released for home video.

=== ''Guest House Paradiso'' ===
{{main article|Guest House Paradiso}}
Following the 1997 "Hooligan's Island" tour, Mayall and Edmondson wrote a spin-off movie together, which Edmondson directed, entitled ''[[Guest House Paradiso]]'', released in 1999. The DVD release was advertised as the "''Bottom'' movie", although this had been denied on its cinema release, as in 1999's interview on UK breakfast show ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'', the week prior to its British cinema release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdT8MUmRhrE |title=Rik and Ade on the Big Breakfast |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, despite the characters being given new surnames ('Richard Twat' - which he insists is pronounced 'Thwaite' -  and 'Eddie Elizabeth Ndingobamba'), they are effectively the same characters, transposed to the situation of running a grotty remote guest house next to a [[nuclear power plants in the United Kingdom|nuclear power plant]]. The style of humour is very much in the same vein as ''Bottom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=5291 |title=Empire review of Guest House Paradiso |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a storyline of the pair feeding guests radioactive fish, causing massive amounts of vomiting.

The '''Central Zone languages''', also known as the '''Hindi languages''', are a group of related language [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] spoken across northern and central India. These language varieties form the central part of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] family, itself a part of the [[Indo-European languages]] family. They historically form a [[dialect continuum]] that descends from the Madhya [[Prakrit]]s. Located in the [[Hindi Belt]], the Hindi language varieties also includes the [[Khariboli dialect]], the primary dialect spoken in [[Delhi]] and the basis of modern [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]]. This dialect developed over centuries into the medieval [[Hindustani language]], of which [[Modern Standard Hindi]] and [[Modern Standard Urdu]] are today derived from. Both Hindi and Urdu are standardizations of the Hindustani language that was historically spoken in Delhi and used as a lingua franca across Northern India. In regards to the Indo-Aryan language family, the coherence of this language group depends on the classification being used; here only Eastern and Western Hindi will be considered.

==Languages==
If there can be considered a consensus within the dialectology of Hindi proper, it is that it can be split into two sets of dialects: ''Western'' and ''Eastern Hindi''.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p251"&gt;{{Harv|Shapiro|2003|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Western Hindi'' evolved from the [[Apabhramsa]] form of [[Shauraseni language|Shauraseni Prakrit]], ''Eastern Hindi'' from ''[[Ardhamagadhi]]''.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p277"&gt;{{Harv|Shapiro|2003|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Western Hindi.png|thumb|'''Western Hindi''' languages.  Clockwise from the top: Hindustani, Kannauji, Bundeli, Braj, Haryanvi.&lt;br&gt;The '''Eastern Hindi''' languages are not shown individually.  They are Awadhi in the north, east of Hindustani and Kannauji; Bagheli in the center, to the east of Bundeli, and Chhattisgarhi to the southeast of Bundeli.]]
# '''Western Hindi'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Linguistic Survey of India|9|1|chapter=Western Hindi|chapter-url=https://archive.org/download/rosettaproject_hin_detail-2/rosettaproject_hin_detail-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#*[[Braj Bhasha]] (21 m), spoken in western [[Uttar Pradesh]] and adjacent districts of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]].
#* [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]] (8 m), spoken in [[Chandigarh]], [[Haryana]],  and as a minority in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Delhi]].
#* [[Bundeli language|Bundeli]] (3 m), spoken in south-western [[Uttar Pradesh]] and west-central [[Madhya Pradesh]].
#* [[Kannauji language|Kannauji]] (9.5 m), spoken in west-central [[Uttar Pradesh]].
#* [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (312 m), including the [[prestige dialect|standard vernacular]] dialect [[Khariboli dialect|Khariboli]] (and its standardised forms Standard [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]]), spoken in western [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Delhi]].
# '''Eastern Hindi'''
#* [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]] (38 m), spoken in north and north-central Uttar Pradesh as well as Fiji.
#* [[Bagheli language|Bagheli]] (8 m), spoken in north-central Madhya Pradesh and south-eastern Uttar Pradesh.
#* [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]] (13 m), spoken in southeast Madhya Pradesh and northern and central [[Chhattisgarh]].

This analysis excludes varieties sometimes claimed for Hindi for cultural reasons, such as [[Bihari languages|Bihari]], [[Rajasthani languages|Rajasthani]], and [[Pahari languages|Pahari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Shapiro|2003|pp=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhojpuri]] is classified under the Bihari languages though it has long been considered a Hindi language.

[[Romani language|Romani]], [[Domari language|Domari]], [[Lomavren language|Lomavren]], and [[Seb Seliyer language|Seb Seliyer]] (or at least their ancestors) appear to be Central Zone languages that migrated to the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]] ca. 500–1000 CE in three distinct waves. [[Parya language|Parya]] is a Central Zone language of Central Asia.

To Western Hindi ''[[Ethnologue]]'' adds [[Sansi language|Sansi]], [[Bagheli language|Powari]], Chamari (a [[spurious languages|spurious language]]), [[Bhaya language|Bhaya]], [[Gowari|Gowli]] (not a separate language), and [[Ghera language|Ghera]].

==Use in culturally non-Hindi regions==

* [[Urdu]] is the official language of [[Pakistan]]. Although only the native language of 7% of the population, it is nearly universal as a second language among the literate.
* [[Bombay Hindi]] ("Bombay Baat"), the dialect of the city of [[Mumbai]] (Bombay); it is based on [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] but heavily influenced by [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. Technically it is a [[pidgin]], i.e. neither is it a native language of any people nor is it used in formal settings by the educated and upper social strata. However, it is often used in the movies of [[Hindi cinema]] ([[Bollywood]]) because Mumbai is the base of the Bollywood film industry.
* [[Dakhini]], including [[Hyderabadi Urdu]], and [[Dakhini|Bangalori Urdu]], a dialect of Urdu spoken in the present areas of the erstwhile [[Hyderabad State]], and the historical [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan region]]. There is a small but distinct difference between Dakhini and standard [[Hindustani language|Hindi-Urdu]], which is bigger the further south it is spoken.
* [[Andaman Creole Hindi]] is a trade language of the [[Andaman Islands]].
* [[Fiji Hindi]] is an [[Eastern Hindi]] [[Lingua franca|lingua-franca]] that developed among [[Indo-Fijians]].
* [[Caribbean Hindustani]] and "[[Caribbean_Hindustani#Sarnami_Hindustani|Sarnami]]" are [[Eastern Hindi]] [[Lingua franca|lingua-franca]] that developed among [[Indo-Caribbean]]s and are very similar to the [[Bhojpuri]] and [[Awadhi]] dialect of Hindi and to [[Fiji Hindi]].
* Mauritian Hindi is spoken in [[Mauritius]]. It is based on [[Bhojpuri]] and influenced by French.
* South African Hindi, based on Bhojpuri, Awadhi, and Standard Hindi, is spoken by [[Indian South Africans]].

The '''comedy of intrigue''', also known as the '''comedy of situation''', is a [[Literary genre|genre]] of [[comedy]] in which [[Action (philosophy)|dramatic action]] is prioritised over the development of [[Character (arts)|character]], complicated strategems and conspiracies drive the plot, and [[Farce|farcical humour]] and contrived or ridiculous dramatic situations are often employed.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster (1995, 261) and Pavis (1998, 65).&lt;/ref&gt; Characterisation tends to be defined only vaguely and the plot gives the illusion of dynamic, constant movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 65).&lt;/ref&gt; The German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] argued that characters pursue their aims in such comedies via the use of [[deception]].&lt;ref&gt;Paolucci (1978, 101).&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was first developed in the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatre of classical Rome]] by [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].&lt;ref&gt;Law (2011, 120).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of comedies of intrigue include [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Niccolò Machiavelli's]] ''[[The Mandrake]]'' (1524), the [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] Italian play ''[[The Deceived Ones]]'' (1531), [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (c. 1596) and "[[Much Ado About Nothing]]", [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[The Wise Woman of Hoxton]]'' (c. 1604), [[Molière]]'s ''[[Scapin the Schemer]]'' (1671), and the plays of [[Aphra Behn]] and [[Thomas D'Urfey]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohn (1998, 234), Hochman (1984, 251), and Pavis (1998, 65).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Attested in English in 1819, the word ''dermatology'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] δέρματος (''dermatos''), genitive of δέρμα (''derma''), "skin"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dde%2Frma δέρμα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; (itself from δέρω ''dero'', "to flay"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dde%2Frw δέρω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;) and -λογία ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]''.

== History ==
{{Main|History of dermatology}}
Readily visible alterations of the skin surface have been recognized since the dawn of history, with some being treated, and some not.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  In 1801 the first great school of dermatology became a reality at the famous [[Hôpital Saint-Louis]] in Paris, while the first textbooks (Willan's, 1798–1808) and atlases ([[Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert|Alibert's]], 1806–1814) appeared in print during the same period of time.&lt;ref name="Fitz"&gt;Freedberg, et al.

===United States===
After earning a medical degree ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]), the length of training in the United States for a general dermatologist to be eligible for Board Certification by the American Academy of Dermatology, [[American Board of Dermatology]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology]] is a total of four years.  This training consists of an initial medical, transitional, surgical, or pediatric intern year followed by a three-year dermatology residency.&lt;ref name="aad.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abderm.org/residency.html |title=American Board of Dermatology |publisher=Abderm.org |accessdate=2012-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610234130/http://www.abderm.org/residency.html |archive-date=2013-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Creative Innovations |url=http://www.aocd.org/qualify/board_certification.html |title=American Osteopathic College of Dermatology - Qualifications Overview |publisher=Aocd.org |accessdate=2012-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061926/http://www.aocd.org/qualify/board_certification.html |archive-date=2012-10-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this training, one- or two- year post-residency fellowships are available in [[immunodermatology]], [[phototherapy]], [[laser medicine]], [[Mohs micrographic surgery]], [[cosmetic surgery]], [[dermatopathology]], or pediatric dermatology.  For the past several years, dermatology residency positions in the United States have been one of the most competitive to obtain.&lt;ref name="most competitive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/93/editorial/residency/wu2.html|title="...has been the most competitive of all specialties for at least the last 5-6 years."

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, a dermatologist is a medically qualified practitioner who has gone on to specialize in medicine and then sub-specialize in dermatology. This involves:

* Medical school for five years to obtain an MBBS, MBBCh or MB, BChir degree
* One year of house jobs before becoming fully registered as a medical practitioner
* Two to three years training in general medicine to obtain a higher degree in medicine and become a member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]
* Having obtained the [[Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of the United Kingdom|MRCP]] examination, applying to become a Specialty Registrar (StR) in Dermatology and training for four years in dermatology
* Passing the Specialty Certificate Examination (SCE) in Dermatology before the end of training

Upon successful completion of the four-year training period, the doctor becomes an accredited dermatologist and is able to apply for a consultant hospital post as a consultant dermatologist.

== Fields ==

=== Cosmetic dermatology ===
[[File:Obagijf1938.JPG|thumb|A Cosmetic dermatology unit in [[SM City North Edsa]], Philippines]]
Dermatologists have been leaders in the field of cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology'' (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 895. {{ISBN|0-7216-2921-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some dermatologists complete fellowships in surgical dermatology.  Many are trained in their residency on the use of [[botulinum toxin]], fillers, and laser surgery.  Some dermatologists perform cosmetic procedures including [[liposuction]], [[blepharoplasty]], and [[face lift]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daytonskinsurgery.org/fellowship.html |title=Dayton Skin Care Specialists: Fellowship Information |publisher=Daytonskinsurgery.org |accessdate=2012-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928023900/http://www.daytonskinsurgery.org/fellowship.html |archivedate=2012-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UC Davis Health System, Department of Dermatology |url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/dermatology/education/fellowship.html |title=ACGMC Procedural Dermatology Fellow |publisher=Ucdmc.ucdavis.edu |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most dermatologists limit their cosmetic practice to minimally invasive procedures.  Despite an absence of formal guidelines from the [[American Board of Dermatology]], many cosmetic fellowships are offered in both surgery and laser medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Hair Growth Oil|url=http://www.mb103.com/lnk.asp?o=12367&amp;c=119019&amp;a=293904&amp;l=12644|accessdate= 24 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dermatopathology ===
A dermatolopathologist is a [[pathologist]] or dermatologist who specializes in the [[pathology]] of the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medschool.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=1158&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=838|title=What is dermatopathology? Diagnosing disorders of the skin - David Geffen School of Medicine - Los Angeles, CA|website=medschool.ucla.edu|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field is shared by dermatologists and pathologists.  Usually a dermatologist or pathologist will complete one year of dermatopathology fellowship.  This usually includes six months of general pathology, and six months of dermatopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwpathology.org/academics/residency/fellowship/DermGoals.pdf |title=DRAFT |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alumni of both specialties can qualify as dermatopathologists.  At the completion of a standard residency in dermatology, many dermatologists are also competent at dermatopathology.  Some dermatopathologists qualify to sit for their examinations by completing a residency in dermatology and one in pathology.

=== Immunodermatology ===
This field specializes in the treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases such as [[lupus]], [[bullous pemphigoid]], [[pemphigus vulgaris]], and other immune-mediated skin disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medicine.utah.edu/dermatology/labservices/immunodermatology/services/disease-list.php|title=Disease List - U of U School of Medicine -  {{!}} University of Utah|website=medicine.utah.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialists in this field often run their own immunopathology labs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}Immunodermatology testing is essential for the correct diagnosis and treatment of many diseases affecting epithelial organs including skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.The various diseases often overlap in clinical and histological presentation and, although the diseases themselves are not common, may present with features of common skin disorders such as urticaria, eczema and chronic itch. Therefore, the diagnosis of an immunodermatological disease is often delayed.Tests are performed on blood and tissues that are sent to various laboratories from medical facilities and referring physicians across the United States.

===Mohs surgery===
{{Main|Mohs surgery}}
The dermatologic subspecialty called [[Mohs surgery]] focuses on the excision of skin cancers using a tissue-sparing technique that allows intraoperative assessment of 100% of the peripheral and deep tumor margins developed in the 1930s by Dr. [[Frederic E. Mohs]].  The procedure is defined as a type of [[CCPDMA]] processing. Physicians trained in this technique must be comfortable with both pathology and surgery, and dermatologists receive extensive  training in both during their residency.  Physicians who perform Mohs surgery can receive training in this specialized technique during their dermatology residency, but many will seek additional training either through preceptorships to join the American Society for Mohs Surgery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=About ASMS|publisher=American Society for Mohs Surgery| url=http://www.mohssurgery.org/about-asms/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or through formal one to two years Mohs surgery fellowship training programs administered by the American College of Mohs Surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mohscollege.org/acms/difference.php |title=The Mohs College Difference |publisher=Mohscollege.org |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique requires the integration of the same doctor in two different capacities: surgeon as well as pathologist. In case either of the two responsibilities is assigned to another doctor or qualified  health care professional, it will not be considered to be Mohs surgery.

=== Pediatric dermatology ===
Physicians can qualify for this specialization by completing both a pediatric residency and a dermatology residency.  Or they might elect to complete a post-residency fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abderm.org/subspecialties/pediatric.html |title=Subspecialty Certification in Pediatric Dermatology |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=The American Board of Dermatology |accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This field encompasses the complex diseases of the [[neonate]]s, hereditary skin diseases or [[genodermatosis|genodermatoses]], and the many difficulties of working with the [[pediatric]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.medscape.com/resource/pediatric-dermatology |title=Pediatric Dermatology |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Medscape |accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teledermatology ===
{{Main|Teledermatology}}
[[Teledermatology]] is a form of dermatology where telecommunication technologies are used to exchange medical information via all kinds of media (audio, visual and also data communication, but typically photos of dermatologic conditions) usually made by non-dermatologists for evaluation off-site by dermatologists).&lt;ref&gt;Burg G, Soyer H.P, Chimenti S. (2005): Teledermatology In: Frisch P, Burgdorf W.: EDF White Book, Skin Diseases in Europe. Berlin, 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Perednia, M.D., Nancy A. Brown, M.L.S., OregonHealthSciencesUniversity [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=225996&amp;blobtype=pdf Teledermatology: one application of telemedicine]&lt;/ref&gt;
This subspecialty deals with options to view skin conditions over a large distance to provide [[knowledge exchange]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dermnetnz.org/ DermNet NZ: the dermatology resource]&lt;/ref&gt; to establish second-opinion services for experts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telederm.org/ The Community for Dermatology | Teledermatology]&lt;/ref&gt; or to use this for follow-up of individuals with chronic skin conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Ebner et al. 2006 e&amp;i&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.

===Dermatoepidemiology===

Dermatoepidemiology is the study of skin disease at the population level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barzilai|first1=DA|last2=Freiman|first2=A|last3=Dellavalle|first3=RP|last4=Weinstock|first4=MA|last5=Mostow|first5=EN|title=Dermatoepidemiology.|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|date=Apr 2005|volume=52|issue=4|pages=559–73; quiz 574–8|pmid=15793504|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2004.09.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; One aspect of dermatoepidemiology is the determination of the global burden of skin diseases &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-burden-skin-disease-2010-analysis-prevalence-and-impact-skin-conditions |title=The global burden of skin disease in 2010: an analysis of the prevalence and impact of skin conditions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1 November 2013 |website= IHME|publisher= |access-date=31 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global Burden of Disease|website=W.H.O. Global Burden of Disease/en/|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1990 to 2013, skin disease constituted approximately 2% of total global disease disability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IHME Data Visualization: Compare|url=http://www.healthdata.org/data-visualization/gbd-compare|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=CJ|title=Quantifying the burden of disease: the technical basis for disability-adjusted life years.|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=1994|volume=72|issue=3|pages=429–45|pmid=8062401|pmc=2486718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Therapies ==
[[File:Dermatology treatment.jpg|thumb|Facial cleansing pores in Meditec at ITESM CCM(2012)]]
Therapies provided by dermatologists include, but are not restricted to the following:
* Excision and treatment of [[skin cancer]]
* [[Cryosurgery]] – for the treatment of warts, skin cancers, and other dermatosis.
* Cosmetic filler injections
* [[Hair removal]] with [[laser]] or other modalities
* Hair [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]] – a cosmetic procedure practiced by many dermatologists.
* Intralesional treatment – with steroid or [[chemotherapy]].
* [[Laser therapy]] – for both the management of birth marks, skin disorders (like [[vitiligo]]), [[tattoo removal]], and cosmetic resurfacing and rejuvenation.
*Chemical peels for the treatment of [[acne]], [[melasma]], and sun damage
* [[Photodynamic therapy]] – for the treatment of [[skin cancer]] and precancerous growths.
* [[Phototherapy]] – including the use of narrowband UVB, broadband UVB, psoralen and UVB.
* [[Tattoo removal]] with laser.
* [[Tumescent technique|Tumescent liposuction]] – liposuction was invented by a [[gynecology|gynecologist]].  A dermatologist (Dr. [[Jeffrey A. Klein]]) adapted the procedure to local infusion of dilute anesthetic called tumescent liposuction.  This method is now widely practiced by dermatologists, plastic surgeons and gynecologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/lstartinventions/a/liposuction.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081107040140/http://inventors.about.com/od/lstartinventions/a/liposuction.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-11-07 |title=Liposuction - Who Invented Liposuction? |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Radiation therapy]] – although rarely practiced by dermatologists, many dermatologist continue to provide radiation therapy in their office.
* [[Vitiligo surgery]] – Including procedures like autologous melanocyte transplant, [[Suction blister|suction blister grafting]] and punch grafting.
* [[Allergy testing]] –  'Patch testing' for contact dermatitis.
* Systemic therapies – including antibiotics, immunomodulators, and novel injectable products.
* Topical therapies – dermatologists have the best understanding of the numerous products and compounds used topically in medicine.

Most dermatologic pharmacology can be categorized based on the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]], specifically the [[ATC code D]].

'''Digital addict''' is used to refer to a person who compulsively uses [[digital technology]], which would manifest as another form of [[addiction]] if that technology was not as easily accessible to them. Colloquially, it can be used to describe a person whose interaction with technology is verging on excessive, threatening to absorb their attention above all else and consequently having a negative impact on the well-being of the user.

The primary theory is digital technology users develop digital addiction by their habitual use and reward from computer applications.  This reward triggers the reward center in the brain that releases more dopamine, opiates, and neurochemicals, which over time can produce a stimulation tolerance or need to increase stimulation to achieve a “high” and prevent withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Hilarie|last2=Rae|first2=Cosette D|last3=Steel|first3=Ann H|last4=Winkler|first4=Alexander|date=2017-02-28|title=Internet Addiction: A Brief Summary of Research and Practice|journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews|volume=8|issue=4|pages=292–298|doi=10.2174/157340012803520513|issn=1573-4005|pmc=3480687|pmid=23125561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used as a conversational phrase, digital addict describes an increasingly common dependence on devices in the [[digital age]].

==Discourse==

Accessed: 06 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; digital addict is used as an overarching phrase to suggest an increasing trend of compulsive behaviour amongst users of technological devices, recognising that over-exposure to and over-use of technology can result in a dependence on digital devices, leading to behavioural symptoms similar to any addictive disorder, as the user neglects to maintain a healthy balance between using technology and socialising outside of it. 
 
The negative side-effects of overusing technology have in recent decades attracted increasing attention as a legitimate psychological disorder.  Unrestrained use of technological devices may impact upon developmental, social, mental and physical well-being and result in symptoms akin to other [[behavioural addiction]]. Several clinics worldwide now offer treatment for [[internet addiction disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10425194/Child-internet-addicts-sent-to-4500-a-week-addiction-clinics.html.

Accessed: 24 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  demonstrating the addictive qualities of technology as warranting further medical and academic research.

It is clear that, whilst still debated, the potential for internet or digital devices to have addictive qualities is an emerging concern.  In recent years particular attention has been paid to how the over-use of technology may be affecting the younger generation.  With an influx of technology designed for day-to-day use, many children are becoming increasingly reliant upon digital devices for education, social networking and entertainment.  With young people spending less time interacting with their peers face to face and more time indoors than previous generations, the direct impact of digital devices on both physical and mental well-being is becoming of concern.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, L. R., Green, G. T., &amp; Cordell, H. K. (2011). Children's Time Outdoors: Results and Implications of the National Kids Survey. Journal of Park &amp; Recreation Administration, 29(2), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The potential developmental side-effects of internet use are also recognised by the American Academy of Paediatrics in children under two years of age.&lt;ref&gt;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/10/12/peds.2011-1753.full.pdf+html.

Accessed: 24 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, South Korea's concern for the attachment its younger generation has to technology is even greater, with their parliament considering passing a law to curb obsessive game use within the country by classifying online gaming as a potentially anti-social addiction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/south-korea-considers-law-to-classify-online-gaming-as-a-potentially-antisocial-addiction-8998538.html.  Heather Saul.  South Korea considers law to classify online gaming as a potentially antisocial addiction.’ 11 December 2013.  Accessed: 23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether by academics, medics, journalists or users themselves, concerns are voiced worldwide about the potentially addictive qualities of technology, building a legitimate case for considering digital addict a valid social descriptor, aptly describing a collective trend in media habits.  Although the extent to which digital addiction can be considered of medical interest continues to be discussed, the recognition of technology overuse as a developing cultural and social issue remains important.

== Origins  ==

The phrase has been used informally amongst some internet users and bloggers, one of the earliest uses being in 2009 in an article by Rupinder Gill on the popular blog SparkLife.&lt;ref&gt;Rupinder Gill. [http://community.sparknotes.com/2009/08/10/signs-u-r-a-digital-addict Signs u r a Digital Addict]. SparkLife Blog. Aug 2009. Accessed: 11 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was then independently adopted and promoted by Stephen Dilworth MD Member Network UK for Foresters, the international financial services organisation. Foresters defined, developed and applied the term digital addict to substantiate use of the phrase within discussion on the potential danger in being over-exposed to technology. The term has been used in several published resources, first appearing in its commercial use between October – December 2013.

The phrase has been used significantly, and persuasively, as part of the Tech Timeout campaign&lt;ref&gt;http://techtimeout.com/&lt;/ref&gt; an international initiative encouraging families to consider how reliant they are upon the devices within their home by taking an hour out of their day to spend away from technology and instead spend that time as a family. The Tech Timeout campaign was devised to negotiate the growing issue of technology addiction and addresses the importance of moderating our use of digital technologies so as not to become dependent upon them. Digital addict is used within this context to hint at the growing obsession with digital devices, and although an informal descriptor, it is used from a position of concern for the growing dependence upon technology in wider society and within the home.

Born of the recognition that the acceptance of technology in the modern world has hidden the extent to which populations are becoming reliant upon, and over-attached to, digital devices 'digital addict' offers a collective term to recognise the increasing amount of time dedicated to using internet or digital devices in contemporary society.

The digital divide has led to the development of many phrases seeking to define trends in behavioural use of technology and patterns of behaviour, ranging from digital native to [[digital detox]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/digital-detox?q=digital+detoxes.  Oxford Dictionaries Online.  Accessed: 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; to [[digital omnivore]], all recognising the prevalence of technology in our lives.  Digital addict fits within this discourse and begins to consider the psychological effects of internet use and the impact this has upon mental, social and even physical well-being.

== Children using digital devices ==
Studies have shown that children’s technology use has greatly increased over the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cris-rowan/technology-children-negative-impact_b_3343245.html|title = The Impact of Technology on the Developing Child|date = 2013-05-29|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Subrahmanyam, Kaveri, et al. "The Impact of Home Computer use on Children's Activities and Development." ''The Future of Children'' 10.2 (2000): 123-44. ''ProQuest.'' Web. 21 Apr. 2016.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, children as young as one year of age are using technology, such as tablets, iPhones, and computers. Although these devices can be a good learning tool as it teaches children how to use these technologies, it can also harm them in various ways. Researchers have found that the use of these devices can cause or contribute to child obesity because children spend so much time on their devices. It is also common for these children suffer pain because they are looking at their screens for long period of time. Moreover, children in the future may experience having poorer muscle tone because of being hunched over while using the devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Don't put your kids at risk: Experts warn of dangers with children using technology|url = http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/554497/Toddlers-risk-dangers-technology|accessdate = 2015-06-17|first = Charlotte|last = Wace}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With increased time spent in front of the screen, children spend less time playing sports, exercising or participating in other activities, such as reading or engaging with other children. This is not only having a physical effect, but it also is affecting the children’s social development. Face-to-face interactions are highly crucial in a child’s development so that they can learn social and communication skills but increased technology time limits this and can impede learning. The time spent on screen can make young children suffer by affecting their learning abilities in a detrimental way. Children can learn and retain information better in person than from a screen between the ages of 12–18 months. A specific term called "video deficit" occurs when an infant learns better from a live presentation than from a video presentation. There has been multiple studies that showed children between the ages of 12–36 months who learn how to imitate and solve problems more adequately when they observe an in person demonstration versus when watching it from a video screen.&lt;ref&gt;http://ebookcentral.proquest.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/lib/umcp/reader.action?docID=4709397{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the technological age that children are growing up in, this is becoming an increasing problem due to its accessibility to children but taking away digital devices would also have a detrimental effect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ching-Ting, Hsin, Li Ming-Chaun, and Tsai Chin-Chung.

Although there are many significant sources claiming that the negatives outweigh the positives in children’s technology use, it should also be noted that effects of prosocial video game play have been correlated with a child’s ability to feel empathy making them more inclined to help others according to Greitmeyer &amp; Osswald in a 2010 study.&lt;ref&gt;[https://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/14PAGBS.pdf ''IA State Public Psychology'', The Positive and Negative Effects of Video Game Play, Retrieved February 21, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of technology by children can also contribute to the overall improvements of motor skills. By playing interactive games and knowing how to navigate through a screen using buttons, children are able to learn how to coordinate their brains with their fingers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthresearchfunding.org/11-pros-and-cons-of-children-using-technology/ "11 Pros and Cons of Children Using Technology" - HRFnd".

In [[heraldry]], the '''[[field (heraldry)|field]]''' (background) of a [[escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] can be '''divided''' into more than one area, or subdivision, of different [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]s, usually following the lines of one of the [[ordinary (heraldry)|ordinaries]] and carrying its name (e.g. a shield divided in the shape of a chevron is said to be parted "per chevron").  Shields may be divided this way for ''differencing'' (to avoid conflict with otherwise similar coats of arms) or for purposes of ''marshalling'' (combining two or more coats of arms into one), or simply for style.  The lines that divide a shield may not always be straight, and there is a system of terminology for describing patterned lines, which is also shared with the heraldic ordinaries. [[French heraldry]] takes a different approach in many cases from the one described in this article.{{TOC left}}{{clear}}

==Common divisions of the field==
{{stack|[[File:Divisions of the field.png|200px|right|Division of the field]]
[[File:ChausséShield.png|thumb|75px|Chaussé]]}}
Common partitions of the field are:
* ''parted'' (or ''party'') ''per fess'' (halved horizontally)
* ''party per pale'' (halved vertically)
* ''party per bend'' (diagonally from upper left to lower right)
* ''party per bend [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]]'' (diagonally from upper right to lower left)
* ''party per saltire'' (diagonally both ways)
* ''party per cross'' or ''quarterly'' (divided into four quarters)
* ''party per chevron'' (after the manner of a chevron)
* ''party per pall'' (divided into three parts in a '''Y''' shape)

(In the above "left" and "right" are from the viewer's perspective, whereas the heraldic terms "sinister" and "dexter" are from the perspective of the person carrying the shield.) Nowadays, however, the 'party' is often omitted, even in 'official' blazons, e.g. in letters patent and extracts of matriculation.

A field cannot be divided ''per [[bordure]]'' (as, if this did exist, it would be indistinguishable from the bordure), but a bordure can. A bordure can be divided or counter-changed.

Neither can a field (nor any [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]) be divided ''per chief'', for similar reasons; though both Canadian and Scottish Public Registers have official records of fields or bordures divided 'per chief'.  The earliest such record in the [[Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland|Scottish Public Register]] is before 1677, "parted per chief azure and gules three skenes argent hefted and pomelled Or Surmounted of as many Woolf-heads couped of the third."&lt;ref&gt;"Skene of Newtyle", ''Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland'', vol 1, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; and a bordure per chief is shown in the arms of [http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=18&amp;ProjectElementID=46 Roy, Canada]. A chief is considered a charge in English heraldry and is considered layered atop the field.

{{Anchor|tierced}}
Shields may also be divided into three parts: this is called ''tierced'', as in ''tierced per pale, azure, argent and gules'' (though perhaps in [[English heraldry]] this is rarely if ever done,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and the foregoing shield would be blazoned — as the pale is supposed to be one-third of the width of the field and is always so depicted under these circumstances — ''per pale azure and gules, a pale argent.''{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} but [[Scottish heraldry]] does use 'tierced in pale' (e.g. Clackmannan county (now [[Clackmannanshire]]) has ''Or; a saltire gules; a chief tierced in pale vert, argent, vert ...'')&lt;ref&gt;"County of Clackmannan", ''Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland'', vol 27, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  A particular type of tiercing, resembling a '''Y''' in shape (division lines per bend and bend sinister coming down from the chief, meeting at the fess point, and continuing down per pale), is called ''per pall'' (also ''per pairle''). The arms of Pope Benedict XVI is "tierced in mantle" - as described in Vatican information pages, but the usual term in, for example South African heraldry, is ''chapé ployé'' (with arched lines, with straight lines: ''chapé'' (mantled)), which may be blazoned with three tinctures or just two - e.g. Okakarara Technical Institute: ''Gules, chapé Azure, on the partition lines respectively a bend and a bend sinister enhanced, in base a demi-cogwheel, Or, with a fountain issuant.'' Shields may also be divided into three parts by a combination of two methods of division, such as ''party per fess, in chief per pale''.  Another example is in the arms of [[Clive Cheesman]]: ''per pale and per pall''.&lt;ref&gt;See image [http://whitelionsociety.org.uk/Slidesandblazon/Slide6.GIF here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416060925/http://whitelionsociety.org.uk/Slidesandblazon/Slide6.GIF |date=April 16, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is to be distinguished from the essentially unique partition in the arms of the [[2nd Weather Group]] of the [[United States Air Force]], which is ''[[Dexter and sinister|Dexter]] per chevron ployé and sinister per fess enhanced''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arms of 2d Weather Group, United States Air Force|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/AirForce/AirForceUnit.aspx?u=6060|accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaussé===
{{Anchor|chaussé}}
A shield may also be ''party per chevron reversed (inverted)'', which is like party per chevron except upside down. A section formed by two (straight) lines drawn from the corners of the chief to the point in base is called ''chaussé'' (shod), which must be distinguished from the ''pile'', the point of which does not reach the bottom of the shield. With arched or bent (French: ''{{lang|fr|ployé}}'') lines it is called ''chaussé ployé''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Marshalling==
[[File:POL powiat sieradzki COA.svg|thumb|left|100px|The dimidiated arms of [[Sieradz County]] in Poland]]
One common reason for dividing the field in heraldry is for purposes of combining two or more coats of arms to express alliance, inheritance, occupation of an office, etc. This practice, called ''marshalling'', initially took the form of [[dimidiation]], or splicing together two coats of arms split down the middle (or sometimes, though rarely, split across the centre ''per fess'' or quarterly) so that half one coat was matched up with the opposite half of the other. As this would sometimes yield confusing or misleading results, the practice was supplanted by [[Impalement (heraldry)|impalement]], which kept both coats intact and simply squished them into half the space. According to Fox-Davies (1909), the practice of ''dimidiation'' was short-lived and had already reached its peak in the early 14th century, while impalement remains in practice to modern times. One important remainder of the practice, however, is that when a coat of arms with a bordure is impaled with another coat, the bordure does not continue down the centre, but stops short where it meets the line of impalement.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), pp. 524-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[quartering (heraldry)|quartering]] gained usage, and in the height of its popularity during the [[Victorian era]], some coats of arms featured hundreds of "quarterings" (see the Grenville arms at right). More usually, however, a quartered coat of arms consisted of four parts, as the name suggests. The origin and underlying purpose of quartering is to express inheritance by female succession: when a female heir (who has no brothers, or whose brothers have all preceded her in death) dies, her son (only ''after'' her death) quarters her arms with those of his father, placing the father's arms in the first (upper left) and fourth (lower right) quarters and his mother's arms in the second (upper right) and third (lower left).&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stowe Armorial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The arms of [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Richard, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]], claimed 719 quarterings]]
In the UK heraldries, complex systems of marshalling have developed, and continue to thrive, around heraldic expressions of inheritance. In many cases of marriage, the shield is ''impaled'' with the husband's entire coat of arms placed on the dexter side and the wife's entire coat placed on the sinister side; if the wife is an [[Inheritance|heiress]], however, her arms are placed in escutcheon over her husband's (such usage is almost entirely English, Scots marshalling being impaling like any other marriage arms).&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies531"&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; If the husband is a knight of any order, however, the ensigns of that order belong only to him and are not shared with his wife. Two separate shields are then employed, the dexter shield bearing the husband's arms within the circle of his knighthood, and the sinister shield bearing the husband's arms impaled with the wife's usually encircled with a meaningless wreath of oak leaves for artistic balance.&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies531" /&gt; A male [[peerage|peer]] impales the arms of his wife as described above, but including the supporters, coronet and helmet of the peer; if he is also a knight of any order, the two-shield method is used.&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies532"&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt; If a female peer marries a commoner, however, the husband places her arms inescutcheon, surmounted by a coronet of her rank, over his own, but the supporters of her rank cannot be conferred to him; the wife bears her arms singly on a lozenge with the supporters and coronet of her rank.&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies532"/&gt; Volumes may be written on all the endless heraldic possibilities of this convoluted system of marshalling, but it may suffice here to say that for various purposes, arms may be marshalled by four basic methods: ''dimidiation'' by clipping and splicing two coats (usually per pale), ''impalement'' by dividing per pale and crowding an entire coat of arms into each half, ''quartering'' by dividing the shield into usually four (but potentially innumerable) "quarters", and ''superimposition'' by placing one coat of arms inescutcheon over another. It is also worth noting that one common form in German-Nordic heraldry is "quarterly with a heart" (a shield quartered with an inescutcheon overall). This may have stemmed from the continental practice of sovereigns placing their own hereditary arms inescutcheon over the arms of their dominions.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;

Divisions of the field, like the ordinaries, may follow complex line shapes. Most of these ''"sections"'' have developed conventional names in English, but modern artists, particularly in Finland, have developed new sections influenced by shapes found in the local flora.&lt;ref name="Neubecker89"&gt;Neubecker (1976), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the most common of these are engrailed, invected, indented, dancetty, wavy (also called undy), nebuly, embattled, raguly, dovetailed and potenty (pictured below).&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon of Dunakin (1968), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable modern forms include the "fir twig section" ({{lang-fi|havukoro}}) and "fir tree top section" ({{lang-fi|kuusikoro}}).&lt;ref&gt;Appleton, David B. (2002).

==Other modifications==

Besides the complex lines discussed above, divisions of the field may also be modified in other ways. Sometimes the division of the field may be ''fimbriated'' (lined) or, perhaps less properly, "edged"&lt;ref&gt;See an example of this, termed "edged", [http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/STB/STB4Brigade3InfantryDivision.htm here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503075821/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/STB/STB4Brigade3InfantryDivision.htm |date=May 3, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of another tincture, or ''divided by'' some ordinary or its diminutive.  The latter differs from a parted field that then bears the ordinary, in that if the ordinary thus dividing the field is between charges, the charges are not overlapped by the ordinary but the ordinary is between them. A famous example of this is the [[coat of arms of Sweden|greater arms of Sweden]], which is "quartered by a cross Or..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19820268.HTM |title=Lag (1982:268) om Sveriges riksvapen |work=Swedish Code of Statutes |publisher=Sveriges Riksdag |language=Swedish |date=1982-04-29 |accessdate=2009-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One division of the field (though it is sometimes described as a charge) is restricted to the chief: when the chief is divided by a bow-shaped line, this is called a ''chapournet'' or ''chaperonnet'' ("little hood").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/U_CHAPOURNET.HTM |title=Chapournet |work=Probert Encyclopaedia of Heraldry |accessdate=2009-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202010252/http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/U_CHAPOURNET.HTM |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Rompu'', meaning "broken", is often applied to a chevron, where the center is usually broken and ''enhanced'' (brought to a sharper point than normal).&lt;ref&gt;Neubecker (1976), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unusual forms==
* When the partition lines form four L-shapes, the field is blazoned ''quarterly en equerre'' (viz. "[[framing square]]", {{lang-de|Winkelmaßschnitt}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/shell/illustr.pl?051 |title=Illustration 51 |work=www.heraldica.org |author=François Velde |accessdate=2009-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of divisions are unique to German heraldry, including ''per bend... broken in the form of a linden leaf''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* The arms of the former [[Bophuthatswana|Republic of Bophuthatswana]] were "per fess (at nombril point)" (lower than the regular per fess division; the "nombril point" is halfway between the fess point — the exact middle of the field — and the base point, at the bottom centre of the field).
* The arms of the French department of [[Côtes-d'Armor]] show ''émanché'', which is shown in this case as equivalent to the English ''per fess dancetty of two full points upwards''.
* The arms of [[Mpumalanga|Mpumalanga Province]] in [[South Africa]] show ''per bend sinister, inclined in the flanks per fess''.
* The arms of the White Workers Union in South Africa are blazoned ''Per chevron inverted extended argent and gules, in chief a pile sable charged with two chevronels respectively Argent and Or.''

The '''''Encyclopedia of Mormonism''''' is a semiofficial [[encyclopedia]] for topics relevant to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church, see also "[[Mormon]]"). The text is available free online.

==Background==
Published in 1992, the ''Encyclopedia'' contains nearly 1500 [[essay|articles]], including several short unattributed entries in four volumes. The text is approximately one million words, and over 1,850 pages including pictures, maps, charts, index, and appendices. The title for the ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'' was chosen by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]], the secular publisher that initiated the project.

There were over 730 contributors from a wide variety of fields, most of whom had LDS and [[academic]] backgrounds. A large number were [[professors]] at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), the LDS Church-owned university. Most individuals contributed only one article, and few submitted more than three or four. Notable contributors include Mormon historians [[Leonard J. Arrington]] and [[Thomas G. Alexander]], former [[Salt Lake City]] [[list of mayors of Salt Lake City|mayor]] [[Ted Wilson (mayor)|Ted Wilson]], noted non-Mormon LDS historian [[Jan Shipps]], authors [[Stephen Covey|Steven R. Covey]], [[Gerald Lund|Gerald N. Lund]], and [[Richard Eyre (author)|Richard Eyre]], respected scholar and apologist [[Hugh Nibley]], and a few members of LDS hierarchy such as [[H. David Burton]] and [[Jeffery R. Holland]].

The editor of the ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', [[Daniel H. Ludlow]], states that he strove to make the volume as professional as possible. Most articles are written by [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] in their respective fields. LDS [[General Authority|general authorities]] (the spiritual leaders of the church) wrote little of the ''Encyclopedia''; indeed, most contributors from church hierarchy were only tapped to write articles on the publications or institutions they directly administered or led. For impartiality and perspective, several non-Mormons were asked to write important articles. For example, Shipps wrote on the outsider's interpretation of Mormonism, and [[Richard P. Howard]], a historian of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now the [[Community of Christ]]), wrote on his branch of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].

==Subjects addressed==
The ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'' includes lengthy articles on core LDS subjects like [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church history]] and [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|doctrine]], but the work also includes many topics that are less closely related to Mormonism. For example, articles on [[constitutional law]], [[sport]]s, [[science]], and [[freedom (political)|freedom]] discuss LDS perspectives and contributions to various fields.

Ludlow also sought to make the encyclopedia accessible to non-Mormons: an optional fifth volume was printed, containing the "[[Standard Works]]," LDS [[scripture]]s that are heavily cited in the encyclopedia.

==Role of encyclopedia relative to church==
Although the LDS Church cooperated in the production of the book, particularly by setting aside BYU resources, the ''Encyclopedia'' was meant to be independent and unofficial in the church. Ludlow highlights that in his concluding preface remarks:

:Lest the role of the ''Encyclopedia'' be given more weight than it deserves, the editors make it clear that those who have written and edited have only tried to explain their understanding of Church history, doctrines, and procedures; their statement and opinions remain their own. The ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'' is a joint product of Brigham Young University and Macmillan Publishing Company, and its contents do not necessarily represent the official position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. &amp;ndash; ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', p. lxii.

The LDS Church also noted the position in official publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= A Conversation about the Encyclopedia of Mormonism |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/12/news-of-the-church/a-conversation-about-the-encyclopedia-of-mormonism |date= December 1990 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of contents==
In addition to established scholars like Nibley, many other LDS scholars who were then less known also contributed, including [[John Gee]], [[William Hamblin]], [[Louis C. Midgley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Noel B. Reynolds]], [[Stephen D. Ricks]], [[John L. Sorenson]], [[Melvin J. Thorne]], and [[John W. Welch]].

Critics had mixed reviews. [[Sterling M. McMurrin]] said that "the articles on social issues and church structure and the biographies are the most useful" but also felt that "the work is a carefully sanitized partisan affair that, while having many strengths, is quite uneven in quality and, though it appears to face many difficult issues head on, clearly omits, distorts, and compromises wherever necessary to advance and protect a positive image of Mormons, Mormonism, and the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McMurrin|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; George D. Smith concluded his review of the ''Encyclopedia'' by saying, "As a 'religious encyclopedia' that addresses a goal of preserving a body of belief, the Encyclopedia of Mormonism impressively fulfills its mission. At the same time, the encyclopedia, like an iceberg, presents only a portion of important background and issues concerning the Book of Mormon. It is a brief for orthodoxy that lacks the scope and diversity necessary to qualify it as truly encyclopedic."&lt;ref name="Smith 1993"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction to ''[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]]'''s review of the ''Encyclopedia'' mentioned that [[Lavina Fielding Anderson]] "pointed out 'pitfalls in the treatment of women's issues, but revealed a few surprisingly positive moments that otherwise might have been overlooked-and probably were by some editors.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Editors |date= November 1993 |title= Evaluating the Encyclopedia of Mormonism: Introduction |journal= [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] |issue= 92 |page= 31 |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/092-31-53.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140815180113/https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/092-31-53.pdf |archivedate= 2014-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No article of so-called [[New Mormon history|Mormon historical revisionism]] is found in the ''Encyclopedia''. It has been noted that after the ''Encyclopedia''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; publication, several LDS scholars were excommunicated, including some members of the 1993 "[[September Six]]."&lt;ref name="September Six"&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.pbs.org/mormons/faqs/controversies.html |title= FAQs - Dissent/Excommunication/Controversies |work= [[The Mormons (documentary)|The Mormons]] |series= ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]''/''[[American Experience]]'' |publisher= [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]/[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |date= April 30, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160118204213/http://www.pbs.org/mormons/faqs/controversies.html |archivedate= 2016-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; George D. Smith criticized the ''Encyclopedia'' because it is not the promised comprehensive treatment of Book of Mormon scholarship: "it is a statement of LDS orthodoxy."&lt;ref name="Smith 1993"/&gt;

In [[prehistoric art]], '''finger flutings''' are lines that fingers leave on a soft surface. Considered a form of [[cave painting]], they occur in [[cave]]s throughout southern Australia, New Guinea, and southwestern Europe, and were presumably made over a considerable time span including some or all of the [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2006. The study of finger flutings. Cambridge Archaeological Journal 16:3, 281-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Most are not obvious figures or symbols but, rather, appear to many observers as enigmatic lines. They are also called '''tracés digitaux''' or '''finger tracings''' and (though these terms are also in part interpretative) '''meanders''', '''macaroni''', and '''serpentines'''. The term '''finger fluting''' was coined by [[Robert Bednarik]].

Generally they are made in a substance called [[moonmilk]]. Sometimes they are made through a thin clay film into moonmilk underneath or perhaps just into clay.

As [[Henri Breuil]] has published, finger flutings have been recognized since the early days of the 20th century in Europe as Paleolithic. Their recognition as having a similar antiquity outside of Europe lay chiefly in the hands of Sandor (Alexander) Gallus and then in Koonalda Cave in Australia. Many other sites both in Europe and Australia have been found, some of the more famous being Gargas&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2010. Fluted Animals in the Zone of Crevices, Gargas Cave, France. Proceedings of the Eleventh Congress of the International Federation of Rock Art Organizations, Lisbon, Portugal, 4–9 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and Baume Latronne caves in France and the [[cave of Altamira]] in Spain.

[[Image:RouffignacFlutings.jpg|frame|Flutings at the start of the 150 sq m Desbordes Panel, Chamber A1, Rouffignac Cave, France.]]

==Study methods==
Bednarik continues to publish sites that contain flutings, but current forward research into finger flutings is mainly being carried out by [[Kevin J. Sharpe]] and [[Leslie Van Gelder]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2006b. The study of finger flutings. Cambridge Archaeological Journal 16:3, 281-295.&lt;/ref&gt; They have developed the following methods for this purpose. Their cornerstones include multiple examinations of the flutings under investigation, experimentation, and the initial and primarily setting aside of questions of meaning (as such assumptions can determine what investigators then see in the flutings). The physical data in the flutings themselves comprise what they seek: how the fluters constructed their flutings, how the flutings functioned with respect to one other and, if possible, how the flutings functioned for the fluters. Sharpe and Van Gelder use a specific terminology for their studies and call upon three analyses.

===Terminology===

A ''fluter'' makes a fluting by sweeping their fingers across a soft surface; a ''unit'' comprises flutings drawn with one sweep of one hand or finger; the ''profile'' of a unit or a fluter comprises the silhouette of the finger tops left in the medium from the fluting; a ''cluster'' comprises an isolatable group of units that exhibit a unity, for instance because they overlay each other; and a ''panel'' comprises a collection of clusters that appears geographically or otherwise distant from other clusters or on a surface of reasonably uniform orientation.

===Internal analysis===

In terms of the field methodology, having become familiar with a cluster, an Internal Analysis of it is carried out, specially noting the directions of the flutings and their overlays. This provides the differentiation of clusters and units, and the temporal sequence of the flutings. The analysis relates to [[Alexander Marshack]]’s question, asked especially for engraved line markings: What do the order, direction of and (especially for engravings) the tools for creation of the lines tell about the mind of the artifact creator when creating? Though Marshack pioneered this technique, it has been modified in its application by others such as Bednarik, Francesco d’Errico, and Michel Lorblanchet. It forms the backbone of research into line markings such as flutings.

===Forensic analysis===

One of their additions to this methodological base, Sharpe and Van Gelder call a ‘Forensic Analysis.’ In this, they record where possible whether the left or right hand made the unit under examination, as indicated by the presence of marks that the first or fifth finger – written F1 or F5 – would make. These appear distinctively different from one another and from the marks of the other fingers. They measure the width of the F2-F4 set of marks at their narrowest, calling this the 3-fingered width of the unit. The width data for the three fingers suggest the age category of the fluter, namely whether a young child or older.
A Forensic Analysis also examines the profile of a 4- or 5-fingered unit, for frequently units start with the tops of fingers and the investigator needs at least four fingers to tell whether the hand is left or right. Then the investigator records the relative height of F2 to F4 against F3. This would suggest the [[gender]] of the fluter painter. Further, consistency of widths and profiles, and perhaps some other features among units suggest the same person painted them with the finger-fluting technique.

==Results of studies==

Sharpe and Van Gelder’s work has focused on flutings found in the French caves of Rouffignac, in the Dordogne, and Gargas in the Hautes Pyrenees. Using the above methods, they have shown:&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelder, L. and Sharpe, K. 2009.

* indications as to the fluter’s identity (in particular, distinguishing the flutings made by an individual fluter).

==Interpretations==

The lack of thorough studies, let alone methods for doing them, means speculation as to the meaning of flutings runs unchecked, even by the most well-known experts on prehistoric art. They are seen, for example, as representing such things as the first scribbles by humans, though intuitive and random but serpentines (Breuil); water related (Marshack); entopic shapes or phosphenes (Bednarik); huts, comets, or rivers, or linear-phallic and male symbols in the statistical placement of signs within a cave (Leroi-Gourhan); snakes (and thereby associated with death) (Barrière); psycho-neurological archetypes (Gallus); hunting marks (Barrière); shamanic ritual (Lewis-Williams). The corpus of Paleolithic flutings is too complex to fit into a single meaning paradigm. Too much in prehistoric ‘art’ does not conform to what modern people might see as figures and symbols, flutings offering an example. Investigators bring to their study and tie their methods to preconceived notions as to what is meaningful, what constitutes a pattern, and what they think is the origin of fluting making. No one now may ever know the meaning of the flutings and no one now should expect to know it.

That need not stop people responsibly offering meaning or intentionality hypotheses, Sharpe and Van Gelder state. But all such hypotheses must subject themselves to the data uncovered by investigations using methods such as those above.

Tracings of hands and finger flutings often show the dimensions of children.&lt;ref&gt;Bower, B. (2007). Children of Prehistory, ''Science News'' vol. 171, pp. 264-266. ([http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070428/bob8ref.asp references])&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''For the Girl Who Has Everything'''" is the thirteenth episode in the [[Supergirl (season 1)|first season]] of the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', which aired on February 8, 2016. The episode's teleplay was written by [[Ted Sullivan (filmmaker)|Ted Sullivan]] and Derek Simon, from a story by [[Andrew Kreisberg]], and directed by [[Dermott Downs]]. The episode is based on the Superman story "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]", which was written by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons for ''Superman Annual'' #11 in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/supergirl-recap-season-1-episode-13.html|title=Supergirl Recap: What Makes You a Hero|date=February 9, 2016|last=Rivera|first=Joshua|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Kara wakes up on Krypton under a medical assistant robot named [[Kelex]]. Her mother Alura returns and tells her she was experiencing the Argo fever. On Earth, a solar storm prevents Cat from reaching Kara. Winn, James and Alex find her body wrapped in the plant. At the DEO, an attempt to pull the plant off Kara winds up nearly killing her. The plant, known as the Black Mercy, was sent by Non. Astra is not happy, given the deal she made to leave Kara alone.

Kara realizes this Krypton is not real and wishes to go home, but she sees a statue she made for her father; her memories of Earth begin to fade. She sees Astra and starts blaming her and Non. Alex suggests Hank pose as Kara and he pulls it off, managing to get Cat to give "Kara" the day off while Alex attempts getting answers from the holographic Alura, to no avail. Astra offers Alex her assistance to save Kara. Alex recruits Maxwell to help send her into Kara's consciousness to convince her to reject the hallucination. Non confronts Astra about her disappearance, but Astra tells him that nothing could jeopardize their plans. Winn believes the solar storm is a part of the Kryptonians' plan to disrupt Earth's technology through satellites, prompting Hank to allow Winn access to the DEO computers to reboot them.

Alex tries pulling her out of virtual Krypton, only to be knocked out by Kara. James stops Hank from aborting the mission. Alex is sentenced to the Phantom Zone as she tries to reason with Kara. The virtual world starts to break up as Kara comes to her senses. She finally remembers her life on Earth and they are brought back to reality. The plant is removed and Kara seeks revenge on Non, who is planning to use Lord Technologies satellites to weaken and overwrite transmissions. Kara faces off against Non while Alex confronts Astra. Alex discovers the Kryptonians plan to eliminate humanity with a cure known as Myriad. Hank shows up to save Alex, who impales Astra with a kryptonite blade. Kara gets the better of Non and she sees a dying Astra, who apologizes to her. Hank takes responsibility for Astra's death, claiming her killed her, before the three of them leave as the Kryptonians arrive. Non is reminded that his wife did not die in vain as Myriad will be operational. Hank tells Alex she made the right call killing Astra, but Alex is upset over his lie. Kara explains to Alex, James and Winn that feeling lonely and lost made her envision Krypton, but she ultimately missed being on Earth with her family and friends.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
The episode attracted 542,000 viewers for its British premiere, making it the 10th most watched programme on [[Sky One]] for the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/weekly-top-10/|title=Weekly top 10 programmes|last=|first=|date=|website=www.barb.co.uk|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Cliff Wheatley of IGN gave the episode a 7.7/10: "“For the Girl Who Has Everything” isn’t quite the emotional gut-punch that its source material inspires, but it’s a solid episode on its own merits. Surprisingly, the bits dealing with the Black Mercy are the least interesting, but it does inspire a host of other choices that are some of the most compelling the show has offered to date. Plus, there’s some great comedic relief thanks to Cat Grant and J’onn trying (and failing) to impersonate Kara at work. "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/supergirl-for-the-girl-who-has-everything-review "SUPERGIRL: "For the Girl Who Has Everything" REVIEW"] from IGN (February 8, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Jensen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted: "When we left Kara last week, she was at a pretty low point. Pretty much all of her relationships (save the one with her sister) were in varying states of disarray Cat, the mentor she needs, wants to keep things strictly “professional.” Winn is barely talking to her, and things with James are just weird. With this baggage going into tonight, we came into “For the Girl Who Has Everything” ready for a poignant episode to set things right, and Supergirl definitely delivered.

Stacy Glanzman of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.8 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvfanatic.com/2016/02/supergirl-season-1-episode-13-review-for-the-girl-who-has-everyt/ "Supergirl Season 1 Episode 13 Review: For the Girl Who Has Everything"] from TV Fanatic (February 8, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Gonfalon of Justice''''' (Italian - ''Gonfalone della Giustizia'') is a tempera and oil on canvas painting by [[Perugino]], dating to around 1501 and now housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]] in Perugia.

It was commissioned as a [[gonfalon]] (banner for public processions) by the brothers of the Confraternity of Justice in Perugia. It dates to the artist's peak, just after the success of his cycle of paintings for the Sala delle Udienze del Collegio del Cambio, when he was working in both Florence and Perugia. It shows the Madonna and Child accompanied by angels and [[seraphim]], with [[Francis of Assisi]] (with the stigmata) and [[Bernardino of Siena]] kneeling below them. 

Between the two male saints is the [[Christogram#IHS|Christogram]] 'IHS' in the foreground and a view of Perugia in the background, with its female citizens kneeling to the right, the male citizens to the left and other kneeling figures in the white habits of the Confraternity. The composition draws on the painter's assemblage of drawings, with the Madonna and Child similar to those in his 1497 ''[[Fano Altarpiece]]'', the two symmetrical gilded angels to those in the ''[[San Francesco al Prato Resurrection]]'', ''[[Madonna in Glory with Saints]]'' and ''[[Madonna della Consolazione (Perugino)|Madonna della Consolazione]]'', all dating to around 1501 like the Gonfalon.

{{Demographics and Culture of Hong Kong}}
'''Hong Kong Cantonese''' ({{zh|t=香港粵語}}) is a dialect of the [[Cantonese language]] commonly spoken in [[Hong Kong]], as well as [[Macau]]. Although the [[Hong Kong people]] largely identify this variant of Chinese with the term "''Cantonese''" ({{lang|zh-hk|廣東話}}), a variety of publications in [[Mainland China]] describe the variant as ''Hong Kong speech'' ({{lang|zh-hk|香港話}}).

There are slight differences between the pronunciation used in Hong Kong Cantonese and that of the Cantonese spoken in the neighbouring Chinese province of [[Guangdong]], where [[Cantonese]] (based on the [[Guangzhou]] dialect) is a main ''[[lingua franca]]''.

Over the years, Hong Kong Cantonese has also absorbed foreign [[terminology]] and developed a large set of Hong Kong-specific terms. These differences from the Guangzhou dialect are the result of [[British Hong Kong|British rule]] between 1841 and 1997, as well as the closure of the Hong Kong-China border immediately after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

==History==
Before the [[Colonial Hong Kong|arrival of British settlers]] in 1842, the inhabitants of Hong Kong mainly spoke the [[Yue Chinese#Languages|Dongguan-Bao'an]] (Tungkun–Po'on) and Tanka dialects of Yue,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} as well as [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]. These languages and dialects are all remarkably different from Guangzhou Cantonese.

After the British acquired [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and the [[New Territories]] from the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] between 1841 (officially 1842) and 1898, large numbers {{Quantify|date=December 2008}} of merchants and workers came to Hong Kong from the city of [[Guangzhou|Canton]], the main center of Cantonese. Cantonese became the dominant spoken language in Hong Kong. The frequent migration between Hong Kong and mainland Cantonese-speaking areas did not cease up until 1949, when the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] took over [[Mainland China]]. During this period, the Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong was very similar to that in Canton.

In 1949, the year that the People's Republic of China was established, Hong Kong saw a large influx of refugees from different areas of mainland China. The [[Hong Kong Government]] closed the border {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} to halt the massive influx, but illegal immigration from Mainland China into Hong Kong continued. Because of this, the correspondence between language and ethnicity may generally be true though not absolute, as many Chinese who speak Hong Kong Cantonese may come from other areas of China, especially Shanghai or non-Cantonese regions of Guangdong where Hakka and Teochew prevail.

Movement, communication and relations between Hong Kong and mainland China became very limited, and consequently the evolution of Cantonese in Hong Kong diverged from that of Guangzhou. In Mainland China, the use of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as the language of official use and education was enforced. In Hong Kong, Cantonese is the [[medium of instruction]] in schools, along with [[English language|written English]] and written Chinese.

And because of the long exposure to English during the colonial period, large number of English words were loaned into Hong Kong Cantonese, e.g. "巴士" (/páːsǐː/), literally, "bus". Hong Kong people even started to [[calque]] English constructions, for example, "噉 (咁) 都唔 make sense" (literally, "it still does not make sense."). Therefore, the vocabularies of Cantonese in Mainland China and Hong Kong substantially differed.

Moreover, the pronunciation of Cantonese changed while the change either did not occur in mainland China or took place much slower. For example, merging of initial {{IPA|/n/}} into {{IPA|/l/}} and the deletion of {{IPA|/ŋ/}} were observed. Due to the limited communication between Hong Kong and mainland China, these changes only had a limited effect in mainland China at that time. As a result, the pronunciation of Cantonese between Hong Kong and mainland China varied, and so native speakers may note the difference when listening to Hong Kong Cantonese and mainland China Cantonese.

Hong Kong-based Cantonese can be found in Hong Kong popular culture such as [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong films]] and Hong Kong pop music ([[Cantopop]]). Hong Kong people who have emigrated to other countries have brought Hong Kong Cantonese to other parts of the world.

==Pronunciation==
In modern-day Hong Kong, many native speakers are unable to distinguish between certain phoneme pairs, causing them to merge one sound into another. Although this is often considered substandard and is frequently denounced as "lazy sound" ({{lang|zh-hk|懶音}}), the phenomenon is becoming more widespread and is influencing other Cantonese-speaking regions. Contrary to popular opinion, some of these changes are not recent. The loss of the velar nasal ({{IPA|/ŋ/}}) was documented by Williams (1856), and the substitution of the liquid nasal ({{IPA|/l/}}) for the nasal initial ({{IPA|/n/}}) was documented by Cowles (1914). &lt;!-- Shouldn't this citation say a bit more than just the surname and the year?--&gt;

List of observed shifts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Phonetic variations and sound changes in Hong Kong Cantonese: diachronic review, synchronic study and implications for speech sound assessment. | first = Carol K.

*Merging of {{IPA|/n/}} initial into {{IPA|/l/}} initial.
*Merging of {{IPA|/ŋ/}} initial into null initial.
*Merging of {{IPA|/kʷ/}} and {{IPA|/kʷʰ/}} initials into {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/kʰ/}} when followed by {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. Note that {{IPA|/ʷ/}} is the only [[semivowel|glide]] ({{lang|zh-hk|介音}}) in Cantonese.
*Merging of {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} codas into {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} codas respectively, eliminating contrast between these pairs of finals (except after {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}): {{IPA|/aːn/}}-{{IPA|/aːŋ/}}, {{IPA|/aːt/}}-{{IPA|/aːk/}}, {{IPA|/ɐn/}}-{{IPA|/ɐŋ/}}, {{IPA|/ɐt/}}-{{IPA|/ɐk/}}, {{IPA|/ɔːn/}}-{{IPA|/ɔːŋ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔːt/}}-{{IPA|/ɔːk/}}.
*Merging of the two syllabic nasals, {{IPA|/ŋ̩/}} into {{IPA|/m̩/}}, eliminating the contrast of sounds between {{lang|zh-hk|[[wiktionary:吳|吳]]}} (surname Ng) and {{lang|zh-hk|[[wiktionary:唔|唔]]}} (not).
*Merging of the rising tones (陰上 2nd and 陽上 5th).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Variation and merger of the rising tones in Hong Kong Cantonese | first = Robert S. | last = Bauer | first2 = Kwan-hin | last2 = Cheung | first3 = Pak-man | last3 = Cheung | journal = Language Variation and Change | year = 2003 | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–225 | doi =  10.1017/S0954394503152039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today in Hong Kong, people still make an effort to avoid these sound merges in serious broadcasts and in education. Older people often do not exhibit these shifts in their speech, but some do. With the sound changes, the name of Hong Kong's [[Hang Seng Bank]] ({{lang|zh-hk|香港恆生銀行}}), {{IPA|/hœ́ːŋ  kɔ̌ːŋ  hɐ̏ŋ  sɐ́ŋ  ŋɐ̏n hɔ̏ːŋ/}}, becomes {{IPA|/hœ́ːn kɔ̌ːn hɐ̏n sɐ́n  ɐ̏n hɔ̏ːn/}}, sounding like ''Hon' Kon' itchy body'' ({{lang|zh-hk|痕身}} {{IPA|/hɐ̏n sɐ́n/}}) '''un cold'' ({{lang|zh-hk|UN寒}} {{IPA|/ɐ̏n hɔ̏ːn/}}) . The name of Cantonese itself ({{lang|zh-hk|廣東話}}, "Guangdong speech") would be {{IPA|/kʷɔ̌ːŋ  tʊ́ŋ  wǎː/}} without the merger, whereas {{IPA|/kɔ̌ːŋ  tʊ́ŋ  wǎː/}} (sounding like "{{lang|zh-hk|講東話}}": "speak eastern speech") and {{IPA|/kɔ̌ːn tʊ́ŋ  wǎː/}} (sounding like "{{lang|zh-hk|趕東話}}" : "chase away eastern speech") are overwhelmingly popular.&lt;ref name="Reference 5514"&gt;[http://ohai.ca/post/14 Together Learn Cantonese], see middle section.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift affects the way some Hong Kong people speak other languages as well. This is especially evident in the pronunciation of certain English names: "Nicole" pronounce {{IPA|[lekˈkou̯]}}, "Nancy" pronounce {{IPA|[ˈlɛnsi]}} etc. A very common example of the mixing of ({{IPA|/n/}}) and ({{IPA|/l/}}) is that of the word {{lang|zh-hk|[[wiktionary:你|你]]}}, meaning "you". Even though the standard pronunciation should be ({{IPA|/nei/}}), the word is often pronounced ({{IPA|/lei/}}), which is the surname {{lang|zh-hk|[[wiktionary:李|李]]}}, or the word {{lang|zh-hk|[[wiktionary:理|理]]}}, meaning theory. The merger of ({{IPA|/n/}}) and ({{IPA|/l/}}) also affects the choice of characters when the Cantonese media [[Transliteration into Chinese characters|transliterates]] foreign names. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- Can someone explain what "choice of characters" means here?--&gt;

[[Prescription and description|Prescriptivists]] who [[Proper Cantonese pronunciation|try to correct these "lazy sounds"]] often end up introducing [[hypercorrection]]s. For instance, while attempting to ensure that people pronounce the initial {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, they may introduce it into words which have historically had a null-initial. One common example is that of the word {{lang|zh-hk|[[wiktionary:愛|愛]]}}, meaning "love". Even though the standard pronunciation would be {{IPA|/ɔ̄ːi/}}, but the word is often pronounced {{IPA|/ŋɔ̄ːi/}}.

In recent years, a number of Hong Kong secondary schools have tried to reverse this change by making the learning of [[Cantonese Pinyin]] part of the school Chinese curriculum.&lt;!-- At least, in 1999, normal sec. schools didn't teach this pinyin.--&gt;

==Unique phrases and expressions==
{{undue section|date=September 2016}}
Due to Hong Kong's unique historical background, Hong Kong Cantonese has evolved differently from the Mandarin spoken in China, Taiwan and Singapore over the years. Hong Kong Cantonese has developed a number of phrases and expressions that are unique to the context of Hong Kong. These phrases and expressions usually make references to specific things that can only be found in Hong Kong or specific incidents that happened in Hong Kong.
Here are a few examples:

|-

|  Who cares about your [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|1997]]?
|  Who cares?
|}
Here, the former refers to Hong Kong's status as a British colony, where prisoners are detained on behalf of the Sovereign, and is similar to the English colloquial expression "[[wikt:guest of Her Majesty|guest of Her Majesty]]" / "[[wiktionary:live_at_Her_Majesty's_pleasure|live at Her Majesty's pleasure]]". The latter refers to the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China in 1997. The situations alluded to are both unique to Hong Kong.

==Loanwords==
Life in Hong Kong is characterised by the blending of Asian (southern Chinese in particular) and Western cultures, as well as the city's position as a major international business centre. In turn, Hong Kong influences have also spread widely into other cultures. As a result, a large number of [[loanword]]s are created in Hong Kong and then exported to Mainland China, [[Taiwan]], Singapore, and Japan. Some of the loanwords have become even more popular than their Chinese counterparts, in Hong Kong as well as in their destination cultures.

==Code-switching and loanword adaptation==
{{Main|Code-switching in Hong Kong}}
Hong Kong Cantonese has a high number of foreign [[loanword]]s. Sometimes, the [[part of speech]] of the incorporated words are also changed, like "佢地好friend", translated into English as "they are very 'friend'", means "they are good friends". The word "friend" is changed from a [[noun]] into an [[adjective]]. In some examples, some new meanings of English words are even created. For example, "至yeah", literally "the most yeah", means "the trendiest". Originally, "yeah" means "yes/okay" in English, but it means "trendy" when being incorporated into Hong Kong Cantonese (see also "[[Austin Powers (character)|yeah baby]]" and "[[:wikt:aww yeah|aww yeah]]").

Semantic change is common in loanwords; when foreign words are borrowed into Cantonese, polysyllabic words and monosyllabic words tend to become disyllabic, and the second syllable is in the Upper Rising tone (the second tone). For example, "'''kon&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''"  ('''coins'''), "'''sek&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; kiu&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''" ('''secu'''rity) and "'''ka&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; si&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''" ('''cast'''). A few polysyllabic words become monosyllabic though, like "'''mon&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''" ('''mon'''itor), literally means [[computer monitor]]. And some new Cantonese [[Lexicon|lexical items]] are created according to the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Cantonese. For example, "'''laai&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''' 記" from the word "'''li'''brary". Most of the disyllabic words and some of the monosyllabic words are incorporated as their original pronunciation, with some minor changes according to the Cantonese [[phonotactics]].

Incorporating words from foreign languages into Cantonese is also acceptable by most Cantonese speakers. Hong Kong Cantonese speakers frequently code-mix although they can distinguish foreign words from Cantonese ones. For instance, "噉都唔 make sense", literally means "it doesn't make sense". After a Cantonese speaker decides to code-mix a foreign word in a Cantonese sentence, [[syntax|syntactical rules]] of Cantonese will be followed. For instance, "sure" (肯定) can be used like "你 su&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 唔 su&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; aa&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;?" (are you sure?) as if it were its Cantonese counterpart "你肯唔肯定?", using the A-not-A question construction.

In some circumstances, code-mixing is preferable because it can simplify sentences. For example, Instead of code-switching and using "check-in" in expressions like 你check咗in未？(nei5 cek1 zo2 in6 mei6 aa3, 'Have you checked in yet?'), people will have to use the pure Cantonese expression 辦理登機手續 (baan6 lei5 dang1 gei1 sau2 zuk6 'check in (on a plane)' ), which contains six syllables.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patrickchu.net/uploads/9/0/5/3/9053324/2007_free_ppt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Iraqi map pendant''', usually worn on women's [[necklace]]s, has achieved some popularity as a symbol of Iraqi unity in the face of the widespread [[Civil war in Iraq (2006-07)|ethnic and sectarian violence]] in the country.

==Origin==
Necklaces with map pendants were sold before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion]], but they were not especially common.  They have gained currency thereafter, and especially as a statement against the subsequent development of communal violence and increased social [[balkanization]].  

The necklaces have been prominently worn by a number of Iraqi women [[News broadcasting|television journalists]]. Many women have adopted the necklace in tribute to the life of journalist [[Atwar Bahjat]], who was murdered in 2006.

==Practices==
The pendant necklaces are commonly sold in [[silver]] and [[gold]], for the equivalent of about [[United States dollar|US$]]15 and $100 respectively.

Iraqi men have also worn map pendants as [[lapel pin]]s, and some have pinned them to [[military uniforms]].

'''Johan van der Meulen''' (11 January 1915, [[Breda]] - 13 September 2005, Breda), better known by his pseudonym '''John O'Mill''' (a jocular translation of his given name, as if [[O' (disambiguation)|O']] stands for "of the"), was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] author mostly known for his wordplay and [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s, and for using a [[macaronic language|macaronic]] combination of Dutch and English words and sentence structures he called "Double Dutch" (itself a pun on [[wikt:double Dutch|various meanings]] of this phrase). Double Dutch appears English, but it cannot be fully understood without knowledge of Dutch, because it is based on the literal translation of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] idioms into English and the similarity in sound of certain words and expressions. O'Mill, who was until 1975 a teacher of English at the public high school "Rijks-HBS" at [[Breda]] ([[Noord-Brabant]]), was inspired by the clumsy English used by his students.

==History==
{{main|Homosexuality in Japan}}
[[File:Japanesepederasty18thcentury.jpg|thumb|right|A [[wakashū]] (wearing headscarf) sneaks a kiss from a female prostitute behind his patron's back. [[Nishikawa Sukenobu]] (1671-1750)]]

Homosexuality and same-sex relations have been documented in Japan since ancient times.

In the pre-[[Meiji period]], ''nanshoku'' (男色) relationships inside Buddhist monasteries were typically [[Pederasty|pederastic]]. The older partner, or {{nihongo|''nenja''|念者||"lover" or "admirer"}}, would be a monk, priest or abbot, while the younger partner was assumed to be an {{nihongo|[[acolyte]]|稚児|chigo}}, who would be a prepubescent or adolescent boy.&lt;ref&gt;Childs, Margaret (1980). "Chigo Monogatari: Love Stories or Buddhist Sermons?". ''Monumenta Nipponica''. Sophia University. '''35''': 127–51. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2384336 10.2307/2384336].&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship would be dissolved once the boy reached adulthood (or left the monastery). Both parties were encouraged to treat the relationship seriously and conduct the affair honorably, and the ''nenja'' might be required to write a formal vow of fidelity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Pflugfelder, Gregory M. (1997). ''Cartographies of desire: male–male sexuality in Japanese discourse, 1600–1950''. University of California Press. p. 26, 39–42, 75, 70-71, 252, &lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]], some of the [[Shinto]] gods, especially [[Hachiman]], Myoshin, Shinmei and [[Tenjin (kami)|Tenjin]], "came to be seen as guardian deities of ''nanshoku''" (male–male love).

From religious circles, same-sex love spread to the warrior ([[samurai]]) class, where it was customary for a boy in the ''[[wakashū]]'' age category to undergo training in the martial arts by apprenticing to a more experienced adult man. The relationship was based on the typical ''nenja,'' who loves, and the typically younger ''chigo'', who is loved.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Furukawa, Makoto. The Changing Nature of Sexuality: The Three Codes Framing Homosexuality in Modern Japan. pp. 99, 100, 108, 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The man was permitted, if the boy agreed, to take the boy as his lover until he came of age.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Homosexuality in Japan#CITEREFLeupp1997|Leupp, Gary (1997).]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=a6q-PqPDAmIC ''Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan'']. University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-91919-8}}., p. 26, 32, 53, 69-78, 88, 90- 92, 95-97, 102, 132-135.&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships was expected to be exclusive, with both partners swearing to take no other (male) lovers.

As Japan progressed into the Meiji era, same-sex practices continued. However, there was a growing animosity towards these practices. The practice of ''nanshoku'' began to die out after the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Opposition to homosexuality did not become firmly established in Japan until the 19th and 20th centuries, through the Westernization efforts of the [[Empire of Japan]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Terminology==
Modern [[Japanese language|Japanese]] terms for LGBT people include {{nihongo3|literally "same-sex-love person"|同性愛者|dōseiaisha}}, {{nihongo3|"gay"|ゲイ|gei}}, {{nihongo3|"homosexual"|ホモセクシャル|homosekusharu}}, {{nihongo3|"lesbian"|レズビアン|rezubian}}, {{nihongo3|"bisexual"|バイセクシュアル|baisekushuaru}} and {{nihongo3|"transgender"|トランスジェンダー|toransujendā}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue3/mclelland2.html|title=Intersections: Male Homosexuality and Popular Culture in Modern Japan|website=intersections.anu.edu.au|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
{{See also|Age of consent in Asia}}

Homosexuality is legal in Japan. There are no explicit religious prohibitions against homosexuality in the traditional religion of Japan, Shintoism, or in the imported religions of Buddhism (see "[[Buddhism and sexual orientation]]") or [[Confucianism]]. 

[[Sodomy]] was first criminalized in Japan in 1872, in the early [[Meiji era]], to [[westernization|comply with]] the newly introduced beliefs of [[Western culture]] and the Qing legal codes. But this provision was repealed only seven years later by the Penal Code of 1880 in accordance with the [[French Penal Code of 1810|Napoleonic Penal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=6956959187889 |title=H-Net Reviews |publisher=H-net.org |date= |accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Japan has had no laws against homosexuality. Thus, sex among [[Ages of consent in Asia|consenting adults]], in private, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender, is legal under Japanese law.

The federal age of consent in Japan is 13 years old under the Japanese Criminal Law Code. However, all municipalities and prefectures have their own particular laws such as Tokyo's ''Youth Protection Law'' which prohibit sexual activity with youths who are under 18 years old in most circumstances. As an added note, even though the age of consent in Japan can be 13, the voting age is 18. The age of majority is 20 (a law to lower the age of majority to 18 is scheduled to take effect in 2022)&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and the driving age is 18. Japan's ''Prostitution Prevention Act'' (1958) only prohibits actual sexual intercourse (or sex controlled by organized crime). That law defines vaginal intercourse as "true" sexual conduct, so prostitution involving anal and oral sex is not prohibited directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.3yen.com/2005-07-27/is-the-age-of-consent-in-japan-really-13/ |title=Japan Legal FAQ – Is the age of consent in Japan really 13? |publisher=Legal.3yen.com |date=2005-07-27 |accessdate=2014-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025213840/http://legal.3yen.com/2005-07-27/is-the-age-of-consent-in-japan-really-13/ |archivedate=25 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/Asia_Pacific/supporting%20files/some_comments_on_the_legal_posit.htm |title=World Legal Survey |date=6 August 1998 |publisher=[[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|The International Lesbian and Gay Association]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050613082239/http://www.ilga.info/Information/Legal_survey/Asia_Pacific/supporting%20files/some_comments_on_the_legal_posit.htm |archivedate=13 June 2005 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
{{Main article|Recognition of same-sex unions in Japan}}
Article 24 of the Japanese Constitution states that "Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis."

As a result, articles 731 to 737 of the Japanese Civil Code limit marriage to different-sex couples. Same-sex couples are not able to marry, and same-sex couples are not granted rights derived from marriage. Also, [[same-sex marriage]]s performed abroad are not legally recognized in Japan and bi-national same-sex couples cannot obtain a visa for the foreign partner based on their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalrights.org/site/DocServer/Shadow_Report_Japan.pdf?docID=10043 |title=The Violations of the Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Persons in Japan |date=October 2008 |website=[[Global Rights]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230220003/http://www.globalrights.org/site/DocServer/Shadow_Report_Japan.pdf?docID=10043 |archivedate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Japan began allowing Japanese nationals to marry same-sex partners in countries where same-sex marriage is legal. The [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Justice Ministry]] instructed local authorities to issue key certificates, which state that a person is single and of legal age, to individuals seeking to enter same-sex marriages in areas that legally allow it. Though same-sex marriages are not legally recognized within Japan, allowing its citizens to marry same-sex partners overseas is seen as a first step toward the eventual legalization of such marriages in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fridae.asia/gay-news/2009/03/31/2249.japan-to-allow-its-citizens-same-sex-marriage-with-foreign-partners Japan to allow its citizens same-sex marriage - with foreign partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the district of [[Shibuya]] (in Tokyo) announced plans for a procedure of the recognition of same-sex couples for situations such as hospital visits and shared renting of apartments. This procedure allows couples to get a "proof of partnership" paper, which is not based in Japanese law, but can help in, for instance, getting access to a partner who is ill and in the hospital. The Shibuya initiative is considered a significant step towards lesbian and gay partnership rights in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/world/asia/tokyo-ward-plans-to-extend-rights-of-gay-couples.html|title=District in Tokyo Plans to Extend Rights of Gay Couples|first=Martin|last=Fackler|date=12 February 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, Tokyo's [[Setagaya]] ward announced that it would be joining Shibuya in recognizing same-sex partnerships from November of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/07/31/tokyos-setagaya-ward-to-begin-legally-recognizing-same-sex-partnerships/|title=Tokyo's Setagaya Ward to begin legally recognizing same-sex partnerships|date=30 July 2015|website=En.riocketnews24.com|accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the cities of [[Iga, Mie|Iga]], [[Takarazuka, Hyōgo|Takarazuka]], [[Naha]], [[Sapporo]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Osaka]] and [[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]] have begun issuing partnership certificates to same-sex couples.

==Discrimination protections==
[[File:LGBT flag map of Japan.svg|thumb|rights|LGBT flag map of Japan]]
As of 2018, sexual orientation is not protected by national civil rights laws, which means that LGBT Japanese have no legal recourse when they face such discrimination in such areas as employment, education, housing, health care and banking.&lt;ref&gt;"Gay scene: Tolerance, legal limbo". Jun Hongo. Japan Times. Tuesday, Dec. 23, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

However, cases of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation remain relatively uncommon in Japan. Similarly, the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], when being asked about their policy toward gays and lesbians following the U.S. debate during the Clinton presidency, answered that it was not an issue, and individuals within the forces indicated that as long as same-sex relations did not lead to fights or other trouble, there were few, if any, barriers to their inclusion in the armed services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/LGBT_Rights_in_Japan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110095918/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/LGBT_Rights_in_Japan.pdf |archivedate=10 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Constitution promises equal rights and is interpreted to prohibit discrimination on all grounds. However, homosexual and transgender persons can experience physical, sexual and psychological violence at the hands of their opposite-sex or same-sex partners, but receive no protection from the law. Same-sex partners are excluded from the ''Law for the Prevention of Spousal Violence and the Protection of Victims'' and generally lack safe places where they can seek help and support. Japan is a party to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which also comprehensively bans discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/02/01/japan-governor-should-retract-homophobic-comments |title=Japan: Governor Should Retract Homophobic Comments &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2011-02-01 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ''Equal Opportunity Law'' has been revised several times over the years to address sex discrimination and harassment in the workplace, the Government has refused to expand the law to address discrimination against gender or sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/Japan_LBT_May09_japan_cedaw44.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319154140/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/Japan_LBT_May09_japan_cedaw44.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the group OCCUR (Japan Association for the Lesbian and Gay Movement)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occur.or.jp/ |title=NPO法人アカー（OCCUR） |website=Occur.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; won a court case against a Tokyo government policy that barred gay and lesbian youth from using the "Metropolitan House for Youth". While the court ruling does not seem to have extended to other areas of government-sponsored discrimination, it is cited by the courts as a civil rights case, and the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] has since passed legislation banning discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref name="leadership"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outleadership.com/japan/|title=Japan - Out Leadership|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shibuya]] ward also bans sexual orientation discrimination in the provision of goods and services.&lt;ref name="leadership"/&gt;

Since autumn 2003, the Urban Renaissance Agency, the government agency that operates government housing (公団住宅), has allowed same-sex couples to rent units the same way as heterosexual couples at any one of the over 300 properties that it operates. This opened the way for more such action, as the Osaka Government in September 2005 opened the doors of its government housing to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcatplus.nii.ac.jp/webcatplus/details/book/6980828.html |title=Kampf um das soziale Ordnungsgefüge - Webcat Plus |language=ja |website=Webcatplus.nii.ac.jp |date= |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Yodogawa-ku, Osaka]] became the first Japanese government area to pass a resolution officiating support for LGBT inclusion, including mandating LGBT sensitivity training for ward staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://en.rocketnews24.com/2013/09/06/osaka-ward-first-governmental-body-in-japan-to-officially-declare-support-for-lgbt-community/|title = Osaka ward first governmental body in Japan to officially declare support for LGBT community|author = Preston Phro|publisher = RocketNews24|date = September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gladxx.jp/news/2013/3468/3469.html|title = 大阪市淀川区がLGBT支援宣言 (Yodogawa-ku passes LGBT support declaration)|publisher = GladXX|author = Nikkei|date = September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/osaka-district-becomes-first-japanese-government-area-support-lgbt-inclusion110913|title = Osaka district becomes first Japanese government area to support LGBT inclusion|publisher = Gay Star News|date = September 11, 2013|author = Andrew Potts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/yodogawa/page/0000232949.html|title = Yodogawa ward office LGBT support declaration|date = 1 September 2013|publisher = Yodogawa-ku Municipal website}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naha]] followed suit in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ryukyushimpo.jp/2015/07/28/19331/|title=Naha city makes LGBT City Support Declaration|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Education Ministry added sexual orientation and gender identity to its national bullying policy.&lt;ref name="leadership"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/24/japan-anti-bullying-policy-protect-lgbt-students|title=Japan: Anti-Bullying Policy to Protect LGBT Students|date=24 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy mandates that schools should prevent bullying of students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity by "promoting proper understanding of teachers on … sexual orientation/gender identity as well as making sure to inform on the school's necessary measures regarding this matter."

In October 2018, the [[Tokyo]] Metropolitan Government passed a law prohibiting all discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The law, scheduled to take effect in April 2019, also commits the Government to raise awareness of LGBT people and "conduct measures needed to make sure human rights values are rooted in all corners of the city". The law outlaws expressing [[Hate speech|hateful rhetoric]] in public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/10/05/tokyo-new-law-bars-lgbt-discrimination Tokyo: New Law Bars LGBT Discrimination].

''The Japan Times'', 5 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption and parenting==
Same-sex couples are not allowed to legally adopt in Japan. Lesbian couples and single women are unable to access IVF and [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/3/07/making-lgbt-families-possibility-japan|title=Making LGBT Families a Possibility in Japan|date=7 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, [[Osaka]] officially recognised a same-sex couple as foster parents, making it the first such case in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/04/06/national/social-issues/osaka-becomes-first-japanese-city-recognize-sex-couple-foster-parents/|title=Osaka the first city in Japan to certify gay couple as foster parents|date=6 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender identity and expression==
In 2002, a law was passed allowing transgender people who have gone through [[sex reassignment surgery]] to change their legal gender. However, [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] is required, among many other challenging criteria. The law went into effect in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mutantfrog.com/2008/08/11/what-the-diets-been-up-to-lately-revising-the-law-of-transgendered-people/ |title=What the Diet's been up to lately: revising the law of transgendered people |publisher=Mutantfrog.com |date=11 August 2008 |accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2012, the Hyogo Lawyers' Association pronounced a recommendation for a transgender woman in a male prison to be transferred to a female institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/news/20120224-OYT1T00961.htm?from=tw|title=Hygo|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this report, the transgender woman was placed in a male institution because of her legal status of sex, despite having undergone sex reassignment surgery prior to her detention, and had had her body checked by a male member of staff, her hair shaved and was refused any feminine treatment including female clothing.

Since April 2018, transgender people have been covered for sex reassignment surgery as long as they are not receiving hormone treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/14/national/social-issues/japans-social-security-net-transgender-people-improving-obstacles-loom-seniors/ Japan’s social security net for transgender people improving but obstacles loom for seniors]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has also allowed transgender people to use their preferred names on their health insurance cards.

In June 2018, the Japanese Government enacted a new law lowering the age of majority in Japan to 18. Among others, the new law sets the age of marriage at 18 for both men and women (previously women could marry at the age of 16) and allows 18-year-olds to obtain valid passports, credit cards, etc. The law also allows people diagnosed with [[gender dysphoria]] to legally change their sex at the age of 18.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44465196 Coming of age: Why adults in Japan are getting younger], ''PinkNews'', 13 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The changes are scheduled to take effect on 1 April 2022.

==Blood donation==
Gay and bisexual men are allowed to donate blood in Japan following a 6-month deferral period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jrc.or.jp/donation/about/refrain/detail_04/ |publisher=Japanese Red Cross Society |accessdate=2016-06-14|language=ja|title=エイズ、肝炎などのウイルス保有者、またはそれと疑われる方|quote=... 輸血を必要とする患者さんへの感染を防ぐため、過去6カ月間に下記に該当する方は、献血をご遠慮いただいています。... 男性どうしの性的接触があった。 (Translation: To prevent infecting patients requiring blood transfusion, those who match any of the following within the last six months should refrain from donating blood. ... Sexual contact between two males.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrities==
While representations of homosexuals in the Japanese media tend towards caricature on the basis of stereotypes of sexual or behavioral deviance (e.g. the actually straight [[Hard Gay]]), there are several examples of transgender persons with popular celebrity status in Japan such as [[Haruna Ai]], [[Kayo Satoh]], [[Matsuko Deluxe]], [[Ataru Nakamura]], [[Kaba-chan]] and [[Ikko (make-up artist)|Ikko]]. Support for LGBT rights has been expressed by corporate executives and Olympic athlete [[Dai Tamesue]].&lt;ref name="j-today"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snow|first1=Nancy|title=Japan’s race for the LGBT gold in Asia|url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/japan%E2%80%99s-race-for-the-lgbt-gold-in-asia|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=Japan Today|date=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political support==
[[File:TokyoRainbowPrideParade-maingate-side-sunny-may8-2016.jpg|thumb|right|Tokyo Rainbow Pride in 2016]]
LGBT rights are rarely discussed or debated publicly, and most political parties do not make any formal position, in favor of or in opposition, to LGBT rights in their party's platform or manifesto. However, some parties have responded to enquiries concerning [[same-sex marriage]] policy: the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] has indicated opposition to legalizing it, and the [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan|Constitutional Democratic Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]] have indicated support for legalization, while the [[Japanese Communist Party|Communist Party]] has indicated support for legalizing same-sex [[civil unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Inada |first=Miho |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/09/20/same-sex-marriage-in-japan-a-long-way-away/ |title=Same-Sex Marriage in Japan: A Long Way Away? - Japan Real Time - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2001, the Council for Human Rights Promotion, under the Ministry of Justice, recommended that [[sexual orientation]] be included in the nation's civil rights code, but the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] refused to adopt the recommendation.

In 2003, [[Aya Kamikawa]] became the first openly [[transgender]] politician to be elected to public office in Japan, the Setagaya Ward Assembly. She initially ran as an Independent but expressed support for the now defunct [[Rainbow and Greens]] Party of Japan and later unsuccessfully ran for the National Parliament as a member of the [[Democratic Party of Japan]].

In 2005, [[Kanako Otsuji]], from the [[Osaka Prefectural Assembly]], became the first homosexual politician to formally come out at the Tokyo Gay Pride Festival.

In 2011, [[Taiga Ishikawa]] became the first openly gay candidate elected to office in Japan, specifically as the representative for the local assembly of [[Toshima]] Ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyomango.com/tokyo_mango/2011/05/taiga-ishikawa-is-japans-first-openly-gay-elected-official.html |title=Taiga Ishikawa is Japan's first openly gay elected official |publisher=Tokyomango.com |date=2011-05-09 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came out publicly in his book "Where Is My Boyfriend" (2002), and started a non-profit organization that sponsors social events for gay men in Japan.

At the [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 2016|2016 House of Councillors election]], the conservative governing [[Liberal Democratic Party]] included "promoting understanding of sexual diversity" in its platform, a move that would have been "unthinkable" in earlier times and that lawmaker [[Gaku Hashimoto]] attributed in part to burnishing the country's international image in advance of the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="scmp-2016" /&gt;

In March 2017, [[Tomoya Hosoda]] was elected to the [[Iruma, Saitama|Iruma]] Assembly, in the prefecture of [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]]. Hosoda is believed to be the first openly transgender man elected to public office in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-first-world-transgender-man-public-office-councillor-iruma-saitama-kanto-a7636641.html|title=Japan becomes first country in the world to elect transgender man to a public office|date=18 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the country's [[Japanese general election, 2017|2017 general election]], Governor of Tokyo [[Yuriko Koike]]'s newly launched [[Kibō no Tō|Party of Hope]] pledged the elimination of LGBT discrimination in its manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Isabel|last2=Nobuhiro|first2=Emi|title=Japan’s Opposition Unveils ‘Yurinomics’ Platform to Challenge Abe|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-06/japan-s-koike-says-she-may-tax-cash-reserves-of-large-companies|accessdate=6 October 2017|work=Bloomberg|date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[arts]], '''maximalism''', a reaction against [[minimalism]], is an esthetic of excess and redundancy. The philosophy can be summarized as "more is more", contrasting with the minimalist motto "less is more"&lt;ref&gt;http://mofa.cvatd.fsu.edu/resources/archive/pages/learning/resources/moreismore.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The term "maximalism" is sometimes associated with [[Postmodern literature|post-modern novels]], such as those by [[David Foster Wallace]] and [[Thomas Pynchon]], where digression, reference, and elaboration of detail occupy a great fraction of the text. It can refer to anything seen as excessive, overtly complex and "showy", providing redundant overkill in features and attachments, grossness in quantity and quality, or the tendency to add and accumulate to excess.

Novelist [[John Barth]] defines literary maximalism through the medieval Roman Catholic Church's opposition between "two...roads to grace:"
:the ''via negativa'' of the monkʹs cell and the hermitʹs cave, and the ''via affirmativa'' of immersion in human affairs, of being in the world whether or not one is of it. [[Critic]]s have aptly borrowed those terms to characterize the difference between Mr. [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]], for example, and his erstwhile master [[James Joyce]], himself a maximalist except in his early works.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, John. “A Few Words About Minimalism”, ''New York Times Book Review'', p.1. Dec.
28, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takayoshi Ishiwari elaborates on Barth's definition by including a [[postmodern]] approach to the notion [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]. Thus:
:Under this label come such writers as, among others, Thomas Pynchon and Barth himself, whose bulky books are in marked contrast with [[Donald Barthelme|Barthelmeʹs]] relatively thin novels and collections of short stories. These maximalists are called by such an epithet because they, situated in the age of [[epistemology|epistemological]] uncertainty and therefore knowing that they can never know what is authentic and inauthentic, attempt to include in their fiction everything belonging to that age, to take these authentic and inauthentic things as they are with all their uncertainty and inauthenticity included; their work intends to contain the maximum of the age, in other words, to be the age itself, and because of this their novels are often encyclopedic. As Tom LeClair argues in ''The Art of Excess'', the authors of these ʺ[[masterpiece|masterwork]]sʺ even ʺgather, represent, and reform the timeʹs excesses into fictions that exceed the timeʹs literary conventions and thereby master the time, the methods of fiction, and the readerʺ.&lt;ref&gt;Ishiwari, Takayoshi. ʺThe Body That Speaks: Donald Barthelmeʹs ''The Dead Father as Installation''ʺ, Unpublished Masterʹs thesis, p.1. Osaka University, 1996. [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~KP7T-ISWR/ link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606215128/http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~KP7T-ISWR/ |date=2011-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
In music, [[Richard Taruskin]] uses the term "maximalism" to describe the [[Modernism (music)|modernism]] of the period from 1890 to 1914, especially in German-speaking regions, defining it as "a radical intensification of means toward accepted or traditional ends".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Taruskin, Music in the Early Twentieth Century. Oxford History of Western Music 4 (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), p.&amp;nbsp;5.. {{ISBN|978-0-19-522273-9}} {{ISBN|978-0-19-516979-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged, however, on the grounds that Taruskin uses the term merely as an "empty signifier" that is filled with "a range of musical features—big orchestration, motivic and harmonic complexity, and so on—that he takes to be typical of modernism".&lt;ref&gt;J. P. E. Harper-Scott, ''The Quilting Points of Musical Modernism: Revolution, Reaction, and William Walton''. Music in Context (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012), p.&amp;nbsp;22. {{ISBN|9780521765213}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taruskin, in any case, did not originate this sense of the term, which had been used by the mid-1960s with reference to Russian composers of the same period, of whom [[Sergei Prokofiev]] was "the last".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cooper, ''Ideas and Music'' (London: Barrie &amp; Rockliffe, 1965): 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary maximalist music is defined by composer [[David A. Jaffe]] as that which "embraces heterogeneity and allows for complex systems of juxtapositions and collisions, in which all outside influences are viewed as potential raw material".&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, David. “Orchestrating the Chimera—Musical Hybrids, Technology, and the Development of a 'Maximalist' Musical Style”, ''Leonardo Music Journal''. Vol. 5, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the music of [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Charles Ives]], and [[Frank Zappa]].&lt;ref&gt;Delville, Michel and Norris, Andrew. "Disciplined Excess: The Minimalist / Maximalist Interface in Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart", ''Interval(le)s'', p.4. Vol. I, 1 (Automne 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In a different sense, [[Milton Babbitt]] has been described as a "professed maximalist", his goal being, "to make music as much as it can be rather than as little as one can get away with".&lt;ref&gt;Milton Babbitt, ''Words about Music'', edited by Stephen Dembski and Joseph N. Straus (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987), p.&amp;nbsp;183. Cited on p.&amp;nbsp;147 of Richard Kurth, (1994).

A similar statement from five years earlier is found in ''Contemporary Music 1982 Catalogue'' (New York: C. F. Peters Corporation, 1982), 10: "the goal of attempting to make music as much as it might be, rather than as little as one obviously can get away with music's being", cited by Joseph Dubiel, "Three Essays on Milton Babbitt (Part Two)", ''Perspectives of New Music'' 29, no. 1 (Winter 1991): 90–122, citation on pp.&amp;nbsp;94 &amp; 119n13.

==Visual arts==
Maximalism as a term in the [[plastic arts]] is used by art historian [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] to describe a group of artists, including [[Julian Schnabel]] and [[David Salle]], associated with the turbulent beginnings of [[Neo-expressionism]] in the late 1970s. These artist were in part "stimulated out of sheer despair with so long a diet of [[Minimalism|Reductivist Minimalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pincus-Witten, "Gary Stephan: The Brief Against Matisse", In ''Talking Painting: Dialogues with Twelve Contemporary Abstract Painters'', edited by David Ryan, 208–20.

Charlotte Rivers describes how "maximalism celebrates richness and excess in graphic design", characterized by decoration, sensuality, luxury and fantasy, citing examples from the work of illustrator [[Kam Tang]] and artist [[Julie Verhoeven]].&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, Charlotte (2008). ''Maximalism: The Graphic Design of Decadence&amp; Excess'', p.011. {{ISBN|2-88893-019-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian [[Gao Minglu]] connects maximalism in Chinese visual art to the literary definition by describing the emphasis on "the spiritual experience of the artist in the process of creation as a self-contemplation outside and beyond the artwork itself...These artists pay more attention to the process of creation and the uncertainty of meaning and instability in a work. Meaning is not reflected directly in a work because they believe that what is in the artist's mind at the moment of creation may not necessarily appear in his work." Examples include the work of artists, [[Cao Kai]], [[Ding Yi (artist)|Ding Yi]], [[Gu Dexin]] and [[Li Huasheng]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristin E.M. Riemer (October 9, 2003).

'''''Mega Man X5''''', known as {{nihongo|'''''Rockman X5'''''|ロックマンX5}} in Japan, is a [[video game]] developed by [[Capcom]]. It is the fifth main installment in the ''[[Mega Man X]]'' series. It was first released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] for Japan in 2000 and in North America and [[PAL region|PAL territories]] the following year.

''Mega Man X5'' is set in the 22nd century in a world where humans coexist with humanoid [[android (robot)|androids]] called "Reploids". Daily life is under a constant threat of these Reploids going "Maverick" and participating in dangerous and deadly crime. After the events of ''[[Mega Man X4]]'', the Maverick leader [[List of Mega Man X characters#Sigma|Sigma]] has been revived and seeks to unlock the true power of the former Maverick [[Zero (Mega Man)|Zero]] and destroy the hero [[List of Mega Man X characters#Mega Man X|X]] in the process. To make matters worse, Sigma has set the space colony Eurasia on a 16-hour collision course with Earth. It is up to X and Zero to stop Sigma once again and save the planet from destruction. Like its predecessors, ''Mega Man X5'' is an [[action game|action]]-[[platform game]] in which the player controls either protagonist through a series of eight, selectable stages and wins the special weapon of each stage's boss. However, the game only offers limited number of stage attempts before the player must deal with the colony.

According to Capcom producer [[Keiji Inafune]], ''Mega Man X5'' was originally intended to be the final game in the ''Mega Man X'' saga. Critical reception for the game was lukewarm, with many reviewers agreeing that the stale gameplay formula will only further satisfy diehard fans of the series. ''Mega Man X5'' was [[porting|ported]] to the [[Microsoft Windows]] as retail packages in 2002 in both Japan and North America. It was also re-released in 2006 as part of the ''[[Mega Man X Collection]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] and [[PlayStation 2]]. ''Mega Man X5'' was made available on the [[PlayStation Network]] as part of the PSOne Classics line for North America and Japan in 2014. It became available for Windows via [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] as a part of ''Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2'' (''Rockman X Anniversary Collection 2'' in Japan) on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-04-10/mega-man-x-legacy-collections-ship-for-ps4-switch-xbox-one-pc-in-japan-on-july-26/.130187  Mega Man X Legacy Collections Ship for PS4, Switch, Xbox One, PC in Japan on July 26]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capcom-unity.com/mega_man/blog/2018/04/10/mega-man-x-legacy-collection-1-and-2-launch-july-24th?ts=1523427260  Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2 launch July 24th] -Capcom Unity&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Mega Man X characters}}
Like other entries in the series, ''Mega Man X5'' takes place in "21XX", an unspecified year in the 22nd century, where humans have adapted to life with intelligent [[android (robot)|android]] dubbed "Reploids". Months have passed since the events of Mega Man X4. The series' primary antagonist, a "Maverick" Reploid named [[List of Mega Man X characters#Sigma|Sigma]] has been revived once again. Sigma begins conducting research on the origin and design of the "Maverick Hunter" [[Zero (Mega Man)|Zero]] and decides to discover how to unlock Zero's true power, hoping to destroy Sigma's nemesis [[List of Mega Man X characters#Mega Man X|Mega Man X]] in addition. Sigma attacks the Maverick Hunters directly, intending to lose. When he does, he spreads a Maverick [[computer virus|virus]] across the Earth, throwing it into chaos. Meanwhile, a Reploid [[mercenary]] named Dynamo is hired by Sigma to make the space colony Eurasia collide with Earth. The Hunters have only 16 hours to stop the collision. In order to prevent Eurasia from striking the planet, the Hunters pursue two options. The first option is to fire a powerful cannon called "Enigma" at Eurasia, vaporizing it. If the Enigma shot fails, the second option is to launch a space shuttle and pilot it into the colony, destroying it. To maximize their chances, X and Zero are dispatched to collect parts for the two devices with the aid of their new teammates [[List of Mega Man X characters#Alia|Alia]], [[List of Mega Man X characters#Douglas|Douglas]], and [[List of Mega Man X characters#Signas|Signas]]. The necessary parts to upgrade the Enigma and shuttle are held by eight Mavericks, and X and Zero must defeat them to claim the parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Mega Man X5|developer=Capcom|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=January 2001|platform=Sony PlayStation|quote='''Alia:''' We have no choice... For the sake of the world, we must destroy the Colony! ... But the only weapon we have in the Hunter Base that still works is... ... The Enigma... And it's very old. We also have a space shuttle. But, it's been affected by the Virus, and the Auto-Pilot function doesn't work... So we need someone to fly it to the Colony and let it collide... It's almost certain death, but we have no other choice. / '''Signas:''' How's the condition of the Enigma? / '''Douglas:''' Far from perfect... In order to use the Enigma, we need to build it up with some devices. The Enigma doesn't work as is. / '''Signas:''' Under the influence of the Sigma Virus, a lot of Maverick Hunters have become Mavericks, and only a few hunters remain normal. Let's join forces with the rest of our brothers and complete the Enigma! }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Enigma and shuttle succeed or fail is randomly determined by the game, although the Enigma's chances of working successfully are low even with all its parts, while the shuttle has a much higher probability of succeeding assuming all of the parts are collected. Whether the Enigma succeeds or fails, a new virus appears on the Earth, noted by Alia as the Sigma virus combining with the scraps from the colony. If the Enigma or the shuttle succeeds, X and Zero proceed to hunt for the cause of the virus. If the shuttle fails or if the time expires, the colony crashes, nearly destroying the planet; Zero then is infected by the virus. In either case, once the location of the virus' origin is discovered, the Hunters investigate. X and Zero penetrate a bizarre underground fortress. In the fortress, X and Zero cross paths, where mutual suspicion and mistrust leads to a duel between the heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Mega Man X5|developer=Capcom|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=January 2001|platform=Sony PlayStation|quote='''X:''' Why weren't you damaged even though you have been infected by the virus? In fact, you have become more powerful with the infection?! Why?! This isn't the time to fight when we have a mission to accomplish, but... I'll bring you back by any means. / '''Zero:''' You say you'll bring me back to the base even if you have to fight me? X, you can't dare to fight me. Your big heart. That is your kindness and your weakness. I'm okay...Trust me. / '''X:''' Zero... I don't want to lose you... I'm really worried about you...... and I do trust you...That's why I have to fight you here to bring you back. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the duel, the story diverges slightly. If Zero goes Maverick as a result of the virus, he sacrifices himself to save X from Sigma, and X continues on alone to defeat Sigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Mega Man X5|developer=Capcom|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=January 2001|platform=Sony PlayStation|quote='''Sigma:''' You'd almost fully evolved to your true self... It's a shame you didn't quite make it, Zero. You had so much potential. Oh well, farewell! Well...it's only you now, X... I will let you live this time. But I won't be so kind next time, and there WILL be a next time! See you soon! You... The strongest Reploid! Bwah ha ha!}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Zero does not go Maverick, he saves X and himself from Sigma, and both have a chance to confront Sigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Mega Man X5|developer='''Sigma:''' Blast! I haven't completed you... I will retreat for now... Somehow I know you two will come again. I'll be waiting for you, ha ha ha... / '''Zero:''' Wait! Sigmaaaa! ...I WILL defeat you ... without fail!! }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mega Man X5'' has three possible endings. If Zero goes Maverick, X defeats Sigma, but is badly damaged. A mysterious figure recovers him, but also deletes all his memories of Zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Mega Man X5|developer=Capcom|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=January 2001|platform=Sony PlayStation|quote='''Hunter B:''' ...You see? Captain Zero and Captain X are both special A level Hunters for all to see. You worked together and solved a lot of problems. / '''X:''' I remember Sigma. His name doesn't leave me... But I don't have any memory of Zero. Maybe whoever repaired me deleted the data by mistake. }}&lt;/ref&gt; If Zero does not go Maverick, Sigma decides to make the Hunters' victory for naught by taking them down with him. X tries to save Zero but is ambushed by Sigma and both Hunters are critically damaged. Zero manages to finish Sigma off, then the endings diverge again depending on the player character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Mega Man X5|developer=Capcom|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=January 2001|platform=Sony PlayStation|quote='''Sigma:''' Gha ha ha ha ha! X seems to be somewhere close... The three of us can die together... You won't feel lonely if X is with you... / '''Zero:''' No! Leave X out of this! / '''Sigma:''' Time to go! Say goodbye, Zero! Ghaa ha ha ha ha ha!!  }}&lt;/ref&gt; If Zero defeats Sigma, he reflects on his origin and life before dying. If X defeats Sigma, he inherits Zero's beam saber weapon and continues to fight as a Maverick Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Mega Man X5|developer=Capcom|publisher=[[Capcom]]|date=January 2001|platform=Sony PlayStation|quote='''X''': I can face any enemy now... I will feel this way... as long as I have this Saber... I'll do it today, Zero... with you...! Forever...We'll be together...Zero... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The main gameplay remains similar to previous installments. Unlike ''X4'', the player can freely switch between both the shooter X and the swordsman Zero while playing through the game.&lt;ref name="gspotrev"/&gt; Depending on which character the player uses to start it, the other one will be affected negatively with X losing his ''X4'' armor and Zero losing his buster. There are four armors for X—his Ultimate Armor, the upgraded armor from ''Mega Man X4'', and two others that must be assembled from capsules. However, X cannot wear parts of these armors separately. X can also no longer shoot his buster through walls, and each character has the ability to duck. Zero is able to find and enter Dr. Light's capsules, however, he cannot use the armor parts given, instead retaining the part to bring to X. However, if Zero reaches the capsule that contains X's Ultimate Armor, Dr. Light will offer the "Black Zero" Armor instead of the Ultimate Armor that enhances his abilities. Besides regular enemies and bosses, X and Zero can be chased by a phantom virus that will try to infect the characters. If X is sufficiently infected by enough viruses, he will enter a state where his health rapidly declines. However, if Zero is sufficiently infected, he becomes briefly invincible, with increased attack power. At any point between levels, the player has the option of firing the Enigma at the Eurasia.&lt;ref name="gamerev"/&gt; If the Enigma misses, then the player has the option of launching the shuttle. Whether the crash is prevented or not is determined by random chance. If the crash is not prevented, the course of the story is changed. Due to the nature of the storyline, there are multiple endings. Whether X or Zero is used to defeat the last boss also affects which ending is seen.

==Development==
''Mega Man X5'' was originally meant to be the last game of the ''Mega Man X'' series. As stated by producer [[Keiji Inafune]], "I had very little to do with ''X5''. I just told the team to 'finish off the series with this title,' and left it at that. That's why the game itself has a real feel of finality to it."&lt;ref name="r20"/&gt; However, Capcom decided to publish ''[[Mega Man X6]]'' the following year, in which Zero survived his fight from ''X5'', much to the dismay of Inafune.&lt;ref name="bestdamn"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Hoffman, Chris |title=The Best Damn Mega Man Feature. Period |magazine=[[Play (US magazine)|Play]] |volume=3 |issue= 4 |date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haruki Suetsugu, an artist for ''Mega Man X4'', designed nearly all of the characters and promotional artwork for ''Mega Man X5''. Suetsugu added various details to set the characters apart from one another.&lt;ref name="r20"/&gt; X's new Falcon Armor was designed by Ryuji Higurashi, who wanted it to resemble a bird with beak-shaped chest piece, wings coming out of the back, and a talon-like arm cannon. Suetsugu designed the Gaea Armor, which was meant to resemble Sanagiman from the ''[[Inazuman]]'' [[manga]] series.&lt;ref name="r20"/&gt; The Maverick bosses in the English localization of ''Mega Man X5'' are named after members of the American [[hard rock]] band [[Guns N' Roses]].&lt;ref name="r20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] | publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] | title=Mega Man 20/20 | date=January 2008 | issue=224 | page=63 | author=Hoffman, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capcom voice actress [[Alyson Court]], who was involved in the game's localization, came up with the new names as a tribute to her then-husband's love of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Goulter, Tom | date=May 2, 2011 | title=Guns 'n' Roses/Mega Man X5 mystery solved by...

The [[Video game music|musical score]] for ''Mega Man X5'' was composed by Naoto Tanaka, Naoya Kamisaka, and Takuya Miyawaki. The Japanese version of ''Mega Man X5'' features one opening theme, "Monkey", and one closing theme, {{nihongo|"Mizu no Naka"|水の中|Inside the Water}}, both composed and performed by [[Showtaro Morikubo]] and his band [[Mosquito Milk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=モスキート・ミルク「Monkey／水の中」 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030804093923/http://suleputer.capcom.co.jp/suleputer/lineup/cpda1012.htm | url=http://suleputer.capcom.co.jp/suleputer/lineup/cpda1012.htm | archivedate=2003-08-04 | publisher=[[Suleputer]] | language=Japanese | accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the game's instrumental and vocal music was compiled on the ''[[Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6]]'' soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=カプコン ミュージック ジェネレーション ロックマンX1～6　オリジナル・サウンドトラック | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031214215707/http://suleputer.capcom.co.jp/suleputer/lineup/cpca1076.htm | url=http://suleputer.capcom.co.jp/suleputer/lineup/cpca1076.htm | archivedate=2003-12-14 | publisher=Suleputer | language=Japanese | accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme songs were also included on the ''[[Rockman Theme Song Collection]]'', published by Suleputer in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ja:ロックマンテーマソング集&lt;ロックマン15周年記念&gt; |trans-title=Rockman Theme Song Collection &lt;Rockman 15th Anniversary&gt; | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030810220352/http://suleputer.capcom.co.jp/suleputer/lineup/cpca1056.htm | url=http://suleputer.capcom.co.jp/suleputer/lineup/cpca1056.htm | archivedate=August 10, 2003 | publisher=[[Suleputer]] | language=Japanese | accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
''Mega Man X5'' was generally well-received, with IGN giving the game an 8.5 out of 10. However, they added that though the game was fun to play, it was "more of the same" from Capcom, and that ''Mega Man'', like many other series made by Capcom, was being milked for as much as it was worth.&lt;ref name="ignrev"/&gt; GameSpot similarly commented that "Fans of the classic 2D games will no doubt find much to love in ''X5'', while those who can't get into the aging conventions and mechanics probably won't care a great deal for it."&lt;ref name="gspotrev"/&gt; The ''Official UK PlayStation Magazine'' said that the game was "unforgivably primitive".

According to the Japanese publication ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''Mega Man X5'' was the third best-selling video game in Japan during its release week at 46,033 copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | date=December 14, 2000 | title=Now Playing In Japan | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/089/089062p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It placed at number eight the following week with an additional 22,963 copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | date=December 21, 2000 | title=Japanese Top 10 | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/089/089371p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media Create]] sales information showed that the game was 96th best-selling video game in Japan during 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=2000年テレビゲームソフト売り上げTOP300 | url=http://geimin.net/da/db/2000_ne_fa/index.php | publisher=Geimin.net | language=Japanese | accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]] reported that ''Mega Man X5'' sold a total of 215,687 copies in Japan by the end of 2001, listing it as the 132nd best-selling game of the year in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | date=January 11, 2002 | title=Dengeki Online Top 200 Of 2001 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/100/100860p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was eventually re-released as part of Sony's [[The Best (PlayStation range)|PlayStation The Best for Family]] range of budget titles in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ロックマンX5 PlayStation the Best for Family | url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/slpm87021.html | publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] | language=Japanese | accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toy Retail Sales Tracking (TRST) sales data showed that ''Mega Man X5'' was the fifth best-selling PlayStation game in North America for the month of February 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IGN Staff |date=March 19, 2001 |title=TRST: Top Selling PS Games in February 2001 |url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/092/092506p1.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717005256/http://psx.ign.com/articles/092/092506p1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 17, 2012 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2010-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was included on the North American ''[[Mega Man X Collection]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[PlayStation 2]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Dunham, Jeremy | date=January 10, 2006 | title=Mega Man X Ships to Stores | url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/680/680536p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Spanish language}}
There are two [[glottonym|names]] given in Spanish to the [[Spanish language]]: '''español''' ("Spanish") and '''castellano''' ("Castilian"). Spanish speakers from different countries or backgrounds can show a preference for one term or the other, or use them indiscriminately, but political issues or common usage might lead speakers to prefer one term over the other. This article identifies the differences between those terms, the countries or backgrounds that show a preference for one or the other, and the implications the choice of words might have for a native Spanish-speaker.

Formally speaking, the national language of Spain, the official Spanish language, is the Castilian language (as opposed to regional Spanish languages like [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Astur-Leonese languages|Asturleonese]] and [[Basque language|Basque]]). As such both names, ''español'' and ''castellano'', have distinct and independent meanings that may be required for clarity in some specific contexts.
Generally speaking, though, both terms can be used to refer to the (national) Spanish language as a whole, with a preference for one over the other that depends on the context or the speaker's origin. ''Castellano'' (as well as ''Castilian'' in English) has another, more restricted, meaning, relating either to the [[Old Spanish language|old Romance language]] spoken in the [[Kingdom of Castile]] in the [[Middle Ages]], predecessor of the modern Spanish language, or to the variety of Spanish nowadays spoken in the historical region of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], in central [[Spain]].

==History of the terms==
{{see also|History of the Spanish language|Iberian Romance languages|Spanish colonization of the Americas|History of Spain|History of South America|Kingdom of Castile}}

Originally ''Castilian (castellano)'' referred to the language of the [[Kingdom of Castile]], one of several northern kingdoms that spread across the [[Iberian Peninsula]] through the [[Middle Ages]], from about the 8th to the 15th centuries. Traditionally the first recorded examples of written Castilian/Spanish are considered to be the ''[[Glosas Emilianenses]]'', a number of isolated words added to a Latin text as an aid to the reader, dated to the eleventh century. Soon after that there begin to appear discursive texts in Castilian, such as the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]''. This early [[Romance languages|Romance language]] was derived from [[Latin]] and evolved into modern Spanish.

However, the term ''Spanish'' (''español'') is a more recent term that first referred to Spain as a country, and then to the predominant language spoken in that country. Spain as a truly unified nation appeared centuries later than the language and the Kingdom of Castile; in fact, it was only in the late 15th century that the [[personal union]] between the [[Catholic Monarchs|Crowns]] of Castile and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] unified Spain. The actual legal unification date is disputed, but commonly agreed to have occurred not earlier than the eighteenth century at the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Only then did the Castilian language begin to be commonly called Spanish.

In 1492, the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] on a Castilian-paid expedition paved the way for the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. As a result of this process, most countries in South America now speak the same language as Castile. Until about the eighteenth century, the Kingdom of Castile, and not Spain as a whole, was the colonizing power, and the language used was called ''castellano''. Thus, some Latin American countries formerly under Spanish rule have retained the custom of calling it ''castellano'', while others eventually switched to calling it ''español'', with many different factors influencing the final choice.

In English, the term ''Spanish'' relates both to the language and to the nation. The noun used for a person from Spain is ''Spaniard'', with the collective noun ''the Spanish''. The term ''Castilian'' is much less widespread amongst English speakers than the term ''Spanish''.

===''Español''===
Two main hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the word ''español'': one based on [[dissimilation]] in Old Spanish ''españón'' (from a presumed Vulgar Latin *''hispaniōne''), and the other on an [[Occitan language|Occitan]] term derived from a presumed Vulgar Latin *''hispaniolus''. Both Latin ancestor words are based on the place name ''Hispania'' (which evolved into ''España'' by regular sound changes); and both are marked with an asterisk to indicate that they are [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]], not directly attested.

The dissimilation hypothesis, advanced by [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=dnFLUb3eOOmW0QGR6IHQAQ&amp;id=l1ZdAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=menendez+pidal+manual&amp;q=espa%C3%B1%C3%B3n#search_anchor ''Manual de gramática histórica española''] (1904/1980), p. 181 (§66.2).&lt;/ref&gt; presumes that Latin ''Hispania'' was lengthened by the [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] suffix ''-ōne'' (which survives in other [[ethnonyms]] such as ''bretón'', ''borgoñón'', ''sajón'', and ''lapón''). The Old Spanish form ''españon'' is documented in works of the 13th and 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;For example the ''[[Poema de Fernán González]]'' and the ''[[Book of the Knight Zifar|Libro del cauallero Zifar'']].&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the final /n/ of this form changed to /l/ by dissimilation from the previous [[nasal consonant]], ''ñ''. This sporadic sound change is observed in some other words: Menéndez Pidal cites ''Barcelona'' (from ''Barcinone'') and ''delante'' (from ''de in ante''); Lathrop adds ''ingle'' (from ''ing[ui]ne'') and ''sangre'' (from ''sang[ui]ne'').&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Lathrop, ''The Evolution of Spanish'' (Newark, Del.: Juan de la Cuesta), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Occitan scenario, advanced by [[Rafael Lapesa]],&lt;ref&gt;''Historia de la lengua española'' (Madrid: Gredos, 1981), p. 199 (§51.3).&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish borrowed the Occitan name for themselves, which was the name ''España'' plus the diminutive suffix ''-ol'', from the [[Latin]] ''-olus''. The Occitan influence is inferred because in Castilian the same Latin suffix would have produced *''españuelo'' rather than ''español''. Lapesa counters the dissimilation hypothesis by citing other words with ''-ñón'' in which dissimilation did not take place: ''cañón'', ''borgoñón'', ''riñón'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;P. 200, note 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Penny, in discussing loans from French and Occitan, calls this "the most remarkable loan of all, ''español'' 'Spanish', replacing native ''españón''."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Penny, ''A History of the Spanish Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''[[Hispania]]'' was applied to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] when they [[Roman conquest of Hispania|discovered and later subjugated]] it. One theory about this name is that it comes from [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] אי שפנים (''ʾî šəpānîm''), meaning 'island of [[hyrax]]es', named by Canaanite-speaking [[Phoenicia]]ns who mistook Spain's large [[rabbit]] population for hyraxes.&lt;ref&gt;Today the Spanish population of wild rabbits is much less abundant than in ancient times, due to the introduction of the [[myxomatosis]] [[virus]] to mainland Europe in the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other theories about the name have been advanced as well (see [[Hispania#Name|Hispania]]).

The Romans called the inhabitants of Hispania ''hispani'' (singular: ''hispanus''), and the relevant adjective was ''hispanicus''.  These terms, had they undergone regular sound change into Castilian, would have developed into ''España'', *''espanos'' (singular: *''espano'') and *''espánego'' or *''espango''—but in reality, only the first term exists in modern Castilian.

As the branches of [[Vulgar Latin]] began to evolve into separate [[Romance languages]], the term that would evolve into ''español'' began to be used to refer to these derivative languages (especially as opposed to the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] of the [[Moors|Moorish]] and [[Jew]]ish inhabitants of Iberia). It was at first a general term that embraced the various dialects of Iberian Romance spoken in the area, including the forebears of modern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], Castilian and [[Catalan language|Catalan]].  However, with the rise of Castile as a power, and its absorption of all surrounding regions into an ever-growing empire that eventually spread to the [[New World]], the term ''España'' was eventually equated with the peninsular territories ruled by the Crown.  With this, the break with the Roman concept of ''Hispania'' was complete, and the term acquired its modern meaning of 'all of Iberia except for [[Portugal]] and [[Andorra]]'.  Similarly, ''español'' came to be used to refer to the common language of this new country: Castilian.

The terms ''España'' and ''español'' spread to other languages.  The English name ''Spain'' is from the French ''Espagne''.  ''Spanish'' is ''Spain'' plus the English suffix ''-ish''.  The term continues evolving as other languages adapt these words to form their own name for Spain—for example, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] スペイン語 (''Supein-go''), 'Spanish language', and スペイン人 (''Supein-jin''), 'Spaniard', derive from the Japanese word for Spain, スペイン (''Supein''), which, in turn, derives from English ''Spain''.  In Chinese, the word is taken directly from Spanish (or perhaps even Latin) rather than English:  西班牙 (&lt;small&gt;[[Pinyin]] phonetic symbols:&lt;/small&gt; ''xībānyá'') for Spain and 西班牙语 (&lt;small&gt;Pinyin:&lt;/small&gt; ''xībānyá yǔ''), or the abbreviation 西語 (&lt;small&gt;Pinyin:&lt;/small&gt; ''xī yǔ'') for the Spanish language. The Arabic إسبانية (''isbāniya'') for Spain derives directly from the word ''España'': the absence of "p" in the Arabic alphabet makes it a "b", and the sound "ñ" is transformed into "n". إسباني (isbāni) is the name for Spanish, with the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|"nisba" suffix]].

In [[Guatemala]], although Spanish is the official language, the [[Maya peoples]], descendants of the original inhabitants of the region, call it ''la castilla'', keeping the original name from colonial times. Mayans speak at least 22 different [[Mayan languages]] and dialects, including [[Mam language|Mam]], [[Poqomam language|Pocomam]], [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]], [[Tz’utujil language|Tz’utujil]], [[Q’eqchi’ language|Q’eqchi’]], and [[K’iche’ language|K’iche’]].

===''Castellano''===

''Castilla'' (''Castile'' in English) means '[[Castle]]-land'. The word is derived from Latin ''castella'', the plural of ''castellum'', which, in turn, is a diminutive form of ''castrum'' 'fortress, castle'. Through most of the Middle Ages the word was spelled ''Castiella'', a form that survives in [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]] today. (Modern Spanish has transformed all words ending in ''-iello'', ''-iella'' into ''-illo'', ''-illa''.) The adjective derived from ''Castilla'' is ''castellano''. ''Castellano'' also means '[[castellan]]', i.e. a castle master.  There is a comic scene based on the play on words ''Castilian''/''castellan'' in the novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (Chapter 2).

The region was thus named because it was a [[frontier]] land controlled from a series of fortified castles. It shared borders with rival [[Moorish Spain]] (to the south) and the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of León|Leon]] (to the west) and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Kingdom of Aragón|Aragon]] (to the east).

While ''espanyol'' is used in [[Standard Philippine]] and other [[languages of the Philippines]], the word ''kastilà'' is more frequently used.  Furthermore ''katsila'' is also used among those who speak [[Visayan languages]], such as [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]].

===Other local names===

===="Cristiano"====
During the presence of [[Moors]] in [[Hispania]], Spanish was sometimes given the name ''cristiano'' ("Christian") to distinguish it from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] languages. This term is still used occasionally today to refer to the language, in a jocular tone.
The expression ''Hábleme en cristiano'' "talk to me in Christian", uttered to people not speaking Spanish at the moment, is used in opposition of the other languages of Spain{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, which is felt as annoying by them{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} ([[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], but not in the Americas). "Háblame en cristiano" is also a phrase used to ask for clarification in a conversation, when the topic of the discussion is not clear or is vaguely hinted at by one of the speakers.

===="Language of Cervantes"====

The term "lengua de [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]" as an [[List of metaphors for languages|epithet]] for the Spanish language begins to be used  early in the 19th century. [[Mariano José de Larra]] uses the expression in his essay "Literatura", first published in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ChN1_ZcABqkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA66&amp;dq=%22lengua+de+Cervantes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o85NUY-ZBsPV0gH9h4GYBA&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lengua%20de%20Cervantes%22&amp;f=false ''Obras completas''], Vol. 4 (Madrid: José M. Repullés, 1837), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829 it appears in ''Una cuestión de derecho'', by Manuel Sivela.&lt;ref&gt;Paris: Gaultier-Laguionie, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that it appears in an anonymous article in the ''Gaceta de Madrid''.&lt;ref&gt;"De las traducciones", No. 64 (May 29, 1832), p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet Nicasio Camilo Jover, in his poem "Miguel de Cervantes", states directly "Y la lengua del pueblo castellano / Hoy se llama ''la lengua de Cervantes''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eAqvjn2ftP0C&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=%22lengua+de+Cervantes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ANpNUYjPMMmQ0QHelYC4BA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lengua%20de%20Cervantes%22&amp;f=false ''Glorias de España: Poesías históricas''] (Madrid: D.F.A. Fernel, 1848), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish is called "el idioma de Cervantes" in a book published in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Díaz Arenas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tHsa1sTWRt0C&amp;pg=PT136&amp;dq=%22idioma+de+Cervantes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bZpQUbvTBury0gHJuIDYBA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA ''Memorias históricas y estadísticas de Filipinas y particularmente de la grande isla de Luzón''] (Manila: Diario de Manila&lt;/ref&gt; and in another one published in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;"El Tío Cigüeña" (pseud. of Juan Mieg), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3nVIf8-NubcC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22idioma+de+Cervantes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Z1QUa2XIeLI0wGzrYDABw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22idioma%20de%20Cervantes%22&amp;f=false ''Cuatro palabras á los señores traductores y editores de novelas''] (Madrid: Hijos de Doña Catalina Piñuela), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the term refers to the language of [[Spanish Golden Age]] literature generally, rather than simply to that of Cervantes.&lt;ref&gt;For example Héctor M. Ardila A. and Inés Vizcaíno G., [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2hcVra7ZScC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22lengua+de+Cervantes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eOxNUb7RI5O40QGR8YCQDQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lengua%20de%20Cervantes%22&amp;f=false ''Hombres y mujeres en las letras colombianas''] (Bogotá: Magisterio, 2008), p. 14: "La lengua clásica, la lengua de Cervantes y Fray Luis de León".&lt;/ref&gt;

"The language of Cervantes" in English—as a term for the Spanish language generally—comes into use in the 1840s. Examples appear in Janin (1841)&lt;ref&gt;Jules Janin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JRUaAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22language+of+Cervantes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ue9NUY26LJKJ0QGb1oFQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22language%20of%20Cervantes%22&amp;f=false "Biographical Notice of Le Sage"], in ''Asmodeus: Or, the Devil on Two Sticks'' by Alain René Le Sage (London: Joseph Thomas, 1841), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; and Campbell (1849).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rF8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=life+and+letters+of+thomas+campbell+language+of+cervantes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QfZNUfTVHKWL0QGmkYDgBQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cervantes&amp;f=false ''Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell''], ed. William Beattie (London: Edward Moxon, 1849), Vol. 2, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Román paladino"====
The poet [[Gonzalo de Berceo]], writing in the 13th century, used the phrase "román paladino" to mean simple, straightforward language, the language spoken by the common people, as opposed to Latin. In the famous passage from his ''Vida de Santo Domingo de Silos'', Berceo says "Quiero fer una prosa en roman paladino, / en cual suele el pueblo fablar con so vezino; / ca non so tan letrado por fer otro latino. / Bien valdra, como creo, un vaso de bon vino" ("I want to write verse [sic] &lt;!--Dictionaries of Old Spanish define "prosa" as "composición métrica", "poema"--&gt; in clear vernacular, in which the townsfolk speak to their neighbor; for I'm not so learned as to make another in Latin.

Both words are derived ultimately from Latin ''palatīnus'' "of the palace", with influence from Latin ''palam'' "openly".) Today "román paladino" is a high-sounding epithet for clear, straightforward Spanish. Recently it has been popularized in public speeches by [[Prime Minister of Spain|Spain's Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]], who has used it frequently as an equivalent for "I will clearly state...".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Royal Spanish Academy==
In Spain, the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]] is a normative body that rules on the orthography and general usage rules of the language. The Academy has used ''castellano'' since the 18th century, but since 1923, its dictionary and grammar are ''de la lengua española'' ("of the Spanish language"). The Academy's usage of one term is not necessarily a condemnation of the other.

There are many other academies (grouped under the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]]) that may or may not have an official normative recognition but nevertheless cooperate in the creation of the ''Diccionario panhispánico de dudas'' (a compendium of corrected typical mistakes and doubts). The dictionary, whose production was agreed upon by the 22 different Spanish Language Academies, says:

{{Quote|Para designar la lengua común de España y de muchas naciones de América, y que también se habla como propia en otras partes del mundo, '''son válidos los términos castellano y español.''' La polémica sobre cuál de estas denominaciones resulta más apropiada está hoy superada. [...] Aun siendo sinónimo de ''español,'' resulta '''preferible reservar el término ''castellano'' para referirse al dialecto románico nacido en el Reino de Castilla durante la Edad Media, o al dialecto del español que se habla actualmente en esa región.'''}}

{{Quote|''When naming the common language of Spain and of many nations of America, which is also spoken as a first language in other parts of the world, '''the terms Castilian and Spanish are [both] valid.''' The debate over which of these designations is more appropriate is presently settled. [...] Although it is a synonym of ''Spanish'', it '''is preferable to reserve the term ''Castilian'' to refer to the Romance language arising in the Kingdom of Castile during the Middle Ages, or to the dialect of Spanish currently spoken in that region.'''|[http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/ ''Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas,'' 2005]}}

Thus, even if both terms are allowed in Spanish, the use of ''español'' is recommended for the language as a whole. However, popular choice of terms is not so clear, with other factors, such as customs or geographical location, being factors.

==Usage in Spain==
Spaniards tend to call the language ''español'' (Spanish) to contrast it to languages of other states, such as in a list with [[French language|French]] (''francés''), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (''chino''), etc. ''Castellano'' (Castilian) by contrast, is more often used when contrasting the language with other [[Languages of Spain|regional languages of Spain]]: official languages like [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Galician language|Galician]] or unofficial ones like [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Extremaduran language|Extremaduran]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]]. The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] uses the term ''el castellano'' to define the official language of the whole State, opposed to ''las demás lenguas españolas'' (''the other Spanish languages''). Article 3 reads in part:

{{Quote|El castellano es la lengua española oficial del Estado. Todos los españoles tienen el deber de conocerla y el derecho a usarla. Las demás lenguas españolas serán también oficiales en las respectivas Comunidades Autónomas...}}

{{Quote|''Castilian is the official Spanish language of the State. All Spaniards have the duty to know it and the right to use it. The other Spanish languages as well shall be official in their respective Autonomous Communities...''|[[Spanish Constitution]] of 1978}}

This choice of words, however, varies depending on many factors, including the origin of the speaker or some political nuances.

===Bilingual and multilingual regions of Spain===
In the regions where regional languages are spoken, there is obviously a daily need to make the contrast between the [[national language]] and the [[regional language]] and so the national language is most often referred to as Castilian, particularly in the regional languages themselves (for example, ''espanyol'' is virtually never used to refer to the language in Catalan: ''castellà'' is used instead; in Basque, the name of the language is ''gaztelania'' or ''gaztelera'', never ''espainiera''; and in Galician, the most commonly used term is "castelán" rather than "español"). That is often mirrored by educated English-speakers to refer to the linguistic situation in Spain.

For some, this use of the term ''castellano'' is a political or cultural statement that Spanish is only the language of Castile, perhaps also of some areas that Castile colonised, but not the language of their region, which they consider the only legitimate language to be the regional one: Catalan, Basque, Galician etc. That stance is common in regionalist circles.

Conversely, some nationalist circles prefer the term ''español'' because they perceive their ethnic community to be distinct from that of Spain and therefore do not object to the language of Spain being called Spanish. In Basque-speaking regions, whose language is not of [[Romance languages|Romance]] origin (Basque is considered by many scholars to be a [[language isolate]]), some Basque speakers also use the term ''erdara'' or ''erdera'' &lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;''erdara'' in the [http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/hiztegia.htm Morris Student Plus] Basque-English dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; (''foreign'') specifically for Spanish, since for them, it is the prevalent foreign language, just as in the [[French Basque Country]], "French language" is the usual meaning of ''erdara''; in fact, ''erdara'' is another language, different from Basque.

===Monolingual regions of Spain===
In monolingual regions, the implications are a little different. In such regions, there is no identity implication, but still, they must choose one of the two terms. [[Castilian people|Castilians]] usually use the term ''el español'', legitimately presenting it as the national language {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}. However, they also frequently call it ''el castellano'', either to assert their ownership or to distinguish it from the regional languages.

Monolingual regions outside of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] include mainly [[Andalusia]] but also other regions where the regional languages are not developed enough to be widely spoken by the majority of the population, such as [[Extremadura]], [[Cantabria]] or [[Aragon]]. There, ''español'' may be used, as in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], to stress the national nature of the language but with a slightly different nuance: they are accepting another region's historical language as their own.

===Concept of a standard===
The term ''castellano'' is occasionally used to imply more of a standard form than ''español'' does. For example, if someone mispronounces a word, they might be told ''¡Habla castellano!'', i.e. 'Speak Castilian!', 'Speak properly!'. However, that nuance is not to be exaggerated, as it is perfectly possible that the term ''español'' or even, jocularly, ''cristiano'' ('Christian') could be used instead. Moreover, the term ''castellano'' is also commonly and correctly used to refer to dialects of Spanish, which deviate dramatically from the standard.

==Usage and implications in former colonies==
[[File:What Spanish nations call Spanish.png|thumb|280px|right|Geographic distribution of the preferential use of terms ''castellano'' (Castilian) vs. ''español'' (Spanish).{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}]]&lt;!--Map needs citation--&gt;
Both names are commonly used in parts of the world colonized by Spanish speakers, such as Latin America and the Canary Islands. As in Spain, the implications are complex. The most common term used in Latin America is ''español'', generally considered to be a neutral term simply reflecting the country that the language came from. For people who use that term, ''castellano'' may possibly imply greater correctness, as it sometimes does in Spain, or it may merely be an alien term, referring to a region in a far-off country.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

However, some Latin Americans prefer the term ''castellano'', especially in Argentina, Chile, and Peru. One reason for this is that many early Argentine settlers were Galician,&lt;ref&gt;Another relic of this fact is the Argentine use of ''gallegos'' to mean recent immigrants from Spain, to be compared with the Australian use of ''pommy''.&lt;/ref&gt; for whom ''castellano'' had long been associated with the Spanish state in addition to Castile.  Along with Basques or Catalans, Galicians might perceive the term ''español'' as imperialistic and misrepresenting the language of Castile as the language of Spain.

Peruvians often prefer the term ''castellano'' for similar reasons to avoid the linkage between "español" and "España". [[Governorate of New Castile|The Governorate of New Castile (Gobernación de Nueva Castilla)]] was established in [[Lima]], Peru in 1528, and Peruvian history classes still emphasize the Castilian origin of the first conquerors and settlers. That tendency often manifests itself in a preference for films dubbed into Latin American Spanish, which often take longer to reach the market, over those in "Español" (Peninsular Spanish characterized by the use of "vosotros"), which tend to be found in pirated "cam" versions of films. Using "español" to refer to Peninsular Spanish is exactly the opposite of how English-speakers use the two terms, which can create some confusion.

''Castellano'' may also be used to refer to the dialect of Spanish spoken in Castile, and ''español'' would generally refer to [[Standard Spanish]]. In practice, usage tends to be a matter of local custom rather than reflecting any philosophical or political position. However, the fact that Castile is now a region subsumed within modern Spain has been the decisive factor in the preferential usage of ''español'' in an international context.

==Usage and misconceptions abroad==
Some philologists use "Castilian" only for the language spoken in Castile during the [[Middle Ages]] and state that it is preferable to use "Spanish" for its modern form. The [[dialect]] of Spanish spoken in northern parts of modern Castile may also be called "Castilian." It differs from those of other regions of Spain ([[Andalusia]] for example); the [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian dialect]] is conventionally considered in Spain to be the same as Standard Spanish.

Another use of ''Castilian'' in English is to distinguish between Standard Spanish and regional dialects. As noted above, the distinction is made to some extent in Spanish but not as far as some English-speakers go; for example, websites with language selection screens give the choice between ''Castilian Spanish'' and ''Latin American Spanish'', among other languages.

In the Americas, where Spanish is the native language of 20 countries, usage of ''castellano'' and ''español'' is sometimes reversed to refer to another nation. For example, a Peruvian talking about a Uruguayan might say, ''Yo hablo en español peruano, él habla en español uruguayo, pero los dos hablamos castellano'' ("I speak Peruvian Spanish, he speaks Uruguayan Spanish, but we both speak Castilian"){{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. That usage comes from the historical association of ''español'' with the language that was brought to America by [[conquistadores]] and was later transformed in each nation through daily usage, with ''castellano'' as the basis for all variants.

The '''[[International Phonetic Alphabet]]''' (IPA) requires '''specific names for the symbols''' and diacritics used in the alphabet.

It is often desirable to distinguish an IPA symbol from the sound it is intended to represent, since there is not a one-to-one correspondence between symbol and sound in broad transcription. The symbol's names and phonetic descriptions are described in the ''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association''. The symbols also have nonce names in the [[Unicode]] standard. In some cases, the Unicode names and the IPA names do not agree. For example, IPA calls {{IPA|ɛ}} "epsilon", but Unicode calls it "small letter open E".

==Letters==
The traditional names of the Latin and Greek letters are used for unmodified symbols. In Unicode, some of the symbols of Greek origin have Latin forms for use in IPA; the others use the symbols from the Greek section.

Examples:
{| class="wikitable"
! style="width:2em;" | !! IPA symbol name !! phonetic description !! Unicode name
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|p}} || (lowercase) p || [[voiceless bilabial stop]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER P
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|x}} || (lowercase) x || [[voiceless velar fricative]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER X
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|r}} || (lowercase) r || [[alveolar trill|coronal trill]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER R
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|β}} || [[Beta (letter)|beta]] || [[voiced bilabial fricative]] || GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɛ}} || [[epsilon]] || [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN E
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɣ}} || [[gamma]] || [[voiced velar fricative]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER GAMMA
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|θ}} || [[theta]] || [[voiceless dental fricative]] || GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|χ}} || [[Chi (letter)|chi]] || [[voiceless uvular fricative]] || GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɸ}} || [[phi (letter)|phi]]{{r|footnote1|group=decimal}} || [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER PHI
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ʊ}} || upsilon {{r|footnote2|group=decimal}} || [[near-close near-back rounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER UPSILON
|-
|}

'''Note'''
{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=
&lt;ref name=footnote1&gt;The Latin phi; the old-style or Greek phi (φ) is used in linguistics to mark prosodic units ([[Foot (prosody)|foot]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=footnote2&gt;The Latin [[upsilon]] is frequently called "[[horseshoe|horseshoe u]]" in order to distinguish it from the Greek upsilon (υ). Historically, it derives from a Latin small capital &lt;tt&gt;U&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The IPA standard includes some small capital letters, such as {{IPA|ʀ}}, although it is common to refer to these symbols as simply "capital" or "cap" letters, because the IPA standard does not include any full-size capital letters.

===Cursive-based letters===
A few letters have the forms of cursive or script letters. Examples:

{| class="wikitable"
! style="width:2em;" | !! IPA symbol name !! phonetic description !! Unicode name
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɑ}} || [[script a|single-story a]] || [[open back unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER ALPHA
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɡ}} || single-story g{{r|footnote1|group=decimal}} || [[voiced velar stop]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER SCRIPT G
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ʋ}} || cursive v{{r|footnote2|group=decimal}} || [[labiodental approximant]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER V WITH HOOK
|}
'''Note'''
{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=
&lt;ref name=footnote1&gt;The double-story g ([[File:Looptail g.svg|10 px]]) is not strictly an IPA character, but is an acceptable alternative.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=footnote2&gt;In form and origin, but not in name, this is the Greek upsilon.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Ligatures===
Ligatures are called precisely that, although some have alternate names. Examples:

{| class="wikitable"
! style="width:2em;" | !! IPA symbol name !! phonetic description !! Unicode name
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|œ}} || [[Œ|ethel]] || [[open-mid front rounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɮ}} || l-ʒ ligature, or lezh || [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative|voiced coronal lateral fricative]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER LEZH
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|æ}} || [[Ash (letter)|ash]] || [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
|}

===Rotated letters===
Many letters are ''turned'', or rotated 180 degrees. Examples:

{| class="wikitable"
! style="width:2em;" | !! IPA symbol name !! phonetic description !! Unicode name
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ʎ}} || turned y || [[palatal lateral approximant]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED Y
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɥ}} || turned h || [[labial-palatal approximant]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED H
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɒ}} || turned single-story a || [[open back rounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED ALPHA
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ʌ}} || [[turned V|turned v]]{{r|footnote1|group=decimal}} || [[open-mid back unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL TURNED V
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɔ}} || [[open o]]{{r|footnote2|group=decimal}} || [[open-mid back rounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN O
|}

;Notes
{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=
&lt;ref name=footnote1&gt;The symbol {{IPA|ʌ}} is often also called "[[caret]]" or "wedge" for its similarity to that diacritic.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=footnote2&gt;The symbol {{IPA|ɔ}} can be described as a ''reversed c'', but it is almost always referred to as ''open o'', which describes both its articulation and its shape. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

A few letters are ''reversed'' (flipped on a vertical axis):
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! style="width:2em;" | !! IPA symbol name !! phonetic description !! Unicode name
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɘ}} || reversed e || [[close-mid central unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER REVERSED E
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ɜ}} || reversed epsilon || [[open-mid central unrounded vowel]] || LATIN SMALL LETTER REVERSED OPEN E {{r|footnote1|group=decimal}}
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | {{IPA|ʕ}} || reversed glottal stop {{r|footnote2|group=decimal}}|| [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]] || LATIN LETTER PHARYNGEAL VOICED FRICATIVE {{r|footnote3|group=decimal}}
|}

;Notes:
{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=
&lt;ref name=footnote1&gt;The old Unicode name for this character is LATIN SMALL LETTER REVERSED EPSILON.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=footnote2&gt;This IPA symbol is often called by the name of the corresponding Arabic letter, [[ayin]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=footnote3&gt;The old Unicode name for this character is LATIN LETTER REVERSED GLOTTAL STOP.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

One letter is ''inverted'' (flipped on a horizontal axis): '''{{IPA|ʁ}}''' ''inverted capital small R''. ('''{{IPA|ʍ}}''' could also be called an ''inverted w'', but ''turned w'' is more common.)

===Letters with extra lines, curls and serifs===
When a horizontal stroke is added, it is called a ''crossbar'': '''{{IPA|ħ}}''' ''[[Ħ|barred h]]'', '''{{IPA|ɵ}}''' ''[[Ɵ|barred o]]'', '''{{IPA|ʢ}}''' ''reversed barred glottal stop'' or ''barred ayin'', '''{{IPA|ɟ}}''' ''barred dotless j'' or ''barred gelded j'' (apparently never 'turned f'), '''{{IPA|ǂ}}''' ''double-barred pipe'', etc.

swyat'' through it: '''{{IPA|ø}}''' ''[[Ø|slashed o]]''.

The implosives have ''hook'' tops: '''{{IPA|ɓ}}''' ''[[Ɓ|hook-top b]]'', as does '''{{IPA|ɦ}}''' ''hook-top h''.

Such an extension at the bottom of a letter is called a ''tail''. It may be specified as ''left'' or ''right'' depending on which direction it turns: '''{{IPA|ɳ}}''' ''right-tail n'', '''{{IPA|ɻ}}''' ''right-tail turned r'', '''{{IPA|ɲ}}''' ''left-tail n'', '''{{IPA|ʐ}}''' ''tail z'' (or just ''retroflex z''), etc. But note: '''{{IPA|ŋ}}''' ''[[eng (letter)|eng]]'' or ''[[engma]]'', '''{{IPA|ɱ}}''' ''meng'', '''{{IPA|ꜧ}}''' ''heng''.

When the tail loops over itself, it's called ''curly'': '''{{IPA|ʝ}}''' ''curly-tail j'', '''{{IPA|ɕ}}''' ''curly-tail c''.

There are also a few unique modifications: '''{{IPA|ɬ}}''' ''belted l'', '''{{IPA|ɞ}}''' ''closed reversed epsilon'' (there was once also a '''{{IPA|ɷ}}''' ''closed omega''), '''{{IPA|ɰ}}''' ''right-leg turned m'', '''{{IPA|ɺ}}''' ''turned long-leg r'' (there was once also a ''long-leg r''), '''{{IPA|ǁ}}''' ''double pipe'', and the obsolete '''{{IPA|ʗ}}''' ''stretched c''.

Several non-English letters have traditional names: '''{{IPA|ç}}''' ''c [[cedilla]]'', '''{{IPA|ð}}''' ''[[eth]]'' (also spelled ''edh''), '''{{IPA|ŋ}}''' ''engma'' or ''eng'', '''{{IPA|ə}}''' ''[[Ə|schwa]]'' (also spelled ''shwa''), '''{{IPA|ǃ}}''' ''exclamation mark'', '''{{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;ǀ&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}''' ''pipe''.

Other symbols are unique to the IPA, and have developed their own quirky names: '''{{IPA|ɾ}}''' ''fish-hook r'', '''{{IPA|ɤ}}''' ''ram's horns'', '''{{IPA|ʘ}}''' ''bull's eye'', '''{{IPA|ʃ}}''' ''[[esh (letter)|esh]]'' (apparently never 'stretched s'), '''{{IPA|ʒ}}''' ''[[ezh (letter)|ezh]]'' (sometimes confused with ''[[yogh]]''), '''{{IPA|ɧ}}''' ''hook-top heng''.

The '''{{IPA|ʔ}}''' is usually called by the sound it represents, ''glottal stop''. This is not normally a problem, because this symbol is seldom used to represent anything else. However, to specify the symbol itself, it is sometimes called a ''gelded question mark''. This latter name is derived from its original form as a dotless question mark in a fashion reminiscent of [[gelding]].

==Diacritic marks==

===Traditionally named diacritics===
:'''{{IPA|é}}''' ''[[Acute accent|acute]]'', '''{{IPA|ē}}''' ''[[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]'', '''{{IPA|è}}''' ''[[Grave accent|grave]]'', '''{{IPA|ê}}''' ''[[circumflex]]'', '''{{IPA|ě}}''' ''[[open-mid back unrounded vowel|wedge]]'' or ''[[háček]]'', '''{{IPA|ë}}''' ''[[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]'' or ''[[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]]'', '''{{IPA|ĕ}}''' ''[[breve]]'', '''{{IPA|ẽ}}''' ''(superscript) [[tilde]]'', plus variants such as '''{{IPA|ḛ}}''' ''subscript tilde'', '''{{IPA|ɫ}}''' ''superimposed tilde'', etc.

===Non-traditionally named diacritics===
:'''{{IPA|d̼}}''' ''seagull'', '''{{IPA|e˞}}''' ''hook'', '''{{IPA|e̽}}''' ''over-cross'', '''{{IPA|d ̚}}''' ''corner'', '''{{IPA|d̪}}''' ''bridge'', '''{{IPA|d̺}}''' ''inverted bridge'', '''{{IPA|d̻}}''' ''square'', '''{{IPA|e̥}}''' ''under-ring'', '''{{IPA|e̊}}''' ''over-ring'', '''{{IPA|e̜}}''' ''left half-ring'', '''{{IPA|e̹}}''' ''right half-ring'', '''{{IPA|e̟}}''' ''plus'', '''{{IPA|e̠}}''' ''under-bar'', '''{{IPA|e̯}}''' ''arch'', '''{{IPA|d̬}}''' ''subscript wedge'', '''{{IPA|e̝}}''' ''up tack'', '''{{IPA|e̞}}''' ''down tack'', '''{{IPA|e̘}}''' ''left tack'', '''{{IPA|e̙}}''' ''right tack'', '''{{IPA|d͡z}}''' ''tie bar'', '''{{IPA|ẹ}}''' ''under-dot'', '''{{IPA|n̩}}''' ''under-stroke''.

Diacritics are alternately named after their function: The bridge is also called the ''dental sign,'' the under-stroke the ''syllabicity sign'', etc.

The '''National Monuments Council'''  (NMC) was the national heritage conservation authority of [[South Africa]], and therefore also of [[Namibia]], during the major part of the [[apartheid]] era. It was the successor body to the [[Historical Monuments Commission]] and became known principally for its declaration of several thousand national monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Section 19, National Monuments Act, Act 28 of 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of heritage sites in South Africa]]&lt;/ref&gt; It came into being through the promulgation of the National Monuments Act of 1969 and ceased to exist on 31 March 2000 when it was replaced by [[South African Heritage Resources Agency|SAHRA]] and the [[Provincial heritage resources authority|provincial heritage resources authorities]] established in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;National Monuments Act, Act 28 of 1969 as amended to 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The National Monuments Council was the successor to the [[Historical Monuments Commission]] which had been in existence since 1923 and upon its creation the 'historical monuments' declared by the Commission became known as 'national monuments'.&lt;ref&gt;Natural and Historical Monuments, Relics and Antiques Act, Act 5 of 1923&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section 20(2), National Monuments Act, Act 28 of 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Like its predecessor it was a statutory body, semi-independent of government and presided over by a council appointed by the Minister responsible for culture. It had its head office in [[Cape Town]] rather than the national capital [[Pretoria]]. This reflected its preoccupation with the heritage of the early colonial (Dutch) period, the area around Cape Town being the most densely colonised during that time and hence the area in which most remnants of Dutch colonialism in South Africa are located. This is borne out by the fact that around half of the national monuments declared by the NMC were located in what is now the [[Western Cape]] Province.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: [[List of heritage sites in South Africa]] with [[List of heritage sites in Western Cape]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Apartheid Era ===
Most of the period of existence the NMC fell within the [[apartheid]] era. During this period the organisation was governed by a Council made up exclusively of [[white South African]]s and had a professional staff of similar composition. However, from not long after [[PW Botha|PW Botha's]] introduction of the [[Tricameral Parliament]] in 1984 the membership of the Council included one representative from each of the [[Coloured]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] communities. During the [[F. W. de Klerk|de Klerk]] era (1989–1994) the organisation began to shift focus and declared a number of sites important to the history of the African community, including those associated with anti-apartheid movements, commencing with the declaration of the [[Sol Plaatje]] House in Kimberley in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Government Gazette of South Africa, No. 14048, Pretoria: 19 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-Apartheid ===
From 1994, under the post-Apartheid government, the make-up and focus of the organisation began to change to reflect the changes in South African society.  During this period the composition of the Council and professional staff came to reflect the demographics of the country and a concerted effort was made to declare sites that reflected a broader national heritage.
At the end of March 2000 the National Monuments Council was replaced by the [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]], SAHRA, and over the following years the establishment of [[Provincial heritage resources authority|provincial heritage resources authorities]] saw the shift of the majority of its functions to provincial level. In terms of Section 58 of the National Heritage Resources Act national monuments became the responsibility of [[Provincial heritage resources authority|provincial heritage resources authorities]] and are now known as [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]]. A new category of [[national heritage site]] was created and is the responsibility of SAHRA.

=== Independence of Namibia ===
In 1990, when the territory of South West Africa became Namibia, the National Monuments Act remained in force and a National Monuments Council was established for the newly independent country. This organisation continued to operate until the promulgation of the Namibian Heritage Act of 2004 in terms of which the [[National Heritage Council of Namibia|National Heritage Council]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Act , Government Notice 287, Government Gazette of the Republic of Namibia , No. 3361, Windhoek: 29 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
The most noticeable legacy of the National Monuments Council is the bronze badge which still adorns most [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]] in South Africa and heritage places in Namibia. The term 'national monument' is still used by most South Africans and Namibians to refer to anything protected in terms of heritage legislation.
[[File:Gedenkplaket, Nasionale Gedenkwaardigheid.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Badge used on former national monuments]]
More fundamental inheritances of present heritage resources authorities are:
* The lists of [[Provincial heritage sites (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]] and heritage places is heavily biased towards colonial heritage and the built environment.
* There is a lack of integration of heritage management into the planning systems of local government, a legacy of the lack of relevant provisions in the National Monuments Act.
* A lack of understanding of the importance and relevance of heritage conservation amongst the majority of South Africans and Namibians stemming from the focus of the NMC being for most of its existence mainly on heritage relevant to the white community.

== Logo ==
The logo of the National Monuments Council was almost the same as that used by its predecessor the [[Historical Monuments Commission]]. It depicts the entrance gate of the Cape Town Castle (the first historical monument to be declared by the Commission)&lt;ref&gt;p.2, Oberholster JJ, The Historical Monuments of South Africa, Cape Town: The Rembrandt van Rijn Foundation, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by a wreath of [[Protea|King Proteas]] (South Africa's national flower) and capped with the national coat of arms that was used between 1910 and 2000. The only change from the Historical Monuments Commission period is the inclusion of a [[padrão]] in the centre of the castle gateway, a symbol of the Portuguese 'discovery' of Africa and apparently symbolic of the inclusion of [[South-West Africa|South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) within the area of jurisdiction of the organisation.

== Offices ==
The Head Office of the National Monuments Council was in Cape Town and for most of its existence was the only base from which the organisation operated.
From the mid-1980s 'regional offices' were established. The first was in [[Pretoria]] to service the then Transvaal province and thereafter in the other two provinces of the time, the Orange Free State ([[Bloemfontein]]) and Natal (initially [[Durban]], but later [[Pietermaritzburg]]) provinces. The Cape Province came to be served by regional offices in [[Cape Town]] (Western Cape), [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] (Northern Cape) and [[Grahamstown]] (Eastern Cape). An office was also established in [[Windhoek]], the capital of the South African governed territory of [[South West Africa]].
Following the establishment of nine provinces in 1994 the boundaries of the regions served were brought into line with those of provinces and over the next few years what were now called 'provincial offices' were established in those provinces that did not yet have an office. With the coming into effect of the National Heritage Resources Act in 1999, the records and in some cases staff of these offices were taken over by [[Provincial heritage resources authority|provincial heritage resources authorities]].

== Funding ==

The National Monuments Council received the bulk of its funds as a transfer payment from the department of the Minister responsible for culture. For most of its history this was the Department of National Education, but after 1994 the Department of Arts, Culture Science and Technology. The organisation also administered a number of trust funds established for the care of particular sites or types of heritage and derived income from properties which it owned, most notably Dal Josaphat near [[Paarl]] in the Western Cape.

== Successor organisations ==
The following organisations are successors to the National Monuments Council:
* [[Amafa aKwaZulu-Natali]] ([[KwaZulu-Natal]] Province)
* Eastern Cape Provincial Heritage Resources Authority ([[Eastern Cape]] Province)
* Heritage Free State ([[Free State (province)|Free State]] Province)
* [[Heritage Western Cape]] ([[Western Cape]] Province)
* Limpopo Provincial Heritage Resources Authority ([[Limpopo]] Province)
* Mpumalanga Provincial Heritage Resources Authority ([[Mpumalanga]] Province)
* [[Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority]], ([[Northern Cape]] Province)
* [[National Heritage Council of Namibia]]
* North West Provincial Heritage Resources Authority ([[North West (South African province)|North West]] Province)
* Provincial Heritage Resources Authority Gauteng ([[Gauteng]] Province)
* [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]] (SAHRA)

In Namibia the National Heritage Council is the successor in all respects whereas in South Africa the National Heritage Resources Act, specifically, but not exclusively Sections11-13, 23–26 and 58 thereof, establish how responsibilities are divided between the [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]] and [[Provincial heritage resources authority|provincial heritage resources authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section 68, National Heritage Act , Government Notice 287, Government Gazette of the Republic of Namibia , No. 3361, Windhoek: 29 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nüshu''' ({{zh|t=女書|s=女书|p=Nǚshū {{noitalics|{{IPA-cmn|nỳʂú|}}}}|l=women's script}}), is a [[syllabary|syllabic script]] derived from [[Chinese character]]s that was used exclusively among women in [[Jiangyong County]] in [[Hunan]] province of southern [[China]].&lt;ref name="proposal"&gt;Proposal [http://www.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3287.pdf text], [http://www.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3340.pdf slides]), 2007-9-17&lt;/ref&gt; Nüshu has been included in the [[Unicode Standard]] since June 2017.

== Features ==

Unlike the standard [[Chinese written language|written Chinese]], which is [[Logogram|logographic]] (with each [[Chinese character|character]] representing a word or part of a word), Nüshu is [[phonetic]], with each of its approximately 600-700 characters representing a [[syllable]]. This is about half the number required to represent all the syllables in [[Shaozhou Tuhua|Tuhua]], as tonal distinctions are frequently ignored, making it "the most revolutionary and thorough simplification of Chinese characters ever attempted".&lt;ref name=sky&gt;Zhao Liming, "The Women's Script of Jiangyong". In Jie Tao, Bijun Zheng, Shirley L. Mow, eds, ''Holding up half the sky: Chinese women past, present, and future'', Feminist Press, 2004, pp. 39–52. {{ISBN|978-1-55861-465-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou Shuoyi, described as the only male to have mastered the script, compiled a dictionary listing 1,800 variant characters and allographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2004-09/23/content_2012172.htm |title=Last inheritress of China's female-specific languages dies |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2004-09-23 |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104181654/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2004-09/23/content_2012172.htm |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It have been suggested that, Nüshu characters appears to be an [[italic type|italic]] variant form of [[Kaishu]] Chinese characters,&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt; as can be seen in the name of the script, though some have been substantially modified to better fit [[embroidery]] patterns.{{CN|date=December 2017}} The strokes of the characters are in the form of dots, horizontals, [[Slash (punctuation)|virgules]], and arcs.&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt; The script is traditionally written in vertical columns running from right to left, but in modern contexts it may be written in horizontal lines from left to right, as is the case for Chinese. Unlike Chinese, Nüshu writers value characters written with very fine, almost threadlike, lines as a mark of fine penmanship.

About half of Nüshu is modified Chinese characters used logographically.{{Dubious|date=December 2010}} In about 100, the entire character is adopted with little change apart from skewing the frame from square to [[rhomboid]], sometimes reversing them (mirror image), and often reducing the number of strokes. Another hundred have been modified in their strokes, but are still easily recognizable, as is ''nü'' 'woman' above. About 200 have been greatly modified, but traces of the original Chinese character are still discernible.

The rest of the characters are phonetic. They are either modified characters, as above, or elements extracted from characters. There are used for 130 phonetic values, each used to write on average ten homophonous or nearly homophonous words, though there are allographs as well; women differed on which Chinese character they preferred for a particular phonetic value.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;

== History ==

It is not known when or how Nüshu came into being, but—because it is clearly based in the standard Chinese script, hanzi—Nüshu could not have been created before standardization of hanzi (circa 900).  Many of the simplifications found in Nüshu had been in informal use in standard Chinese since the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] dynasty (13th - 14th century). It seems to have reached its peak during the latter part of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911).&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;

Though a local educated worker at the Jiangyong Cultural Office (Zhou Shuoyi) had collected, studied and translated many Nüshu texts into standard Chinese, he was unable to draw outside attention to the script until a report was submitted to the central government on this subject in 1983.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

During the latter part of the 20th century, owing more to wider social, cultural and political changes than the narrow fact of greater access to hanzi literacy, younger girls and women stopped learning Nüshu, and it began falling into disuse, as older users died. The script was suppressed by the Japanese during their invasion of China in the 1930s-40s, because they feared that the Chinese could use it to send secret messages.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, and also during China's Cultural Revolution (1966–76).&lt;ref name="introduction"&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/resources/0521612357/3239_Ch12%20Additional%20text.pdf Additional text - Chapter 12], An Introduction to Language and Linguistics, Jeff Connor-Linton and Ralph Fasold, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-84768-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last original writers of the script died in the 1990s (the last one in 2004).

It is no longer customary for women to learn Nüshu, and literacy in Nüshu is now limited to a few scholars who learned it from the last women who were literate in it. However, after Yang Yueqing made a documentary about Nüshu, the [[government of the People's Republic of China]] started to popularize the effort to preserve the increasingly endangered script, and some younger women are beginning to learn it.

=== Recent years ===
[[file:NushuGarden.jpg|thumb|Nüshu Garden school, July 2005]]

[[Yang Huanyi]], an inhabitant of Jiangyong county, Hunan province and the last person proficient in this writing system, died on September 20, 2004, age 98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1312951,00.html |title=Language dies with woman |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date= 2004-09-26|accessdate=2012-10-03 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jon Watts |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1576488,00.html |title=Jon Watts, The forbidden tongue, The Guardian 23 September 2005 |publisher=Guardian |date= 2005-09-22|accessdate=2012-10-03 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language and locale have attracted foreign investment building up infrastructure at possible tourist sites and a [[US Dollar|$]]209,000 grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] to build a Nüshu museum scheduled to open in 2007. However, with the line of transmission now broken, there are fears that the features of the script are being distorted by the effort of marketing it for the tourist industry.{{or|date=April 2017}}

Chinese composer [[Tan Dun]] has created a multimedia symphony entitled "Nu Shu: The Secret Songs of Women" for Harp, Orchestra, and 13 microfilms. Tan Dun spent 5 years conducting field research in Hunan Province, documenting on film the various songs the women use to communicate. Those songs become a 3rd dimension to his symphony, and are projected alongside the orchestra and harp soloist.

[[Lisa See]] describes the use of Nüshu among 19th-century women in ''[[Snow Flower and the Secret Fan]]''.

== Adoption ==

The Nüshu script is used to write a distinct local [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese variety]] known as Xiangnan Tuhua (湘南土話, 'Southern Hunanese [[Shaozhou Tuhua|Tuhua]]') that is spoken by the people of the [[Xiao River]] and [[Yongming River]] region of northern Jiangyong County, Hunan.&lt;ref name="Zhao 2006 162"&gt;{{harvnb|Zhao|2006|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This dialect, which differs enough from those of other parts of Hunan that there is little [[mutual intelligibility]], is known to its speakers as {{IPA|[tifɯə]}} "Dong language." It is written only in the Nüshu script.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chiang|1995|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are differing opinions on the classification of Xiangnan Tuhua, as it has features of several different Chinese varieties. Some scholars classify it under [[Xiang Chinese]] or [[Pinghua]] and other scholars consider it a hybrid dialect.&lt;ref name="Zhao 2006 162"/&gt;  In addition to speaking Tuhua, most local people in Jiangyong are bilingual in the Hunan dialect of [[Southwestern Mandarin]], which they use for communication with people from outside the area where Tuhua is spoken, as well as for some formal occasions.&lt;ref name="Zhao 2006 162"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiang 1995 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Chiang|1995|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If Hunan Southwestern Mandarin is written, then it is always written using standard [[Chinese characters]] and not with the Nüshu script.&lt;ref name="Chiang 1995 22"/&gt;

Jiangyong County has a mixed population of [[Han Chinese]] and [[Yao people]], but Nüshu is used only to write the local Chinese dialect (Xiangnan Tuhua, 湘南土話), and there are no known examples of the script being used to write the local [[Hmong–Mien languages|Yao language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zhao|2006|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of the Nüshu works were "third day missives" ({{zh|t=三朝書 |s=三朝书 |p=sānzhāoshū |labels=no}}). They were cloth bound booklets created by [[laotong]], "sworn sisters" ({{zh|t=結拜姊妹 |s=结拜姊妹 |p=jiébàizǐmèi |labels=no}}) and mothers and given to their counterpart "sworn sisters" or daughters upon their marriage. They wrote down songs in Nüshu, which were delivered on the third day after the young woman's marriage. This way, they expressed their hopes for the happiness of the young woman who had left the village to be married and their sorrow for being parted from her.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4356095/ A language by women, for women], Washington Post, Feb 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works, including poems and lyrics, were handwoven into belts and straps, or embroidered onto everyday items and clothing.

'''''One More Time with Feeling''''' is a 2016 British [[documentary film]] directed by [[Andrew Dominik]]. It documents the recording of [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]' sixteenth studio album, ''[[Skeleton Tree]]'', in the aftermath of the death of [[Nick Cave]]'s 15-year-old son Arthur.

==Background==
[[Nick Cave]]{{'}}s 15-year-old son Arthur died after an accidental cliff fall at the Ovingdean Gap in [[Brighton]], England in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/15/nick-cave-son-arthur-dies-brighton-chalk-cliff-fall|title=Nick Cave's son dies after Bright chalk cliffs fall &amp;#124; UK news|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|last1=Elgot|last2=Khomami|first1=Jessica|first2=Nadia|date=15 July 2015|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Arthur's death, Cave was partway through recording sessions for ''[[Skeleton Tree]]'', the sixteenth studio album by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2016/09/12/493631808/all-songs-1-a-devastating-new-film-about-nick-cave|title=All Songs +1: A Devastating New Film About Nick Cave|website=[[All Songs Considered]] ''([[NPR]])''|publisher=National Public Radio|last1=Boilen|first1=Bob|author-link1=Bob Boilen|date=12 September 2016|access-date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''One More Time with Feeling'' documents the final production process of ''Skeleton Tree'', in the aftermath of the death of Nick Cave's son Arthur. The film includes 35&amp;nbsp;minutes of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds performing at [[Associated Independent Recording|Air Studios]] in London in early 2016&amp;nbsp;during the final recording sessions for the album, as well as director [[Andrew Dominik]]{{'}}s interviews with Cave, band member [[Warren Ellis (musician)|Warren Ellis]] and Cave's wife Susie Bick.&lt;ref name="iw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/08/nick-cave-documentary-one-more-time-with-feeling-andrew-dominik-venice-film-festival-2016-1201720338|title=Nick Cave's Tragedy and the Very Beautiful Music Documentary: An Interview With 'One More Time With Feeling' Director Andrew Dominik|website=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|last1=Thompson|first1=Anne|date=29 August 2016|access-date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also features "intermittent narration and improvised rumination" from Cave throughout.&lt;ref name="pf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/65778-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds-announce-new-album-skeleton-tree|title=Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds Announce New Album, ''Skeleton Tree''|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|last1=Lozano|last2=Monroe|first1=Kevin|first2=Jazz|date=2 June 2016|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Production==
Principal production for ''One More Time with Feeling'' started in February 2016&amp;nbsp;and the entire film was shot over the course of 10&amp;nbsp;days with a crew of seven people.&lt;ref name="iw" /&gt; The film was shot in both [[black and white]] and in color and in both 2D and [[3D film|3D]],&lt;ref name="pf" /&gt; with two specialist 3D technicians.&lt;ref name="iw" /&gt; Dominik originally intended to shoot the film as "a performance based concept", but it became "something much more significant" as he began conducting interviews during filming.&lt;ref name="pf" /&gt; The decision to conduct interviews and introduce non-musical elements was "completely improvised" by Dominik during principal production. Interviews with Nick Cave and Susie Bick were filmed in both London and Brighton.&lt;ref name="iw" /&gt;

Dominik and Cave had an agreement where Dominik could film at any time and ask Cave any question, provided that "if there was anything [Cave] didn't like he could cut it out". Several "emotional" scenes of the film were edited out due to Dominik's "confusion [on] how to deal with the subject" and for fear that they were "exploitative in some way". The portions of the film featuring Cave's narration and voiceovers were recorded on his [[iPhone]] after filming was completed. Several hours of his personal recordings were sent to Dominik via [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]; Dominik edited the recordings and "built sequences around pieces" of them.&lt;ref name="iw" /&gt;

Cave both commissioned and financed ''One More Time with Feeling'' himself in order to avoid conducting interviews about ''Skeleton Tree'' and his son's death with the media. According to Dominik, Cave was not expecting to profit from the film's release and "his best hope [was] to break even."&lt;ref name="iw" /&gt;

The film's title was lifted from the lyrics of ''Magneto'', a song from [[Skeleton Tree]].

==Release==
''One More Time with Feeling'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on 5&amp;nbsp;September 2016. It received a general worldwide release in 850&amp;nbsp;theatres on 8 September, the day before Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released ''Skeleton Tree''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asff.co.uk/nick-cave-bad-seeds-one-time-feeling-launches-cinemas-worldwide|title=Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' One More Time with Feeling Launches in Cinemas Worldwide|website=''[[Aesthetica Short Film Festival]]''|publisher=[[Aesthetica]]|date=2 August 2016|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended to be a one-night-only event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-album-skeleton-tree-music-documentary-trailer-one-more-time-with-feeling-a7169576.html|title=Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds release trailer for music documentary One More Time With Feeling|website=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print|last1=Stolworthy|first1=Jason|date=3 August 2016|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; additional screenings were added until 11&amp;nbsp;September due to demand in certain locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickcave.com/news/skeleton-tree-now|title=Skeleton Tree Out Now + I Need You Video|website=''[[Nick Cave]]''|date=8 September 2016|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Palin''''' ({{lang-my|ပလ္လင်}}; from {{lang-pi|pallaṅka}}, lit. "couch" or "sofa") refers to one of six types of [[Throne|thrones]] recognized in traditional Burmese scholarship. The ''palin'' is a major symbol of the Burmese monarchy and feature prominently in Burmese architecture and Burmese Buddhist iconography. The ''palin'' is featured on the seal of Myanmar's [[Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture (Myanmar)|Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture]].

== Types of ''palin'' ==
Traditional Burmese scholarship recognizes six types of thrones, namely:

# ''Aparājitapallaṅka'' ({{my|အပရာဇိတပလ္လင်​}}) - the [[Buddha]]'s throne
# ''Kamalāsanapallaṅka'' ({{my|ကမလာသနပလ္လင်​}}) - [[Brahma]]'s throne
# ''Dibbāsanapallaṅka'' ({{my|ဒိဗ္ဗာသနပလ္လင်}}) - [[Nat (spirit)|nat]]'s throne
# ''Rājapallaṅka'' ({{my|ရာဇပလ္လင်}}) - monarch's throne
# ''Dhammāsanapallaṅka'' ({{my|ဓမ္မာသနပလ္လင်}}) - [[Buddhist monk]]'s throne
# ''Aṭṭakaraṇapallaṅka'' ({{my|အဋ္ဋကရဏပလ္လင်​}}) - [[judge]]'s throne

== Usage by Burmese monarchs ==
[[File:Lion throne, Mandalay Palace.jpg|thumb|The Lion Throne at [[Mandalay Palace]] in 1903.]]
In pre-colonial times, the ''rājapallaṅka'' (Burmese ''yazapalin'') seated the sovereign and his main consort. Traditionally, Burmese palaces possessed eight types of thrones, housed in nine palace halls, leading to the Burmese adage, "eight thrones, 9 palace halls" (ပလ္လင်ရှစ်ခန်း ရွှေနန်းကိုးဆောင်). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.mm/npe/?q=news/8/03/2016/id-38407|title=ယဉ်ကျေးမှု ထုံးဓလေ့ဟောင်း တို့နိုင်ငံသားတို့မမေ့ကောင်း|last=|first=|date=|website=Myanmar News Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Queen Supayalat and King Thibaw.jpg|thumb|[[King Thibaw]] and Queen [[Supayalat]] on the Lion Throne at [[Mandalay Palace]]]]

The ''palin'' is also used to seat images and statues of the Buddha, variously called ''gaw palin'' (ဂေါ့ပလ္လင်), ''phaya palin'' (ဘုရားပလ္လင်) or ''samakhan'' (စမ္မခဏ်), from the Pali term ''sammakhaṇḍa''. This ''palin'' is a feature of many Buddhist household shrines in Burma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9568">The phrase '''pathetic fallacy''' is a literary term for the attributing of human emotion and conduct to things found in nature that are not human. It is a kind of [[personification]] that occurs in poetic descriptions, when, for example, clouds seem sullen, when leaves dance, or when rocks seem indifferent. The British cultural critic [[John Ruskin]] coined the term in his book, ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843–60).&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'' Second Edition (2005). Thomas Mautner, Editor. p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.H. |last=Abrams |first2=G.G. |last2=Harpham |year=2011 |origyear=1971 |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning |isbn=9780495898023 |lccn=2010941195 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA269 |page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th Edition (1988), volume 9, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the phrase==
[[File:Millais Ruskin.jpg|thumb|right|''John Ruskin'' at Glenfinlas, Scotland (1853–54), by [[John Everett Millais]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886970 Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinlas], ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 138, No. 1117, pp. 228–234, April 1996. (Accessed via JSTOR, UK.)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ruskin coined the term "pathetic fallacy" to attack the sentimentality that was common to the poetry of the late 18th century, and which was rampant among poets including Burns, Blake, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats. Wordsworth supported this use of personification based on emotion by claiming that "objects ... derive their influence not from properties inherent in them ... but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by these objects."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpcVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=wordsworth%22affected+by+these+objects%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-yDhTnGaI&amp;sig=Cr7njaPNNTrYcta6IRG7vpu7lZU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI8cei3OyexwIVC9UeCh2w6Qen#v=onepage&amp;q=wordsworth%22affected%20by%20these%20objects%22&amp;f=false Wordsworth, William.  Knight, William Angus, editor. ''The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth, Volume 4''.] W Paterson (1883) page 199&lt;/ref&gt; However Tennyson, in his own poetry, began to refine and diminish such expressions, and introduced an emphasis on what might be called a more scientific comparison of objects in terms of sense perception.  The old order was beginning to be replaced by the new just as Ruskin addressed the matter, and the use of the pathetic fallacy markedly began to disappear. As a critic, Ruskin proved influential and is credited with having helped to refine poetic expression.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', Alex Preminger, Ed., Princeton University Press, 1974 {{ISBN|0-691-01317-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term has changed significantly from the idea Ruskin had in mind.&lt;ref name="Fowler1994"&gt;{{cite book |first=H.W. |last=Fowler |year=1994 |origyear=1926 |title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage |series=Wordsworth Collection |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |isbn=9781853263187 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4HI0RQIDK0C&amp;pg=PA425 |page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruskin's original definition is "emotional falseness", or the falseness that occurs to one's perceptions when influenced by violent or heightened emotion.  For example, when a person is unhinged by grief, the clouds might seem darker than they are, or perhaps mournful or perhaps even uncaring.&lt;ref name="Ruskin1856vIIIpt4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruskin |first=John |chapter=Of the Pathetic Fallacy |title=Modern Painters, |volume=volume iii |at=pt. 4 |year=1856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurwit1982"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Palm Trees and the Pathetic Fallacy in Archaic Greek Poetry and Art |first=Jeffrey M. |last=Hurwit |journal=The Classical Journal |volume=77 |number=3 |year=1982 |pages=193–199 |publisher=The Classical Association of the Middle West and South |jstor=3296969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other changes to Ruskin's phrase since he coined it: The particular definition that Ruskin used for the word ''fallacy'' has since become obsolete.  The word ''fallacy'' nowadays is defined as an example of a flawed logic, but for Ruskin and writers of the 19th century and earlier, "fallacy" could be used to mean simply a "falseness".&lt;ref&gt;"Fallacy". ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. 1st ed. 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the word ''pathetic'' simply meant for Ruskin "emotional" or "pertaining to emotion".&lt;ref&gt;"Pathetic". ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. 1st ed. 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting aside Ruskin's original intentions, and despite this linguistic 'rocky road', the two-word phrase has survived, though with a significantly altered meaning.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', Alex Preminger, Ed., Princeton University Press, 1974 {{ISBN|0-691-01317-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Ruskin's original meaning==
[[Image:Crocus-angustifolius.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A yellow ''Crocus angustifolius'' known as Cloth-of-gold crocus. (''Curtis's Botanical Magazine'', 1803)]]
In his essay, Ruskin demonstrates his original meaning by offering lines of a poem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;They rowed her in across the rolling foam—
The cruel, crawling foam...&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin then points out that "the foam is not cruel, neither does it crawl. The state of mind which attributes to it these characters of a living creature is one in which the reason is unhinged by grief"—yet, Ruskin did not disapprove of this use of the pathetic fallacy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, so long as we see that the feeling is true, we pardon, or are even pleased by, the confessed fallacy of sight, which it induces: we are pleased, for instance, with those lines ... above quoted, not because they fallaciously describe foam, but because they faithfully describe sorrow.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Ruskin, J., "Of the Pathetic Fallacy", Modern Painters vol. III part 4. (1856)[http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/ruskinj/note/004.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin intended that pathetic fallacy may also refer to any "untrue" quality: as in the description of a [[crocus]] as "gold", when the flower is, according to Ruskin, saffron in color.&lt;ref name="Ruskin1856vIIIpt4"/&gt;

The following, a stanza from the poem "Maud" (1855) by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], demonstrates what John Ruskin, in ''Modern Painters'', said was an "exquisite" instance of the use of the pathetic fallacy:&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
'''MAUD'''

There has fallen a splendid tear
  From the passion-flower at the gate.
She is coming, my dove, my dear;
  She is coming, my life, my fate.
The red rose cries, "She is near, she is near;"
  And the white rose weeps, "She is late;"
The larkspur listens, "I hear, I hear;"
  And the lily whispers, "I wait." (Part 1, ''XXII'', 10)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Science==
In science, the term "pathetic fallacy" is used in a pejorative way in order to discourage the kind of figurative speech in descriptions that might not be strictly accurate and clear, and that might communicate a false impression of a natural phenomenon. An example is the metaphorical phrase "[[Horror vacui (physics)|Nature abhors a vacuum]]", which contains the suggestion that nature is capable of abhorring something. There are more accurate and scientific ways to describe nature and vacuums.

Another example of a pathetic fallacy is the expression, "Air hates to be crowded, and, when compressed, it will try to escape to an area of lower pressure." It is not accurate to suggest that air "hates" anything or "tries" to do anything. One way to express the ideas that underlie that phrase in a more scientific manner can be found and described in the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases: effusion or  movement towards lower pressure occurs because unobstructed gas molecules will become more evenly distributed between high- and low-pressure zones, by a flow from the former to the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Bronowski, Jacob. ''The Common Sense of Science''. Faber &amp; Faber. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biltoft, Benapfl, and Swain. ''Vacuum Technology 60A &amp; 60B, Chapter 3: Review of Basic Vacuum Calculations''. Las Positas College. Fall 2002. [http://lpc1.clpccd.cc.ca.us/lpc/tswain/chapt3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/318183/kinetic-theory-of-gases Encyclopædia Britannica online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postmodern Marketing''' is a term derived from [[postmodern]] philosophical movements where there are cultural tendencies of inherent suspicion towards a global cultural narrative or meta-narrative.  Postmodern marketing takes this same philosophical perspective and applies it to the way [[advertising]] initiatives are handled in the current post-World War II era.  Postmodern marketing is approaching or has passed through a new era in [[advertising]], [[Brand management|branding]], and strategic [[brand]] thinking.&lt;ref name="dmarson-pg226"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Well Encyclopedia of Management |last=Marson |first=David J. |year=2011 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |location=Malden, Mass. |isbn= 978-0-631-23317-6 |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern marketing is inherently focused on customized experiences where broad market generalizations are no-longer applied or implemented on behalf of branded communications.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Postmodern Marketing?",|last=Brown |first=Steven |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 27 Iss: 4|pages=19–34 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the technique requires marketers to remove "new aged adlandia" trends and developments to focus on how the consumer prefers to be messaged to.

As a result, the ad aged "art and science" debate around [[creativity|creative]], [[Advertising#Media|media]], [[marketing]] and [[Brand management|branding]] are put to an end.  With a postmodern marketing approach a one-to-one communication is created between real humans, controlling real mouses, real computers, real keyboards and real [[mobile telephones]].

== Origins ==
The development of postmodern marketing is built on the foundations of modern marketing (with analysis, planning, implementation and control deeply rooted in its process).&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;   Postmodern marketing however, acts more of a collection of approaches in the need to stay nimble, reactive and able to engage and shift with consumers from a non-definitive point of view.  Postmodern marketing saw great acceptance in the early 1990s with the emerging developments of the [[Splinternet]] and marketers realization that "traditional" strategic practices like Porters five forces, the Wheel of Retailing, and the Boston Matrix had become outdated and not able to keep up with or report on consumer media habits, creative tone, and umbrella [[Brand management|branding]] techniques.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;   As a result, postmodern marketing was born.

== Three Categories of Postmodern Marketing ==
Although the exact origins of the term is unknown, scholarly reports date the defining of the movement to the early 1990s by the "European Journal of Marketing" author Stephen Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/fast-company-staff/fast-company-blog/post-modern-marketing |title=Post-Modern Marketing |publisher=FastCompany.com |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his findings, postmodern marketing is made up of three distinct categories (1) the idea of change, new, and complex, (2) sub-discipline of consumer research, and (3) marketing practices and research methodologies.   Furthermore, as Brown implies, one who approaches marketing from postmodern style should in many ways reject attempts to impost order and working in silos.  Instead markers should work collectively from with "artistic" attributes of intuition, creativity, spontaneity, speculation, emotion and involvement.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;

=== The Idea of Change, New and Complex ===

The idea of change is a deeply rooted philosophy when studying postmodern marketing.  When planning and strategizing within the "new now" or the "new new now" of media, technical services and creative styling a practitioner within the space must be comfortable with new and more complex systems and created worlds, platform and messaging structures.  Fundamentally grounded on dramatic political and economic pressures the changing landscape illustrated the need to be nimble, direct and personalized communication and a high concern for [[personally identifiable information]].&lt;ref name="styler"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unspeakable: Discourse, Dialogue, and Rhetoric in the Postmodern World (Rhetoric of Human Sciences) |last=Tyler |first=Stephen J. |year=1987 |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Pr |location= Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-299-11274-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sub-discipline of Consumer Research ===

To adjust with shifts in consumer consumption habits, postmodern [[marketing]] has created new disciplines to better sample, survey and poll target [[consumer group]] to better align with habit, preference and beliefs.  Many call this shift a "naturalistic" or interpretive" approach,  which mainly emerged from the control of non-renewable resources.

=== Marketing Practices and Research Methodologies ===

Outcomes of redefined consumer research studies are newly defined approaches to marketing and media disciplines.  Although some of these disciplines may be out dated, they illustrate core differences between postmodern marketing and modern marketing methodologies.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;

These approaches to marketing suggest that the role of a [[brand manager]], digital agency, creative, [[media planner]], account director, etc. is only defined by the [[company culture|company's culture]] that they in.  Hence, a postmodern marketer is one who approaches marketing and advertising campaigns with a "thinker marker" mentality.  Where they pull in and emphasize the need for creative relevance, companion [[Advertising#Media|media]], collateral activation, social engagement, and most importantly have the means to pull it all together.  Many believe that a postmodern marketing approach creates greater efficiencies, order, opportunity and a chance to gain real world insights from the perspective of the consumer.  As a result, postmodern [[marketing]] like postmodernality stands as a transitory phase in 21st centuryvertising and has ushered in an era of styles and nimble techniques.

== Myths ==
Postmodern marketing is not the same as "non-traditional" or [[digital marketing]]. It is instead made up only of new aged media engagements brought about by the developments like that of the iPad.

Social media belongs to the young.  According to Sean Carton writer of ClickZ, the idea of social media belonging to only the young is, "Baloney".  With the accelerated growth of account activation amongst the 55+ age cohort according to leading marketing research firms like [[Forrester Research|Forrester]], [[eMarketer]], [[comScore]] and [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]], the idea of social media belonging to only the young Republicans is an inaccurate statement of fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/1709224/-post-modern-marketing-myths-busted |title=Postmodern Marketing Myths: Busted |publisher=ClickZ.com |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions ==
According to many scholastic journals, postmodern marketing hinges on and has aided to the development of many changes to the current marketing model.  Some of the more renowned conditions that postmodern marketing is known to influence and disrupt are :&lt;ref name="ffuat-pg40"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Marketing In  Postmodern World",|last=Fuat |first=Firat |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 29 Iss: 1|pages=40–56 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Hyper reality:''' Relating to simulations or simulated experiences.  Tourist attractions, amusement parks and "subculture" vacation destinations are known for their ability in creating hyper-real "immersive worlds".
* '''Fragmentation:''' Adheres to many marketing disciplines.  These being media space, consumer attention, consumption habits, and communication/messaging strategies.
* '''Reversals of production and consumption:''' A condition that occurs when the roles of consumer and marketer change.  This is when consumers become "brand ambassadors" for a company and voice concern, opinion and align their beliefs with that of the brand through a number of traditional and non-traditional media channels.
* '''Decentering of the subject:''' Occurs when a brand personifies the product or service being marketed.  As a result, the promoted item become a "Hero" or a new-age savior.
* '''Paradoxical juxtaposition:''' The ultimate state of postmodern marketing.  This condition allows consumers and brand managers to act in the moment and adjust to changing landscapes, tone, pressure, and emotional cues.  As a result, they are able to represent a different self-image and avoid moments of conformity to single, set brand guidelines, perceived reputations and roles.
* '''Loss of commitment:'''  An outcome of many postmodern marketing experiences can result in loss of commitment amongst brand ambassadors and loyalists.  This is usually driven from the inability for brand managers to adhere to or recreate the level of consumer engagement needed retain the same level of consumer interest and interaction.

Norquest additionally reconstructs six onsets suggesting [[consonant cluster]]s: {{IPA|*pl, *fj, *lj, *ɾj, *tʃʰw, *ŋ̊w}}. Whether these were actual consonant clusters is not clear. The clusters with a glide as a second member may have been [[Coarticulation|coarticulated]] consonants: [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] {{IPA|*fʲ, *lʲ, *ɾʲ}}, [[Labialization|labialized]] {{IPA|*tʃʰʷ, *ŋ̊ʷ}}, while *pl may have arisen from a sesquisyllable *p-l.

Norquest also reconstructs six bisyllabic root shapes:
* *Ci + glottal: *Ciʔ-, *Ciɦ-
* *Cu + glottal: *Cuʔ-, *Cuɦ-
* *Cu + rhotic: *Cuɾ-, *Cur-
Pretonic syllables are later lost in all Hlai languages, but in these six combinations, they trigger in some languages conditional developments of the tonic syllable's onset consonant, allowing them to be distinguished in reconstruction.

In Ostapirat's (2004) reconstruction, Proto-Hlai forms can be both monosyllabic and disyllabic. Some disyllabic forms have medial consonants beginning with three penultimate vowels (*u-, *i-, *a-; the last of which is default). Vowels can also combine with *-i or *-u to form diphthongs. Tones (*A, *B, *C, *D) are also reconstructed.

In the table below, Proto-Hlai consonants marked as green can occur at the end of syllables.

There is a total of 4-5 Proto-Hlai vowels in Norquest's reconstruction (Norquest 2007:238). Ostapirat (2004) reconstructs 5 vowels, which are /a, ə, i, ɨ, u/.

==Sound changes==
:''For further information about the Pre-Hlai language as reconstructed by Norquest (2007), [[Proto-Tai language#Proto-Southern Kra-Dai]]''.
The transition from [[Proto-Tai language#Proto-Southern Tai–Kadai|Pre-Hlai]] (the predecessor of the Proto-Hlai language ancestral to both [[Hlai language|Hlai]] and [[Jiamao language|Jiamao]]) to Proto-Hlai involved the following series of sound changes (Norquest 2007:308). (''Order follows that of the table of contents – not intended to be sequential'')

# Elimination of Uvulars – loss of Pre-Hlai uvulars *q, *C-q, *C-ɢ
# Intervocalic Lenition – -p- &gt; -ʋ-, -t- &gt; -ɾ-, -k- &gt; -ɦ-, etc.
# Initial Devoicing – loss of voiced fricatives, etc.
# Vocalic Transfer – vowel in penultimate syllable moved to last syllable
# Initial Aspiration
# Monosyllabification – Pre-Hlai, which was sesquisyllabic, was reduced to monosyllabic forms in Proto-Hlai.
# Stop and Fricative Affrication – ʈʰ &gt; tʃʰ, cʰ &gt; tɕʰ, etc.
# Peripheral Vowel Raising – e(:C) &gt; i(:C), o(:C) &gt; u(:C), ɛ:(C) &gt; e:(C), ɔC &gt; oC
# Monophthongization – *ɯa(C) &gt; *ɯə(C) &gt; *ɯ:(C), *o:y &gt; *wi: &gt; *i:

Or, in the sequential order given in Norquest (2007:416-417), which excludes monophthongization:
# Intervocalic lenition
# Elimation of uvulars
# Peripheral vowel raising
# Initial devoicing
# Vocalic Transfer
# Initial aspiration
# Monosyllabification
# Stop and fricative affrication

After evolving from Pre-Hlai, Proto-Hlai initials went through 4 main types of sound changes (Norquest 2007:66).
#Temporal compression – reduction of constituents in the syllable; most common
#Gesture reduction
#Onset fortition – change to initial aspiration, etc.
#Systemic realignment – mergers, etc.

After the breakup of Proto-Hlai, the following sound changes occurred in various Hlai branches.
#Devoicing
#Registrogenesis – creation of tone registers (i.e., register splits); most likely influenced by Hainanese [[Min Chinese]]

The following table gives the reflexes of the onset consonants in the Hlai languages, as well as Norquest and Ostapirat's reconstructions:

== Notes ==
# Introduced by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, National Farmers' Day was organized as a day’s activity for the nation to honor its hard working [[farmer]]s who excelled in their contribution to improve the [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector with certificates and prizes.  In 1988, the first Friday of every December was set aside by the [[government]] as ''Farmers' Day'' and is celebrated as a statutory Public Holiday.
# With  the exception of Farmers' Day which is always on a Friday, when these dates fall at the weekend, the following Monday tends to be declared a holiday.
# The Founder's day is celebrated in commemoration of the birthday of [[Kwame Nkrumah|Dr. Kwame Nkrumah]], the first President of Ghana.
Public holidays are not mandatory for all institutions/organizations in Ghana. Institutions/organizations that are exempt include; The Ghana National Fire Service, food vendors,some category of hotels, health service providers such as hospitals, dealers in pharmaceutical products etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3918">'''Roads to You''' is the name of a continued series of cultural workshops intended to promote peace and tolerance through music. The program was founded by [[Jordan]]ian composer and pianist [[Zade Dirani]].
[[File:Roads to you logo.jpg|thumb|Zade's Roads to You]]

==Origins==
In the wake of the tragic attacks of [[September 11th attacks|9/11]], Zade was moved to do something positive to promote peace in the wake of such a tragedy. He began a series of house concerts in a "humble grassroots effort to create a better understanding of his culture in the West."&lt;ref name="RoadstoYouTour"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=2772
|title= Celebration of One World|publisher=adc.org|accessdate=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years and several performances later, Zade became interested in how to continue the positive momentum of the concerts. He turned his focus to how musicians, from all different nations, can work together to be global leaders and ambassadors of peace. This idea was the inception of [[The Zade Foundation]], and ultimately the ''Roads to You'' tour.

==Workshops and Educational Partnerships==
The educational partnerships are an extension of ''Roads to You'' beyond the concert hall and into the homes and schools of the communities.

The educational workshops provide insight into the evolution of the various cultures and their development to current day standing, and helps explain the source of conflict in war-torn regions while jointly exploring possibilities of conflict resolution. The hope is to educate and inspire audiences and students by making this cultural and historical information accessible to students, their families and their communities.

==House Concerts==
''Roads to You'' musicians perform and share their cultural heritage with audiences in house concerts. They are often in collaboration with community leaders and partners.&lt;ref name="workshops"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_April_14/ai_n26830324/

==Tour==
Officially launched in May 2006 in partnership with [[Berklee College of Music]], and [[Seeds of Peace]], and sponsored by a host of community organizations including The Barakat Foundation, The Boniuk Center for Religious Tolerance at Rice University,&lt;ref name="workshops"/&gt; The Center for Interfaith Relations in Louisville, KY,&lt;ref name="RoadsLouisville"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bubeat.blogspot.com/2006/10/zade-dirianis-roads-to-you-to-come-to.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Mohammad Ali Center, among others, the ''Roads to You'' tour brought the same concept of promoting peace and understanding that the original house concerts did, but at a much larger scale. Roads to You held over 100 workshops in addition to several performances in 2006.&lt;ref name="workshops"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jordanembassyus.org/new/pr/pr03082006.shtml

'''Satya Pir''' ({{lang-bn|সত্যপীর}}) is a belief system found in [[Bengal]] created by the fusion of [[Islam]] and local religions. Experts maintain that the Muslim ''Satya Pir'' and the [[Hindu]] [[Satyanarayan Puja]] essentially represent the same beliefs and rituals.&lt;ref name=pedia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karim|first1=Abdul|title=Satya Pir|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Satya_Pir|website=Banglapedia|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A century ago in Bengal, the ritual called, pujah was mainly performed by Hindu women and was interchangeably called Satya pir Pujah or Satya Narayan pujah.

According to the author, Dwijendra Nath Neogi, some  Muslims  at that time also performed the pujah. The author gives alternate theories as to how Pir and Narayan got associated. In one theory, he proposes that Brahmins during the Islamic era  in Bengal changed Narayan into Pir in order for the Muslims to believe that they were worshipping an Islamic saint. The other theory says the worship started as that of a Muslim saint or Pir and later the Pir was changed into Narayan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neogi|first1=Dwijendra Nath|title=Sacred Tales of India|date=1916|publisher=MacMillan &amp; Company|location=London , UK|pages=95–100|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=NU4qAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=satya+pir+narayan+ritual&amp;ots=llvGX0F3PX&amp;sig=epDPptySUj2pLIVXkQzosCkjsOU#v=onepage&amp;q=pir&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In folklores, Narayan and Pir get mixed such as one supplicant will address him as Satya Narayana, implying that he is an avatar of Krishna, while another one in a different tale will be told that Satya Pir has just come from Mecca, which would make him Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Darla|title=Fabulous Females and Peerless Pirs: Tales of Mad Adventure in Old Benga|journal=Journal of Folklore Research Reviews,  -|date=2006|url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/jfrr/article/view/2405/2281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Uddin|first1=S|last2=Raj|first2=S|last3=Harman|first3=W|title=Dealing with Deities: The Ritual Vow in South Asia - Chapter 6 In  the company of Pirs: Making vows, receiving favors at Bangladeshi Sufi Shrines -|date=2006|publisher=State University of New York, Albany , NY, USA|location=Albany, NY, USA|isbn=0-7914-6707-4|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=h80yOTwlAUcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=satya+pir+narayan&amp;ots=DmTlx8Ma7W&amp;sig=pnHWV73SquPuT1OkcGOVolWX7WU#v=onepage&amp;q=satya%20pir%20narayan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Orissa, the state adjacent to Bengal,  Sufism gained popularity and led to the emergence of the Satya-Pir tradition.

'''''Shenkui''''' is a [[culture bound syndrome]] native to [[China]] in which the individual suffers somatic symptoms with anxiety, believed to be caused by a loss of semen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/culture-bound-syndromes-tf/ ]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wen Wang 1981"/&gt; And in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], shen (kidney) is the reservoir of vital essence in semen ([[Jing (Chinese medicine)|ching]]) and k’uei signifies deficiency.&lt;ref name="Wen Wang 1981"/&gt; In [[simplified Chinese]] it is called 肾亏, [[Traditional Chinese]] 腎虧, and in [[pinyin]] Shènkuī.

Shenkui or shen-k'uei is one of several Chinese culture-bound syndromes locally ascribed to loss (or fear of loss) of [[Yin and yang|Yang]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 陽). In [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], Shenkui is believed to result from a deficiency in yang, obtained through the loss of semen. Semen is believed to be "lost" through excessive sexual activity or masturbation, [[nocturnal emission]]s, "white urine" which is believed to [[spermaturia|contain semen]], or other mechanisms. Symptoms within the Chinese diagnostic system include dizziness, backache, tiredness, weakness, insomnia, frequent dreams, and complaints of sexual dysfunction (such as premature ejaculation or impotence). From an [[ethnopsychiatric]] perspective, additional symptoms are preoccupation with sexual performance, potential semen loss, and bodily complaints which may be taken as symptoms of lost yang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.mac.com/mccajor/cbs_smn.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231185015/http://homepage.mac.com/mccajor/cbs_smn.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 31, 2006 |accessdate=January 21, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Losing semen reduces Yang, causing an unbalance in the body. Nocturnal emissions, too much intercourse, and masturbation resulting in ejaculation lower the levels of semen, causing loss of Yang. Somatic symptoms may include body soreness, aches, lack of energy, fatigue, and possibly problems in sexual performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goleman |first=Daniel |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/05/science/making-room-on-the-couch-for-culture.html?sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Making Room on the Couch for Culture |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1995-12-05 |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person suffering form Shenkui may endure body aches, dizziness, tiredness, inability to sleep, and sexual dysfunction, all for which no physical cause can explain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2009/08/21/top-10-bizarre-cultural-disorders/ |title=Top 10 Bizarre Cultural Disorders |publisher=Listverse |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing of semen too often is avoided  because it is believed to be crucial to a person’s health and safety. It is believed to be life-threatening if too much semen is lost.&lt;ref name="quizletiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quizlet.com/2122697/culture-bound-syndromes-in-the-dsm-iv-tr-flash-cards/ |title=Culture-Bound Syndromes in the DSM-IV-TR flashcards |publisher=Quizlet |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Please don't cite someone's flashcards.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include:&lt;ref name="Wen Wang 1981"&gt;Wen Jung-Kwang, Wang Ching-Lun. Shen-k'uei syndrome: a culture-specific sexual neurosis in Taiwan. In: Kleinman A, Lin Tsung-yi, eds. Normal and abnormal behavior in Chinese cultures. Dordrecht, Reidel, 1981: 357- 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dizziness
* Backache
* Tiredness
* Weakness
* Insomnia
* Frequent dreams
* Sexual dysfunctions; premature ejaculation or impotence.

==Origin==
Chinese folk beliefs hold that the [[Yin and yang|Yin]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 陰) represents femininity, slow, cold, wet, passive, water, the moon, and nighttime. And that Yang represents masculinity, fast, dry, hot, aggressive, fire, the sun, and daytime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webspawner.com/users/pakli/crossculturalco.html |accessdate=January 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805130214/http://www.webspawner.com/users/pakli/crossculturalco.html |archivedate=August 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of yang would result in an abundance of Yin. It is also believed that if a case of Shenkui is severe enough, it could result in death. 
Informal or incomplete education about [[sexual health]] in China leaves a lot of room for folk beliefs to thrive. Often, advertisements support such beliefs to encourage use of traditional medicines. In Chinese folk beliefs, the loss of semen can cause imbalance in the body, leaving you with aches and pains and trouble performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=412460 |title= From Yang and Yin to and or but |author1= Charles E. Osgood |author2= Meredith Martin Richards |work= Language |volume=49 |date= June 1973 |pages=380–412 |publisher= [[Linguistic Society of America]] |doi=10.2307/412460 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Specific treatments are not mentioned. The affected person may go to a medical clinic that specializes in sexual health. If no medical problems are found, therapy may be used to help deal with stress, or anxiety medicines may be used.

Disorders, who they affect, and how they affect are different within each culture. In order to diagnose someone, it is necessary to make the effort to understand their home culture. Whether it is a culture bound syndrome or not, a person’s background determines how they see and interpret their own symptoms and how it must be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goleman |first=Daniel |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/05/science/making-room-on-the-couch-for-culture.html?sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Making Room on the Couch for Culture |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1995-12-05 |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12749">'''Speech science''' refers to the study of production, transmission and perception of [[speech]]. Speech science involves [[anatomy]], in particular the anatomy of the oro-facial region and [[neuroanatomy]], [[physiology]], and [[acoustics]].

==Speech production==
[[File:Gray962.png|thumb|right|150px|The cartilaginous passageways (the bronchi and bronchioles) of the lungs.&lt;ref name = "GA"&gt;[[Gray's Anatomy|Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body]]'', 20th ed. 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{main|Speech production}}
The production of speech is a highly complex motor task that involves approximately 100 orofacial, [[larynx|laryngeal]], [[pharyngeal muscles|pharyngeal]], and [[muscles of respiration|respiratory muscles]].&lt;ref name="Simonyan 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simonyan K, Horwitz B |title=Laryngeal motor cortex and control of speech in humans |journal=Neuroscientist |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=197–208 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21362688 |pmc=3077440 |doi=10.1177/1073858410386727 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levelt 1989"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Levelt | first1 = Willem J. M. | title = Speaking : from intention to articulation | date = 1989 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-262-12137-8 | oclc = 18136175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Precise and expeditious timing of these muscles is essential for the production of temporally complex speech sounds, which are characterized by transitions as short as 10 ms between frequency bands&lt;ref name="Fitch 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitch RH, Miller S, Tallal P |title=Neurobiology of speech perception |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=20 |issue= |pages=331–53 |year=1997 |pmid=9056717 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.20.1.331 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an average speaking rate of approximately 15 sounds per second. Speech production requires airflow from the lungs ([[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) to be phonated through the [[vocal fold]]s of the larynx ([[phonation]]) and resonated in the vocal cavities shaped by the [[jaw]], [[soft palate]], [[lip]]s, [[tongue]] and other articulators ([[articulation (anatomy)|articulation]]).

===Respiration===
{{main|Respiration (physiology)}}

Respiration is the physical process of gas exchange between an organism and its environment involving four steps ([[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]], distribution, [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio|perfusion]] and diffusion) and two processes (inspiration and expiration). [[Respiratory system|Respiration]] can be described as the mechanical process of air flowing into and out of the [[lung]]s on the principle of [[Boyle's law]], stating that, as the volume of a container increases, the air pressure will decrease. This relatively negative pressure will cause air to enter the container until the pressure is equalized. During [[inhalation|inspiration]] of air, the diaphragm contracts and the lungs expand drawn by [[pleural cavity|pleurae]] through surface tension and negative pressure. When the lungs expand, air pressure becomes negative compared to atmospheric pressure and air will flow from the area of higher pressure to fill the lungs. Forced inspiration for speech uses accessory muscles to elevate the [[rib cage]] and enlarge the [[thoracic cavity]] in the vertical and lateral dimensions. During forced expiration for speech, muscles of the [[Trunk (anatomy)|trunk]] and [[abdomen]] reduce the size of the thoracic cavity by compressing the abdomen or pulling the rib cage down forcing air out of the lungs.

===Phonation===
{{main|Phonation}}
Phonation is the production of a periodic sound wave by vibration of the [[vocal folds]]. Airflow from the lungs, as well as [[larynx|laryngeal]] muscle contraction, causes movement of the vocal folds. It is the properties of tension and elasticity that allow the vocal folds to be stretched, bunched, brought together and separated. During prephonation, the vocal folds move from the abducted to [[Larynx#Intrinsic|adducted position]]. [[Articulatory phonetics#Components|Subglottal pressure]] builds and air flow forces the folds apart, inferiorly to superiorly. If the volume of airflow is constant, the velocity of the flow will increase at the area of constriction and cause a decrease in pressure below once distributed. This negative pressure will pull the initially blow open folds back together again. The cycle repeats until the vocal folds are abducted to inhibit phonation or to take a breath.

===Articulation===
{{main|Manner of articulation}}

In a third process of speech production, articulation, mobile and immobile structures of the face (articulators) adjust the shape of the [[mouth]], [[pharynx]] and nasal cavities ([[vocal tract]]) as the vocal fold vibration sound passes through producing varying resonant frequencies.

===Central nervous control===

The analysis of brain lesions and the correlation between lesion locations and behavioral deficits were the most important sources of knowledge about the cerebral mechanisms underlying speech production for many years.&lt;ref name="Huber 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huber P, Gutbrod K, Ozdoba C, Nirkko A, Lövblad KO, Schroth G |title=[Aphasia research and speech localization in the brain] |language=German |journal=Schweiz Med Wochenschr |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=49–59 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10683880 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rorden 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rorden C, Karnath HO |title=Using human brain lesions to infer function: a relic from a past era in the fMRI age? |journal=Nat.

More recently, the results of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]], provide growing evidence that complex human skills are not primarily located in highly specialized brain areas (e.g., [[Broca's area]]) but are organized in networks connecting several different areas of both hemispheres instead. Functional neuroimaging identified a complex neural network underlying speech production including cortical and subcortical areas, such as the [[supplementary motor area]], [[Cingulate cortex|cingulate]] motor areas, [[primary motor cortex]], [[basal ganglia]], and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name="Riecker 2005"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Riecker A, Mathiak K, Wildgruber D, etal |title=fMRI reveals two distinct cerebral networks subserving speech motor control |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=700–6 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15728295 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000152156.90779.89 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sörös 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sörös P, Sokoloff LG, Bose A, McIntosh AR, Graham SJ, Stuss DT |title=Clustered functional MRI of overt speech production |journal=NeuroImage |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=376–87 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16631384 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.02.046 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speech perception==
{{main|Speech perception}}

Speech perception refers to the understanding of speech. The beginning of the process towards understanding speech is first hearing the message that is spoken. The [[auditory system]] receives sound signals starting at the outer ear. They enter the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] and continue into the external [[ear canal|auditory canal]] (ear canal) and then to the [[eardrum]]. Once in the [[middle ear]], which consists of the [[malleus]], the [[incus]], and the [[stapes]]; the sounds are changed into mechanical energy. After being converted into mechanical energy, the message reaches the oval window, which is the beginning of the [[inner ear]]. Once inside the inner ear, the message is transferred into hydraulic energy by going through the [[cochlea]], which is filled with fluid, and on to the [[Organ of Corti]]. This organ again helps the sound to be transferred into a neural impulse that stimulates the auditory pathway and reaches the [[brain]]. Sound is then processed in [[Transverse temporal gyrus|Heschl's gyrus]] and associated with meaning in [[Wernicke's area]]. As for theories of speech perception, there are a motor and an auditory theory. The motor theory is based upon the premise that speech sounds are encoded in the acoustic signal rather than enciphered in it. The auditory theory puts greater emphasis on the sensory and filtering mechanisms of the listener and suggests that speech knowledge is a minor role that’s only used in hard perceptual conditions.

==Transmission of speech==
{{main|Acoustics}}
[[File:Waveform-above.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Waveform]] (amplitude as a function of time) of the English word "above".]]
[[File:Spectrogram-buy.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Spectrogram]] (frequency as a function of time) of the English word "buy".]]

Speech is transmitted through [[sound waves]], which follow the basic principles of [[acoustics]]. The source of all sound is vibration. For sound to exist, a source (something put into vibration) and a medium (something to transmit the vibrations) are necessary.

Since sound waves are produced by a vibrating body, the vibrating object moves in one direction and compresses the air directly in front of it. As the vibrating object moves in the opposite direction, the pressure on the air is lessened so that an expansion, or [[rarefaction]], of air molecules occurs. One compression and one rarefaction make up one [[longitudinal wave]]. The vibrating air molecules move back and forth parallel to the direction of motion of the wave, receiving energy from adjacent molecules nearer the source and passing the energy to adjacent molecules farther from the source.
Sound waves have two general characteristics: A disturbance is in some identifiable medium in which energy is transmitted from place to place, but the medium does not travel between two places.

Important basic characteristics of waves are wavelength, amplitude, period, and frequency. [[Wavelength]] is the length of the repeating wave shape. [[Amplitude]] is the maximum displacement of the particles of the medium, which is determined by the energy of the wave. A period (measured in seconds) is the time for one wave to pass a given point. [[Frequency]] of the wave is the number of waves passing a given point in a unit of time. Frequency is measured in [[hertz|hertz (hz)]]; (Hz cycles per second) and is [[perception|perceived]] as [[Tone (linguistics)|pitch]]. Each complete vibration of a sound wave is called a cycle. Two other physical properties of sound are intensity and duration. Intensity is measured in [[decibel|decibels (dB)]] and is perceived as loudness.

There are two types of tones: [[pure tone]]s and [[Virtual pitch|complex tone]]s. The musical note produced by a [[tuning fork]] is called a pure tone because it consists of one tone sounding at just one frequency. Instruments get their specific sounds — their [[timbre]] — because their sound comes from many different tones all sounding together at different frequencies. A single note played on a piano, for example, actually consists of several tones all sounding together at slightly different frequencies.

The '''stater''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|t|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|s|t|ɑː|ˈ|t|ɛər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stater Merriam-Webster ]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|στατήρ}} {{IPA-el|statɛ̌ːr|IPA}}, literally "weight") was an ancient coin used in various regions of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. The term is also used for similar coins, imitating Greek staters, minted elsewhere in ancient Europe.

== History ==
[[File:Monnaie de Bactriane, Eucratide I, 2 faces.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|&lt;small&gt;Gold 20-stater of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Eucratides I]], the largest gold coin ever minted in Antiquity. The coin weighs {{convert|169.2|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and has a diameter of {{convert|58|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;/small&gt;]]

The stater, as a Greek silver currency, first as ingots, and later as coins, circulated from the 8th century BC to AD&amp;nbsp;50. The earliest known stamped stater (having the mark of some authority in the form of a picture or words) is an [[electrum]] turtle coin, struck at [[Aegina]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snible.org/coins/bmc/attica/XXIII.jpg Coin images]&lt;/ref&gt; that dates to about 700&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snible.org/coins/hn/aegina.html Ancient coinage of Aegina]. snible.org. Retrieved on 2011-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; It is on display at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in [[Paris]]. 
According to [[Robin Lane Fox]], the stater as a weight unit was borrowed by the [[Euboea]]n stater weighing {{convert|16.8|g|oz}} from the [[Phoenicia]]n [[shekel]], which had about the same weight as a stater ({{convert|7.0|g|oz|disp=comma|abbr=on}}) and was also one fiftieth of a [[Mina (unit)|mina]].&lt;ref name="Fox 2008"&gt;Lane Fox, Robin. ''Travelling Heroes: Greeks and Their Myths in the Epic Age of Homer''. P. 94.  London: Allen Lane, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-7139-9980-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The silver stater minted at [[Corinth]]&lt;ref name="Smith 1881"&gt;Smith, William. ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities''. J. Murray, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; of {{convert|8.6|g|oz|abbr=on}} weight was divided into three silver [[drachma]]e of {{convert|2.9|g|oz|abbr=on}}, but was often linked to the [[Athens|Athenian]] silver [[didrachm]] (two drachmae) weighing {{convert|8.6|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue of Greek coins, A. Baldwin, Boston, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the Athenian silver [[tetradrachm]] (four drachmae) weighed {{convert|17.2|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Staters were also struck in several Greek city-states such as, [[Aegina]], [[Aspendos]], [[Delphi]], [[Knossos]], [[Kydonia]], many city-states of [[Ionia]], [[Lampsacus]], [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]], [[Metapontium]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Phaistos]], [[Paestum|Poseidonia]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Thasos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and more.

[[File:Celtic billon stater Armorican tribe.jpg|thumb|A Celtic stater made from [[Billon (alloy)|billon alloy]] found in [[Armorica]]]]
There also existed a "gold stater", but it was only minted in some places, and was mainly an accounting unit worth 20–28 drachmae depending on place and time, the Athenian unit being worth 20 drachmae. (The reason being that one gold stater generally weighed roughly {{convert|8.5|g|oz|abbr=on}}, twice as much as a drachma, while the parity of gold to silver, after some variance, was established as 1:10). The use of gold staters in coinage seems mostly of [[Macedon]]ian origin. The best known types of Greek gold staters are the 28-drachma ''kyzikenoi'' from [[Cyzicus]].

==Non-Greek staters==
[[Celt]]ic tribes brought the concept to Western and Central Europe after obtaining it while serving as mercenaries in north Greece.&lt;ref name=jersey1&gt;{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |pages=1-2 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold staters were minted in [[Gaul]] by Gallic chiefs modeled after those of [[Philip II of Macedonia]], which were brought back after serving in his armies, or those of Alexander and his successors.&lt;ref name=jersey1 /&gt; Some of these staters in the form of the [[Gallo-Belgic Staters|Gallo-Belgic series]] were imported to Britain on a large scale.&lt;ref name=jersey15&gt;{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |pages=15-19 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These went on to influence a range of staters produced in Britain.&lt;ref name=jersey20&gt;{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |pages=20-26 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Gold staters generally weighed between {{convert|4.5|and(-)|6.5|g|oz}}.&lt;ref name=Beanmeth17&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Bean|first=Simon C|date=1994 |title=The coinage of Atrebates and Regni |type=Ph.D. |chapter=Methodology |pages=17-18|publisher=University of Nottingham. |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11944/1/262143.pdf |access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celtic staters were also minted in present-day [[Czech Republic]] and [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="Zab"&gt;{{cite book | title=Systemy pieniężne na ziemiach polskich | publisher=Zakład Narodowy Im. Ossolińskich, PAN | author=Żabiński, Zbigniew | authorlink=Zbigniew Żabiński | year=1981 | pages=22 | isbn=83-04-00569-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquests of Alexander extended Greek culture east, leading to the adoption of staters in Asia. Gold staters have also been found from the ancient region of [[Gandhara]] from the time of [[Kanishka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Coins in India| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUdmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q| publisher=Marg Publications| author= Prabha Ray Himanshu| isbn=978-81-85026-73-2| date=2006-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Death of Klinghoffer''''' is an American [[opera]], with music by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] to an English-language [[libretto]] by [[Alice Goodman]]. First produced in Brussels and New York in 1991, the opera is based on the [[Achille Lauro hijacking|hijacking of the passenger liner ''Achille Lauro'']] by the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] in 1985, and the hijackers' murder of 69-year-old [[Jewish-American]] passenger [[Leon Klinghoffer]], who was wheelchair bound.

The concept of the opera originated with theatre director [[Peter Sellars]],&lt;ref name="Christiansen 2003"&gt;[[Rupert Christiansen|Christiansen, Rupert]], "Breaking Taboos". ''Opera'', '''54(5)''', 543–548 (May 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; who was a major collaborator, as was choreographer [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]]. It was commissioned by five American and European opera companies, and the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].

The opera has generated controversy, including allegations by Klinghoffer's two daughters and others that the opera is [[antisemitic]] and glorifies terrorism. The work's creators and others have disputed these criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Michael|title=''Klinghoffer'' Protesters Flock to Met Opera House|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-forges-ahead-on-klinghoffer-in-spite-of-protests.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=LargeMediaHeadlineSum&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==
[[File:PeterSellarsOjai.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Sellars]], who originated the concept of the opera and directed its first performance]]
Theatre director [[Peter Sellars]] developed the concept of this opera&lt;ref name="Christiansen 2003"/&gt; and was a major collaborator, as was choreographer [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]]. The opera was originally commissioned through a consortium of six entities: the Brussels opera company [[La Monnaie]], the [[San Francisco Opera]], the [[Opéra de Lyon]] in France, the Los Angeles Festival (separate from that city's opera company), the [[Glyndebourne Festival]] in England, and the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The first performance took place at the Théatre Royal de la Monnaie, Brussels, Belgium, on March 19, 1991, directed by Sellars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Rockwell|title=From an Episode of Terrorism, Adams's ''Death of Klinghoffer''|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE113CF932A15750C0A967958260|work=The New York Times| date=March 21, 1991|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, the [[Lyon]] premiere took place.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This was followed by a [[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]] studio recording in that French city with the same cast.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The first US performance was at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] on September 5, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Edward Rothstein|title=Seeking Symmetry Between Palestinians and Jews|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEED9103EF934A3575AC0A967958260|work=The New York Times|date=September 7, 1991|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy ensued. An opening scene depicting a suburban family, the Rumors, was permanently cut from the score on grounds that it caused offense. The Nonesuch recording, released in 1992, does not include this music. Because of the reaction to the subject matter and philosophy of the opera, planned stagings at [[Glyndebourne]] and in [[Los Angeles]] were cancelled.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

When the original production was staged by [[San Francisco Opera]] in November 1992, the Jewish Information League mounted protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/151815 "Art Attack: John Adams, composer"], ''[[New Statesman]]'' (London), October 17, 2005: the anonymous contributor describes the opposition as "Jewish Information League", although there is no source for a group of that name. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007075512/http://www.newstatesman.com/node/151815 |date=October 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first staging in Germany took place in 1997 in [[Nürnberg]], followed by a second German production at the [[Opernhaus Wuppertal]] in 2005.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Synopsis==

===Prologue===
The [[prologue]] consists of two choruses, the "Chorus of Exiled Palestinians" and the "Chorus of Exiled Jews", each of which is a general reflection about the respective peoples and their history.

===Act 1===
''Scene 1''

The unnamed captain of the ''[[MS Achille Lauro]]'' recalls the events of the hijacking. Prior to that, most of the passengers had disembarked in Egypt for a tour of the Pyramids, and the ship set out to sea to return later for the touring passengers. The hijackers had boarded during the disembarkation. When the hijackers commandeer the ship, the passengers still on board are collected in the ship's restaurant. The narrative shifts to a Swiss grandmother, traveling with her grandson while the boy's parents are touring the pyramids. The ship's first officer, given the fictitious name of [[Giordano Bruno]], informs the Captain that [[terrorists]] are on the ship and one waiter has been wounded. The Captain and First Officer try to keep the passengers calm. Molqi, one of the hijackers, explains the situation to the passengers at gunpoint. The Captain and Molqi have an encounter, where the Captain orders food and drink to be brought, and offers to let Molqi choose the food for the Captain to eat.

''Scene 2''

Following the "Ocean Chorus", another hijacker, Mamoud, keeps guard over the Captain. Mamoud recalls his youth and songs he listened to on the radio. The Captain and Mamoud have a dialogue, in which the Captain pleads that individuals on the two sides of the Palestinian–Israeli conflict could meet and try to understand each other. Mamoud dismisses this idea. During this scene is a passenger narrative by the Austrian Woman, who locked herself in her cabin and remained hidden throughout the hijacking. Act 1 ends with the "Night Chorus."

===Act 2===
The "Hagar Chorus", relating to [[Hagar in Islam#Hagar in the desert|the Islamic story of Hagar and the Angel]] and [[Hagar#Hagar and Abram|the Biblical story of Hagar and Ishmael]] is sung. It represents the beginnings of Arab–Israeli tension, of which the hijacking is one historical result.

''Scene 1''

Molqi is frustrated that he has received no reply to his demands. Mamoud threatens all of the passengers with death. Leon Klinghoffer sings, saying that he normally likes to avoid trouble and live simply and decently, but going on to denounce the hijackers. Another hijacker, called "[[John Rambo|Rambo]]", responds in harsh terms about Jews and Americans. The passenger, the British Dancing Girl, recalls how well the fourth hijacker, Omar, treated her and the other passengers, for example, letting them have cigarettes. Omar sings of his desire for martyrdom for his cause. At the end of the scene, Omar and Molqi have a dispute, and Molqui takes Klinghoffer away. The "Desert Chorus" follows.

''Scene 2''

Marilyn Klinghoffer talks about disability, illness, and death. She thinks that her husband Leon was taken to the ship's hospital, but he was shot, off-stage. The hijackers have ordered the Captain to say they will kill another passenger every fifteen minutes. Instead, the Captain offers himself as the sole next person to be killed. Molqi appears and says that Leon Klinghoffer is dead. The "Aria of the Falling Body (Gymnopédie)", sung by Klinghoffer, follows.

The "Day Chorus" links scene 2 to scene 3.

''Scene 3''

After the hijackers have surrendered and the surviving passengers have disembarked safely in port, the Captain remains to tell Marilyn Klinghoffer about her husband's death. She reacts with sorrow and rage toward the Captain, for what she sees as his accommodation of the hijackers. Her final sentiment is that she wished that she could have died in her husband's place.

==Dramaturgy==
The general style of the opera's music resembles that of Adams' [[minimalist music]] period, in the vein also of music by [[Philip Glass]] and [[Steve Reich]]. Intervallic relationships such as ''[[affekt]]'' are used to evoke certain emotions. The drama is portrayed primarily in long monologues by individual characters, with commentary by the [[choir|chorus]], which does not take part in the action.

Both Adams and Sellars have acknowledged the affinity of the opera's dramatic structure to the sacred [[oratorio]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], in particular his ''[[Passions (Bach)|Passions]]''. The plot of the opera does not contain a detailed re-enactment of the events of the hijacking and the murder of Klinghoffer; the major events are not directly portrayed on stage and occur between the opera's staged scenes. The artists originally considered the opera as more of a "dramatic meditation" or "reflection", in the manner of an oratorio, rather than a conventional narrative opera driven by plot.

Based on this aspect, the opera has been criticized as undramatic and static, particularly in act 1, whereas act 2 is more "conventional" in terms of operatic narrative.&lt;ref name="Clements1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Clements|title=''The Death of Klinghoffer'' (Barbican, London)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/jan/21/artsfeatures.classicalmusicandopera|work=The Guardian|date=January 21, 2002|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defence of this unconventional structure, John Ginman has analysed the particular dramaturgy and structure of the opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714040512&amp;db=all | last=Ginman | first=John | title=Opera as 'Information': The Dramaturgy of ''The Death of Klinghoffer'' | journal=Contemporary Theatre Review | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=51–59 | date=March 2004 | accessdate=January 23, 2011 | doi=10.1080/1026716032000152217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera's choral passages have been performed and recorded separately as ''Choruses from Klinghoffer''.

==Controversy and allegations of antisemitism==
Controversy surrounded the American premiere and other productions in the years which followed. Some critics and audience members condemned the production as antisemitic and appearing to be sympathetic to the hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Edward Rothstein | title=''Klinghoffer'' Sinks Into Minimal Sea | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/arts/classical-view-klinghoffer-sinks-into-minimal-sea.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | date=September 15, 1991 | accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, Goodman, and Sellars repeatedly claimed that they were trying to give equal voice to both Israelis and Palestinians with respect to the political background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=| title=Opera As A Source Of Healing | url=http://www.newsweek.com/1991/03/31/opera-as-a-source-of-healing.html | work=Newsweek | date=March 31, 1991 | accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Walsh | title=Art And Terror in the Same Boat | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972615,00.html | work=Time | date=April 1, 1991 | accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Klinghoffer and Ilsa Klinghoffer, the daughters of Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer, anonymously attended the 1991 U.S. premiere of the opera in New York City. Afterward the Klinghoffer family released the following statement about the opera: "We are outraged at the exploitation of our parents and the coldblooded murder of our father as the centerpiece of a production that appears to us to be anti-Semitic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Allan Kozinn | title=Klinghoffer Daughters Protest Opera | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DD1E3CF932A2575AC0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | date=September 11, 1991 | accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatic expression of Palestinian historical grievances in a theatrical context generated some criticism of the opera's alleged sympathy with Palestinian terrorism. Others accused the creators of anti-Semitism for their portrayal of fictional Jewish-American neighbours of the Klinghoffers, the Rumors, in a scene in the original version. The couple were characterized in a way many Jews believed to be offensive and inappropriately satirical. ''[[New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Edward Rothstein]] was particularly scathing in describing the scene and its place in the play; he described it as expressing "scorn of American Jews and anybody else without mythic claims on the world's attention" while eliminating altogether the Israeli position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothstein|first1=Edward|date=September 15, 1991|title=Classical View; 'Klinghoffer' Sinks Into Minimal Sea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/arts/classical-view-klinghoffer-sinks-into-minimal-sea.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; asking rhetorically "Who could tell from this work just what the Jewish side really is{{snd}}a sort of touristy attachment to an ancient land?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothstein|first1=Edward|date=September 7, 1991|title=Review/Opera; Seeking Symmetry Between Palestinians and Jews|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/07/arts/review-opera-seeking-symmetry-between-palestinians-and-jews.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the American premiere, Adams deleted this scene, while revising his opera for all future productions.&lt;ref name="Fink"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FOPR%2FOPR17_02%2FS0954586705001989a.pdf&amp;code=ff08d1457e33990c799cf8f415584175 | last=Fink | first=Robert | title=''Klinghoffer'' in Brooklyn Heights | journal=Cambridge Opera Journal | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=173–213 | date=July 2005 | accessdate=January 23, 2011 | doi=10.1017/s0954586705001989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] cancelled a scheduled performance in November 2001 of extracts from the opera. This was partly in deference to a member of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, who lost a family member on one of the hijacked planes, as well as due to perceptions that the work was overly sympathetic to terrorists. In a widely discussed ''New York Times'' article, [[Richard Taruskin]] defended the orchestra's action. He denounced Adams and the opera for "romanticizing terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Richard Taruskin | title=Music's Dangers And The Case For Control | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E6D8163CF93AA35751C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=4 | work=The New York Times | date=December 9, 2001 | accessdate=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rockwell]] of ''The New York Times'', in a review of the Penny Woolcock film version, countered that the opera ultimately "shows unequivocally that murder is nothing more than that, vicious and unconscionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Rockwell|title=Is ''Klinghoffer'' Anti-Semitic?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/movies/music-is-klinghoffer-anti-semitic.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 4, 2003|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anna Picard | title=John Adams: 'It was a rant, a riff and an ugly personal attack' | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/john-adams-it-was-a-rant-a-riff-and-an-ugly-personal-attack-751250.html | work=The Independent | date=January 13, 2002 | accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Taruskin's criticisms on a number of occasions, including this 2004 statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not long ago our attorney general, [[John Ashcroft]], said that anyone who questioned his policies on civil rights after September 11 was aiding terrorists; what Taruskin said was the aesthetic version of that. If there is an aesthetic viewpoint that does not agree with his, it should not be heard. I find that very disturbing indeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Martin Kettle | title=The witch-hunt | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/dec/15/books.guardianreview3 | work=The Guardian | date=December 15, 2001 | accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a more academic analysis, musicologist Robert Fink countered Taruskin's accusations of antisemitism, with particular reference to the deleted scene with the Rumor family. Fink has discussed how the removal of this scene disrupted the original dramaturgical structure of the opera, as the singers of the members of the Rumor family took on symbolically ironic later roles in the opera. Fink further posited that the reaction of American audiences to the portrayal of the Rumor family was partly because it was sociologically accurate. He discussed the scene in the historical context of past depictions in American popular culture of Jewish-American families.&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt; A separate academic study by Ruth Sara Longobardi discusses the opera with respect to issues about depictions of Palestinians and Jews. She explores how the use of contemporary media in productions, such as the Penny Woolcock film of the opera, affects perception of the two sides of the political conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cambridgefluids.org/action/displayFulltext?type=6&amp;fid=5916288&amp;jid=SAM&amp;volumeId=3&amp;issueId=03&amp;aid=5916284&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1752196309990435 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725130501/http://cambridgefluids.org/action/displayFulltext?type=6&amp;fid=5916288&amp;jid=SAM&amp;volumeId=3&amp;issueId=03&amp;aid=5916284&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1752196309990435 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=July 25, 2011 | last=Longobardi | first=Ruth Sara | title=Re-producing ''Klinghoffer'': Opera and Arab Identity before and after 9/11 | journal=Journal of the Society for American Music | volume=3 | issue=03 | pages=273–310 | year=2009 | accessdate=January 30, 2011 | doi=10.1017/s1752196309990435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 [[Juilliard Opera Center|Juilliard]] performance generated renewed controversy. A letter to ''The Juilliard Journal'' protested the opera as "a political statement made by the composer to justify an act of terrorism by four Palestinians." The school's president, [[Joseph W. Polisi]], responded with his own letter, stating that he was "a longtime friend of Israel and have visited the country on numerous occasions", as well as a recipient of the King Solomon Award from the [[America-Israel Cultural Foundation]]. He described ''Klinghoffer'' as "a profoundly perceptive and human commentary on a political/religious problem that continues to find no resolution." He added that Juilliard and other institutions "have to be responsible for maintaining an environment in which challenging, as well as comforting, works of art are presented to the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.juilliard.edu/journal/2008-2009/0902/articles/0902_letters.html|last=Polisi|first=Joseph W.|title=Letters to the Editor: On ''The Death of Klinghoffer''|journal=Juilliard Journal|volume=XXIV|issue=5|pages= |date=February 2009|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York cancelled an international simulcast and radio broadcast of this opera due to "an outpouring of concern" locally that it "might be used to fan global anti-semitism."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rose, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2014/10/17/356889957/twenty-years-later-klinghoffer-still-draws-protests "Twenty Years Later, ''Klinghoffer'' Still Draws Protests"], on www.npr.org, October 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to cancelling both broadcasts, the company agreed to include a statement from Klinghoffer's daughters in the printed program of the production. [[Peter Gelb]], general manager for the Met, stated:
:"I'm convinced that the opera is not anti-Semitic, but I've also become convinced that there is genuine concern in the international Jewish community that the live transmission of ''The Death of Klinghoffer'' would be inappropriate at this time of rising anti-Semitism, particularly in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Michaels |first1=Sean |last2=Tilden |first2=Imogen | title=New York's Met cancel The Death of Klinghoffer simulcast | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/18/new-york-metropolitan-opera-cancel-death-of-klinghoffer-simulcast | work=The Guardian | date=June 18, 2014 | accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official statement, Adams said: "The cancellation of the international telecast is a deeply regrettable decision and goes far beyond issues of 'artistic freedom,' and ends in promoting the same kind of intolerance that the opera's detractors claim to be preventing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ng |first=David | title=John Adams decries cancellation of 'Klinghoffer' cinema broadcast | url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-80539900/ | work=Los Angeles Times | date=June 17, 2014 | accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2014 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine piece, critic [[Justin Davidson]] denied that ''The Death of Klinghoffer'' was anti-Semitic or glorified terrorism, stating that the title character is "the opera's moral core, the one fully functioning human being." He described the opera as "imperfect" and "politically troubling", writing that its attempt to show the historical justifications for both sides is both needlessly provocative and hampers the drama: "Explaining historical events is not an opera's job, and never has been. [...] What matters is how vast events frame a human drama, translated into musical form." He also said that the decision to model the opera on the Bach ''Passions'' "might actually be the most offensive thing about the opera, since a Jewish murder victim is conscripted to serve as a Christian symbol of redemption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Trouble With Klinghoffer Isn't Quite What You Think |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/trouble-with-klinghoffer.html |work=New York |first=Justin |last=Davidson |date=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[First Amendment]] expert [[Floyd Abrams]] wrote in October 2014 that, though there were no First Amendment issues: "the killers ... chose to commit their crime. So did [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], [[James Earl Ray]] and [[Osama bin Laden]]. We can expect no arias to be sung in their defense at the Metropolitan Opera, and there is no justification for any to be sung for the Klinghoffer killers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/floyd-abrams-klinghoffer-and-the-two-sides-of-terrorism-1413414330|title=Floyd Abrams: Klinghoffer and the 'Two Sides' of Terrorism|author=Floyd Abrams|date=October 15, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former New York City mayor and opera fan [[Rudy Giuliani]] wrote that while the Met had a First Amendment right to present the opera, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Equally, all of us have as strong a First Amendment right to ... warn people that this work is both a distortion of history and helped, in some ways, to foster a three decade long feckless policy of creating a moral equivalency between the Palestinian Authority, a corrupt terrorist organization, and the state of Israel, a democracy ruled by law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/20/rudy-giuliani-why-i-protested-the-death-of-klinghoffer.html|title=Rudy Giuliani: Why I Protested ''The Death of Klinghoffer''|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;American writer and feminist [[Phyllis Chesler]], an opera aficionado, conceded the legal and artistic right to perform the opera, but claimed that it "beatifies terrorism, both musically and in the libretto."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newenglishreview.org/blog_direct_link.cfm/blog_id/56957|title=Betrayal in the Metropolitan Opera Production of the Death of Klinghoffer|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In support of the production, [[Oskar Eustis]], the artistic director of the ''[[The Public Theater|Public Theater]]'' said: "It is not only permissible for the Met to do this piece – it's required for the Met to do the piece. It is a powerful and important opera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-forges-ahead-on-klinghoffer-in-spite-of-protests.html?_r=0|title=Protests Greet Metropolitan Opera's Premiere of ''Klinghoffer''|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Godwhale''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by [[United States|American]] novelist [[T. J. Bass]], first published in 1974. It is the sequel to ''[[Half Past Human]]''. The book was nominated for the [[Nebula Award]] for [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] in 1974. The novel deals with [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biology|biological]] inventions with a strange and mystical twist.

''The Godwhale'' presents a view of a far-future Earth in which almost all non-human life has been exterminated due to rampant [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], and most human beings have been transformed into weak, docile, diminutive creatures via [[genetic engineering]] and extensive reliance on [[automation]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. Bass utilizes extensive biochemical and medical terminology in the narrative, and many scenes are quite clinically graphic. It is a cautionary tale on the evolution of technological society, and was published during the emergent period of the US [[environmental movement]].

== Plot introduction ==
The protagonist, Larry Dever, is gravely injured resulting in a radical surgical procedure, a [[hemicorporectomy]], in which tissue below the waist is removed. He is outfitted with a set of intelligent mechanical legs, a "manniquin", and is placed into suspended animation until the damaged tissue can be restored. He wakes at a time when cloning technology can replace his legs, although for a price. Years before he was awakened, a clone, or "bud child", was created and is now a thriving young boy without language. Horrified by the prospect of his child being sacrificed to provide him with a new lower body, Larry opts to return to suspended animation. His child, Dim Dever, is selected by the guiding world computer, called Olga, to carry his ancient genes to a possible new colony on a planet orbiting Procyon.

Larry awakens again in a nightmare future. Far from the highly advanced past, now an enormous human population (possibly in the trillions) covers every inch of the planet. Technology and science have degraded, and all freely breeding species have been exterminated. The 'Hive' or human population within its computer-supported subterranean culture ruthlessly hunts, kills, and recycles anyone who does not conform.

As Larry is trying to adapt to his new life, without most of his own body or his "cyber" torso, something re-awakens an ancient, half-derelict cyborg, the Godwhale of the title. This enormous 'rake' is an ocean-going biota harvester built in part from a genetically modified blue whale. Initially attempting to rejoin human civilization, the Godwhale (named Rorqual Maru or 'Whale Ship' in Japanese) eventually teams up with a genetically modified clone of Larry, Larry himself, and an assortment of misfits and refugees from the Hive. Together they set out to try to find out what mysteriously brings the marine biota back to the previously sterile oceans, while a tiny group from the Hive, the outcasts, and their cyber deities survive and thrive in the face of incredible bungling by the 'Class One' computer that manages humanity and the various castes of 'Nebish' humans brought into the fight.

==Reception==
[[Lester del Rey]] described ''The Godwhale'' as "a complex and fascinating novel [and] a fine example of what science fiction is all about."&lt;ref&gt;"Reading Room", [[If (magazine)|''If'']], June 1974, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Theodore Sturgeon]] simply declared the novel "Good."&lt;ref&gt;"If . . . ?", ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', April 14, 1974, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodor Christian Lohmann''' (October 18, 1831 – August 31, 1905) was a 19th-century German administrative lawyer, civil servant and social reformer, second in importance only to [[Otto von Bismarck]] in the formation of the German social insurance system. He is considered one of the major forces advocating for legislation for occupational safety and health, as co-architect of Bismarck's social security and as a seminal figure in the relation of ''Diakonie''&lt;ref&gt;The English translation as "deaconry" would be inaccurate, since in Germany ''Diakonie'' is also a lay diaconate, i.e. religious service of reconciliation in the world combining the word of faith and the action of love. Its aims are said to include: a) furthering ecumenical relationships among diaconal associations and diaconal communities; b) reflecting on the nature and task of ''diaconia'' in the Biblical sense; c) furthering a sense of ''diaconia'' in churches and congregations; d) strengthening fellowship among members to render mutual help and undertake common tasks.&lt;/ref&gt; and social politics.

==Private life, education, and early career==
Theodor Lohmann was the seventh of eight children in a rural, patriarchal Lutheran household. From early on Lohmann had been influenced by the pious German Lutheran ''Great Awakening'' movement of [[Ludwig Harms]], characterized by proselytism and sanctification. Lohmann's father, Ernst Heinrich Lohmann (1797–1856), was a merchant and owner of a brickyard. His mother, Johanna Juliana Lohmann (born Hardegen), died early. Theodor Lohmann attended the gymnasium in Celle.

From 1850 he studied jurisprudence and political science at the University of Göttingen, where he also engaged in the study of church theory and came in contact with the ''[[Inner Mission (Germany)|Inner Mission]]'' for the first time, which led him to write his first thesis ''Communismus, Socialismus, Christenthum''. His thesis received a great deal of academic attention for its proposal of an extensive reform of society in the light of the newly emerging socialist theories. In 1851 he was one of the founders of the ''Burschenschaft'' ''Germania of Göttingen''. Four years later Lohmann entered the civil service of the Kingdom of Hanover. In 1858 he passed the second ''Staatsexamen''.

Subsequently Lohmann was active in different roles for the royal administration of Hanover. In 1861 he was assigned to the administration's cultural department, and as general secretary in 1869 Lohmann participated in the first Evangelisch-Lutheran synod in Hanover. In the 1860s he had already engaged himself with the development of the Lutheran Inner Mission (Innere Mission), effectively reorganizing the constitution of the Hanover state church. Together with the theologian Gerhard Uhlhorn and others he played an important role in the establishment of the ''Evangelischer Verein'' ("Evangelisch Association") and the ''Stephansstift'', a diaconical institution of [[Hanover]] created in 1869 for the promotion of religious freedom. He was also involved in the assistance of youth and old people as well as vocational training. In 1862 Theodor Lohmann had married Louise Sophie Elisabeth Wyneken (1839–1879). The couple had three children.

==Work as a social reformer==
During the [[Austro-Prussian War]] the Kingdom of Hanover was occupied in 1866 by [[Prussia]]n troops, and Hanover became a Prussian province. For the administrative lawyer Theodor Lohmann this presented a major fork in his career path: In 1871 Lohmann and his young family moved to Berlin and he assumed a position in the Prussian Ministry of Commerce, where he worked on matters concerning industrial workers. In this capacity he participated in the drafting of a number of bills, including the amendment of the German Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act, which introduced factory inspection in Prussia, and formed the basis for the current-day ''Gewerbeaufsicht'' ("industrial, commercial and business inspectorate").

From 1866 to 1873 [[Hermann Wagener]], journalist, Conservative, Prussian and Reichstag deputy, and
friend of Bismarck was an official in the Prussian Ministry of State, and an important voice for reform. According to Hennock, Lohmann's role in the period after Wagener's departure is under reassessment by historians:

:Wagener’s departure from the political scene in 1873 coincided with the arrival of Theodor Lohmann at the Prussian trade ministry as well as with the tensions caused by the [[Gründerkrise]]. Henceforth Lohmann was the most important innovator until in 1880 he was joined by (Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] ) himself. That is well known. But the picture of Lohmann’s actions that emerges from (work published in the 1990s and subsequently) has led to a significant re-evaluation of  (Lohmann's) role.&lt;ref&gt;For those interested in pursuing the question, all of the most recently published work in the bibliography is germane to this question.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 Lohmann transferred to the Prussian Ministry of Interior. There he played a key staff role in support of Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] during the passage of legislation that established the German social security system, the first system in the world based on principles of social insurance. Lohmann’s objectives, however, were distinct from Bismarck’s: Whereas the famous chancellor was interested in creating a social insurance that transformed the workers into dependent "state pensioners", or quiescent supporters of the Reich,  Lohmann sought to broaden the workers' rights of self-determination and local self-governance. Bismarck’s concept of state socialism built upon a close linkage of the workers to the state contradicted Lohmann’s vision of the ''mündiger Arbeitnehmer'' ("mature and responsible worker").&lt;ref name="Nipperdey"&gt;Thomas Nipperdey, ''Deutsche Geschichte 1866–1918. Erster Band: Arbeitswelt und Bürgergeist'', München 1990 (Beck), p. 341 sq. &amp; p. 346 sq., {{ISBN|3-406-34453-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Bismarck sought to use the social insurance program to firm up the old order of the [[Prussian Junkers]], Lohmann's German brand of [[Christian socialism]] sought the middle ground between the Junkers and the other defenders of the old order and the increasingly revolutionary ardor of the German workers.

Those on Bismarck's side were not notably long on ideas about how to deal with what was widely known at the time as the Social Problem. "Nothing illustrates the (Bismarck) government's lack of energy and imagination more strikingly than its approach to the working class," according to Gordon Craig. After the departure of his friend Wagener, the politically artful Bismarck seems to have turned to Lohmann and his associates in the bureaucracy for ideas.

: In the Prussian Ministry of Commerce there was a dedicated group of civil servants, led by Freiherr Berlepsch and his chief assistant Theodor Lohmann, who were convinced that the time had come to advance beyond the limits of Bismarck's social welfare system, to provide the working class with a comprehensive code for the protection of the rights of labor, to encourage working class participation in communal activities,  and, by doing so, to satisfy its justifiable desire for equality and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Craig (1978) Germany: 1866-1945. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, however, the hopes of the reformers were simply not tolerable to Bismarck and his allies. Craig also writes:

: The prevailing philosophy was that preached most stridently by the industrialist Stumm-Halberg, who believed that any kind of working-class organization was a threat to the existing social and political system, and most apocalyptically by soldiers like Waldersee, who regarded military action as the best answer to the rise of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, op.cit. p. 263)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Emperor, the attempt to apply Bismarck's (and Stumm-Halberg's) approach to the social problem, resulted in movement away from initial sympathy for the reform position toward an escalating rhetoric of violence that alarmed many of his servants, who believed his comments were undermining the stability of government. In the end, this approach proved self-defeating and the Reichstag unwilling to be stampeded into adopting anti-socialist legislation. The "net effect was to embitter the working class and to deepen the gulf that existed between it and the rest of German society since 1878. This was unfortunate, since there were forces at work within the working class that might, if properly appreciated, have led to the kind of reconciliation that men like Naumann and Lohmann and Berlepsch were working for." &lt;ref&gt;Craig, op. cit., p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

: (Lohmann's) ideas, which were shared, with some modifications, by social reform groups within the Centre Party, by [[Friedrich Naumann]]'s [[National-Social Association]], by the [[Evangelical Workers' Union]] in [[Mönchengladbach]], and by the so-called '[[Socialists of the Chair]]' who belonged to the [[Social Policy Association]] found little sympathy at the center of government; and after the Emperor's brief flirtation with them in the first years of his reign, their proponents were gradually eased out of office.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, op. cit. p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he was finally forced out following a confrontation with Bismarck, Lohmann had at least partial success in designing the state's public [[health insurance]]: Workers were allowed to participate in the financing and self-government of the health insurance companies. Despite Bismarck's opposition the traditional role of German ancillary health insurance funds and companies in the program was considerably strengthened.&lt;ref name="Nipperdey" /&gt; In 1883 the sociopolitical differences brought about a major schism between Lohmann and Bismarck and ended Lohmann’s role in reforming social insurance in Germany for seven years. The immediate cause of the rift was disagreement over provisions of accident insurance coverage. While Lohmann favored direct investment of the workers in the planned accident insurance program, Bismarck sought a compulsory insurance system in the form of mutual employer's liability insurance associations, which were to be subsidized by the state. For a while Lohmann tried to thwart Bismarck's plans. In September 1883 the issue came to a head in a confrontation between the two. As a result, Lohmann was removed from any further role in the formulation of this social legislation. Robert Bosse, the Director of the Ministry of the Interior at the time, noted in his memoirs:

:''In this conflict Lohmann risked his office and his future. Respect for him! It's another question whether he was factually right. I don’t believe so.''&lt;ref name="Tennstedt"&gt;Hansjoachim Henning, Florian Tennstedt, Peter Rassow &amp; Karl E. Born, ''Quellensammlung zur Geschichte der deutschen Sozialpolitik 1867 bis 1914'', Section II, Vol. 2, Part 1, Darmstadt 1978/2004 (Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft), pp. 377 &amp; 382&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the 1884 law on the new accident insurance and the even greater success of the employer's liability insurance associations confirmed this assumption by Bosse and disproved Lohmann’s reservations at least partly. Lohmann himself said he was relieved that he no longer had to account for procedures, which he regarded "wrong" and "completely impracticable".&lt;ref name="Tennstedt" /&gt;

Lohmann left in 1883. Berlepsch held on, but eventually resigned in disgust in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, op. cit. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Others of their [[reform coalition]] faced similar fates.

As a result of his career in government, Daniel Rodgers, the Princeton historian whose ''Atlantic Crossings''&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 1998. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; is a touchstone of transatlantic history puts Lohmann in the company of William Beveridge, the major intellectual architect of the postwar British welfare state, the Stockholm economists of the 1930s and Franklin D. Roosevelt's "brain trust" who shaped the New Deal.  Rodgers terms Lohmann "framer of Bismarck's initial social insurance proposals."

==Role in church social action==
After he left the Prussian administration Theodor Lohmann immersed himself in supporting the ''Inner Mission'' and traditional missionary work, among other things in the ''Gesellschaft zur Beförderung des Christentums unter den Juden'' ("Society for the Advancement of Christianity among the Jews"). He served as the society's president from 1876 to 1898. Lohmann also worked for the ''Gesellschaft zur Beförderung der evangelischen Missionen unter den Heiden'' ("Society for the Advancement of the Evangelisch Missions among Unbelievers"). In 1880 Lohmann had become a member of the ''Central-Ausschuß für die innere Mission der deutschen evangelischen Kirche'' ("Central Committee for the Inner Mission of the German Evangelisch Church"). He remained its member until his death in 1905.

In 1885 Lohmann wrote the report of the General Committee of the Inner Mission entitled ''Die Aufgabe der Kirche und inrer inneren Mission gegenüber den wirtschaftlichen und gesellschaftlichen Kämpfen  
der Gegenwart'' (The Function of the Church and its Internal Mission in relation
to the Present Economic and Social Conflicts). According to  Gordon Craig, this volume "anticipated much that was to be said six years later in (Pope) Leo XIII's ''Rerum novarum'', and the outstanding Christian Social reformer of the next generation, [[Frederick Naumann]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig, op. cit., p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bismarck's departure from his position as German chancellor in 1890 Lohmann was reassigned by the new Minister of Trade, Hans Hermann of Berlepsch, to further extend the German worker legislation. One of his responsibilities during his first year was the planning and execution of the ''International Conference on Protection of Workers'' held in Berlin. He was subsequently involved in a further amendment of the German Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act, which brought new improvements for the workers, e.g. the prohibition of nightwork for women and young people. After several promotions Lohmann was appointed director of the trade department in the Ministry of Trade in 1900. In 1904, on the occasion of his fiftieth anniversary of administrative service, he was presented with the ''[[Wilhelmsorden]]'', an award for special sociopolitical contributions.

Theodor Lohmann died on August 31, 1905 at the age of seventy-three in Tabartz, Thuringia. Despite his substantial contributions to the German social security system and the protection of German workers, Lohmann and his social reforms remain to this day in the shadow of Bismarck and his politics.

==Plot summary==
''Time'' is set on Earth, the inner part of the [[Solar System]] and various other [[universes]] onwards from the 21st century. The novel covers a wide range of topics, including the [[Doomsday argument]], [[Fermi paradox]], [[genetic engineering]], and humanity's extinction.

The book begins at the end of space and time, when the last descendants of humanity face an infinite but pointless existence.  Due to [[proton decay]] the physical universe has collapsed, but some form of intelligence has survived by embedding itself into a lossless computing substrate where it can theoretically survive indefinitely.  However, because there will never be new input, eventually all possible thoughts will be exhausted.  Some portion of this intelligence decides that this should not have been the [[ultimate fate of the universe]], and takes action to change the past, centering on the early 21st century.  The changes come in several forms, including a message to Reid Malenfant, the appearance of super-intelligent children around the world, and the discovery of a mysterious gateway on asteroid [[3753 Cruithne]].

Players assume the role of a {{nihongo|sage|審神者|saniwa}} who travels into the past to defeat evil forces, and has the ability to animate legendary swords, which are depicted as attractive young men. ''Touken Ranbu'' is mostly a gender-swapped [[Video game clone|clone]] of the game ''[[Kantai Collection]]'', also by DMM, which anthropomorphizes historical warships as young girls. Combat is largely automated, with progress mainly dependent on [[Resource management (gaming)|resource management]] and [[Grinding (video gaming)|grinding]].

==Reception==
''Touken Ranbu'' quickly became very popular in Japan, particularly with young women, and had over 1.5 million registered players by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=2周年記念『刀剣乱舞』初の公式複合イベント 来年1月に池袋で | url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2080917/full/ | language=Japanese | work=[[Oricon]] | date=2016-11-02 | accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been credited with accelerating the Japanese cultural trend of {{nihongo|"[[katana]] women"|カタナ女子|katana joshi}} – women who are interested in, and who pose with, historical Japanese swords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Lynzee Loveridge | title=Female History Fans Cited for Sales Spike in Japanese Sword Book Series | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-03-16/female-history-fans-cited-for-sales-spike-in-japanese-sword-book-series/.86041 | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=2015-03-16 | accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; That trend had been started a few years previously with the ''[[Sengoku Basara]]'' video games, which made katana fans a distinct part of the Japanese subculture of female history aficionados (''[[reki-jo]]'').&lt;ref name="Kotaku 10 June 2015" /&gt; The popularity of ''Touken Ranbu'' was such that a Japanese women's interest magazine published an article about exercise routines based on sword fighting techniques from the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Scott|title=Women's Interest Magazine Offers Fitness Routine Inspired by Anthropomorphic Sword Boys of "Touken Ranbu -ONLINE-"|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/07/07-1/womens-interest-magazine-offers-fitness-routine-inspired-by-anthropomorphic-sword-boys-of-touken-ranbu-online-|accessdate=2 August 2015|work=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2015 Tokyo [[Wonder Festival]]'s figure exhibition was reportedly "completely dominated by hot male swordsmen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Scott|title=Wonder Festival Summer 2015 figure exhibition completely dominated by hot male swordsmen|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/07/30/wonder-festival-summer-2015-figure-exhibition-completed-dominated-by-hot-male-swordsmen/|accessdate=2 August 2015|work=Rocket News 24|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|founding of the State of Israel]], relatively few women have served in the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli government]], and fewer still have served in the leading ministerial offices. While Israel is one of a small number of countries where a woman—[[Golda Meir]]—has served as [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government.

{{As of|2018}}, women comprise 28% of Israel's 120-member [[Knesset]]. For comparison (as of 2004), the female ratio in the Arab world is 6.4%, in [[European Union]] average is 17.6% and in [[Scandinavia]] 40% "and rising".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/women2004.html Women In Israel] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States of America, women comprise only 19.3% of the House of Representatives. Female representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few have come from Arab or religious Jewish parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/Women_in_public_life.html Women in Public Life] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/MKIndex_Current_eng.asp?view=3 Current Female Knesset Members] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Golda Meir]] is the only woman to serve as the [[Prime Minister of Israel]]. She was chosen for the job just before the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969 elections]] following the death of [[Levi Eshkol]], and ended her job in 1974. She and [[Tzipi Livni]] are the only women who served as [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Foreign Affairs Ministers]], Meir having served in the job for 10 years—from 1956 to 1966. Livni is the only woman to serve in the second most important job in the Israeli government, [[Deputy leaders of Israel#Vice Prime Minister|Vice Prime Minister]].

Once Golda Meir resigned in 1974, it was another 12 years until another woman was appointed as a minister with a portfolio, when [[Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino]] was appointed [[Health Minister of Israel|Health Minister]], and 18 years until a woman was appointed to any other portfolio, [[Education Minister of Israel|Education Minister]].

After Golda Meir, the leading jobs which women held are as follows: [[Education Minister of Israel|Education Minister]] for a total of 9 years (5 of them by [[Limor Livnat]], 3 years by [[Yuli Tamir]] and 1 year by [[Shulamit Aloni]]), and [[Communications Minister of Israel|Minister of Communications]], also for a total of 7 years (6 years by [[Shulamit Aloni]] and [[Limor Livnat]], and 1 year by [[Dalia Itzik]]). [[Tzipi Livni]] was acting [[Justice Minister of Israel|Minister of Justice]] for a month, and then Minister of Justice for almost a year and a half. [[Ayelet Shaked]] was appointed as Minister of Justice in 2015.

Although a few women did succeed in reaching the leading posts in the Israeli government, a number of them hadn't ever been held by women, such as [[Defense Minister of Israel|Defense Minister]], [[Internal Security Minister of Israel|Internal Security Minister]], [[Finance Ministry (Israel)|Finance Minister]].

== Historical overview ==
===Until the 1970s===
[[Image:Golda Meir2.jpg|thumb|[[Golda Meir]], at a meeting in the [[White House]], 1973]]
From the first Israeli government until the 12th, [[Golda Meir]] was the only woman in the Israeli government (though not the parliament). Golda Meir, who started out as a secretary of the Women's Labour Council of Histadrut, and later became the head of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]'s political department, and then an ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]], came back to Israel in 1949 after she was elected to the [[Knesset]], and served as the Israeli Minister of Labor. She held this job for 7 years under a number of Prime Ministers, until in 1956 she became Foreign Minister, a job she held for 10 years until 1966.

After 3 years, in which she wasn't a member of the Israeli government, she was chosen as the head the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment party]] and as Prime Minister, and she was voted as Prime Minister again in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969 elections]], when the party got the highest number of seats in the Knesset. Despite being a woman, she wasn't known as a [[Feminism|Feminist]], and she didn't appoint any other women to positions in the government.

During Golda Meir's time, the number of woman members of Knesset was around 10–14 on average (out of 120), mostly from [[Mapai]] and its successor parties. In the elections during which Golda Meir was to become prime minister, only 8 women got into the Knesset.

=== The 1970s ===

After the [[Israeli legislative election, 1973|1973 elections]], Golda Meir resigned from her position as prime minister as the result of protests after the [[Yom Kippur War]], and [[Yitzhak Rabin]] was chosen to succeed her. In 1974, he appointed [[Shulamit Aloni]] as a [[minister without portfolio]]. She held this position for 5 months, until she resigned in protest over the appointment of [[Yitzhak Rafael]] as the [[Religious Services Minister of Israel|Religious Services Minister]], despite the fact that he was suspected of having accepted bribes.

=== After the 1970s ===
In 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called "B’Zhutan: Haredi Women Making Change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-election-2015/.premium-1.637916|title=Israel's first ever ultra-Orthodox women’s party makes bold debut|date=20 January 2015|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
