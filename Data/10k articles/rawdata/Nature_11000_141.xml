      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2767">The 1938 soil taxonomy divided soils into three orders dependent on dominant [[pedogenesis|soil forming factors]].

== Intrazonal soils ==
'''Intrazonal''' soils have more or less well-defined [[soil profile]] characteristics that reflect the dominant influence of some resident factor of relief or [[parent material]] over the classic zonal effects of climate and vegetation. There are three major sub-types, two of which have two further sub-types each.

:Calcimorphic or [[calcareous]] soils develop from a [[limestone]]. It has two sub-types:
::[[Rendzina]] soils are thin soils with limited [[available water capacity]].
::Terra rossa soils are deep red soils associated with higher rainfall than rendzina.
:Hydromorphic soils form in [[wetland]] conditions.  There are two sub-types:
::[[Gley soil]]s - These occur when the pore spaces between the grains become saturated with water and contain no air. This lack of oxygen leads to anaerobic conditions which reduce the iron in the parent rock. This gives the soil a characteristic grey/blue colour with flecks of red.
::[[Peat]] soils form under circumstances that prevent the breakdown of vegetation completely.
:Halomorphic soils form due to [[soil salination]].

== Azonal soil ==
{{see also|Azonal}}
These soils are formed in mountainous regions out of fine grains produced by weathering. However, due to various reasons, this fine grained material constantly slides down the slope. As a result, the time necessary for the formation of soils does not become available. Therefore, these soils remain immature. An example is soil along the slopes of the Himalayan mountains. In river plains, particularly in flood-plain areas, new alluvium is deposited every year. The time for soil formation remains inadequate. Hence, flood plain soils also remain immature. In river plains, due to alluvium and availability of water, the farmlands are fertile but the soils remain immature.

The '''Alexandrion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Αλεξάνδρειον), a building of the international "Alexander the Great Institute", is a private institution of Macedonians living abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panmacedonian.info|title=Pan-Macedonian Association, USA|access-date=2018-10-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517152435/http://panmacedonian.info/|archive-date=2017-05-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Greeks, who came from [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], had the idea to erect a monument in their homeland, at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]], near the Temple of [[Zeus]] in [[Archaeological Park of Dion|Dion]], a symbol of their bond with their homeland, and at the same time a place of encounter. It was founded in 1992. The head office of the Institute is in New York (USA), the local management is based in [[Katerini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandreon.edu.gr/index.php/features/module-positions-3|title=BOARD OF DIRECTORS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:MacedonEmpire.jpg|thumb|Macedon Empire]]
Just above the A1 motorway ([[Athens]] - [[Thessaloniki]]) near the [[Litochoro]] exit.

==Purpose==
The institute's goals are beneficial, spiritual, social, artistic and cultural. The preservation and spread of the Greek language and Greek traditions are particularly valuable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandreon.edu.gr/index.php/features/module-positions|title=Mission of the International Institute Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions and seminars are organized and the Alexandrion serves representative purposes. In addition to former Greek president of the state, Mr. Papoulias, there were other high domestic and foreign personalities hosted as guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandreon.edu.gr/index.php/component/content/article/79-scroller/479-episkepsi-tou-proedrou-tis-dimokratias-kyriou-karolou-papoylia-sto-aleksandreio-idryma|title=Visit of the President of the Republic Mr Karolos Papoulias at the Alexander Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are concerts, lectures and guided tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandreon.edu.gr/index.php/2013-10-20-17-44-00/video-aleksandreiou|title=Video about the Alexandrion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Exhibition==
All paintings, exhibits and plaques exhibited in the U-shaped building have a relation to [[Alexander the Great]]. Beginning with his birthplace [[Pella]], all the stations of his short life are illuminated. The largest chart shows his campaign from Macedonia to India. The individual stages of this campaign are detailed displayed.

Greek and English commentaries of [[Vergina]], Pella and Dion explain Alexander's life in these places. A map showing all the ancient Macedonian places and a copy of the mosaic of the Alexander battles against the Persians. ([[Alexander mosaic]]) from Pompei.

'''''At the Earth's Core''''' is a 1976 British-American [[fantasy]]-[[science fiction film]] produced by Britain's [[Amicus Productions]].&lt;ref name="gary"&gt;Gary A. Smith, ''The American International Pictures Video Guide'', McFarland 2009 p 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was [[film director|directed]] by [[Kevin Connor (director)|Kevin Connor]] and starred [[Doug McClure]], [[Peter Cushing]] and  [[Caroline Munro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At the Earth's Core (1976)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/at_the_earths_core/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed in [[Technicolor]], and based on the [[fantasy]] novel ''[[At the Earth's Core (novel)|At the Earth's Core]]'', by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the first book of his [[Pellucidar]] series, in token of which the film is also known as ''Edgar Rice Burroughs' At the Earth's Core''. The original music score was composed by [[Mike Vickers]].

==Plot==
Dr. Abner Perry ([[Peter Cushing]]), a British [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[scientist]], and his US financier [[David Innes]] ([[Doug McClure]]) make a test run of their ''Iron Mole'' drilling machine in a [[Wales|Welsh]] mountain, but end up in a strange underground [[Pellucidar|labyrinth]] ruled by a species of giant telepathic flying reptiles, the Mahars, and full of prehistoric monsters and cavemen. 

They are captured by the Mahars, who keep primitive humans as their slaves through [[mind control]]. David falls for the beautiful slave girl Princess Dia ([[Caroline Munro]]) but when she is chosen as a sacrificial victim in the Mahar city, David and Perry must rally the surviving human slaves to rebel and not only save her but also win their freedom.

==Production==
The film was made following the success of ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1975 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]''.&lt;ref name="amicus"&gt;Ed. Allan Bryce, ''Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood'', Stray Cat Publishing, 2000 p 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Connor later recalled, "we tried to get the beasts bigger so as to interact better with the actors – more one on one. We had a somewhat bigger budget thanks to the success of ‘Land.’ The beasts were specially designed so that small stunt guys could work inside the suits in a crouched position and on all-fours. Needless to say it was very cramped and the stunt guys had to take frequent breathers. Some worked better than others – but we were experimenting and trying something different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heyuguys.com/the-studio-that-time-forgot-an-interview-with-amicus-director-kevin-connor/|title=The Studio That Time Forgot – An Interview With Amicus Director Kevin Connor|first=Ross |last=Jones-Morris|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The movie was popular, becoming the 18th most profitable British film of 1976.&lt;ref name="amicus"/&gt; 

Amongst contemporary critics however, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wasn't impressed: "All the money used to make "At the Earth's Core" seems to have been spent on building monsters with parrotlike beaks that open, close, and emit a steady squawling as if someone were vacuuming next door. Close up, the monsters look like sections of rough concrete wall, and the decision to film them in close up is only one example of the total lack of talent or effort with which the picture is made...the movie is a kind of no-talent competition in which the acting, the script, the direction and the camera-work vie for last place";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/08/28/archives/earths-core-monstrous.html|title='Earth's Core' Monstrous|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while more recently, in more positive vein, the [[BFI Screenonline]] found it "Extravagant, colourful and thoroughly preposterous, At the Earth's Core is utterly without pretension but has the exuberant charm of the best of its decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1017379/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: At The Earth's Core (1976)|website=www.screenonline.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film was featured in the season finale of the revived ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the show's eleventh season overall, released on April 14, 2017 through Netflix.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5214">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Chandrasekhar's ''X''- and ''Y''-function}}
In atmospheric [[radiation]], '''Chandrasekhar's ''X''- and Y-function''' appears as the solutions of problems involving [[Diffuse reflection|diffusive reflection]] and transmission, introduced by the [[Indian American]] [[astrophysicist]] [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan. Radiative transfer. Courier Corporation, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell, John R., M. Pinar Menguc, and Robert Siegel. Thermal radiation heat transfer. CRC press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Modest, Michael F. Radiative heat transfer. Academic press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hottel, Hoyt Clarke, and Adel F. Sarofim. Radiative transfer. McGraw-Hill, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sparrow, Ephraim M., and Robert D. Cess. "Radiation heat transfer." Series in Thermal and Fluids Engineering, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1978, Augmented ed. (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The Chandrasekhar's ''X''- and ''Y''-function &lt;math&gt;X(\mu),\ 
Y(\mu) &lt;/math&gt; defined in the interval &lt;math&gt;0\leq\mu\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies the pair of nonlinear integral equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X(\mu) &amp;= 1+ \mu \int_0^1 \frac{\Psi(\mu')}{\mu+\mu'}[X(\mu)X(\mu')-Y(\mu)Y(\mu')] \, d\mu',\\[5pt]
Y(\mu) &amp;= e^{-\tau_1/\mu} + \mu \int_0^1 \frac{\Psi(\mu')}{\mu-\mu'}[Y(\mu)X(\mu')-X(\mu)Y(\mu')] \, d\mu'
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the characteristic function &lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is an even polynomial in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; generally satisfying the condition

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1\Psi(\mu) \, d\mu \leq \frac{1}{2}, &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\tau_1&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the [[optical thickness]] of the atmosphere. If the equality is satisfied in the above condition, it is called ''conservative case'', otherwise ''non-conservative''. These functions are related to [[Chandrasekhar's H-function]] as

: &lt;math&gt;X(\mu)\rightarrow H(\mu), \quad Y(\mu)\rightarrow 0 \ \text{as} \ \tau_1\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;

and also

:&lt;math&gt;X(\mu)\rightarrow 1, \quad Y(\mu)\rightarrow e^{-\tau_1/\mu} \ \text{as} \ \tau_1\rightarrow 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Approximation==
The &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated up to ''n''th order as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X(\mu) &amp;= \frac{(-1)^n}{\mu_1\cdots\mu_n}\frac{1}{[C_0^2(0)-C_1^2(0)]^{1/2}} \frac{1}{W(\mu)}[P(-\mu) C_0(-\mu)-e^{-\tau_1/\mu}P(\mu)C_1(\mu)],\\[5pt]
Y(\mu) &amp;= \frac{(-1)^n}{\mu_1\cdots\mu_n}\frac{1}{[C_0^2(0)-C_1^2(0)]^{1/2}} \frac{1}{W(\mu)}[e^{-\tau_1/\mu}P(\mu) C_0(\mu)-P(-\mu)C_1(-\mu)]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; are two basic polynomials of order n (Refer Chandrasekhar chapter VIII equation (97)&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan. Radiative transfer. Courier Corporation, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;), &lt;math&gt;P(\mu) = \prod_{i=1}^n (\mu-\mu_i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; are the zeros of [[Legendre polynomials]] and &lt;math&gt;W(\mu)= \prod_{\alpha=1}^n (1-k_\alpha^2\mu^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are the positive, non vanishing roots of the associated characteristic equation

:&lt;math&gt;1 = 2 \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{a_j\Psi(\mu_j)}{1-k^2\mu_j^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; are the quadrature weights given by

:&lt;math&gt;a_j = \frac 1 {P_{2n}'(\mu_j)} \int_{-1}^1 \frac{P_{2n}(\mu_j)}{\mu-\mu_j} \, d\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
*If &lt;math&gt;X(\mu,\tau_1), \ Y(\mu,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt; are the solutions for a particular value of &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt;, then solutions for other values of &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; are obtained from the following [[integro-differential equation]]s

*If the abbreviations &lt;math&gt;x_n = \int_0^1 X(\mu) \Psi(\mu) \mu^n \, d\mu, \ y_n = \int_0^1 Y(\mu)\Psi(\mu) \mu^n \, d\mu, \ \alpha_n = \int_0^1 X(\mu)\mu^n \, d\mu, \ \beta_n = \int_0^1 Y(\mu) \mu^n \, d\mu&lt;/math&gt; for brevity are introduced, then we have a relation stating &lt;math&gt;(1-x_0)x_2 + y_0y_2 + \frac{1}{2} (x_1^2-y_1^2) = \int_0^1 \Psi(\mu)\mu^2 \, d\mu.&lt;/math&gt; In the conservative, this reduces to &lt;math&gt;y_0(x_2+y_2) + \frac{1}{2}(x_1^2-y_1^2)=\int_0^1 \Psi(\mu)\mu^2 \, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;
*If the characteristic function is &lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mu)=a+b\mu^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a, b &lt;/math&gt; are two constants, then we have &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0=1+\frac{1}{2}
[a(\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2)+b(\alpha_1^2-\beta_1^2)]&lt;/math&gt;.
*For conservative case, the solutions are not unique. If &lt;math&gt;X(\mu), \ Y(\mu)&lt;/math&gt; are solutions of the original equation, then so are these two functions &lt;math&gt;F(\mu)=X(\mu) + Q\mu [X(\mu) + Y(\mu)],\ G(\mu)=Y(\mu) + Q\mu[X(\mu)+Y(\mu)]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary constant.

'''Chemical oceanography''' is the study of [[ocean chemistry]]: the behavior of the [[chemical element]]s within the [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]s. The ocean is unique in that it contains - in greater or lesser quantities - nearly every naturally occurring [[chemical element|element]] in the [[periodic table]]. 

Much of chemical oceanography describes the [[biogeochemical cycle|cycling]] of these elements both within the ocean and with the other [[Earth's spheres|spheres]] of the Earth system (see [[biogeochemical cycle]]). These cycles are usually characterized as quantitative [[flux]]es between constituent [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] defined within the ocean system and as [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]]s within the ocean. Of particular global and [[climate|climatic]] significance are the cycles of the biologically active elements such as [[carbon cycle|carbon]], [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus cycle|phosphorus]] as well as those of some important trace elements such as [[iron]]. 

Another important area of study in chemical oceanography is the behaviour of [[isotopes]] (see [[isotope geochemistry]]) and how they can be used as tracers of past and present oceanographic and climatic processes. For example, the incidence of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O (the heavy isotope of oxygen) can be used as an indicator of polar [[ice sheet]] extent, and [[boron]] isotopes are key indicators of the [[pH]] and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] content of oceans in the geologic past.

The [[leningrad Codex|Westminster Leningrad Codex]] reads:{{Quote |text={{script|Hebr|אֹמַר עִם־קִנִּ֣י אֶגְוָ֑ע וְ֝כַח֗וֹל אַרְבֶּ֥ה יָמִֽים׃}} |source={{bibleref2|Job|29:18|WLC|Job 29:18 (WLC)}}}}

In one English translation, this reads:{{Quote |text=Then I thought, ‘I shall die in my nest,
    and I shall multiply my days like the phoenix; 
       -- ''New Revised Standard Version}}

In the Greek [[Septuagint]] (circa 200 BCE), the translators used the [[Ancient Greek]] expression στέλεχος φοίνικος (stélechos phoínikos, "stem/trunk of a palm tree") when they reached the Hebrew ''chol'' in Job 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academic-bible.com/en/online-bibles/septuagint-lxx/read-the-bible-text/bibel/text/lesen/?tx_buhbibelmodul_bibletext%5Bscripture%5D=Job+29%3A18|title=Job 29:18|last=|first=|date=8 March 2017|website=Academic Bible|publisher=German Bible Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}} (see also the dictionary definition of [[:wiktionary:στέλεχος|στέλεχος]], [[:wiktionary:φοῖνιξ|φοῖνιξ]] and [[:wiktionary:Φοῖνιξ|Φοῖνιξ]] at Wiktionary)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Latin [[Vulgate]] (circa 400 CE), uses ''palma'' (Latin for "palm tree").&lt;ref&gt;See the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+29%3A18&amp;version=VULGATE Vulgate], and its translation into English in the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+29%3A18&amp;version=DRA Douai-Rheims Bible].&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of English translations use the term "[[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Job|29:18|CJB|CJB}}, {{bibleref2|Job|29:18|LEB|LEB}}, {{bibleref2|Job|29:18|NABRE|NABRE}}, {{bibleref2|Job|29:18|NRSV|NRSV}}, {{bibleref2|Job|29:18|NRSVA|NRSVA}}, {{bibleref2|Job|29:18|NRSVACE|NRSVACE}}, {{bibleref2|Job|29:18|NRSVCE|NRSVCE}}, {{bibleref2|Job|29:18|WYC|WYC}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in this verse, while the [[King James Version]] and the German language [[Luther Bible]] use "Sand".&lt;ref&gt;{{br-separated entries |{{bibleref2|Job|29:18|LUTH1545|LUTH1545}}: Ich gedachte: „Ich will in meinem Nest ersterben und meiner Tage viel machen wie Sand.“ |{{bibleref2|Job|29:18|KJV|KJV}}: Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars have differed in their understanding of Job 29:18. [[Roel van den Broek|Roelof Van den Broek]] (1971) believed that "sand" was the most appropriate interpretation in this verse, following the usage in other verses. On his interpretation, "multiply my days like the sand" would be a metaphor for a long life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Van den Broek|title=The Myth of the Phoenix: According to Classical and Early Christian Traditions... Door Roelof Van Den Broek. &amp;#91;Translated from the Dutch by I. Seeger&amp;#93;.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA58|year=1971|publisher=Brill Archive|page=58-60|id=GGKEY:X2ZCYSU2Q6Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Mitchell Dahood]] (1974) argued in favor of the interpretation "phoenix" on the basis of parallels between Job and Ugaritic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Dahood, Mitchell. “ḤÔL ‘PHOENIX’ IN JOB 29:18 AND IN UGARITIC.” The Catholic Biblical Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 1, 1974, pp. 85–88., www.jstor.org/stable/43713645.&lt;/ref&gt;

The understanding of ''chol'' as a phoenix-like bird has resulted in an amount of discourse on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Slifkin (2007:235-238).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dinosaur Valley State Park''' is a [[state park]] near [[Glen Rose, Texas]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Gnis|1334378|Dinosaur Valley State Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Texas State Parks]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Dinosaur Valley State Park, located just northwest of Glen Rose in [[Somervell County, Texas|Somervell County]], is a {{convert|1524.72|acre|ha|0|sing=on}} scenic park set astride the [[Paluxy River]]. The land for the park was acquired from private owners under the State Parks Bonds Program during 1968 and opened to the public in 1972.&lt;ref name=TPWD&gt;[http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/dinosaur/ Texas Parks and Wildlife: Dinosaur Valley State Park]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to being a state park, it is also a [[National Natural Landmark]].

Eastward-dipping [[limestone]]s, [[sandstone]]s, and [[mudstone]]s of the [[Glen Rose Formation]] were deposited during the early [[Cretaceous]] Period approximately 113 million years ago along the shorelines of an ancient sea, and form the geological setting for the park area. Over the last million years or so, these layered formations have been [[erosion|eroded]], dissected and sculpted by the Paluxy River which, in many places, has cut down to resistant beds and planed off sizable exposures of rock in the river bottom.&lt;ref name=TPWD/&gt;

==Recreation==
Cross country running races are held in the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/meet/134890/results|title=UIL 4A District 8 Championship|publisher=athletic.net|accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Near Dinosaur Valley State Park, in the limestone deposits along the [[Paluxy River]], "twin sets" tracks were found in the Glen Rose Formation as early as 1908. These footprints were once thought to be evidence that humans and non-avian dinosaurs lived at the same time, but now are identified to be created by dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=John|title=Paluxy River: The Tale of the Trails|journal=Acts &amp; Facts|date=May 2013|volume=42|issue=5|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, young-Earth creationists continue to believe that humans and non-avian dinosaurs lived at the same time, a notion that is contrary to the standard view of the [[geological time scale]]. Biologist [[Massimo Pigliucci]] has noted that geologists in the 1980s "clearly demonstrated that no human being left those prints," but rather "they were in fact [[metatarsal]] dinosaur tracks, together with a few pure and simple fakes."&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci]], ''[[Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science]],'' (Sinauer, 2002, page 246): {{ISBN|0-87893-659-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of George Adams, who claimed to have found human footprints in the Glen Rose Formation, later admitted that Adams' and some others' fossil footprints were a hoax.&lt;ref name="tracks"&gt;{{cite news | title=Human footprints beside dinosaur tracks? Let's talk| publisher=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |date=August 10, 2008 | first=Bud | last=Kennedy |page = B02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zana Douglas, the granddaughter of George Adams, explained that during the 1930s depression her grandfather and other residents of Glen Rose made money by making [[moonshine]] and selling "dinosaur fossils".&lt;ref name="tracks"/&gt; The faux fossils brought $15 to $30 and when the supply ran low, they "just carved more, some with human footprints thrown in."&lt;ref name="tracks"/&gt;

'''Energy in India''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[India]]. [[Energy policy of India]] describes the policies and strategies of India for achieving sustainable [[energy security]] to its people. [[Electricity sector in India]] is the main article of electricity in India. The [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (India)|Ministry of New and Renewable Energy]] provides data regarding progress in the non-conventional energy sector.

Since 2013, total [[primary energy]] consumption in India has been the third highest in the world after China and the United States.&lt;ref name=eia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=IND&amp;src=home-b6 |title=India was the third-largest energy consumer in 2013|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdebtclock.org/energy.html |title=World energy consumption clock |publisher=US debt clock org |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is the second top coal consumer in the year 2015 after China. India ranks third in oil consumption with 195.5 million tons in 2015 after the United States and China.

==Coal==
{{See also|Coal by country|Coal mining in India}}
India was the third top [[Coal mining|coal]] producer in 2015 with 283.9 Mtoe (7.4% global share).&lt;ref name=srwe/&gt; Nearly 80% of total electricity generated (utility and captive) in India is from coal.
 
According to [[Greenpeace]] the largest coal belt in India is at [[Jharia]]. Before coal mining Jharia had forests inhabited by tribes. In 1971 the [[coal mine]]s were nationalised. [[Bharat Coking Coal Limited]] (BCCL) took over Jharia coal mines.&lt;ref name=truecost&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/true-cost-coal.pdf "The True Cost of Coal"] Greenpeace 27 November 2008 pp. 24–29&lt;/ref&gt;

India accounts for the world’s greatest concentration of [[coal seam fire]]s. Mine area suffers from pollution of air, water and land.&lt;ref name="truecost"/&gt;

== Oil and natural gas==
{{Main|Energy policy of India}}
India was the fourth top net crude oil (including crude oil products) importer of 163 Mt in 2015. India has 4.561 million barrels per day (5.7% of the world) crude oil refinery capacity which is ranked 4th globally.&lt;ref name=srwe/&gt;

==Liquefied petroleum gas==
[[File:Liquefied petroleum gas cylinders.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Cylinders with LP gas in [[India]] ]]

Nearly 8.9 million tons [[Liquefied Petroleum Gas]] (LPG) was consumed during April to September 2016 (six months) in domestic sector mainly for cooking. The number of domestic connections are 215 million (one connection for six people) with a circulation of more than 250 million LPG cylinders whose net aggregate length would form a 125,000 km long pipe line which is more than the length of total [[Indian Railways|railway track laid in India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ppac.org.in/WriteReadData/Reports/201611231215439693847DataonLPGMarketingOct16.pdf |title=LPG Profile |accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the LPG requirement is imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/india-challenges-china-as-worlds-biggest-lpg-importer/62263809|title= India challenges China as world's biggest LPG importer|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piped city gas supply in India is not yet developed on major scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/pm-modi-says-70-of-indias-population-will-have-city-gas-facility-in-2-3-years/66752204|title= PM Modi says 70% of India’s population will have city gas facility in 2-3 years|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biomass and charcoal==
[[Biomass]] is a renewable energy source and its use for energy generation is [[carbon-neutral fuel]]. It is carbon neutral because it would also release [[global warming]] [[green house gasses]] like methane and carbon dioxide when it is left to degenerate without using as energy source. Presently, only 20% of house holds in India use biomass and charcoal for cooking purpose as LPG use for cooking purpose is rising rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/nearly-80-of-indian-households-now-have-access-to-lpg-gas/63226987 |title= Nearly 80% of Indian households now have access to LPG gas |accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/niti-aayog-pitches-for-round-the-clock-power-for-all-electric-vehicles/60217855|title=NITI Aayog pitches for round-the-clock power for all electric vehicles |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition biomass is also used marginally in commercial cooking, electricity generation, process industries, etc. The total biomass use in India is nearly 177 Mtoe in the year 2013.&lt;ref name=eia/&gt; Substantial surplus crop residue is also burnt in agriculture fields for clearing the land for the next crop. Nearly 750 million tons of non edible (by cattle) biomass is available annually in India which can be put to use for higher value addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-punjab-top-producers-of-green-energy-from-farm-waste/article1-1385893.aspx|title=Maharashtra, Punjab top producers of green energy from farm waste |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huge quantity of imported coal is being used in pulverised coal-fired power stations. Raw biomass is not suitable for use in the pulverised coal mills as they are difficult to [[Hardgrove Grindability Index|grind]] into fine powder due to [[Caking (chemical engineering)|caking]] problem. However 100% biomass can be fired after [[Torrefaction]] in the pulverised coal mills for replacing imported coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sari-energy.org/PageFiles/What_We_Do/activities/worldbiofuelsmarkets/Presentations/BiofuelsShippingStorageLogistics/Michael_Wild.pdf|title=The upgrading of solid biomasss by means of Torrefaction |accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torrefied biomass plants can be integrated with existing pulverised coal-fired power stations using the available hot flue gas as heat source. [[Cofiring]] dry biomass up to 20% heat input with coal is also possible directly in pulverised coal-fired power stations without facing caking problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-coal.org.uk/documents/83524/9188/Henderson---Cofiring-of-biomass-in-coal-fired-power-plants-%E2%80%93-European-experience| title=Cofiring of biomass in coal-fired power plants – European experience|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residue biomass is burnt in the fields causing pollution problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/government-press-release/cea-has-written-to-all-states-to-use-5-10-of-118020801216_1.html| title=CEA has written to all States to use 5-10% of biomass pellets with coal for power generation in thermal power plants|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As traditional use of biomass is being replaced by [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] at faster pace, biomass burning in agriculture fields would become major source for causing higher level air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pollution-delhi-gets-whiff-of-hope-as-ntpc-steps-in-to-buy-crop-residue-from-farmers/story-nmfwHl5bDCgdi5ImQPtNQM.html| title=Air Pollution: Delhi sees hope as NTPC steps in to buy crop residue from farmers|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bio gas]] which is mainly methane/natural gas can also be used for generating protein rich cattle, poultry and fish feed in villages economically by cultivating [[Methylococcus capsulatus]] bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntva.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/04-huslid.pdf |title=BioProtein Production |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112298-food-made-from-natural-gas-will-soon-feed-farm-animals-and-us/ |title=Food made from natural gas will soon feed farm animals – and us |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cargill.com/2016/new-venture-selects-cargill-tennessee-to-produce-feedkind |title=New venture selects Cargill’s Tennessee site to produce Calysta FeedKind® Protein |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can be  put to use in cheaper production of [[algae oil]] from [[algae]] particularly in tropical countries like India which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2015/01/20150121-algenol.html#more |title=Algenol and Reliance launch algae fuels demonstration project in India |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/ExxonMobil-Announces-Breakthrough-In-Renewable-Energy.html |title=ExxonMobil Announces Breakthrough In Renewable Energy |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union government is implementing many schemes to utilise productively the agro waste or biomass in rural areas to uplift rural economy and job potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/indrapratha-gas-mahindra-mahindra-join-hands-to-stop-stubble-burning/62986917|title=Indrapratha Gas, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra join hands to stop stubble burning|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/modi-govt-plans-gobar-dhan-scheme-to-convert-cattle-dung-into-energy/63028408|title=Modi govt plans Gobar-Dhan scheme to convert cattle dung into energy|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon imports most of its energy.

As of August 2016, electricity generation capacity in Lebanon still does not meet the country's demand. Lebanon is also importing electricity from Syria.
Domestic electricity is delivered at 230V 50Hz.

'''Energy in Liechtenstein''' describes [[Energy industry|energy]] production, consumption and import in [[Liechtenstein]]. 

Liechtenstein has no domestic sources of fossil fuels and relies on imports of gas and fuels. The country is also a net importer of electricity. In 2016, its domestic energy production covered only slightly under a fourth of the country's electric supply, roughly 24,21 %. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lkw.li/angebot-und-leistungen/strom-und-waerme/energiequellen-und-stromproduktion.html |title=LKW — Energy Sources and Electricity Production|language=de|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liechtenstein's national power company is Liechtensteinische Kraftwerke (LKW, Liechtenstein Power Stations), which operates the country's existing power stations, maintains the electric grid and provides related services.

==Electricity==
[[File:Samina Kraftwerk-01.JPG|thumb|Samina Power Station in [[Vaduz]]]]

In 2010, the country's domestic electricity production amounted to 80,105 MWh. 

In 2015, the country's estimated domestic electricity production was around 68.43 million kWh.

94.2% of domestic production (76,166 MWh) was provided by hydropower, 3.12% of domestic production (3,330 MWh) was provided by fossil fuels, 2.68% of domestic production (1,361 MWh) was provided by solar or wind power generation, and 0 % (0 MWh) by nuclear power generation.

In 2010, imports of electricity to Liechtenstein amounted to roughly 270,540 MWh. None of the domestically generated electric power was exported.

In 2015, imports of electricity to Liechtenstein amounted to roughly 325.2 million kWh. There were again no exports of domestically generated electric power. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ls.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, non-renewable sources accounted for 67,35 % and renewable sources for 32,47 % of Liechtenstein's electricity supply. Energy production from non-renewables consisted of 56,88 % foreign imports of electricity produced by nuclear power, and 0,65 % of electricity produced in Liechtenstein from imported natural gas. Energy production from renewables consisted of 27,71 %  hydropower production (8,91 % imported and 18,80 % domestic), as well as 4,76 % produced domestically from solar energy. Liechtenstein's overall energy production from renewables consisted of 8,91 % imports and of 23,56 % domestic, non-export production. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lkw.li/angebot-und-leistungen/strom-und-waerme/energiequellen-und-stromproduktion.html |title=LKW — Energy Sources and Electricity Production|language=de|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy==

Energy production from renewable resources accounts for the vast majority of domestically produced electricity in Liechtenstein. Despite efforts to increase renewable energy production, the limited space and infrastructure of the country prevents Liechtenstein from fully covering its domestic needs from renewables only. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cipra.org/en/news/4481 |title=Green electricity for Liechtenstein |language=en|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroelectric ===
Liechtenstein has used hydroelectric power stations since the 1920s as its primary source of domestic energy production. By 2018, the country had 12 hydroelectric power stations in operation (4 conventional/pumped-storage and 8 fresh water power stations). Hydroelectric power production accounted for roughly 18 - 19 % of domestic needs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lkw.li/unternehmen/kraftwerke.html |title=LKW - Power stations and Facilities |language=de|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:de:Kraftwerk_Lawena|Lawena Power Station]] is the oldest in the country, opened in 1927. The power station underwent reconstructions in 1946 and 1987. Today, it also includes a small museum on the history of electricity production in Liechtenstein. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lkw.li/unternehmen/kraftwerke/wasserkraftwerk-und-museum-lawena.html |title=LKW - Hydroelectric power station Lawena |language=de|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:de:Kraftwerk_Samina|Samina Power Station]], currently the largest of the domestic power stations, has been operational since December 1949. In 2011-2015, it underwent a reconstruction that converted it into a pumped-storage hydroelectric power station. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lkw.li/unternehmen/kraftwerke/wasserkraftwerk-samina.html |title=LKW - Hydroelectric power station Samina |language=de|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar ===
In recent decades, renewable energy efforts in Liechtenstein have also branched out into solar energy production. Most solar energy is generated by photovoltaic arrays mounted on buildings (usually roofing), rather than dedicated solar power stations. Currently, the largest photovoltaic array in the country is the one atop the Gründenmoos tennis hall, with an installed power output of 112 kWp. Other examples include industrial buildings in [[Balzers]] (80 kWp and 70 kWp), a logistics centre in [[Schaan]] (86 kWp), an agricultural building in [[Triesen]] (40 kWp), and industrial buildings in [[Vaduz]] (40 kWp), [[Schaanwald]] (36 kWp) and Triesen (30 kWp). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lkw.li/angebot-und-leistungen/installation/photovoltaik.html |title=LKW - Photovoltaics |language=de|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumption==
In 2010, total consumption of electricity in the Principality of Liechtenstein amounted to roughly 350,645 MWh. 

In 2015, total consumption of electricity in the Principality of Liechtenstein amounted to roughly 393.6 million kWh. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ls.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feofaniya''' ({{lang-uk|Феофанія}}; also called '''''Theophania''''') is a park located in the [[Subdivisions of Kiev#Historical neighborhoods|historical neighborhood]] on a [[Land lot|tract]] near the southern outskirts of [[Kiev]], the capital of [[Ukraine]]. The neighborhood is located in the [[Subdivisions of Kiev#Raions of Kiev|administrative]] [[Holosiivskyi Raion]] ([[raion|district]]) amidst the neighborhoods of Holosiiv, Teremky, [[Pyrohiv (Kiev)|Pyrohiv]] and [[Khotiv]]. The park's total area is about {{convert|1.5|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. In Feofania was built the first Soviet computer [[MESM]] by Lebedev team.

Feofaniya was first mentioned in 1471 as ''Lazorivschyna'' (Лазорівщина), which at the time belonged to an owner named Khodiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wek.kiev.ua/uk/Феофанія|title=Feofaniya|accessdate=2008-02-13|work=Wiki-Encyclopedia Kiev|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is said to derive from a monk named Lazar. In the 17th century, the area was referred to as ''Shakhravschyna'' (Шахравщина).&lt;ref name="kyiv"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kudrytskyi|first=A.|title=Kyiv, Encyclopedic Directory|year=1981|publisher=Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia|location=[[Kiev]]|pages=649}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The modern name ''Feofaniya'' dates back to 1803 when Feofan Shiyanov settled in the area, set aside for charity purposes. During the 1860s, Feofaniya belonged to the [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] in central Kiev. Buildings built in the area were constructed in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style, however, they did not survive.&lt;ref name="kyiv"/&gt; In 1919, Feofaniya was converted to the [[sovkhoz|Soviet state farm]], and later transformed into the main observatory for the Institute of Botany of the Ukrainian Academy of Science.

In 1972, Feofaniya was declared a park, and from 1992—a government designated park, which belongs to the "Feofaniya" conservatory of the [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine]]. Reconstruction work began on the area in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Ukrainian law|type=Decree of the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet of Ministers]]|number=654-р|law=654-2004-р|name=Про затвердження ескізного проекту реконструкції та благоустрою парку - пам'ятки садово-паркового мистецтва загальнодержавного значення "Феофанія"|date=2004-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, when finished (projected in 2008) will include new [[landscaping]], water and canal features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kiev park "Feofania" plans to finish reconstruction works in 2008 |url=http://www.podrobnosti.ua/technologies/nature/2006/08/15/339868.html |work=[[Podrobnosti|podrobnosti.ua]] |date=August 15, 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-13 |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221105112/http://www.podrobnosti.ua/technologies/nature/2006/08/15/339868.html |archivedate=2008-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Olga |last=Hryhorenko |title=Feofaniya — the new "Tsar's Village"? |url=http://www.dt.ua/3000/3320/47123/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802045803/http://www.dt.ua/3000/3320/47123/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2012 |work=[[Zerkalo Nedeli|Mirror Weekly]] |date=July 17–23, 2004 |accessdate=2008-02-13 |language=Ukrainian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4662">[[Image:Goos-Hanchen-Shift.svg|right|thumbnail|300px|Ray diagram illustrating the physics of the Goos–Hänchen effect]]

The '''Goos–Hänchen effect''' (named after [[Fritz Goos|Hermann Fritz Gustav Goos]] (1883 &amp;ndash; 1968)&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Fritz Goos]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hilda Hänchen]] (1919 &amp;ndash; 2013) is an [[optical phenomenon]] in which [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized]] light undergoes a small lateral shift, when [[Total internal reflection|totally internally reflected]]. The shift is perpendicular to the direction of propagation, in the plane containing the incident and reflected beams. This effect is the linear polarization analog of the [[Imbert–Fedorov effect]].

This effect occurs because the reflections of a finite sized beam will interfere along a line transverse to the average propagation direction. As shown in the figure, the superposition of two plane waves with slightly different angles of incidence but with the same frequency or wavelength is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\underline{E}}(x,z,t)=\mathbf{\underline{E}}^{TE/TM} \left( e^{j\mathbf{k}_1 \cdot \mathbf{r}} + e^{j\mathbf{k}_2 \cdot \mathbf{r}} \right) \cdot e^{-j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k}_{1} = k \left( \cos{\left( \theta_0 + \Delta \theta \right)} \mathbf{\hat{x}} + 
\sin{\left( \theta_0 + \Delta \theta \right)} \mathbf{\hat{z}}
\right) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k}_{2} = k \left( \cos{\left( \theta_0 - \Delta \theta \right)} \mathbf{\hat{x}} + 
\sin{\left( \theta_0 - \Delta \theta \right)} \mathbf{\hat{z}}
\right) &lt;/math&gt;

with 
:&lt;math&gt; k = \begin{matrix}\frac{\omega }{c} \end{matrix} n_1 &lt;/math&gt;.

It can be shown that the two waves generate an interference pattern transverse to the average propagation direction, 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k}_0 = k \left( \cos{\theta_0} \mathbf{\hat{x}} + \sin{\theta_0} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
and on the interface along the &lt;math&gt;(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; plane.

Both waves are reflected from the surface and undergo different phase shifts, which leads to a lateral shift of the finite beam. Therefore, the '''Goos–Hänchen effect''' is a coherence phenomenon.

This effect continues to be a topic of scientific research, for example in the context of nanophotonics applications. A negative ''Goos–Hänchen shift'' was shown by Wild and Giles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wild |first1=Walter J. |first2=C.

They report a substantial, negative lateral shift of the reflected beam in the plane of incidence for a p-polarization and a smaller, positive shift for the s-polarization case.

The '''Granitic Seychelles''' are the islands in the [[Seychelles]] which lie in central position on the [[Seychelles Bank]] and are composed of [[granite]] rock. They make up the majority of the '''Inner Islands''', which in addition include the [[coral]] islands along of the rim of the Seychelles Bank, namely [[Bird Island, Seychelles|Bird Island]] and [[Denis Island]]. 

There are [[mafic]] [[xenolith]] intrusions in the granite in some areas.  The Granitic Seychelles are fragments of the  ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], and have been separated from other continents for 75 million years.  The Granitic Seychelles form the northernmost part of the [[Mascarene Plateau]]. [[Mahé Island|Mahé]] is the largest and tallest island in the Seychelles, at 145 square km and up to 905 m elevation.

The Granitic Seychelles contrast with the [[Coralline Seychelles]] or Outer Islands, several island groups made up of low [[coral]] islands with dry, infertile soils.

The Granitic Seychelles are home to [[tropical moist forest]]s, with several endemic species, including the [[coco de mer]] (''Lodoicea maldivica''), and the [[jellyfish tree]] (''Medusagyne oppositifolia'').

There are 42 granitic islands, in descending order of size: [[Mahé Island|Mahé]], [[Praslin]], [[Silhouette Island|Silhouette]], [[La Digue]], [[Curieuse Island|Curieuse]], [[Felicite Island|Félicité]], [[Fregate Island|Frégate]], [[Ste. Anne Island|Ste. Anne]], [[North Island, Seychelles|North]], [[Cerf Island|Cerf]], [[Marianne Island|Marianne]], [[Grand Sœur Island|Grand Sœur]], [[Thérèse Island|Thérèse]], [[Aride Island|Aride]], [[Conception Island, Seychelles|Conception]], [[Petite Sœur Island|Petite Sœur]], [[Cousin Island|Cousin]], [[Cousine Island|Cousine]], Long, Récif, Round (Praslin), [[Anonyme Island|Anonyme]], [[Mamelles Island|Mamelles]], [[Moyenne Island|Moyenne]], Ile aux Vaches Marines, L'Islette, Beacon (Ile Sèche), Cachée, Cocos, Round (Mahé), L'Ilot Frégate, Booby, Chauve Souris (Mahé), Chauve Souris (Praslin), Ile La Fouche, Hodoul, L'Ilot, Rat, Souris, St. Pierre (Praslin), Zavé, Harrison Rocks (Grand Rocher).

==Flora==
The native vegetation of these islands consisted of palm, [[pandanus]] screw pines, and hardwood forest with mossy, ferny, [[cloud forest]] at higher elevations. The flora shows links with both Madagascar to the south and the African mainland to the west. Having been so isolated the islands are rich in endemic plant life including palm trees such as the [[coco de mer]].

==Fauna==
The unique lizard and reptile populations of the Seychelles include seven species of [[caecilian]] and the iconic giant tortoises, ''[[Dipsochelys arnoldi]]'' on the granitic Seychelles, and ''[[Dipsochelys dussumieri]]'' on [[Aldabra]]. There have been some extinctions but the remaining endemic birds of these islands include the Seychelles scops-owl (''[[Otus insularis]]'') and the Seychelles paradise-flycatcher (''[[Terpsiphone corvina]]'').

==Threats and preservation==
200 years of human settlement has seen the removal of much of the ancient habitat (including planting of coconut, vanilla and cinnamon), and the introduction of damaging invasive species. The [[Vallée de Mai]] on Praslin is the largest example of natural palm forest and is a World Heritage Site.

As the surge of water and sand brought to land by a wave retreats seaward, the film of water becomes thinner until it forms rhomboid shaped patterns in the sand. Small fans form at the apex of the rhombic features, which are eventually fed by the remaining backflow of water traveling downslope. Channels begin to form headward in the form of millimeter wide rills along the sides of the fans; the creation of these small channel networks culminates when the last of the backwash dissipates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This is one of the processes involved in the formation of [[gully|gullies]], such as [[lavaka]].  Erosion by sapping tends to produce steep-sided [[U-shaped valley]]s of fairly uniform width with box-like, "theater-shaped" [[headwall]]s.  This contrasts with the more common branching or ''dendritic'' pattern of V-shaped valleys produced by overland flows that become wider with distance from their source.  Groundwater sapping has been suggested as the cause for erosion of the valley and channel networks on [[Valley networks (Mars)|Mars]], although studies show that groundwater alone can not excavate and transport the material required to create these canyons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1156630|title=Formation of Box Canyon, Idaho, by Megaflood: Implications for Seepage Erosion on Earth and Mars|year=2008|last1=Lamb|first1=M.

==Geomorphology and geology==
Sapping typically occurs in permeable [[sandstone]]s associated with high water tables underlain by an impermeable layer. Limited in its ability to travel vertically, water is forced to travel laterally where it eventually seeps out of the ground. [[Limestone]]s, [[siltstone]]s, and [[shale]]s can be found in valleys created by groundwater sapping as well.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.colorado.edu/geography/geomorph/rosenberry/#What%20is%20sapping%20photo|title = University of Colorado|date = |accessdate = |website = Ground-water Sapping and the Generation of Natural Ampitheaters|publisher = |last = Rosenberry|first = Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristic landforms==
Characteristic landforms caused by groundwater sapping are “theater-shaped” channel heads and “U-shaped” valleys, which have a consistent width and steep valley walls.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Morphology of Large Valleys on Hawaii: Evidence for Groundwater Sapping and Comparisons with Martian Valleys|last = Kochel|first = R.C.|date = 1986|journal = Journal of Geophysical Research|doi = 10.1029/jb091ib13p0e175|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Piper|first2 = J.F.|volume = 91|pages = 175–192|bibcode = 1986JGR....91E.175K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weakened basal rocks are unable to support more resistant upper layers, causing valley head and sidewalls to collapse inwards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Theater-shaped channel heads are characterized by overhanging sidewalls that are relatively dry compared to the lower level rocks below the zone of seepage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The development of theater heads has been related to “ground-water flow direction, jointing and faulting, permeability contrasts, formation slope and dip angles, and formation cohesion”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The morphology of channels and valleys created by sapping are highly dependent on regional scale geology, and can be hard to distinguish from features created through alternative processes. Chemical precipitates can be used as indicators of groundwater water discharge implying that a valley or channel may have been formed as a result of sapping. These sorts of clues are important in areas where water is not currently being discharged.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Notable landmarks==

===Colorado Plateau===
{{main|Colorado Plateau}}
Many “natural amphitheaters” can be found near the [[Colorado River]]. It is thought that sapping may have been more common in this area in the past when there was a higher water table. A shift in the climate and associated precipitation or the incision of the Colorado River are two factors that may have caused a change in the water table level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Mars===
{{main|Mars}}
Short, stream-like, deep channels have been observed on Mars. Very similar to valleys created by groundwater sapping here on Earth, the discovery of the Martian valleys has prompted numerous studies that aim to better understand the process of sapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Origin of the Valley Networks on Mars: a Hydrological Perspective|last = Gulick|first = V.C.|date = 2001|journal = Geomorphology|doi = 10.1016/s0169-555x(00)00086-6|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 37|pages = 241–268|bibcode = 2001Geomo..37..241G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guinean montane forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of [[West Africa]]

The ecoregion occupies the portions of the [[Guinea Highlands]] lying above 600 meters elevation, extending across portions of [[Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. It includes the [[Fouta Djallon]] plateau and the massifs of [[Ziama Massif|Ziama]], [[Simandou]], Tétini, Béro, Kourandou in Guinea, the [[Loma Mountains]] and [[Tingi Hills]] in Sierra Leone, the [[Nimba Range]] in Guinea, Liberia, and Côte d'Ivoire, and the [[Monts du Toura]] in Côte d'Ivoire. [[Mount Bintumani]] in the Loma Mountains is the highest peak in West Africa west of [[Mount Cameroon]]. The next highest peaks in the region are in the [[Sankan Biriwa]] massif (1850 meters) in the Tingi Hills.

Average rainfall is between 1,600–2400&amp;nbsp;mm per year and many important rivers have their sources in these mountains.&lt;ref&gt;"Guinean montane forests." WWF ecoregion profile. Accessed November 16, 2012 [http://worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0114]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
These mountains have a distinct plant cover in various phases according to elevation, with up to 35 endemic species including a ''[[Rhipidoglossum]]'' orchid found only on Mount Nimba. Common plant types in the humid mountain valleys include ''[[Uapaca]] togoensis, [[Cola (plant)|Cola lateritia]] maclaudii, [[Parinari excelsa]], [[Piptadeniastrum]] africanum'' and ''[[Canarium schweinfurthii]]''. Higher altitudes of the Loma and the Tingi are covered with a savanna of ''[[Syzygium]], [[Kotschya]] ochreata, [[Monechma]] depauperatum'', and the tree ferns,'' [[Cyathea subg. Cyathea]] manniana'' and ''[[Cyathea dregei]].'' Other areas of high prairie are known for [[Gladiolus]], ''[[Solenostemon]] monostachyus latericola, [[Cyanotis]] longiflora,'' and ''[[Thesium]] tenuissimum''. Finally the high gallery forest is dominated by ''[[Parinari excelsa]]'' with the tree fern, ''[[Cyathea camerooniana]]'', and the bamboo, ''[[Oxytenanthera]] abyssinica''.

''[[Pitcairnia feliciana]]'', the only species of [[Bromeliad]] native outside the Americas, is endemic to the Fouta Jallon.&lt;ref&gt;"Fouta-Djalon". 'Freshwater Ecoregions of the World. Accessed 30 September 2015. [http://www.feow.org/ecoregions/details/510]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Leopards ''(Panthera pardus)'' are the largest predator in the ecoregion. The ecoregion supports populations of the endangered [[Western chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes verus'').

Near-endemic birds include Sierra Leone prinia (''[[Prinia leontica]]'') and the iris glossy-starling (''[[Coccycolius iris]]'').

Endemic amphibians include the Western Nimba toad ''([[Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis]])'', found only in the montane grasslands of the Nimba Range, and which is totally [[viviparous]]. The Guinea Screeching Frog (''[[Arthroleptis crusculum]]'') is a threatened species found in the Nimba Range, Mounts Béro, Tétini, and Foko, the Simandou Range (Mts. Tibe and Fon), Loma Mountains, and Tingi Hills in high-altitude grasslands and in gallery forests during the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/54369/0 "Arthroleptis crusculum" IUCN Red List. Accessed 28 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ptychadena submascareniensis]]'' is another frog species that has been found only on Mt. Nimba and in the Loma Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;"Ptychadena submascareniensis". IUCN Red List. Accessed 28 September 2015. [http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/58526/0]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
The landscape has been badly affected by mining on Mount Nimba and general clearance for farming as well as more recent civil war in Sierra Leone and Liberia.  Despite its park status iron ore mining on Mount Nimba was still ongoing up until the Liberian Civil War, while the Loma Mountains are perhaps the best preserved part of the region.

===Protected areas===
Protected areas include:
* Gueoule and Mont Glo forest reserves, Côte d'Ivoire
* Kounounkan Forest Reserve, Guinea
* [[Loma Mountains]] Non-hunting Forest Reserve, Sierra Leone
* [[Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve]], Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire (with plans to extend into Liberia)
* [[Mont Sângbé National Park]], Côte d'Ivoire
* [[Tingi Hills]] Non-hunting Forest Reserve, Sierra Leone
* [[Ziama Strict Nature Reserve]], Guinea

'''Jambavana''' also known as '''Jambavanta''' is a real character originating in [[Indian epic poetry]], popularly found in Ramyana. The King of Bears, he is an asiastic or sloth bear in Indian epic tradition (though he is also described as a monkey in other scriptures), immortal to all but his father [[Brahma]].&lt;ref name=dict&gt;Patricia Turner, Charles Russell Coulter. ''Dictionary of ancient deities''. 2001, page 248&lt;/ref&gt; Several times he is mentioned as Kapishreshtha (Foremost among the monkeys) and other epithets generally given to the Vanaras. He is known as Riksharaj (King of the Rikshas). Rikshas are earlier described as similar to Vanaras but in later versions of Ramayana Rikshas are described as bears. He was created by Brahma, to assist [[Rama]] in his struggle against [[Ravana]].&lt;ref name=dict /&gt;

Jambavana was present at the [[ocean of milk|churning of the ocean]], and is supposed to have circled [[Vamana]] seven times when he was acquiring the three worlds from [[Mahabali]].

* Jaambavamtudu ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]),
*Jamvanta,
* Jambavantha,
* Jambavat,
* Jambuvan,

== Legend ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
[[File:Jambavan.jpg|thumb|Jambavan]]
Jambavan in his previous life was the King of the Himalayas who had incarnated as a bear in order to serve Lord Rama. He received a boon from Lord Rama that he would have a long life, and have the strength of ten million lions. In the epic ''[[Ramayana]]'', Jambavantha helped Rama find His wife [[Sita]] and fight her abductor, Ravana. It is he who makes [[Hanuman]] realize his immense capabilities and encourages Him to fly across the ocean to search for Sita in Lanka. In the Mahabharata, Jambavantha had killed a lion, who had acquired a gem called Syamantaka from Prasena after killing him. Krishna was suspected of killing Prasena for the jewel, so He tracked Prasena's steps until He learned that he had been killed by a lion who had been killed by a bear. Krishna tracked Jambavantha to his cave and a fight ensued. The combat between Krishna and Jambavan ensued for 27/28 days (per Bhagavata Purana) and 21 days (per Vishnu Purana) after which Jambavan began to grow tired. Then realizing who Krishna was, Jambavantha submitted. He gave Krishna the gem and also presented Him his daughter [[Jambavati]], who became one of Krishna's wives.

Jambavan mentions two past incidents in his life in the Ramayana.

Once at the foot of Mount Mahendra, where Hanuman is about to take a leap and mentions that he could have jumped over the ocean to Lanka except that he got injured when he was beating the drum for Vishnu during the Vamana Avatara when the Supreme God measured the three worlds. Vamana's shoulder struck Jambavan and he was injured which limited his mobility.

And once during the Samudra-Manthan,he was present at the time of the event. He got to know about the all-curing plant Vishalyakarni from the gods there and he later used this information to convey Hanuman to help an injured Laxmana who was rendered unconscious by Indrajit.

== Anecdotes ==
Jambavan, together with Parasuram and Hanuman, is considered to be one of the few to have been present for both Ram and Krishna avatars.
Said to have been present for the churning of the ocean and thus witness to the Kurma avatar, and further the Vaman avatar, Jambavan may well be the longest lived of the chiranjivis and have been witness to nine avatars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jambavan: The only one who saw Lord Rama and Krishna|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-slideshow/seekers/god-and-i/jambavan-the-only-one-who-saw-lord-rama-and-krishna?track=cntshfb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing style was eclectic and personal, meditative and detailed, and though she was at least once accused of "taking poetic license too far"&lt;ref name="bryn_mawr"&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-06.html Criticism of Lembke's translation of ''The Georgics'']. ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in her translation of ''Georgics'', readers were often charmed and seduced by her way of weaving scientific fact, history and culture, with personal anecdote, mythological allusion and poetic feeling. "The author's ability to pull together disparate elements in her writing is impressive, and her passionate connection with the natural world is displayed in line after line," wrote [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref name="skinnydipping_nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/books/in-short-nonfiction-040029.html|title=SKINNY DIPPING And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human.

'''Karbonite gears''' are a reinforced plastic composite material used  in [[Hitec]] [[RC servo]]s that show almost five times the strength of nylon [[gear]]s and better wear resistance. Cycle times of over 300,000 have been observed with these gear trains showing virtually no wear. Karbonite-geared servos are more expensive than those using nylon ones but are highly durable.&lt;ref name="robots"&gt;Society of Robots: [http://societyofrobots.com/actuators_servos.shtml Actuators - Servos]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbyists are advised avoid use of [[thread locking compound]]s on Karbonite as this will cause the plastic to fail.

The '''Late Triassic''' is the third and final of three [[epoch (geology)|epochs]] of the [[Triassic]] [[geological timescale|Period]] in the [[geologic timescale]]. The [[Triassic-Jurassic extinction event]] began during this epoch and  is one of the five major mass extinction events of the Earth. The corresponding [[series (stratigraphy)|series]] is known as the '''Upper Triassic'''. In Europe the epoch was called the [[Keuper]], after a German [[lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphic]] [[group (stratigraphy)|group]] (a sequence of [[rock strata]]) that has a roughly corresponding age. The Late Triassic spans the time between {{Period start|Upper-Triassic}} [[annum|Ma]] and {{Period start|Lower-Jurassic}} Ma (million years ago). The Late Triassic is divided into the [[Carnian]], [[Norian]] and [[Rhaetian]] [[Geologic time scale|ages]].

Many of the first [[dinosaur]]s evolved during the Late Triassic, including ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', ''[[Coelophysis]]'', and ''[[Eoraptor]]''.

The extinction event that began during the Late Triassic resulted in the disappearance of about 76% of all terrestrial and marine life species, as well as almost 20% of taxonomic families. Although the Late Triassic Epoch did not prove to be as destructive as the preceding [[Permian]] Period, which took place approximately 50 million years earlier and destroyed about 70% of land species, 57% of insect families as well as 95% of [[marine life]], it resulted in great decreased in population sizes of many living organism populations.

Specifically, the Late Triassic had negative effects on the [[conodont]]s and [[ammonoid]] groups. These groups once served as vital [[index fossil]]s, which made it possible to identify feasible life span to multiple strata of the Triassic strata. These groups were severely affected during the epoch, and became extinct soon after. Despite the large populations that withered away with the coming of the Late Triassic, many families, such as the [[pterosaur]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[mammal]]s and fish were very minimally affected. However, such families as the [[bivalve]]s, [[gastropod]]s, [[marine reptile]]s and [[brachiopod]]s were greatly affected and many species became extinct during this time.

==Causes of the extinction==
Most of the evidence suggests the increase of volcanic activity was the main cause of the extinction.  As a result of the rifting of the super continent Pangea, there was an increase in widespread volcanic activity which released large amounts of carbon dioxide.  At the end of the Triassic period, massive eruptions occurred along the rift zone, known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, for about 500,000 years.  These intense eruptions were classified as flood basalt eruptions, which are a type of large scale volcanic activity that releases a huge volume of lava in addition to sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide.  The sudden increase in carbon dioxide levels is believed to have enhanced the greenhouse effect, which acidified the oceans and raised average air temperature.  As a result of the change in biological conditions in the oceans, 22% of marine families became extinct. In addition, 53% of marine genera and about 76-86% of all species became extinct, which vacated ecological niches; thus, enabling dinosaurs to become the dominant presence in the Jurassic period.  While the majority of the scientists agree that volcanic activity was the main cause of the extinction, other theories suggest the extinction was triggered by the impact of an asteroid, climate change, or rising sea levels.

==Carnian Age==
The Carnian Age is the first stage of the three to occur during the duration of the mass extinction era. The Carnian age developed about 228 to 217 million years ago, and signals the start of the Late Triassic Epoch. The Carnian stage can further be broken down to relative species activity during the time, based on fossils and evidence found dating back to this time period. For example, marine life such as ''serenites nanseni'' and ''Trachyceras Obesum'' can be dated back to the early Carnian stage. Meanwhile, ''Tropites Dilleri,'' ''Tropites Welleri'' and ''klamathites macrolobatus'' can all be dated back to the late Carnian stage, During the Carnian era, archosaurs took on a powerful role in existence and domination in terms of land and resources. The archosaur species included animals similar to today's crocodile and general large lizards. Many families of prehistoric animals existed during this time period, such as the phytosaurs, ornithosuchids, prestosuchids, rauisuchids and poposaur archosaurs populated many areas of the earth, and were scattered among areas such as today's India, North America, South America, Africa and Britain. Evidence of fossils of such prehistoric animals have been found in these parts of the world. However, during the Carnian time period, separation of the northern areas began to occur, which separated the Laurasian supercontinent existing at the time. In addition, the Gondwanaland supercontinent of the South also began to separate and disperse itself. However, Pangaea was still intact at this time. During these land mass separations, regions were extremely tectonically active, which caused cataclysmic flows of lava, which would eventually lead to rift lines and land separation. Inevitably, this signified the start to the eventual Late Triassic mass extinction.

==Norian Age==
The Norian age is the second stage of the three to occur during the duration of the triassic mass extinction. This stage developed about 217 to 204 million years ago. This stage comes after the Carnian stage, and is known for its rising populations of mesozoic organisms as well as the decline in populations of previous species that had once played important roles in the environment. This stage identifies with its own species of ammonoid index fossils, which is how it differs from the preceding Carnian stage. In this stage, fossils and evidence of ''Cyrtopleurites bicrenatus'' are found in these different areas of the world, which seem to be more complex and advanced than those in the preceding stage of the era. Many species alive during the Norian age that eventually became extinct lived either in the Tethys-Panthalassan reef province, or the West Pangean reef province. in the Tethys-Panthalassan province, species saw considerable amounts of populations becoming extinct here. Species such as the sphinctozoid as well as other species began dying out, and by the end of the Norian stage, about 90% of these species evolved and remained in the area. Further evidence shows that scientists discovered major rises in sea level towards later years of the stage, in which new taxa came into play.

==Rhaetian Age==
The Rhaetian age was the final stage of the Triassic era's mass extinction, in succession to the Norian stage, and was last major disruption of life until the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. This stage of the Triassic is known for its extinction of marine reptiles, such as nothosaurs and shashtosaurs with the ichthyosaurs, similar to today's dolphin. This stage was concluded with the disappearance of many species that removed types of plankton from the face of the earth, as well as some organisms known for reef-building, and the pelagic conodonts. In addition to these species that became extinct, the straight-shelled nautoloids, placodonts, bivalves and many types of reptiles did not survive through this stage.

==Climate and environment during the Triassic Period==
During the beginning of the Triassic Era, the earth consisted of a giant landmass known as Pangea, which covered about a quarter of earth's surface.  Towards the end of the era, continental drift occurred which separated Pangea.  At this time, polar ice was not present because of the large differences between the equator and the poles.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} A single, large landmass similar to Pangea would be expected to have extreme seasons; however, evidence offers contradictions. Evidence suggests that there is arid climate as well as proof of strong precipitation. The planet's atmosphere and temperature components were mainly warm and dry, with other seasonal changes in certain ranges.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The Middle Triassic was known to have consistent intervals of high levels of humidity. The circulation and movement of these humidity patterns, geographically, are not known however.  The major "Carnian Pluvial Event" stands as one focus point of many studies.  Different hypotheses of the events occurrence include eruptions, monsoonal effects, and changes caused by plate tectonics.  Continental deposits also support certain ideas relative to the Triassic period.  Sediments that include red beds, which are sandstones and shales of color, may suggest seasonal precipitation.  Rocks also included dinosaur tracks, mudcracks, and fossils of crustaceans and fish, which provide climate evidence, since animals and plants can only live during periods of which they can survive through.

===Evidence of environmental disruption and climate change===
The Late Triassic is described as semiarid. Semiarid is characterized by light rainfall, having up to 10-20 inches of precipitation a year. The period had a fluctuating, warm climate in which it was occasionally marked by instances of powerful heat. Different basins in certain areas of Europe provided evidence of the emergence of the “Middle Carnian Pluvial Event." For example, the Western Tethys and German Basin was defined by the theory of a middle Carnian wet climate phase. This event stands as the most distinctive climate change within the Triassic period. Propositions for its cause include:

* Different behaviors of atmospheric or oceanic circulation forced by plate tectonics may have participated in modifying the carbon cycle and other scientific factors.
* heavy rains due to shifting of the earth
* sparked by eruptions, typically originating from an accumulation of igneous rocks, which could have included liquid rock or volcanic rock formations

Theories and concepts are supported universally, due to extensive areal proof of Carnian siliciclastic sediments. The physical positions as well as comparisons of that location to surrounding sediments and layers stood as basis for recording data. Multiple resourced and recurring patterns in results of evaluations allowed for the satisfactory clarification of facts and common conceptions on the Late Triassic. Conclusions summarized that the correlation of these sediments led to the modified version of the new map of Central Eastern Pangea, as well as that the sediment’s relation to the “Carnian Pluvial Event” is greater than expected.

* High interest concerning the Triassic period has fueled the need to uncover more information about the time period’s climate. The Late Triassic period is classified as a phase entirely flooded with phases of monsoonal events. A monsoon affects large regions and brings heavy rains along with powerful winds. Field studies confirm the impact and occurrence of strong monsoonal circulation during this time frame. However, hesitations concerning climatic variability remains. Upgrading knowledge on the climate of a period is a difficult task to assess. Understanding of and assumptions of temporal and spatial patterns of the Triassic period’s climate variability still need revision. Diverse proxies hindered the flow of palaeontological evidence. Studies in certain zones are missing and could be benefited by collaborating the already existing but uncompared records of Triassic palaeoclimate.
* A specific physical piece of evidence was found. A fire scar on the trunk of a tree, found in southeast Utah, dates back to the Late Triassic. The feature was evaluated and paved the path to the conclusion of one fire’s history. It was categorized through comparison of other modern tree scars. The scar stood as evidence of Late Triassic [[wildfire]], an old climatic event.

===Biological impact===
The impacts that the Late Triassic era had on surround environments and organisms were wildfire destruction of habitats and prevention of photosynthesis. Climatic cooling also occurred due to the soot in the atmosphere. Studies also show that 103 families of marine invertebrates became extinct at the end of the Triassic, yet another 175 lived on into the jurassic. Marine and extant species were hit fairly hard by extinctions during this period. Almost 20% of 300 extant families became extinct, and Bivalves, Cephalopods, and Brachiopods suffered greatly. 92% of Bivalves were wiped out episodically throughout the Triassic.

The end of the Triassic also brought about the decline of corals and reef builders during what is called a “reef gap”. The changes in sea levels brought this decline upon corals, particularly the Calcisponges and Scleractinian corals. However, some corals would make a resurgence during the Jurassic period. 17 Brachiopod species were also wiped out by the end of the Triassic. Furthermore, Conulariids became entirely extinct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9109">The '''League to Enforce Peace''' (LEP) was an American organization established in 1915 to promote the formation of an international body for world peace. It was formed in Philadelphia by American citizens concerned by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in Europe.

==History==
Early efforts to support the formation of an international organization to contain and respond to violence once the current hostilities ended began in 1914 with speaking tours to arouse support. Advocates worked to distinguish their efforts from contemporary anti-war efforts that aimed at preventing American participation in the war and to counter misimpression that they were trying to end the war in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1914/07/31/archives/seek-to-stir-west-for-peace-league-taft-and-other-leaders-will.html "Seek to Stir West for Peace League," July 31, 1914], accessed January 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hamilton Holt]] published an editorial in his New York City weekly magazine the ''Independent'' called "The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal" on September 28, 1914. It called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt's plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Viscount James Bryce]], a former ambassador from the U.K. to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, 56-7&lt;/ref&gt;

At a convention in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia's]] [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] on June 17, 1915, with the LEP's first president, former U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]], presiding, one hundred noteworthy Americans formally announced the formation of the League to Enforce Peace. They proposed an international agreement in which participating nations would agree to "jointly use their economic and military force against any one of their number that goes to war or commits acts of hostility against another." The founders included [[Elihu Root]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Men and Decisions|last = Strauss|first = Lewis|publisher = Doubleday|year = 1962|isbn = 1299121713|location = Garden City, New York|pages = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Graham Bell]], Rabbi [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Stephen S. Wise]], [[James Gibbons|James Cardinal Gibbons]] of Baltimore, and [[Edward Filene]] on behalf of the recently founded [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]]. Elected to the Executive Committee were Harvard President [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], former Cabinet member and diplomat [[Oscar S. Straus]], magazine editor Hamilton Holt, Taft, and a dozen others &lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1915/06/18/archives/league-to-enforce-peace-is-launched-american-branch-of-proposed.html "League to Enforce Peace is Launched," June 18, 1915], accessed January 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacifists rejected the LEP's notion of collective security and nationalists rejected the idea of America submitting to arbitration. The LEP's founders, on the other hand, though varied in their outlooks, expressed a long established ideal of the civilizing influence of the British Empire and American democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, 57ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial efforts of the League to Enforce Peace aimed at creating public awareness through magazine articles and speeches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The LEP combined enthusiastic support for the American war effort with its proposals for a new international order to follow the defeat of Germany. It presented its plans for an international organization to respond to any nation that would follow a course like that of German militarism.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1918/03/18/archives/to-hold-war-convention-league-to-enforce-peace-will-meet-in.html "To Hold War Convention," March 18, 1918], accessed January 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

President Wilson's specific proposal for the League of Nations met resistance from the Republican-controlled Senate and the opposition led by Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] of Massachusetts. The high-minded debate deteriorated until the ideal of international cooperation was, writes one historian, "sacrificed to party intrigue, personal antipathy, and pride of authorship."&lt;ref&gt;Yeomans, 454&lt;/ref&gt; The League to Enforce Peace believed American participation was more important than the exact nature of the organization, but found itself defending Wilson's plan against attempts to restrict American participation in it.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/07/25/archives/straus-deplores-taft-reservations-says-league-to-enforce-peace.html "Straus Deplores Taft Reservations," July 25, 1919], accessed January 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; When the U.S. Senate debated the treaty with Germany, the LEP specifically opposed attempts in the Senate to restrict American participation in international arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/17/archives/reed-reservation-called-fatal-league-to-enforce-peace-advises.html "Reed Reservation Called Fatal," November 17, 1919], accessed January 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1919, the League held a series of public meetings in more than half a dozen American cities in support of Wilson's League proposal.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1918/12/19/archives/send-committee-to-paris-league-to-enforce-peace-will-support.html "Send Committee to Paris," December 19, 1918], accessed January 1, 201&lt;/ref&gt; President Wilson thanked the League for its support.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/02/15/archives/wilson-praises-support-cables-his-appreciation-to-the-league-to.html "Wilson Praises Support," February 15, 1919], accessed January 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1919, the LEP published a book of essays modeled on ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' called ''The Covenanter: An American Exposition of the Covenant of the League of Nations''. It delivered a copy to every member of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/07/02/archives/issues-the-covenanter-league-to-enforce-peace-sends-copies-to.html "Issues 'The Covenanter'," July 2, 1919], accessed January 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Lowell, Taft, and former Attorney-General [[George Woodward Wickersham|George W. Wickersham]] were the authors. The ''New York Times'' called it a "masterly analysis" and thought it perfectly suited for a broad public: "This—thank Heaven—is a brochure for the lazy-minded!"&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/07/27/archives/the-truth-about-the-league-of-nations-a-masterly-analysis-of-the.html "The Truth about the League of Nations," July 27, 1919], accessed January 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

With the formation of the [[League of Nations]] in 1919 the LEP changed focus slightly to raise grass roots American support for the League of Nations. For example, in November 1920 it analyzed the annual budgets of the League of Nations to demonstrate that participation in the League of Nations in the coming year would cost the United States "exactly one-tenth of one percent of what we spent on armaments during a single year before the war, while it would amount to something like two-thousandth of one per cent of what the direct cost of our belligerency reached in 1918."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/11/22/archives/compares-cost-of-war-and-league-of-nations-league-to-enforce-peace.html "Compares Cost of War and League of Nations," November 22, 1920], accessed January 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the LEP dissolved and it ceased operations by 1923.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou00014 |title = League to Enforce Peace (U.S.) additional papers |publisher= Harvard University Library |accessdate = 31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the League's records are held by the [[Harvard University Library]].&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

'''''[[Canna (plant)|Canna]]'' [[species]]''' have been categorised by two different [[taxonomists]] in the course of the last three decades. They are [[Paulus Johannes Maria Maas|Paul Maas]], from the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;Maas, P. J. M. (1985) Cannaceae.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maas, P. J. M. and H. Maas (1988) Cannaceae&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segeren, W &amp; Maas, PJM - The genus Canna in northern South America&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nobuyuki Tanaka]] from [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=Tanaka&gt;Tanaka, N. (2001) Taxonomic revision of the family Cannaceae in the New World and Asia.&lt;/ref&gt; Both reduced the number of species from the 50-100 that had been accepted previously, and assigned most to being [[synonyms]]. Inevitably, there are some differences in their categorisations, and the individual articles on the species describes those differences.

The reduction in numbers is also confirmed by work done by Kress and Prince at the Smithsonian Institution, however, this only covers a subset of the species range.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Linda M.* and W. John Kress. Smithsonian Institution&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Taxomic revision of the family Cannaceae in the New World and Asia'', by Dr Tanaka.&lt;ref name=Tanaka/&gt; is the latest authoritative reference, allied with the proposal to conserve the name ''Canna tuerckheimii'' over ''C. latifolia''.&lt;ref name=conserve&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2004/00000053/00000003/art00025 Proposal to conserve the name Canna tuerckheimii]&lt;/ref&gt; The most exhaustive work on Canna synonyms is that in the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families (WCSP).&lt;ref name=Kew/&gt;

The following is a '''list of mountains, peaks and hills in [[Hong Kong]]'''.

In the [[Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanisation|romanisation system]] used by the Hong Kong Government known as [[Standard Romanization (Cantonese)|Standard Romanisation]], 'shan' and 'leng' are the transliterations of the Cantonese words for 'mount' (山) and 'ridge' (嶺), respectively. 'Toi', 'kong', 'fung' and 'koi' also correspond to 'mount' in English and 'teng' corresponds to 'peak'.  It is this system which is used in the list below.

Prior to [[Europe]]an settlement, the '''[[Caribbean]]''' was dominated by [[forest]]ed [[ecosystem]]s.  The insular Caribbean has been considered a [[biodiversity hotspot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Myers|Myers, N.]], R. A. Mittermeier, C. G. Mittermeier, G. A. B. da Fonseca, and J. Kent. 2000.
Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 403:853-858.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[species diversity]] is lower than on mainland systems, [[endemism]] is high.

Species diversity is highest and endemism is lowest in [[Trinidad]], which has a predominantly continental flora.  Endemism is highest in [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]], the largest members of the [[Greater Antilles]].

The '''Madagascar lowland forests''' or '''Madagascar humid forests'''&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-humid-forests"/&gt; are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] found on the eastern coast of the island of [[Madagascar]], home to a plant and animal mix that is 80 to 90% endemic, with the forests of the eastern plain being a particularly important location of this endemism. They are included in the [[Global 200]] list of outstanding ecoregions.

==Geography==

The ecoregion constitutes a narrow strip of lowland forests between Madagascar's east coast and the mountainous central highlands, from sea level to {{convert|800|m|ft}} elevation. It covers an area of approximately {{convert|112,600|sqkm|sqmi}}. The ecoregion is under the direct influence of the oceanic [[trade winds]], which maintain a warm, humid climate; rainfall is above 2,000 mm per year and can reach up to 6,000 mm on the [[Masoala]] peninsula.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-humid-forests"/&gt;

The lowland forests extend from [[Marojejy]] in the north to the southeast corner of the island. At the northern edge of ecoregion around [[Vohemar]], the moist forests transition to the drier [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion. To the east, at approximately {{convert|800|m|ft}} elevation, the lowland forests transition gradually to the [[Madagascar subhumid forests]] ecoregion. The southern end of the ecoregion lies at the crest of the [[Anosyennes Mountains]], where a narrow belt of dry transitional forest marks the transition to the dry [[Madagascar spiny forests|spiny forests]] ecoregion in the mountains' [[rain shadow]].&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-humid-forests"/&gt;

==Flora==

The lowland forests are characterized by dense evergreen forests, 82% of which is endemic species, with a canopy exceeding {{convert|30|m|ft}}. Typical canopy species include ''[[Dalbergia]], [[Diospyros]], [[Ocotea]], [[Symphonia (plant)|Symphonia]]'', and ''[[Tambourissa]]''; emergents of ''[[Canarium]], [[Albizia]],'' and ''[[Brochoneura acuminata]]'' rise above the canopy. The lowland forests have a rich diversity of ''[[Pandanus]]'', [[palm (plant)|palm]], [[bamboo]], and [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[orchid]] species. At higher elevations the trees become shorter and have a denser undergrowth.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-humid-forests"/&gt;

==Fauna==

The lowland forests represent a great reservoir of diversity and [[endemism]]. Nearly all of Madagascar's endemic mammal genera are represented there, including all five families of [[lemur]]s.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-humid-forests"/&gt;

Fifteen species and subspecies of lemurs are endemic and near-endemic to the ecoregion, including the [[aye-aye]] ''(Daubentonia madagascariensis)'', the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] ''(Allocebus trichotis)'', both species of [[ruffed lemur]]s ''(Varecia variegata, V. rubra)'', the [[indri]] ''(Indri indri)'', the [[eastern woolly lemur]] ''(Avahi laniger)'', the [[diademed sifaka]] ''(Propithecus diadema)'', [[Milne-Edwards' sifaka]] ''(P. edwardsi)'', the [[golden bamboo lemur]] ''(Hapalemur aureus)'', the [[greater bamboo lemur]] ''(Prolemur simus)'', the [[gray-headed lemur]] ''(Eulemur cinereiceps)'', the [[collared brown lemur]] ''(E. collaris)'', and the [[red-bellied lemur]] ''(E. rubriventer)''.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-humid-forests"/&gt;
 
As well as lemurs, the forest are home to seven endemic genera of [[rodent]]s, six endemic genera of [[Carnivora|carnivorans]] and several species of bat. Rare animals include the brown-tailed mongoose (''[[Salanoia concolor]]''). Of the 165 bird species found here 42 are endemic to the region, such as the rare red-tailed newtonia (''[[Newtonia fanovanae]]''). The forests are also home to 50 endemic reptiles and 29 amphibians such as the following chameleons: ''[[Calumma gallus]]'', ''[[Calumma cucullatum]]'', ''[[Furcifer balteatus]]'', ''[[Furcifer bifidus]]'', ''[[Brookesia superciliaris]]'', and ''[[Brookesia therezieni]]''. The freshwater fish population, with more than 100 endemic species, is also unique.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-humid-forests"/&gt;

A famous extinct species is [[Delalande's coua]] (''Coua delalandei'') which has not been seen since the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-humid-forests"/&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
{{see also|List of national parks of Madagascar}}

Madagascar's lowland rainforests have been preserved generally better than the high [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|central plateau]], but there has still been substantial loss. Widespread [[slash-and-burn]] activity in the lowland rainforests is one of the major reasons. Slash-and-burn is a method sometimes used by [[shifting cultivation|shifting cultivators]] to create short term yields from marginal soils. When practiced repeatedly, or without intervening fallow periods, the [[nutrient]]-poor soils may be exhausted or eroded to an unproductive state. Another threat is the selective exploitation of some species, such as palms and [[Cyathea|tree ferns]].&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-humid-forests"/&gt;

The society started publishing a monthly bulletin from December 1978 and a quarterly journal ''Blackbuck'' from January 1985&lt;ref name="thehindu_20100621" /&gt; Blackbuck carries semi-technical articles and works of popular interest. The digitised Version of 'Blackbuck' and the monthly bulletin was unveiled on 2 July 2015 to the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://192.155.224.66/stage/mns/index.php | title=Blackbuck Digitised version| publisher=K V Sudhakar | accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An anthology of writings from the ''Blackbuck'' titled ''Sprint of the Blackbuck'' was published in 2012. The volume was edited by noted Tamil film historian and Madras Naturalists' Society member [[S. Theodore Baskaran]].

Starting from [[Madhavaiah Krishnan]]'s birth centenary year in 2012, the society annual presents a "M.

A '''mesocrystal''' is a material structure composed of numerous small crystals of similar size and shape, which are arranged in a regular 
periodic pattern. It is a form of oriented aggregation, where the small crystals have [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[crystallographic]] alignment but are spatially separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yuwono|first1=Virany M.|last2=Burrows|first2=Nathan D.|last3=Soltis|first3=Jennifer A.|last4=Penn|first4=R. Lee|title=Oriented Aggregation: Formation and Transformation of Mesocrystal Intermediates Revealed|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=132|issue=7|year=2010|pages=2163–2165|doi=10.1021/ja909769a|pmid=20112897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the sizes of individual components are at the nanoscale, mesocrystals represent a new class of nanostructured solids made from crystiallographically oriented nanoparticles. The sole criterion for determining whether a material is mesocrystal is the unique crystallographically hierarchical structure, not its formation mechanism.&lt;ref name="Song"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Song|first1=Rui-Qi|last2=Cölfen|first2=Helmut|title=Mesocrystals-Ordered Nanoparticle Superstructures|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=22|issue=12|year=2010|pages=1301–1330|pmid=20437477|doi=10.1002/adma.200901365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
Helmut Cölfen discovered and named mesocrystals in 2005 during his studies on biominerals&lt;ref name="Colfen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cölfen|first1=Helmut|last2=Antonietti|first2=Markus|title=Mesocrystals: inorganic superstructures made by highly parallel crystallization and controlled alignment|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=44|issue=35|year=2005|pages=5576-5591|pmid=16035009|doi=10.1002/anie.200500496}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He suggested that their growth was due to a non-classical, self-assembly based process.&lt;ref name="Song" /&gt;

== Structure and formation ==

Mesocrystal is an abbreviation for mesoscopically structured crystal, where individual subunits often form a perfect 3D order, as in a traditional crystal where the subunits are individual atoms.&lt;ref name="Song" /&gt;

=== Formation methods ===

==== Nanoparticle alignment by organic matrix ====

This is when a mesocrystal is formed by filling organic matrix compartments with crystalline matter. This crystalline matter would be oriented by the organic matrix. This is the process of [[biomineralization]] and this is how mesocrystals are produced in nature.&lt;ref name="Song" /&gt;

==== Ordering by physical fields ====
In most cases mesocrystals form nanoparticles in solution. These nanoparticles aggregate and arrange in crystallographic formation, without any additives.&lt;ref name="Song" /&gt; The main causes of this ordering are tensorial polarization forces and dipole fields.&lt;ref name="Lei" /&gt;

==== Mineral bridges ====
Formation with mineral bridges occur with the formation of nanocrystals. Growth is quenched at this stage by the absorption of a polymer into the nanoparticle surface. Now mineral bridges can nucleate at the defect site, within the growing inhibition layer on the nanocrystal. Through this, a new nanocrystal grows on the mineral bridge, and the growth is again stopped by the polymer. This process is repeated until the crystal builds up.&lt;ref name="Song" /&gt;

==== Space constraints and self-similar growth ====
This argument for formation of mesocrystals requires only a confined space that the reaction takes place in. As the nanoparticle grow into crystals, they have no choice but to align with each other in such a confined space.&lt;ref name="Song" /&gt;

== Applications ==

Mesocrystals have unique structural features and the physical and physiochemical properties that come from that structure have made them become a subject of interest.  Mesocrystals are expected to have a role in many different applications.  These include [[heterogeneous]] [[photocatalysts]], [[electrodes]], [[optoelectronics]], biomedical materials, and lightweight structural materials.&lt;ref name="Lei"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Lei|last2=O’Brien|first2=Paul|title=Mesocrystals — Properties and Applications|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters|volume=3|issue=5|year=2012|pages=620–628|doi=10.1021/jz2015742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The properties that make mesocrystals viable for future applications are their shared properties with nanoparticulate, [[mesoporous]], and single-crystal materials. Because mesocrystals are made up of [[nanoparticles]], the properties of the nanoparticles themselves are, in some cases, passed to the whole mesocrystal structure.  This allows for the practical application of mesocrystals because they are "potentially more stable analogues of nanoparticulate materials."  High [[porosity]] is generally a quality of mesocrystals, this is the property shared with [[mesoporous]] materials. Closed, internal pores are good for thermal and dielectric insulation and the open pores then aid in [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and could be utilized for medical delivery.  Alternatively, a mesocrystal could have its pores filled and then it would be similar to a single-crystal material and have some unusual [[electronics|electronic]] and [[optical]] properties.  The diversity of the properties of mesocrystals could allow them to be effectively utilized in many applications.&lt;ref name="Lei" /&gt;

=== In nature ===
The spines of [[sea urchins]] are composed of mesocrystals of calcite nano-crystals (92%) in a matrix of non-crystalline [[calcium carbonate]] (8%). This structure makes the spines hard but also shock-absorbing, which special property makes them effective defences against predators.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17263">'''Parent–offspring conflict''' ('''POC''') is an expression coined in 1974 by [[Robert Trivers]]. It is used to describe the [[evolutionary conflict]] arising from differences in optimal [[parental investment]] (PI) in an offspring from the standpoint of the [[parent]] and the [[offspring]]. PI is any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that decreases the parent's ability to invest in other offspring, while the selected offspring's chance of surviving increases.

POC occurs in sexually reproducing species and is based on a genetic conflict: Parents are equally related to each of their offspring and are therefore expected to equalize their investment among them. Offspring are only half or less related to their [[sibling]]s (and fully related to themselves), so they try to get more PI than the parents intended to provide even at their siblings' disadvantage. 
However, POC is limited by the close genetic relationship between parent and offspring: If an offspring obtains additional PI at the expense of its siblings, it decreases the number of its surviving siblings. Therefore, any [[gene]] in an offspring that leads to additional PI decreases (to some extent) the number of surviving copies of itself that may be located in siblings. Thus, if the costs in siblings are too high, such a gene might be selected against despite the benefit to the offspring. 
The problem of specifying how an individual is expected to weigh a relative against itself has been examined by [[W. D. Hamilton]] in 1964 in the context of [[kin selection]]. [[Kin selection#Hamilton's rule|Hamilton's rule]] says that [[altruistic behavior]] will be positively selected if the benefit to the recipient multiplied by the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the performer is greater than the cost to the performer of a social act. Conversely, selfish behavior can only be favoured when Hamilton's inequality is not satisfied. This leads to the prediction that, other things being equal, POC will be stronger under half siblings (e.g., unrelated males father a female's successive offspring) than under full siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | authorlink = Robert Trivers | year = 1974 | title = Parent-offspring conflict | url = | journal = Am.

==Occurrence==

===In plants===
In [[plants]], POC over the allocation of resources to the brood members may affect both brood size (number of [[seed]]s matured within a single fruit) and seed size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sadras | first1 = V.O. | last2 = Denison | first2 = R.F. | year = 2009 | title = Do plant parts compete for resources? An evolutionary perspective | url = | journal = New Phytol | volume = 183 | issue = 3| pages = 565–574 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02848.x | pmid = 19413690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning brood size, the most economic use of maternal resources is achieved by packing as many seeds as possible in one fruit, i.e., minimizing the cost of packing per seed. In contrast, offspring benefeits from low numbers of seeds per fruit, which reduces sibling competition before and after dispersal. Conflict over seed size arises because there usually exists an inverse exponential relationship between seed size and [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], that is, the fitness of a seed increases at a diminishing rate with resource investment but the fitness of the maternal parent has an optimum, as demonstrated by Smith and Fretwell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = C.C. | last2 = Fretwell | first2 = S.D. | year = 1974 | title = The optimal balance between size and number of offspring | url = | journal = Am. Nat. | volume = 108 | issue = 962| pages = 499–506 | doi = 10.1086/282929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[marginal value theorem]]). However, the optimum resource investment from the offspring's point of view would be the maximum that it can possibly get from the maternal parent.

This conflict about resource allocation is most obviously manifested in the reduction of brood size (i.e. a decrease in the proportion of [[ovule]]s matured into seeds). Such reduction can be assumed to be caused by the offspring: If the maternal parent's interest were to produce as few seeds as observed, [[Selection (biology)|selection]] would not favour the production of extra ovules that do not mature into seeds. (Although other explanations for this phenomenon exist, such as [[genetic load]], resource depletion or maternal regulation of offspring quality, they could not be supported by experiments.)

There are several possibilities how the offspring can affect paternal resource allocation to brood members. Evidence exists for [[siblicide]] by dominant embryos: Embryos formed early kill the remaining embryos through an aborting chemical. In oaks, early fertilized ovules prevent the [[fertilization]] of other ovules by inhibiting the [[pollen tube]] entry into the [[embryo sac]]. In some species, the maternal parent has evolved postfertilization [[abortion]] of few seeded pods. Nevertheless, cheating by the offspring is also possible here, namely by late siblicide, when the postfertilization abortion has ceased.

According to the general POC model, reduction of brood size – if caused by POC – should depend on genetic relatedness between offspring in a fruit. Indeed, abortion of embryos is more common in [[out-crossing]] than in [[self-pollinating]] plants (seeds in cross-pollinating plants are less related than in self-pollinating plants). Moreover, the level of solicitation of resources by the offspring is also increased in cross-pollinating plants: There are several reports that the average weight of crossed seeds is greater than of seeds produced by self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uma Shaanker | first1 = R. | last2 = Ganeshaiah | first2 = K.N. | last3 = Bawa | first3 = K.S. | year = 1988 | title = Parent-offspring conflict, sibling rivalry, and brood size patterns in plants | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 177–205 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.19.110188.001141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
Some of the earliest examples of parent-offspring conflict were seen in [[bird]] broods and especially in [[raptor birds|raptor]] species. While parent birds often lay two eggs and attempt to raise two or more young, the strongest fledgling takes a greater share of the food brought by parents and will often kill the weaker sibling ([[siblicide]]). Such conflicts have been suggested as a driving force in the evolution of optimal [[clutch size]] in birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mock | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Drummond | first2 = H. | last3 = Stinson | first3 = C.H. | year = 1990 | title = Avian siblicide | url = | journal = Am. Sci. | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 438–449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[blue-footed booby]], parent-offspring conflict results in times of food scarcity. When there is less food available in a given year, the older, dominant chick will often kill the younger chick by either attacking directly, or by driving it from the nest. Parents try to prevent siblicide by building nests with steeper sides &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David J.|title=The Role of Parents in Siblicidal Brood Reduction of Two Booby Species|journal=The Auk|year=1995|volume=112|issue=4|pages=860–869|doi=10.2307/4089018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by laying heavier second eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Alba|first=Liliana |author2=Roxana Torres |author3=G.R. Bortolotti|title=Seasonal Egg-Mass Variation and Laying Sequence in a Bird with Facultative Brood Reductions|journal=The Auk|year=2007|volume=124|issue=2|pages=643–652|doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[643:sevals]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mammals===
Even before POC theory arose, debates took place over whether [[infant]]s [[wean]] themselves or mothers actively wean their infants. Furthermore, it was discussed whether maternal rejections increase infant independence. It turned out that both mother and infant contribute to infant independence. Maternal rejections can be followed by a short-term increase in infant contact but they eventually result in a long-term decrease of contact as has been shown for several primates: In wild [[baboon]]s infants that are rejected early and frequently spend less time in contact whereas those that are not rejected stay much longer in the proximity of their mother and suckle or ride even in advanced ages. In wild [[chimpanzee]]s an abrupt increase in maternal rejections and a decrease in mother-offspring contact is found when mothers resume [[Estrus#Estrus|estrus]] and consort with males. In [[rhesus macaque]]s a high probability of conception in the following mating season is associated with a high rate of maternal rejection. Rejection and behavioral conflicts can occur during the first months of an infant's life and when the mother resumes estrus. These findings suggest that the [[reproduction]] of the mother is influenced by the interaction with their offspring. So there is a potential for conflicts over PI.
It was also observed in rhesus macaques that the number of contacts made by offspring is significantly higher than the number of contacts made by mother during a mating season, whereas the opposite holds for the number of broken contacts. This fact suggests that the mother resists offspring's demands for contact, whereas offspring is apparently more interested in spending time in contact. At three months of infant age a shift from mother to infant in responsibility for maintaining contact takes place. So when the infant becomes more independent, its effort to maintain proximity to its mother increases. This might sound paradoxical but becomes clear when one takes into account that POC increases during the period of PI. In summary, all these findings are consistent with POC-theory.

One might object that time in contact is not a reasonable measure for PI and that, for example, time for milk transfer ([[lactation]]) would be a better one. Here one can argue that mother and infant have different [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] needs due to the fact that they have different surface-to-volume ratios resulting in more rapid loss of heat in infants compared to adults. So infants may be more sensitive to low temperatures than their mothers. An infant might try to compensate by increased contact time with their mother, which could initiate a behavioral conflict over time. Consistency of this hypothesis has been shown for [[Japanese macaque]]s where decreasing temperatures result in higher maternal rejections and increased number of contacts made by infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maestripieri | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Parent-offspring conflict in primates | url = | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 923–951 | doi=10.1023/a:1015537201184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In social insects===

In eusocial species, the parent-offspring conflict takes on a unique role because of [[haplodiploidy]] and the prevalence of sterile workers. Sisters are more related to each other (0.75) than to their mothers (0.5) or brothers (0.25). In most cases, this drives female workers to try and obtain a sex ratio of 3:1 (females to males) in the colony. However, queens are equally related to both sons and daughters, so they prefer a sex ratio of 1:1. The conflict in social insects is about the level investment the queen should provide for each sex for current and future offspring. It is generally thought that workers will win this conflict and the sex ratio will be closer to 3:1, however there are examples, like in ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', where the queen has considerable control in forcing a 1:1 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bourke, A.F.G. and F.L.W. Ratnieks | year = 2001 | title = Kin-selected conflict in the bumble-bee ''Bombus terrestris'' (Hymenoptera: Apidae) | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 268 | pages = 347–355 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1381 | pmid=11270430 | pmc=1088613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
An important illustration of such conflict is provided by David Haig’s (1993) work on genetic conflicts in pregnancy. Haig has argued that [[fetus|fetal]] genes would be selected to draw more resources from the mother than it would be optimal for the mother to give, a hypothesis that has received empirical support. The [[placenta]], for example, secretes allocrine [[hormone]]s that decrease the sensitivity of the mother to [[insulin]] and thus make a larger supply of blood sugar available to the fetus. The mother responds by increasing the level of insulin in her bloodstream, and to counteract this effect the placenta has insulin receptors that stimulate the production of insulin-degrading [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haig | first1 = D. | authorlink = David Haig (biologist) | year = 1993 | title = Genetic conflicts in human pregnancy | url = | journal = Quart. Rev. Biol. | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 495–532 | doi = 10.1086/418300 | pmid = 8115596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 30 percent of human [[fertilisation|conceptions]] do not progress to full term (22 percent before becoming clinical pregnancies)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3393170 | doi=10.1056/NEJM198807283190401 | volume=319 | title=Incidence of early loss of pregnancy | journal=N Engl J Med | pages=189–94 | last1 = Wilcox | first1 = AJ | last2 = Weinberg | first2 = CR | last3 = O'Connor | first3 = JF | last4 = Baird | first4 = DD | last5 = Schlatterer | first5 = JP | last6 = Canfield | first6 = RE | last7 = Armstrong | first7 = EG | last8 = Nisula | first8 = BC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this creates a second arena for conflict between the mother and the fetus, because the fetus will have a lower quality cut off point for [[spontaneous abortion]] than the mother. The mother's quality cut-off point should also decline as she nears the end of her reproductive life and it may be significant that the offspring of older mothers have a higher incidence of genetic defects. Initially, the maintenance of pregnancy is controlled by the maternal hormone [[progesterone]], but in later stages it is controlled by the fetal [[human chorionic gonadotrophin]] released into the maternal bloodstream, which causes the release of maternal progesterone. There is also conflict over blood supply to the placenta, with the fetus being prepared to demand a larger blood supply than is optimal for the mother (or even for itself, since high birth weight is a risk factor). This results in [[hypertension]] and, significantly, high [[birth weight]] is positively correlated with maternal blood pressure.

After birth the young infant may demand more nutritional resources than the lactating mother is prepared to provide, and the presence of [[benzodiazepine]]-like compounds in [[breast milk]] may function to keep this in check, although its primary function is to calm the infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dencker |first1=SJ |title=Quantification of naturally occurring benzodiazepine-like substances in human breast milk. |journal=Psychopharmacology |date=1992 |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=69–72 |pmid=1589563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A tripartite (fetus–mother–father) immune conflict in humans and other placentals===
{{further|Microchimerism#Microchimerism and disease within the context of a tripartite conflict|l1=Microchimerism and disease within the context of a tripartite conflict}}

During pregnancy, there is a two-way traffic of immunologically active cell lines through the placenta. Fetal [[lymphocyte]] lines may survive in women even decades after giving birth. These cells may serve the adaptive interest of the mother, however, they may also serve conflicting interests of the fetus or those of the father. This mixture of shared or contradicting interests has been hypothesized as giving rise to diseases like autoimmune diseases, infertility, and habitual abortion in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Apari P, Rózsa L| title=The tripartite immune conflict in placentals and a hypothesis on fetal→maternal Microchimerism| format=pdf| journal=Medical Hypotheses| year=2009| volume=72|pages= 52–54|pmid= 18930355|issue= 1|doi= 10.1016/j.mehy.2008.08.021| url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/microchimerism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peder Wright Cappelen''' (18 January 1931 &amp;ndash; 4 January 1992) was a Norwegian playwright, non-fiction writer and publisher.

Cappelen was born in [[Bærum]] to publisher Jørgen Wright Cappelen and Ragni Holm Johannessen. He was married first to art historian Tone Wikborg (daughter of [[Erling Wikborg]]), and from 1966 to actress [[Kari Simonsen]]. Cappelen headed the publishing house ''Helge Erichsens Forlag'' from 1958, maybe best known for [[Kjell Aukrust]]'s books and [[Marcel Proust]]. Cappelen's books include ''Eventyret ute'' (1960), ''Alene med vidda'' (1964), and three books illustrated by [[Jens Johannessen]], ''Høstblad'' (1976), ''Fugl i vår'' (1979) and ''Sommerfabel, fra Vidda til Skagen'' (1983). He has written plays inspired by fairytales, historical plays and plays for children.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Peder W Cappelen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first= |last= |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=https://nbl.snl.no/Peder_W_Cappelen | language=Norwegian |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Peder Wright Cappelen |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=https://snl.no/Peder_Wright_Cappelen |language=Norwegian |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSA has regulatory responsibility for safety, emergency preparedness and the working environment in the petroleum activities, including petroleum facilities and associated pipeline systems at Melkøya, Tjeldbergodden, Nyhamna, Kollsnes, Mongstad, Sture, Kårstø and Slagentangen, as well as any future, integrated petroleum facilities.

The regulatory responsibility covers all phases of the activities; such as planning, engineering, construction, use and finally, removal.

The Norwegian government has assigned the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway the following tasks: 
:*The PSA shall, through its own supervision and through cooperation with other authorities in the HSE area, ensure that the petroleum activities and other associated activities are followed up in a comprehensive manner. 
:*The PSA shall furthermore carry out information and advisory activities [[wikt:vis-à-vis|vis-à-vis]] the players in the industry, establish practical cooperative relationships with other national and international HSE authorities, as well as contribute actively to the transfer of knowledge in the area of [[Occupational safety and health|health, safety and environment]] in society in general. 
:*The PSA shall issue statements to its superior government ministry regarding matters which are under consideration and provide assistance to the ministry when requested.

In the broadest sense, the entire work and purpose of the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway is to ensure that the petroleum activities are conducted prudently as regards health, environment and safety. The ministry has issued the following guidelines for how the PSA should carry out its tasks:

Follow-up shall be system-oriented and risk-based. This follow-up must be in addition to, and not instead of, the follow-up which the industry carries out for its own part. There shall be a balanced consideration between the PSA's role as a high risk/technological supervisory body and as a labour inspection authority. Participation and cooperation between the parties are important principles and integral preconditions for the activities of the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway.

==Activities==
In 2005, the PSA was made part of the Coexistence Group II working group, a joint project of the Norwegian gevernment, the Institute of Marine Research, the Norwegian Fishermen's Association, the Norwegian Foundation for Nature Research and the Norwegian Oil Industry Association. Coexistence Group II's mission is to explore the feasibility of coexistence between the fishing and petroleum industries in Norwegian waters.&lt;ref name=NMMSIBG/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOGELRH/&gt; The PSA also coordinates supervisory responsibility with Norway's national [[Health Examination Survey]] (HES).&lt;ref name=NMMSIBG/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOGELRH/&gt;

[[Image:Virgil Solis - Deucalion Pyrrha.jpg|thumb|[[Deucalion]] and '''Pyrrha''' throwing rocks that become babies.]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Pyrrha''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|r|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Πύρρα) was the daughter of [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] and [[Pandora]] and wife of [[Deucalion]] of whom she had three sons, [[Hellen]], [[Amphictyon]], [[Orestheus]]; and three daughters [[Protogeneia]], [[Pandora II]] and [[Thyia]]. According to some accounts, Hellen was credited to be born from Pyrrha's union with Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca, Book 1.7.2''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
In [[Latin]] the word ''pyrrhus'' means red from the Greek adjective πυρρός, ''purrhos'', i.e. "flame coloured", "the colour of fire", "fiery red" or simply "red" or "reddish".&lt;ref name="LSJ"&gt;{{LSJ|purro/s|πυρρός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]], section 38 s.v. Deucalion’s Flood''&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrha was evidently named after her red hair. [[Horace]] (''Ode'', i. 5) and Ovide describes her as red haired. 

== Mythology ==
When [[Zeus]] decided to end the [[Ages of Man|Bronze Age]] with the great [[Ancient Greek flood myths|deluge]], Deucalion and his wife, Pyrrha, were the only survivors.  Even though he was imprisoned, Prometheus who could see the future and had foreseen the coming of this flood told his son, Deucalion, to build an ark and, thus, they survived.  During the flood, they landed on [[Mount Parnassus]], the only place spared by the flood.

Once the deluge was over and the couple were on land again, Deucalion consulted an [[oracle]] of [[Themis]] about how to repopulate the earth. He was told to throw the bones of his mother behind his shoulder. [[Deucalion]] and Pyrrha understood the "mother" to be [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the mother of all living things, and the "bones" to be rocks. They threw the rocks behind their shoulders, which soon began to lose their hardness and change form.  Their mass grew greater, and the beginnings of human form emerged.  The parts that were soft and moist became skin, the veins of the rock became people's veins, and the hardest parts of the rocks became bones.  The stones thrown by Pyrrha became women;  those thrown by Deucalion became men.

The story of Deucalion and Pyrrha is also retold in the Roman poet [[Ovid]]’s famous collection ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. In this retelling, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] (the Roman equivalent of Zeus) takes pity on the couple, recognizing them to be devout worshipers. He parts the clouds and ends the deluge specifically to save Deucalion and Pyrrha, who are floating aimlessly on a raft. When the storm has cleared and the waters have subsided, Deucalion and Pyrrha are taken aback by the desolate wreckage of the land, and understand that they are now responsible for repopulating the earth. Confused on how to carry out their destiny, they go to see the goddess Themis. Themis tells Pyrrha that she must cast the bones of her mother to successfully reproduce. Pyrrha is distraught at the idea of desecrating her mother’s honor by digging up her bones, but Deucalion correctly reasons that Themis is referring to great mother earth, as Themis would never advise someone to commit a crime. Both Pyrrha and Deucalion throw a stone over their shoulder – Pyrrha’s turning into a woman, Deucalion’s turning into a man.

Once the land has been repopulated with humans, mother earth follows suit and begins to produce all other forms of life. Ovid uses this opportunity to inform his audience that heat and water are the sources of all life – “because when heat and moisture blend in due balance, they conceive: these two, these are the origin of everything. Though fire and water fight, humidity and warmth create all things; that harmony” (Ovid – pg 15).

== Other personages ==
[[Creon]], king of [[Cilician Thebe|Thebe]]s, has a daughter named Pyrrha.

"Pyrrha" was, possibly, the name used by [[Achilles]] while hiding among the king of Skyros' daughters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1546">A '''roughing pump''' is any [[vacuum pump]] (typically mechanical) used to initially evacuate a vacuum system, as a first stage towards achieving [[vacuum|high vacuum]] or [[ultra high vacuum]].  The term "roughing pump" derives from the vacuum range it works in, "rough vacuum", above 1x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[torr]] (0.1 [[Pascal_(unit)|Pa]]). Pumps that operate in the high vacuum ranges typically don't operate, or only operate inefficiently, at [[atmospheric pressure]]s, whereas pumps that work efficiently at atmospheric pressure usually cannot produce a vacuum lower than approximately 1x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr.  

One consideration for choosing a roughing pump is whether the pump uses [[lubricating oil]] that's exposed to the vacuum. This concern of "hydrocarbon backstreaming" where pump oil as a gas makes its way into the vacuum chamber, has led to oil-free pump designs on the market.

== Types ==
Two main types of roughing pumps are oil-sealed roughing pumps and dry roughing pumps. Within the two categories are various kinds of designs with differences among them based on maintenance issues, initial costs, pump lifespan and vacuum level. Early in their manufacture, dry pumps were significantly more expensive than oil-based pumps, however over time the cost gap has closed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5202">[[File:Time switch.JPG|thumb|A simple 24-hour cyclical electromechanical time switch with a [[AC power plugs and sockets|French CEE 7/5 socket]] ]]
A '''time switch''' (also called a '''timer switch''', or simply '''timer''') is a [[timer]] that operates an [[electric]] [[switch]] controlled by the timing [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]].

The switch may be connected to an [[electric circuit]] operating from [[mains power]], including via a [[relay]] or [[contactor]]; or [[extra-low voltage|low voltage]], including [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-operated equipment in [[vehicle]]s.  It may be built into power circuits (as with a [[central heating]] or [[water heater]] timer), plugged into a [[AC power plugs and sockets|wall outlet]] with equipment plugged into the timer instead of directly into the power point; or built into equipment as, for example, a [[sleep timer]] that turns off a [[TV set|television receiver]] after a set period.

The mechanism may be mechanical (e.g., [[clockwork]]; rarely used nowadays), [[electromechanical]] (e.g., a slowly rotating geared motor that mechanically operates switches) or [[electronics|electronic]], with [[semiconductor]] timing circuitry and switching devices and no moving parts.

The timer may switch equipment on, off, or both, at a preset time or times, after a preset interval, or cyclically. A [[countdown]] time switch switches power, usually off, after a preset time. A cyclical timer switches equipment both on and off at preset times over a period, then repeats the cycle; the period is usually 24 hours or 7 days. 

For example, a central heating timer may supply heat for a specified period during the morning and evening every weekday, and all day on weekends. A timer for an unattended [[slow cooker]] may switch on automatically at a time and for a period suitable to have food ready at [[supper|mealtime]].  Likewise, a [[coffee maker]] may turn itself on early in the [[morning]] in time for awakening residents to have fresh [[coffee]] already brewed for them.  

Timers may do other processing or have sensors; for example, a timer may switch on lights only during hours of darkness, using a [[season]]al [[algorithm]]&lt;ref&gt;Walter T. Grondzik, Alison G. Kwok, Benjamin Stein ''Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings'', John Wiley and Sons, 2009 {{ISBN|0-470-19565-7}}  page 1201&lt;/ref&gt; or [[light sensor]].  Combining the two allows a light to come on at sundown and go off at midnight, for example.

An '''astronomical''' (or '''astronomic''') '''timer''' calculates [[dawn]] and [[dusk]] times for each day of the year based on the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] (or just north/central/south and [[time zone]] on more cheaply made ones), and the [[day of the year]] (month and date), programmed by the user upon installation in addition to the usual [[time of day]], except in the case of GPS enabled astronomic timers wherein all programming is fully automatic. This eliminates the need for a [[photocell]] (which may be repeatedly triggered on and off by the light which it operates) or for repeatedly re-setting a regular timer for seasonal changes in the [[length of day]] or for [[daylight-saving time]].  This allows exterior [[lighting]] like a [[porch]] [[light fixture]] to be controlled by simply replacing its indoor wall switch, or doing the same for a [[lamp (fixture)|lamp]] in a dark interior corner (away from a [[window]]) by simply plugging-in a self-adjusting lamp timer.

Time switches can be used for many purposes, including saving [[electric energy]] by consuming it only when required, switching equipment on, off, or both at times required by some process, and [[home security]] (for example switching lights in a pattern that gives the impression that premises are attended) to reduce the likelihood of [[burglary]] or [[prowling]].

Among applications are [[lighting]] (interior, exterior, and [[street light]]ing), cooking devices such as [[oven]]s, [[washing machine]]s, and [[climate control|heating and cooling]] of buildings and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydro.mb.ca/your_home/home_comfort/block_heaters.pdf |title=Car warmers, block heaters, and energy controls |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130121414/http://www.hydro.mb.ca/your_home/home_comfort/block_heaters.pdf |archivedate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built-in automatic washing machine controllers are examples of very complex [[electromechanical]] and electronic timers cycles, starting and stopping many processes including [[pump]]s and [[valve]]s to fill and empty the drum with water, heating, and rotating at different speeds, with different combinations of settings for different fabrics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="916">The '''topological censorship''' theorem states that [[general relativity]] does not allow an observer to probe the topology of spacetime: any topological structure collapses too quickly to allow light to traverse it. More precisely, in a [[globally hyperbolic]], [[asymptotically flat]] spacetime satisfying the [[null energy condition]], every [[causal curve]] from past [[null infinity]] to future null infinity is fixed-endpoint homotopic to a curve in a topologically trivial neighbourhood of infinity.

An '''ultramicroscope''' is a [[microscope]] with a system that lights the object in a way that allows viewing of tiny [[particle]]s via [[light scattering]], and not [[Reflection (physics)|light reflection]] or [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. When the diameter of a particle is below or near the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]] (around 500 [[nanometer]]s), the particle cannot be seen in a [[optical microscope|light microscope]] with the usual methods of illumination.

In the system, the particles to be observed are dispersed in a liquid or gas [[colloid]] (or less often in a coarser [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]). The colloid is placed in a light-absorbing, dark enclosure, and illuminated with a convergent beam of intense light entering from one side. Light hitting the colloid particles will be scattered. In discussions about light scattering, the converging beam is called a "[[Tyndall cone]]". The scene is viewed through an ordinary microscope placed at right angles to the direction of the lightbeam. Under the microscope, the individual particles will appear as small fuzzy spots of light moving irregularly. The spots are inherently fuzzy because light scattering produces fuzzier images than light reflection. The particles are in [[Brownian motion]] in most kinds of liquid and gas colloids, which causes the movement of the spots. The ultramicroscope system can also be used to observe tiny nontransparent particles dispersed in a transparent solid or gel.

The ''ultra-'' in ''ultramicroscope'' refers to the ability to see objects whose diameter is shorter than the wavelength of visible light, on the model of the ''ultra-'' in ''[[ultraviolet]]''.

Ultramicroscopes have been used for general observation of [[aerosols]] and [[colloids]], in studying [[Brownian motion]], in observing [[ion]]ization tracks in [[cloud chamber]]s, and in studying biological [[ultrastructure]].

In 1902, the ultramicroscope was developed by [[Richard Adolf Zsigmondy]] (1865–1929) and Henry Siedentopf (1872–1940), working for [[Carl Zeiss AG]]. Applying bright sunlight for illumination they were able to determine the size of 4 nm small [[nanoparticle]]s in [[cranberry glass]]. Zsigmondy further improved the ultramicroscope and presented the immersion ultramicroscope in 1912, allowing the observation of suspended nanoparticles in defined fluidic volumes. In 1925, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on colloids and the ultramicroscope.

Later the development of [[electron microscope]]s provided additional ways to see objects too small for light microscopy.
