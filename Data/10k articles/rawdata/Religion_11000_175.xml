'''Ashem Vohu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|ʃ|ɛ|m|_|ˈ|v|ɔː|h|uː}}, [[Avestan]]: 𐬀𐬴𐬆𐬨 𐬬𐬊𐬵𐬏‎ aṣ̌əm vohū‎) is a very important prayer in [[Zoroastrianism]]. The Ashem Vohu, after the [[Ahunavar]] is considered one of the basic, yet meaningful and powerful mantras in the religion. It is also at the end of most of the prayers in the [[Khordeh Avesta]], except a certain few, most notably the [[Fravarane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|2001|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ashem vohu, [[Ahunavar]],'' ''[[Yenghe hatam]]'', and ''[[Airyaman ishya]]'' form four pillars of the Gathic canon, part of the group of Zoroastrian texts composed in the archaic dialect of the Avestan language. 

==Prayer==

:''aṣ̌əm vohū vahištəm astī''
:''uštā astī uštā ahmāi''
:''hyat̰ aṣ̌āi vahištāi aṣ̌əm'' 

'''Translation:'''

There are many translations and all attempts done by scholars do not give an authentic translation of the original with all its possible more deeper significance(s), because they all differ significantly.

For example:

:''"Righteousness is best (of all that is) good.''
:''As desired, what is being desired''
:''is truth for him who (represents) best truth."''
:'''''or:'''''
:''"Truth is best (of all that is) good.''
:''As desired, as desired, truth''
:''is for him who (represents) best truth."''&lt;ref&gt;The Heritage of Zarathushtra - A new translation of His Gathas, Humbach &amp; Ichaporia&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''or:'''''
:''"Holiness (Asha) is the best of all good:''
:''it is also happiness.''
:''Happy the man who is holy with perfect holiness!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avesta.org/ka/ka_part1.htm#ashem&lt;/ref&gt;''
:'''''or:'''''
:"Righteousness is the best good and it is happiness.
:Happiness is to her/him who is righteous
:for the sake of the best righteousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English Translation of Gujarati Khordeh Avesta|last=Kanga|first=Ervad Kawasji Eduljee|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{zoroastrianism-stub}} The main point to be noted in the translation is that the word HOLINESS, can also be replaced with Righteousness.</text>

'''Badara Tittha Vihara''' (also '''Badaratittha''', '''Padaratittha'''&lt;ref name=hopl&gt;{{cite book|last=Bimala Churn Law|title=History of Pali Literature|year=1933|publisher=Kegan, Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co., Ltd.|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistoryofpalili035454mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) is the name of an historic [[Theravada]] [[Buddhist]] ''[[vihara]]'' in what is now the modern [[Tamil Nadu]] state of [[India]].

==In the Gandhavamsa==
Badaratittha is known to us from the ''[[Gandhavamsa]]'' (or ''[[Cullagandhavamsa]]''), a 17th-century ''[[Pali]]'' work by ''[[Nandapanna|Nandapañña]]'' that recounts post-canonical Pali books written in [[Burma]] and [[Ceylon]].  

The ''Gandhavamsa'' states that Badara Tittha Vihara was the dwelling place of ''[[Dhammapala|Ācariya Dhammapāla]]'', an early Theravadin commentator from [[Kanchipuram]].

==Early days==
Before 1918, the regions of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|part of]] the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]]. `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the members of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The seventh of the tablets mentioned [[Europe]]an regions and was written on April 11, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The seventh tablet was translated and presented on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919 and mentioned Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt; He says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands."&lt;ref name="tablets"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-6.html | pages = 43 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1918 to the 1990s Bosnia and Herzegovina were part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Before World War II Yugoslavia continued to be ruled by monarchs and among them there was awareness of the Bahá'í Faith. In July, 1938, [[Marie of Edinburgh]], a member of the religion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hannah| last=Pakula| title=The last romantic: a biography of Queen Marie of Romania| isbn=0-297-78598-2| publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson| year=1985| location=London| pages=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Queen of Rumania, died. A message of condolence was communicated, in the name of all Bahá’í communities in East and West, to her daughter, [[Maria of Yugoslavia|Maria]], then Queen of Yugoslavia, to which she replied expressing "sincere thanks to all of [[Bahá’u’lláh]]'s followers."&lt;ref name="gpb"/&gt; Later [[Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark|Princess Olga of Yugoslavia]], on being informed of the death of [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Martha Root]] in 1939, remarked “She was so kind and gentle, and a real worker for peace. I am sure she will be sadly missed in her work.”&lt;ref name="gpb"/&gt;

Following the disruption of [[World War II]] and oppression during the early period of communism (see for example what happened to the much larger [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan#Soviet period|Bahá'í community in Turkmenistan]]) the first member of the Bahá'í Faith in Yugoslavia was an isolated  Bahá'í in [[Belgrade]] who converted to the religion in 1963.&lt;ref name="century"/&gt;

==Growth==
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Momen  | first = Moojan |authorlink=Moojan Momen | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran  | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith"  | publisher = Bahai-library.com  | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon  | first = Geeta Gandhi | title  = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"/&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen|authorlink=Moojan Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 |  url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However in the Soviet Block the Bahá'ís had all but disappeared. With the relaxation of the restrictions of Communism through [[Perestroyka]], Yugoslavia's first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] was established in November 1990 in Belgrade&lt;ref  name="century"/&gt; though the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]] maintained there were no Bahá'ís in the country then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By 2003 Bahá’ís had organized Bosnia and Herzegovina into 17 subregions, and four of these contained at least one Bahá'í and a few [[Ruhi Institute]] [[Bahá'í study circle|study circles]] were operating.&lt;ref name="committee"/&gt; Despite this, the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) still  estimated there were no Bahá'ís in the country.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern community==
The small community of Baha'is of Bosnia and Herzegovina has continued to have a presence in events beyond the confines of the country. In November 2004 membership of Baha'i inspired General Assembly of the International Environment Forum lists one member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Roger Schütz''', popularly known as '''Brother Roger ''' ({{lang-fr|Frère Roger}}; May 12, 1915&amp;nbsp;– August 16, 2005), was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Christian]] leader and [[monastic]] [[brother (Christian)|brother]]. In 1940 Schütz founded the [[Taizé Community]], an [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical]] monastic community in [[Burgundy]], [[France]], serving as its first [[prior]] until his murder in 2005. Towards the end of his life, the Taizé Community was attracting international attention, welcoming thousands of young pilgrims every week, which it has continued to do after his death.

== Background and early life ==
Born on May 12, 1915 in [[Provence, Switzerland|Provence]], [[Vaud]], Schütz was the ninth and youngest child of Karl Ulrich Schütz, a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] pastor from [[Bachs]] in the [[Zürcher Unterland]] in [[Switzerland]], and his wife, Amélie Henriette Marsauche, a [[Huguenot]] from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], France.

From 1937 to 1940, Schütz-Marsauche studied [[Reformed theology]] in [[Strasbourg]] and [[Lausanne]], where he was a leader in the Swiss Student Christian Movement, part of the [[World Student Christian Federation]]. Falling ill with [[tuberculosis]], during his convalescence he began to feel drawn to a monastic way of life.&lt;ref name=TC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taize.fr/en_article6526.html|work= Taizé|title=The beginnings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taizé Community ==
{{main|Taizé Community}}
[[File:Brother Roger at prayer.jpg|thumb|Schütz at prayer in Taizé, 2004]]
In 1940, at the start of [[World War II]], Schütz-Marsauche felt called to serve those suffering from the conflict, as his maternal grandmother had done during [[World War I]]. He rode a bicycle from [[Geneva]] to [[Taizé, Saône-et-Loire|Taizé]], a small town near [[Mâcon]], about {{convert|390|km|mi}} southeast of Paris. The town was then located within [[Vichy France|unoccupied France]], just beyond the line of demarcation from the zone occupied by German troops. He bought an empty house, where for two years he and his sister, Genevieve, hid refugees, both Christian and Jewish, before being forced to leave Taizé, after being tipped off that the [[Gestapo]] had become aware of their activities. In 1944, he returned to Taizé to found the Community, initially a small quasi-monastic community of men living together in poverty and obedience, open to all Christians.&lt;ref name=TC /&gt;

Since the late 1950s, many thousands of young adults from many countries have found their way to Taizé to take part in weekly meetings of prayer and reflection. In addition, Taizé brothers make visits and lead meetings, large and small, in Africa, North and South America, Asia, and in Europe, as part of a “pilgrimage of trust on earth”.

The spiritual leader always kept a low profile, rarely giving interviews and refusing to permit any "cult" to grow up around himself. Prior to his death, Brother Roger was due to give up his community functions because of his advanced age and ill-health which had seen him suffer from fatigue and often use a wheelchair.

Brother Roger was a prized authour and wrote many books on prayer and reflection, asking young people to be confident in God and committed to their local church community and to humanity. He also wrote books about Christian spirituality and prayer, some together with [[Mother Teresa]] with whom he shared a cordial friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mother Teresa|last2=Schütz|first2=Roger|title=Prayer: Seeking the Heart of God|date=1992|publisher=Fount|isbn=9780006276463|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Prayer-Seeking-Heart-Mother-Teresa/dp/0006276466|accessdate=5 March 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecumenism ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Frère Roger (center) and Franz Kardinal König (right) leaving Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral after oecumenical church service.jpg|thumb|Brother Roger with Catholic and Protestant clergy, leaving an ecumenical service in [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]], {{circa|1975}}.]]

All his life, Roger devoted himself to reconciling the different [[Christian denomination]]s. He especially addressed Christian [[youth]]. Part of his appeal may have been his dislike of formal preaching, while encouraging a spiritual quest as a common endeavor. During a Taizé gathering in [[Paris]] in 1995, he spoke to more than 100,000 young people who were sitting on the floor of an exhibition hall. "We have come here to search", he said, "or to go on searching through silence and prayer, to get in touch with our inner life. Christ always said, 'Do not worry, give yourself'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/18/international/europe/18roger.html|work=[[International New York Times]]|first=Marlise|last=Simons|title=Brother Roger, 90, Dies; Ecumenical Leader|date=August 18, 2005|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although from a [[Protestant]] background, Brother Roger received the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist]] at the [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Catholic mass]] celebrated every morning in his monastery. In addition, he received the sacrament from both [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]], seemingly in contravention of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] prohibitions reserving the sacrament exclusively to those in [[full communion]] with the [[Catholic Church]]. Though, according to Cardinal [[Walter Kasper]], this was accomplished as though there was a tacit understanding between Brother Roger and the Catholic Church "crossing certain confessional" and canonical barriers through what Brother Roger called a gradual enrichment of his faith with the foundations of the Catholic Church including "the ministry of unity exercised by the bishop of Rome."&lt;ref name="August 25, 2008"/&gt; Brother Roger thus appeared to have undertaken a step without precedent since the [[Protestant Reformation]]: entering progressively into full communion with the faith of the Catholic Church possibly without a formal "[[Religious conversion|conversion]]" that would imply a break with his origins.{{fact|date=August 2017}} In 1980, during a European Meeting in [[Rome]], he said in [[Saint Peter’s Basilica]] in the presence of [[Pope John Paul II]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;I have found my own identity as a Christian by reconciling within myself the faith of my origins with the mystery of the Catholic faith, without breaking fellowship with anyone.&lt;ref name="August 25, 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Magister|first=Sandro|url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/206302?eng=y|title= Was the Founder of Taizé Protestant, or Catholic?

==Death==
{{Wikinews|Taizé ecumenical community founder Frère Roger assassinated}}
[[File:Brother Roger grave.JPG|thumb|Brother Roger's grave in Taizé]]
Brother Roger was stabbed to death during the [[Vespers|evening prayer service]] in Taizé on August 16, 2005, by a young Romanian woman named Luminița Ruxandra Solcan who was later deemed mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iPwbPb7igYdd45aHqW2Pwt0tANug Taizé: non-lieu psychiatrique pour la meurtrière présumée de Frère Roger] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711112245/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iPwbPb7igYdd45aHqW2Pwt0tANug |date=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was stabbed several times and, though one of the brothers carried him from the church, he died shortly afterward. The assailant was immediately apprehended by members of the congregation and was placed in police custody.

The funeral took place on August 23, 2005. [[Horst Köhler]], the [[President of Germany]], and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], at that time [[Minister of the Interior]] of France, were in attendance. Brother Roger's community and friends attended the [[liturgy]] in the vast monastery church at Taizé, while thousands more followed it on a huge screen in fields outside the church. Brother Roger's simple wooden coffin, a wooden [[icon]] lying upon it, was carried into the church by members of the community. In a highly unusual move, the funeral was presided over by a [[Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], [[Walter Kasper]], the president of the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]], who celebrated the Mass with four priest-brothers of Taizé concelebrating.  In his homily he said, "Yes, the springtime of [[ecumenism]] has flowered on the hill of Taizé."&lt;ref name="nyt-20050825"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/international/europe/24france.html At His Funeral, Brother Roger Has an Ecumenical Dream Fulfilled]&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to Brother Roger's concern for [[social justice]], Cardinal Kasper said "Every form of injustice or neglect made him very sad."&lt;ref name="nyt-20050825" /&gt; Brother Roger's successor, [[Brother Alois|Brother Alois Löser]], prayed for forgiveness: "With Christ on the cross we say to you, Father, forgive her, she does not know what she did."&lt;ref name="nyt-20050825" /&gt;

==Successor==
In 1998, Brother Roger had designated [[Brother Alois]], a German Catholic who had originally come to Taizé as a youth and became one of the brothers, as his successor. This was confirmed by the community and in January 2005, it was announced that Alois would soon be taking Roger's place as [[Prior]] of Taizé, but this had not yet occurred at the time of Roger's death, when Alois was attending the [[World Youth Day]] celebration in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. He was installed as prior shortly thereafter.

A '''cardinal''' ({{lang-la|Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae cardinalis}}, literally ''Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church'') is a senior [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] leader, considered a [[Prince of the Church]], and usually  an ordained [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. The cardinals of the Church are collectively known as the [[College of Cardinals]]. The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the [[Pope]] as requested. Most have additional duties, such as leading a [[diocese]] or [[archdiocese]] or managing a [[Dicastery|department]] of the [[Roman Curia]]. A cardinal's primary duty is [[papal election|electing the Pope]] when the [[Holy See|see]] becomes vacant. During the ''[[sede vacante]]'' (the period between a pope's death or resignation and the election of his successor), the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] of cardinals where the pope is elected is limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs.

In 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven [[Suburbicarian diocese|suburbicarian see]]s. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his [[titular church]] or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The term ''cardinal'' at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or [[incardinated]] to a church,&lt;ref name="CE-cardinal"&gt;{{CathEncy | wstitle=Cardinal | title=Cardinal | last=Sägmüller | first=Johannes Baptist}}&lt;/ref&gt; or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin ''cardo'' (hinge), meaning "principal" or "chief". The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the ''tituli'' (parishes) of the [[diocese of Rome]].&lt;ref name="CE-cardinal" /&gt;

==History==

{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Richelieu, por Philippe de Champaigne (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cardinal Richelieu]], chief minister of [[France]]]]

There is disagreement about the origin of the term, but the consensus that "''cardinalis''" from the word ''cardo'' (meaning 'pivot' or 'hinge') was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In [[Rome]] the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean "principal," "eminent," or "superior." The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the "title" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of [[Lateran Council (769)|a synod of 769]], only a cardinal was eligible to become bishop of Rome. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope [[Innocent IV]] in 1244.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

In cities other than Rome, the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour. The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by [[Pope Zacharias]] in 747 to [[Pippin III]] (the Short), ruler of the [[Franks]], in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of [[Paris]] to distinguish them from country clergy. This meaning of the word spread rapidly, and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals. The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by [[Pius V]].

In the year 1563 the influential Ecumenical Council of Trent, headed by Pope [[Pius IV]], wrote about the importance of selecting good Cardinals. According to this historic council "nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only, and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds; and this the more so, because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Catholic bishops and Pope Pius IV|title=The Council of Trent|date=11 November 1563|publisher=Tan Books and Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier influence of temporal rulers, notably the French kings, reasserted itself through the influence of cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements. Traditions even developed entitling certain monarchs, including those of Austria, Spain, and France, to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal, a so-called ''[[crown-cardinal]]''.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Owen|title=The Popes and European Revolution|date=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198269199|page=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrLmCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Early Modern period|early modern]] times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. In [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s England, his chief minister was [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]]. [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kitchell Webster, Hutton Webster, ''Early European History'', p. 604. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=rXSqwPFMn3oC.&lt;/ref&gt; Richelieu's successor was also a cardinal, [[Cardinal Mazarin|Jules Mazarin]]. [[Guillaume Dubois]] and [[André-Hercule de Fleury]] complete the list of the four great cardinals to have ruled [[France]].&lt;ref name="Chadwick" /&gt; In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, [[Henry, King of Portugal]], was crowned king, the only example of a cardinal-king.

While the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals, and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by [[concordate]] (usually earning either its [[primate (bishop)|primate]] or the metropolitan of the capital city the cardinal's hat), no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate, not even if its bishop is a Patriarch.

==Papal elections==
In 1059, [[Pope Nicholas II]] gave cardinals the right to elect the bishop of Rome in the [[papal bull]] ''[[In nomine Domini]]''. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but in 1179 the [[Third Lateran Council]] restored the right to the whole body of cardinals.&lt;ref name=TCE1&gt;{{cite book |last=Fanning |first=W. |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=The Catholic Encyclopaedia |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |year=1911 |pages= |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11456a.htm |chapter=Papal Elections |isbn= 0840731752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbers==
In 1586 [[Pope Sixtus V]] limited the number of cardinals to 70:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 25 October 2017 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/11/18/83425668.pdf | first=Arnaldo | last=Cortesi | work= New York Times | date= 18 November 2017 | title = Two Americans among 23 New Cardinals}}&lt;/ref&gt; six cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons.

When it took effect on 1 January 1971, it deprived twenty-five cardinals of the right to participate in a conclave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffman|first1=Paul|title=Voting for Popes Is Barred to Cardinals Over 80|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/24/archives/voting-for-popes-is-barred-to-cardinals-over-80-prelates-over-80.html|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=New York Times|date=24 November 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1975 in ''[[Romano Pontifici eligendo]]'', he set the maximum number of electors at 120, while establishing no limit on the overall size of the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Iv8pAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101 | page=101 | title= Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church | first= Thomas J. |last = Reese | date= 1998 | publisher = Harvard University Press| isbn=9780674418028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titular church==
[[File:Theodor Kardinal Innitzer -001-.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodor Innitzer|Cardinal Innitzer]], [[Archbishop of Vienna]] and Cardinal-Priest of [[San Crisogono]]]]
Each cardinal takes on a [[titular church]], either a church in the city of Rome or one of the [[Suburbicarian diocese|suburbicarian see]]s. The only exception is for patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches.&lt;ref name="Paul VI. 1965"&gt;Pope Paul VI., Motuproprio "Ad Purpuratorum Patrum Collegium" (11 February 1965), par. II&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods, discipline, or the service of their titular churches.&lt;ref&gt;Code of Canon law: 357-1&lt;/ref&gt; They are allowed to celebrate Mass and hear confessions and lead visits and pilgrimages to their titular churches, in coordination with the staff of the church. They often support their churches monetarily, and many Cardinals do keep in contact with the pastoral staffs of their titular churches.

The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] in addition to such a titular church also receives the [[Bishop of Ostia|titular bishopric of Ostia]], the primary suburbicarian see. Cardinals governing a [[particular Church]] retain that church.&lt;ref&gt;Code of Canon law: 350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title and reference style==
In 1630, Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be ''[[His Eminence|Eminence]]'' (previously, it had been "illustrissimo" and "reverendissimo"){{efn|They were formerly called illustrissimi and reverendissimi; but Pope Urban VIII (of the Barberini family), in 1630, established the above as their title of honour. Edward Wigglesworth, Thomas Gamaliel Bradford: Encyclopædia Americana: a popular dictionary of arts, sciences. Volume 4. Page 493.}} and decreed that their secular rank would equate to Prince, making them secondary only to the Pope and crowned monarchs.{{efn|As the exclusive electors of the pope (at least since 1179), cardinals were deemed to be the ecclesiastical equivalents of the Holy Roman Empire's 'Prince-Electors,' an extremely elite group with precedence over all other nobility (including archdukes, dukes and counts), who were tasked with the responsibility of electing Holy Roman Emperors.... A decree of 10 June 1630, by Urban VII bestowed the title "His Eminence", historically reserved for high nobility, upon the cardinals, thus elevating them above the 'His Excellency,' then being used to refer to Italian princes." Guruge, Anura. The Next Pope. Alton, New Hampshire. 2010. Page 81.}}{{efn|Authoritarian, keenly conscious of his position, Urban kept business in his own hands and rarely discussed it with his cardinals: to compensate them he gave them the rank of princes of the church  and a right to the title of 'eminence' (June 1630). Oxford Dictionary of Popes: Urban VIII}}

In accordance with tradition, they sign by placing the title "Cardinal" (abbreviated ''Card.'') after their personal name and before their surname as, for instance, "John Card(inal) Doe" or, in [[Latin]], "Ioannes Card(inalis) Cognomen". Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan,&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, ''The Church Visible'', p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English. Official sources such as the  [[Catholic News Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stylebook/stylebooksample.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20051212193819/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stylebook/stylebooksample.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-12-12|title=Catholic News Service|website=www.catholicnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as "Cardinal [First name] [Surname]".

=== Cardinal bishops ===
[[File:Sodano.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angelo Sodano|Cardinal Sodano]], current Dean of the College]]
Cardinal bishops (cardinals of the episcopal order) are among the most senior [[prelates]] of the Catholic Church. Though in modern times most cardinals are also bishops, the term "cardinal bishop" only refers to the cardinals who are [[titular bishop]]s of one of the seven [[suburbicarian diocese|suburbicarian sees]].

In early times, the privilege of [[papal election]] was not reserved to the cardinals, and for centuries the person elected was customarily a Roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere. To preserve [[apostolic succession]] the rite of consecrating him a [[bishop]] had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop. The rule remains that, if the person elected Pope is not yet a bishop, he is consecrated by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, the Cardinal [[Bishop of Ostia]].

There are seven suburbicarian sees: [[Bishop of Ostia|Ostia]], [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano|Albano]], [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Porto-Santa Rufina|Porto and Santa Rufina]], [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Sabina-Poggio Mirteto|Sabina and Mentana]], [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Frascati|Frascati]], and [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Velletri-Segni|Velletri]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6YCpraE-7xcC&amp;pg=PA468 John P.

Since 1962, the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees, with no powers of governance over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document| url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-xxiii/la/motu_proprio/documents/hf_j-xxiii_motu-proprio_19620411_suburbicariis-sedibus.html | language=la | accessdate=2 November 2017| date= 9 April 1962 | title= Suburbicariis sedibus | publisher=  Libreria Editrice Vaticana | author= Pope John XXIII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each see has its own bishop, with the exception of Ostia, of which the [[Cardinal Vicar]] of the see of Rome serves as [[apostolic administrator]].

The current cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian dioceses are given in the table below (along with those Cardinals whose titular churches were co-opted to suburbicarian rank in June 2018). Those over 80 years of age are ineligible to participate in a Papal conclave.

For a period ending in the mid-20th century, long-serving cardinal priests were entitled to fill vacancies that arose among the cardinal bishops, just as [[cardinal deacon]]s of ten years' standing are still entitled to become cardinal priests. Since then, cardinals have been advanced to cardinal bishop exclusively by papal appointment. Those appointed to be cardinal-bishops are usually already cardinals, but their seniority within the order of cardinal bishops is determined by the date of their elevation to the order of cardinal bishop, rather than by the date they originally became cardinals of a lesser order.

On June 26, 2018, it was announced that, corresponding to the expansion in cardinal priests and cardinal deacons in recent decades, there would be an expansion in cardinal bishops (of Roman titles).  Four cardinals, effective June 28, were elevated to this rank by having their titular churches co-opted to suburbicarian rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document | accessdate = 26 June 2018 | url = http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2018/06/26/180626c.html | publisher =Holy See Press Office | date= 26 June 2018 | title = Rescriptum of the Holy Father Francis ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | | work =National Catholic Reporter | date= 26 June 2018 | url = https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/new-papal-appointments-reflect-popes-wish-transparency | accessdate = 26 June 2018 | title = New papal appointments reflect pope's wish for transparency| agency = Catholic News Service | first = Carol | last = Glatz}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement, all six cardinal bishops of suburbicarian see titles, as well as two of the three cardinal patriarchs, were non-electors because of having reached age 80.

==== Dean and Vice-Dean of the College of Cardinals ====
{{main|Dean of the College of Cardinals}}
The Dean of the College of Cardinals, or Cardinal Dean, is the ''[[primus inter pares]]'' of the [[College of Cardinals]], elected by the [[Latin Church]] cardinal bishops from among their own number, an election, however, that must be approved by the Pope. The position of Dean formerly belonged by right to the longest-serving of the cardinal bishops. The Vice-Dean is similarly elected by the Latin Church cardinal bishops from among their own number with the Pope's approval and also formerly belonged by right to the second-longest-serving of the cardinal bishops.

==== Cardinal patriarchs ====
In 1965, [[Pope Paul VI]] decreed in his ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Ad Purpuratorum Patrum Collegium'' that [[patriarch]]s of the Eastern Catholic Churches who were named cardinals (i.e., patriarch cardinals) would also be cardinal bishops, ranking after the six cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian sees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document| title=Ad Purpuratorum Patrum Collegium | url= http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/la/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19650211_ad-purpuratorum.html | publisher= Libreria Editrice Vaticana | accessdate=3 December 2017 | author= Pope Paul VI | language=la | date=11 February 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all other cardinals, these patriarch cardinals do not receive any title associated with the [[Diocese of Rome]]. Unlike the other cardinal bishops, they do not participate in electing the dean nor can they be chosen dean. 

There are currently four Eastern Patriarchs who are cardinal bishops:
* [[Nasrallah Sfeir]], [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Patriarch Emeritus of Antioch]] of the [[Maronite]]s
* [[Antonios Naguib]], [[List of Coptic Catholic Patriarchs of Alexandria|Patriarch Emeritus of Alexandria of the Copts]]
* [[Bechara Boutros al-Rahi]], [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Patriarch of Antioch]] of the [[Maronite]]s
* [[Louis Raphaël I Sako]], [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans]]

If a Latin Church prelate who carries the title patriarch, such as that of [[Patriarchate of Venice|Venice]] or [[Patriarchate of Lisbon|Lisbon]], becomes a cardinal, he ranks as a cardinal priest, not automatically as a cardinal bishop, unless specifically appointed as one.

=== Cardinal priests ===
Cardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church, ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=32336 John Hardon, ''Modern Catholic Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]s of important [[diocese]]s throughout the world, though some hold [[Roman Curia|Curial]] positions.

In modern times, the name "cardinal priest" is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests. Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the ''cardinal'' priests, the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] (the Latin ''cardo'' means "hinge"). Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel—the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of Rome, the pope.

[[File:Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal-priest [[Thomas Wolsey]]]]
While the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and [[Roman Curia]], every cardinal priest has a [[titular church]] in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops are given one of the [[suburbicarian diocese]]s around Rome. [[Pope Paul VI]] abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal's name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to celebrate mass and preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.

While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[Renaissance]], and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, [[Pope Sixtus V]] sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum [[Size of the College of Cardinals|size of the College]] at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When [[Pope John XXIII]] abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.

The cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled ''cardinal [[protopriest]]''. He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80, at which cardinals are barred from the conclave. The current cardinal protopriest is [[Michael Michai Kitbunchu]] of [[Thailand]].

=== Cardinal deacons ===
The cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals. Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the [[Roman Curia]] or priests elevated after their 80th birthday. Bishops with diocesan responsibilities, however, are created cardinal priests.

Cardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the [[Papal Household]] and the seven deacons who supervised the Church's works in the districts of [[Rome]] during the early Middle Ages, when church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services. Cardinal deacons are given title to one of these deaconries.

Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the [[Roman Curia]] holding various posts in the church administration. Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important, they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied.&lt;ref name="Thomas J. Reese p. 92-93"&gt;Thomas J. Reese, '' Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church'',  Harvard University Press, 1996 p. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1587 decree of [[Pope Sixtus V]], which fixed the maximum [[size of the College of Cardinals]], there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent. John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II maintained this ratio.&lt;ref name="Thomas J. Reese p. 92-93"/&gt;

As of 2005, there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries, though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons. Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to "opt for the order of cardinal priests" (''optazione'') after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years. They may on such elevation take a vacant "[[titular church|title]]" (a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest's "title" for that occasion. When elevated to cardinal priests, they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons (thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them, regardless of order).

When not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' [[papal blessing]], some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the [[dalmatic]]s they would don with the simple white mitre (so called ''mitra simplex'').

==== Cardinal protodeacon ====
The cardinal protodeacon is the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals. If he is a cardinal elector and participates in a conclave, he [[Habemus Papam|announces a new pope's election]] and name{{efn|once he has been ordained to the episcopate&lt;ref&gt;Ap. Const. [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html Universi Dominici Gregis, No. 89]&lt;/ref&gt;}} from the central balcony of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]]. The proto-deacon also bestows the pallium on the new pope and crowns him with the [[papal tiara]], though coronations have been discontinued since Pope John Paul I opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;"Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff, he also confers the pallium upon [[Metropolitan bishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan bishops]] or gives the pallium to their proxies." [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P19.HTM Canon 355 §2]&lt;/ref&gt; The current cardinal proto-deacon is [[Renato Raffaele Martino]].

==Special types of cardinals==

===Camerlengo===
The Cardinal [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]], assisted by the Vice-Camerlengo and the other prelates of the office known as the Apostolic Camera, has functions that in essence are limited to a period of ''[[sede vacante]]'' of the papacy. He is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the Holy See and present the results to the College of Cardinals, as they gather for the [[papal conclave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19880628_pastor-bonus-roman-curia_en.html#ADMINISTRATIVE+SERVICES|title=Pastor Bonus, - John Paul II - Apostolic Constitution (June 28, 1988) - John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardinals who are not bishops===
[[File:Reginald Pole painting.jpg|thumb|[[Reginald Pole]] was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest.]]
Until 1917, it was possible for someone who was not a priest, but only in [[minor orders]], to become a cardinal (see "lay cardinals", below), but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons. For example, in the 16th century, [[Reginald Pole]] was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. In 1917 it was established that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests,&lt;ref&gt;Canon 232 §1 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], even if they are only priests at the time of appointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_j-xxiii_motu-proprio_19620415_cum-gravissima_lt.html Motu proprio ''Cum gravissima'', 15 April 1962] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302231616/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_j-xxiii_motu-proprio_19620415_cum-gravissima_lt.html |date=2 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these two changes, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] at his appointment, and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration. Several cardinals aged over 80 or close to it when appointed have obtained [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] from the rule of having to be a bishop.{{efn|Examples include [[Domenico Bartolucci]], [[Karl Josef Becker]], [[Yves Congar]], [[Aloys Grillmeier]], [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Julien Ries]], [[Leo Scheffczyk]], [[Roberto Tucci]] and [[Albert Vanhoye]].}} These were all appointed cardinal-deacons, but [[Roberto Tucci]] and [[Albert Vanhoye]] lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest.

A cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other [[pontificalia]] (episcopal regalia: [[mitre]], [[crozier]], [[zucchetto]], [[pectoral cross]] and ring). Even if not a bishop, any cardinal has both actual and honorary precedence over non-cardinal patriarchs, as well as the archbishops and bishops who are not cardinals, but he cannot perform the functions reserved solely to bishops, such as [[Holy Orders|ordination]]. The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it, and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent [[papal conclave]]s.

==="Lay cardinals"===
{{Main article|Lay cardinal}}
At various times, there have been cardinals who had only received [[tonsure#Western Christianity|first tonsure]] and [[minor orders]] but not yet been [[Holy Orders|ordained]] as [[deacon]]s or priests. Though [[clergy|clerics]], they were inaccurately called "[[lay cardinal]]s". [[Teodolfo Mertel]] was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the [[Code of Canon Law]] promulgated in 1917 by [[Pope Benedict XV]], only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_PO.HTM canon 232 §1] of the 1917 Code of Canon Law&lt;/ref&gt; Since the time of [[Pope John XXIII]] a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P18.HTM canon 351 §1] of the 1983 Code of Canon Law&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardinals ''in pectore'' or secret cardinals==
{{Main article|In pectore}}
In addition to the named cardinals, the pope may name secret cardinals or cardinals ''[[in pectore]]'' (Latin for ''in the breast''). During the [[Western Schism]], many cardinals were created by the contending popes. Beginning with the reign of [[Pope Martin V]],&lt;ref name="CE-cardinal" /&gt; cardinals were created without publishing their names until later, a practice termed ''creati et reservati in pectore''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gIjAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA337&amp;|first=John|last=Rickaby|volume=3|page=337|date=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cardinal named ''in pectore'' is known only to the pope. In the modern era popes have named cardinals ''in pectore'' to protect them or their congregations from political reprisals. If conditions change, the pope makes the appointment public. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those made cardinals at the time of his ''in pectore'' appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an ''in pectore'' cardinal, the person's status as cardinal expires. The last pope known to have named a cardinal ''in pectore'' is [[Pope John Paul II]], who named four, including one whose identity was never revealed.{{efn|The three were:
[[Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei]], Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Shanghai|Shanghai]], made cardinal 1979, revealed 1991; [[Marian Jaworski]], Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Lviv]], made cardinal 1998, revealed 2001; [[Jānis Pujāts]], Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Riga|Riga]], made cardinal 1998, revealed 2001. John Paul created a fourth in 2003 but did not reveal his identity, not even in his will. Speculation centered on [[Joseph Zen Ze-kiun]], Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz (bishop)|Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz]], Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow|Moscow]], and Archbishop [[Stanisław Dziwisz]], John Paul's longtime friend and secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/07/world/fg-secret7 | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 7 April 2005 | title = Mystery Cardinal Will Never Be Able to Join Peers | first= Richard | last = Boudreau |accessdate= 6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral, and when a cardinal died, it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb. Some cardinals will still have a galero made, even though it is not officially part of their apparel.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

To symbolize their bond with the [[papacy]], the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Paulson |first=Michael |date=25 March 2006 |title= Bling! examination of the ring of Cardinal O'Malley | work = Boston Globe | accessdate = 8 September 2010 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/paulson/blog/2006/03/25/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting a cardinal (as with a bishop's episcopal ring). Before the new uniformity imposed by John Paul II, each cardinal was given a ring, the central piece of which was a gem, usually a sapphire, with the pope's stemma engraved on the inside.&lt;ref name="Nainfa1909"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Abel Nainfa|title=Costume of Prelates of the Catholic Church: According to Roman Etiquette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILddVVSkGx8C|year=1909|publisher=John Murphy Company|location=Baltimore-New York|page=107}}.  The new cardinal had to pay for the ring, in exchange for which he received the right to make his own Last Will and Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is now no gemstone, and the pope chooses the image on the outside: under [[Pope Benedict XVI]] it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, with [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]] to each side. The ring includes the pope's coat of arms on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fogcityjournal.com/news_in_brief/mass_of_rings_060326.shtml|title=Elevated cardinals receive gold ring from the pope during Mass of Rings|website=www.fogcityjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinals have in [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] a "privilege of forum" (i.e., exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank): only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction (cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual, or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin, where culpability must be determined and the appropriate
ecclesiastical penalty imposed). The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to a tribunal, usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia. Without such delegation, no [[ecclesiastical court]], even the [[Roman Rota]], is competent to judge a canon law case against a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P5A.HTM Canon 1405 §1 and canon 1406 §2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822022417/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P5A.HTM |date=22 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Children of Gebelawi''''', ('''أولاد حارتنا''') is a novel by the Egyptian writer and Nobel laureate [[Naguib Mahfouz]]. It is also known by its Egyptian dialectal transliteration, '''''Awlad Haretna''''', formal Arabic transliteration, '''''Awlaadu Haaratena''''' and by the alternative translated transliteral Arabic title of '''''Children of Our Alley'''''.

==Reception==
It was originally published in Arabic in 1959, in serialised form, in the daily newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram]]''. It was met with severe opposition from religious authorities, and publication in the form of a book was banned in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Hafez, Sabry: "Introduction" to ''The Cairo Trilogy''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, 2001. pg xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first printed in Lebanon in 1967. An English translation by Philip Stewart was published in 1981 and is still in print; when Stewart refused to sell his copyright, Doubleday commissioned a new version by [[Peter Theroux]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

It was this book that earned Naguib Mahfouz condemnation from [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]] in 1989, after the Nobel Prize had revived interest in it. As a result, in 1994 – a day after the anniversary of the prize – Mahfouz was attacked and stabbed in the neck by two extremists outside his Cairo home.&lt;ref&gt;Hafez, op. cit., pg. xlii.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahfouz survived the attack, yet he suffered from its consequences until his death in 2006.

==Synopsis==

The story recreates the interlinked history of the three monotheistic [[Abrahamic religions]] (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), allegorised against the setting of an imaginary 19th century [[Cairo|Cairene]] alley.

Critics claimed that Gabalawi stands for God. Mahfouz rejected this, saying that he stood for "a certain idea of God that men have made" and that "Nothing can represent God. God is not like anything else. God is gigantic." The first four sections retell, in succession, the stories of: Adam (Adham أدهم) and how he was favoured by Gabalawi over the latter's other sons, including the eldest [[Satan]]/[[Iblis]] (Idris إدريس). In subsequent generations the heroes relive the lives of [[Moses]] (Gabal جبل), [[Jesus]] (Rifa'a رفاعة) and [[Muhammad]] (Qasim قاسم). The followers of each hero settle in different parts of the alley, symbolising Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The protagonist of the book's fifth section is Arafa (عرفة), who symbolises modern science and comes after the prophets, while all of their followers claim Arafa as one of their own.

Central to the plot are the futuwwat (plural of futuwwa, 'strongman'), who control the alley and exact protection money from the people. The successive heroes overthrow the strongmen of their time, but in the next generation new strongmen spring up and things are as bad as ever. Arafa tries to use his knowledge of explosives to destroy the strongmen, but his attempts to discover Gabalawi's secrets leads to the death of the old man (though he does not directly kill him). The Chief Strongman guesses the truth and blackmails Arafa into helping him to become the dictator of the whole Alley. The book ends, after the murder of Arafa, with his friend searching in a rubbish tip for the book in which Arafa wrote his secrets. The people say "Oppression must cease as night yields to day. We shall see the end of tyranny and the dawn of miracles."

'''Christian culture''' is the [[cultural practice]]s common to [[Christianity]].  With the rapid expansion of Christianity to Europe, Syria, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Asia Minor]], Egypt, Ethiopia, and India and by the end of the 4th&amp;nbsp;century it had also become the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B.

[[Western culture]], throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as [[Cultural Christian|cultural Christians]]. The notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is "at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of ''How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization'' by Thomas Woods, Jr. |url=http://www.nrbookservice.com/products/bookpage.asp?prod_cd=c6664 |work=National Review Book Service |accessdate=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Western culture contained several polytheistic religions during its early years under the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire]]s, as the centralized Roman power waned, the dominance of the Catholic Church was the only consistent force in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=Early Middle Ages|isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=The Age of Enlightenment|isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian culture guided the course of philosophy, literature, art, music and science.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0-8132-1683-6|edition=reprint|first2=Glenn |last2=Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian disciplines of the respective arts have subsequently developed into [[Christian philosophy]], [[Christian art]], [[Christian music]], [[Christian literature]] etc. Art and literature, law, education, and politics were preserved in the teachings of the Church, in an environment that, otherwise, would have probably seen their loss.

== Architecture ==
{{Main|Church architecture}}
[[File:Tomb of Jesus3.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Jesus]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre church]] in [[Jerusalem]].]]
The architecture of cathedrals, basilicas and abbey churches is characterised by the buildings' large scale and follows one of several branching traditions of form, function and style that all ultimately derive from the [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian architectural]] traditions established in the [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantinian]] period.

Cathedrals in particular, as well as many [[abbey]] churches and [[basilica]]s, have certain complex structural forms that are found less often in [[parish church]]es. They also tend to display a higher level of contemporary architectural style and the work of accomplished craftsmen, and occupy a status both ecclesiastical and social that an ordinary parish church does not have.  Such a cathedral or great church is generally one of the finest buildings within its region and is a focus of local pride. Many cathedrals and basilicas, and a number of abbey churches are among the world's most renowned works of architecture. These include [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Notre Dame de Paris]], [[Cologne Cathedral]], [[Salisbury Cathedral]], [[Prague Cathedral]], [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the [[Basilica of St Denis]], the Basilica of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Washington National Cathedral]], [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]], [[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis]], Gaudí's incomplete [[Sagrada Familia]] and the ancient church of [[Hagia Sophia]], now a museum.

The earliest large churches date from [[Late Antiquity]]. As Christianity and the construction of churches and cathedrals spread throughout the world, their manner of building was dependent upon local materials and local techniques. Different [[Architectural style|styles of architecture]] developed and their fashion spread, carried by the establishment of monastic orders, by the posting of bishops from one region to another and by the travelling of master [[stonemason]]s who served as architects.&lt;ref&gt;John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles of the great church buildings are successively known as [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], various [[Victorian architecture|Revival]] styles of the late 18th to early 20th centuries and [[Modern architecture|Modern]].&lt;ref name="BF"/&gt; Overlaid on each of the academic styles are the regional characteristics. Some of these characteristics are so typical of a particular country or region that they appear, regardless of style, in the architecture of churches designed many centuries apart.&lt;ref name="BF"/&gt;

[[Christian art]] is [[sacred art]] which uses themes and imagery from Christianity. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity.

Images of [[Jesus]] and narrative scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' are the most common subjects, and scenes from the [[Old Testament]] play a part in the art of most denominations.  Images of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

Christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam]] and [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism]].  However, there is also a considerable history of [[aniconism in Christianity]] from various periods.

===Illumination===
{{Main|Illuminated manuscript}}

[[File:Armenian-manuscript-CIMG1727.JPG|thumb|upright|Armenian manuscript of 1053. Work of Johannes]]
An [[illuminated manuscript]] is a [[manuscript]] in which the [[Writing|text]] is supplemented by the addition of decoration. The earliest surviving substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period AD 400 to 600, primarily produced in Ireland, [[Constantinople]] and Italy. The majority of surviving manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many illuminated manuscripts survive from the 15th century [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from [[Late Antiquity]].

Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on [[papyrus]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on [[parchment]] (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called [[vellum]], traditionally made of unsplit [[calfskin]], though high quality parchment from other skins was also called ''parchment''.

===Iconography===
{{Main|Iconoclasm|Religious image|Christian icons|Christian symbolism}}

[[File:St. Theodor.jpg|thumb|upright|There are few old ceramic icons, such as this [[Theodore Stratelates|St. Theodor]] icon which dates to ca. 900 (from [[Preslav]], Bulgaria)]]
Christian art began, about two centuries after Christ, by borrowing motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art. [[Religious images]] are used to some extent by the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] Christian faith, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition. In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]]. Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].

An [[icon]] is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from [[Orthodox Christianity]]. Christianity has used [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] from its very beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Symbolism}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both East and West, numerous iconic types of Christ, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.

[[Christian symbolism]] invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas. Christianity has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world. [[Religious symbolism]] is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and [[Panagia]] types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s. Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

Each [[saint]] has a story and a reason why he or she led an exemplary life. Symbols have been used to tell these stories throughout the history of the Church. A number of Christian [[saint]]s are traditionally represented by a symbol or [[Icon|iconic motif]] associated with their life, termed an attribute or [[emblem]], in order to identify them. The study of these forms part of [[iconography]] in [[Art history]].

=== Eastern Christian art ===
{{main|Byzantine art}}
[[File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumb|upright|6th? century [[icon]] of [[Christ Pantocrator]], a very rare pre-[[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] icon.]]
The dedication of [[Constantinople]] as capital in 330 AD created a great new Christian artistic centre for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], which soon became a separate political unit. Major Constantinopolitan churches built under Constantine and his son, [[Constantius II]], included the original foundations of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Mathews, ''The early churches of Constantinople: architecture and liturgy'' (University Park, 1971); N. Henck, "Constantius ho Philoktistes?", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 55 (2001), 279–304 ([http://www.doaks.org/DOP55/DP55ch14.pdf available online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327035204/http://www.doaks.org/DOP55/DP55ch14.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Western Roman Empire]] disintegrated and was taken over by "barbarian" peoples, the art of the Byzantine Empire reached levels of sophistication, power and artistry not previously seen in Christian art, and set the standards for those parts of the West still in touch with Constantinople.
[[File:Rhodes Siana2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright|Church of Agios Panteleimonos, Greece.]]
This achievement was checked by the controversy over the use of ''graven images'', and the proper interpretation of the Second Commandment, which led to the crisis of [[Byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] or destruction of religious images, which racked the Empire between 726 and 843. The restoration of Orthodoxy resulted in a strict standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]]. Byzantine art became increasingly conservative, as the form of images themselves, many accorded [[Acheiropoieta|divine origin]] or thought to have been be painted by [[Saint Luke]] or other figures, was held to have a status not far off that of a scriptural text. They could be copied, but not improved upon. As a concession to Iconoclast sentiment, monumental religious sculpture was effectively banned. Neither of these attitudes were held in Western Europe, but Byzantine art nonetheless had great influence there until the [[High Middle Ages]], and remained very popular long after that, with vast numbers of icons of the [[Cretan School]] exported to Europe as late as the [[Renaissance]]. Where possible, Byzantine artists were borrowed for projects such as mosaics in [[Venice]] and [[Palermo]]. The enigmatic frescoes at [[Castelseprio]] may be an example of work by a Greek artist working in Italy.

The art of [[Eastern Catholicism]] has always been rather closer to the Orthodox art of Greece and Russia, and in countries near the Orthodox world, notably Poland, Catholic art has many Orthodox influences. The [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]] may well have been of Byzantine origin – it has been repainted and this is hard to tell. Other images that are certainly of Greek origin, like the [[Salus Populi Romani]] and [[Our Lady of Perpetual Help]], both icons in Rome, have been subjects of specific veneration for centuries.

Although the influence has often been resisted, especially in Russia, Catholic art has also affected Orthodox depictions in many respects, especially in countries like Romania, and in the post-Byzantine [[Cretan School]], which led [[Greek Orthodox]] art under Venetian rule in the 15th and 16th centuries. [[El Greco]] left Crete when relatively young, but [[Michael Damaskinos]] returned after a brief period in Venice, and was able to switch between Italian and Greek styles. Even the traditionalist [[Theophanes the Cretan]], working mainly on [[Mount Athos]], nevertheless shows unmistakable Western influence.

Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward. A number of states contemporary with the [[Byzantine Empire]] were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the "[[Byzantine commonwealth]]"). These included [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[History of Medieval Serbia|Serbia]], and the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]], as well as some non-Orthodox states like the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. Art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] is often called "post-Byzantine." Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

=== Roman Catholic art ===
{{main|Roman Catholic art}}
[[File:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|thumb|upright|Bernini's ''Ecstasy of Saint Theresa'']]
[[Roman Catholic art]] consists of all visual works produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the teachings of the [[Catholic Church]]. This includes sculpture, painting, mosaics, metalwork, embroidery and even architecture. Catholic art has played a leading role in the history and development of Western Art since at least the fourth century. The principal subject matter of Catholic Art has been the life and times of [[Jesus Christ]], along with those of his disciples, the saints, and the events of the Jewish [[Old Testament]].

The earliest surviving art works are the painted frescoes on the walls of the [[catacomb]]s and meeting houses of the persecuted Christians of the Roman Empire. The Christian Church in Rome was influenced by the Roman style of art and the religious Christian artists of the time. The stone [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of Roman Christians exhibit the earliest surviving carved statuary of Jesus, Mary and other biblical figures. The legalisation of Christianity transformed Catholic art, which adopted richer forms such as [[mosaics]] and illuminated manuscripts. The [[iconoclasm]] controversy briefly divided the eastern and western churches, after which artistic development progressed in separate directions. [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art]] flowered in the Western Church as the style of painting and statuary moved in an increasingly naturalistic direction. The Protestant Reformation produced new waves of image-destruction, to which the Church responded with the dramatic and emotive [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles. In the 19th century the leadership in western art moved away from the Catholic Church which, after embracing historical revivalism was increasingly affected by the modernist movement, a movement that in its "rebellion" against nature, counters the Church's emphasis on nature as a good creation of God.

Renaissance artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[Titian]], were among a multitude of innovative virtuosos sponsored by the Church.&lt;ref name="Duffy133"&gt;Duffy, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

British art historian [[Kenneth Clark]] wrote that Western Europe's first "great age of civilisation" was ready to begin around the year 1000. From 1100, he wrote, monumental abbeys and cathedrals were constructed and decorated with sculptures, hangings, mosaics and works belonging one of the greatest epochs of art and providing stark contrast to the monotonous and cramped conditions of ordinary living during the period. [[Abbot Suger]] of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: "The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material". Clarke calls this "the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained the basis of our belief of the value of art until today".&lt;ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"&gt;[[Kenneth Clarke]]; ''Civilisation'', BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during [[The Renaissance]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Catholic artists produced many of the unsurpassed masterpieces of [[Western art]] – often inspired by Biblical themes: from Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' and ''[[Pietà]]'' sculptures, to Da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' and Raphael's various ''Madonna'' paintings. Referring to a "great outburst of creative energy such as took place in Rome between 1620 and 1660", Kenneth Clarke wrote:&lt;ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]ith a single exception, the great artists of the time were all sincere, conforming Christians. [[Guercino]] spent much of his mornings in prayer; [[Bernini]] frequently went into retreats and practised the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]]; [[Rubens]] attended Mass every morning before beginning work. The exception was [[Caravaggio]], who was like the hero of a modern play, except that he happened to paint very well.

This conformism was not based on fear of the Inquisition, but on the perfectly simple belief that the faith which had inspired the great saints of the preceding generation was something by which a man should regulate his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Protestant art ===
[[File:Hans Holbein d. J. 017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s ''Noli me tangere'' a relatively rare Protestant oil painting of Christ from the Reformation period. It is small, and generally naturalistic in style, avoiding iconic elements like the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], which is barely discernible.]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach.  A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed [[Protestant]] agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] art produced during the [[High Renaissance]].  In turn, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of [[art in Roman Catholicism]] to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art.  Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced.  Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like [[history painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]] and [[still life]].

Prominent painters with Protestant background were, for example, [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. World literature was enriched by the works of [[Edmund Spenser]], [[John Milton]], [[John Bunyan]], [[John Donne]], [[John Dryden]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]], [[Theodor Fontane]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Emily Brontë]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Thomas Stearns Eliot]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[William Faulkner]], [[John Updike]], and many others.

== Music ==
{{Main|Christian music}}
[[Christian music]] is music that has been written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding Christian life and faith. Common themes of Christian music include [[praise]], [[worship]], [[penitence]], and [[lament]], and its forms vary widely across the world.

Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of Christian music varies according to culture and social context. Christian music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace.

In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;Murray, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of Catholic composers and Catholic sacred music which have a prominent place in Western culture is extensive, but includes [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]''; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Ave verum corpus]]''; [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Ave Maria]]'', [[César Franck]]'s ''[[Panis angelicus]]'', and [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s ''[[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]]''.

[[Martin Luther]], [[Paul Gerhardt]], [[George Wither]], [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]], and many other authors and composers created well-known church hymns. Musicians like [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frederick Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]] composed great works of music.

[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|200px|thumbnail|[[Gutenberg Bible]]. The [[Bible]] was [[Authorship of the Bible|authored]] by Jews during the [[Iron Age]]s and the [[Classical era]]. It comprise cultural values, basic human values, mythology and religious beliefs of both Judaism and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature|title=biblical literature|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Christian literature]] is writing that deals with Christian themes and incorporates the Christian world view. This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. [[Christian poetry]] is any poetry that contains Christian teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide [[allegory]].

While falling within the strict definition of literature, the Bible is not generally considered literature. However, the Bible has been treated and appreciated as literature; the [[Bible]] is a corner stone of Western civilization.&lt;ref name="Perry2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin Perry|title=Western Civilization: A Brief History, Volume I: To 1789|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2pnv0Aoh2EC&amp;pg=PA33|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-83720-1|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King James Version]] in particular has long been considered a masterpiece of English prose, whatever may be thought of its religious significance. The Authorized Version has been called "the most influential version of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language", "the most important book in English religion and culture", and "the most celebrated book in the [[English-speaking world]]". [[David Crystal]] has estimated that it is responsible for 257 idioms in English, examples include [[feet of clay]] and [[wikt:sow the wind, reap the whirlwind|reap the whirlwind]]. Furthermore, prominent [[atheist]] figures such as the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have praised the King James Version as being "a giant step in the maturing of English literature" and "a great work of literature", respectively, with Dawkins then adding, "A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2011/05/hitchens-201105?currentPage=all|title=When the King Saved God|year=2011|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=10 August 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/19/richard-dawkins-king-james-bible|title=Why I want all our children to read the King James Bible|date=20 May 2012|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate= 10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several retellings of the Bible, or parts of the Bible, have also been made with the aim of emphasising its literary qualities. With estimated sales of over 5 billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best selling book of non-fiction|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryken|first1=Leland|title=How We Got the Best-Selling Book of All Time|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903918104576502782310557332|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sells approximately 100 million copies annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The battle of the books|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10311317?story_id=10311317&amp;CFID=3289446&amp;CFTOKEN=a87381115ea0752-5130AD65-B27C-BB00-012B3B9A581DD567 | work=The Economist | date=22 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RussellAsh&gt;{{cite book|author=Ash, Russell|authorlink=Russell Ash|title=Top 10 of Everything 2002|year=2001|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=0-7894-8043-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a major influence on literature and history, especially in [[Western world|the West]], where the [[Gutenberg Bible]] was the first book printed using [[movable type]].
[[File:Saints of the Golden Legend collage.jpg|200px|thumbnail|The stories of the saints which are preserved in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'']]
In [[Byzantine literature]], four different cultural elements are recognised: the [[Greek literature|Greek]], the Christian, the [[Latin literature|Roman]], and the Oriental. Byzantine literature is often classified in five groups: historians and annalists, encyclopaedists (Patriarch Photios, [[Michael Psellus]], and [[Michael Choniates]] are regarded as the greatest encyclopaedists of Byzantium) and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the ''[[Digenis Acritas]]''. The remaining two groups include the new literary species: ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.&lt;ref name="Mango275–276"&gt;{{harvnb|Mango|2007|pp=275–276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And it was in [[Alexandria]] that Graeco-Oriental Christianity had its birth. There the [[Septuagint]] translation had been made; there that that fusion of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion took place which culminated in [[Philo]]; there flourished the mystic speculative [[Neoplatonism]] associated with [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry of Tyros|Porphyry]]. At Alexandria the great Greek ecclesiastical writers worked alongside pagan rhetoricians and philosophers; several were born here, e.g. [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and his opponent [[Arius]], also [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] and [[Synesius]]. On Egyptian soil [[monasticism]] began and thrived. After Alexandria, [[Antioch]] held great prestige, where a school of Christian commentators flourished under [[St. John Chrysostom]] and where later arose the Christian universal chronicles. In surrounding Syria, we find the germs of Greek ecclesiastical poetry, while from neighboring [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] came [[St. John of Damascus]], one of the [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]].

The list of Catholic authors and literary works is vast. With a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible and [[Papal Encyclicals]] have been constants of the Catholic canon but countless other historical works may be listed as noteworthy in terms of their influence on Western society. From late Antiquity, [[St Augustine]]'s book [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]], which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography of ever written in the canon of [[Western Literature]]. Augustine profoundly influenced the coming medieval worldview. The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', written 1265–1274, is the best-known work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225–1274), and although unfinished, "one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, James F., "Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa theologiae'' (ca. 1273), Christian Wisdom Explained Philosophically", in ''The Classics of Western Philosophy: A Reader's Guide'', (eds.) Jorge J. E. Gracia, Gregory M. Reichberg, Bernard N. Schumacher (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), p. 165. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jAcwGItzssC&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;ots=MXldxkl9sr&amp;dq=james%20f%20ross%20philosopher&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended as a manual for beginners in theology and a compendium of all of the main [[theology|theological]] teachings of the Church. It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The epic poetry of the Italian [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of the late [[Middle Ages]] is also considered immensely influential. The English statesman and philosopher, [[Thomas More]], wrote the seminal work [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] in 1516. [[St Ignatius Loyola]], a key figure in the Catholic counter-reformation, is the author of an influential book of meditations known as the ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]''.

== Philosophy==
{{Main|Christian philosophy|Scholasticism}}
[[File:Augustine Confessiones.jpg|thumb|upright|''Confessions'' by St. [[Augustine of Hippo]]]]
[[Christian philosophy]] is a term to describe the fusion of various fields of philosophy with the [[Theology|theological]] doctrines of Christianity. [[Scholasticism]], which means "that [which] belongs to the school", and was a method of learning taught by the [[academics]] (or ''school people'') of medieval universities c. 1100–1500. Scholasticism originally started to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval Christian theology. Scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].

Medieval philosophy is the philosophy of Western Europe and the Middle East during the [[Middle Ages]], roughly extending from the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]] until the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Frederick Copleston, ''A History of Philosophy, Volume II: From Augustine to Scotus'' (Burns &amp; Oates, 1950), p. 1, dates medieval philosophy proper from the Carolingian Renaissance in the eighth century to the end of the fourteenth century, though he includes [[Augustine]] and the Patristic fathers as precursors. Desmond Henry, in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967), vol. 5, pp. 252–257, starts with Augustine and ends with [[Nicole Oresme|Nicholas of Oresme]] in the late fourteenth century. David Luscombe, ''Medieval Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), dates medieval philosophy from the conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in 312 to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1520s. Christopher Hughes, in A.C. Grayling (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), covers philosophers from Augustine to Ockham. Jorge J.E. Gracia, in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2003), p. 620, identifies medieval philosophy as running from Augustine to [[John of St. Thomas]] in the seventeenth century. Anthony Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy, Volume II: Medieval Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), begins with Augustine and ends with the Lateran Council of 1512.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval philosophy is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then widespread sacred doctrines of [[Abrahamic religion]] ([[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and Christianity) with [[secularism|secular]] learning.

The history of western European medieval philosophy is traditionally divided into two main periods: the period in the [[Latin West]] following the [[Early Middle Ages]] until the 12th century, when the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] were preserved and cultivated; and the "golden age" of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries in the Latin West, which witnessed the culmination of the recovery of ancient philosophy, and significant developments in the field of [[philosophy of religion]], [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]].
[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|upright|''Summa theologica'', Pars secunda, prima pars. (copy by Peter Schöffer, 1471)]]
The medieval era was disparagingly treated by the Renaissance humanists, who saw it as a barbaric "middle" period between the classical age of Greek and Roman culture, and the "rebirth" or ''renaissance'' of classical culture. Yet this period of nearly a thousand years was the longest period of philosophical development in Europe, and possibly the richest. [[Jorge Gracia]] has argued that "in intensity, sophistication, and achievement, the philosophical flowering in the thirteenth century could be rightly said to rival the golden age of Greek philosophy in the fourth century B.C."&lt;ref name="gracia"&gt;Gracia, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of [[faith]] to [[reason]], the existence and unity of God, the object of theology and [[metaphysics]], the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.

Philosophers from the Middle Ages include the Christian philosophers [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Jean Buridan]]; the Jewish philosophers [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]; and the [[Muslim]] philosophers [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], [[Al-Farabi|Alfarabi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]], [[Ibn Bajjah|Avempace]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]], [[Ibn Khaldūn]], and [[Averroes]]. The medieval tradition of [[Scholasticism]] continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as [[Francisco Suarez]] and [[John of St. Thomas]].

Aquinas, father of [[Thomism]], was immensely influential in Catholic Europe, placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation, and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. His work was a significant departure from the [[Neoplatonic]] and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early Scholasticism.

The Renaissance ("rebirth") was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought,&lt;ref name="contemporaries"&gt;Charles Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 5, loosely define the period as extending "from the age of Ockham to the revisionary work of Bacon, Descartes and their contemporaries."&lt;/ref&gt; in which the recovery of classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism.&lt;ref name="renaissance3"&gt;Brian Copenhaver and Charles Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 4: "one may identify the hallmark of Renaissance philosophy as an accelerated and enlarged interest, stimulated by newly available texts, in primary sources of Greek and Roman thought that were previously unknown or partially known or little read."&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the classics and the humane arts generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as [[humanism]].&lt;ref name="transmission"&gt;Jorge J.E. Gracia in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2002), p. 621: "the humanists … restored man to the centre of attention and channeled their efforts to the recovery and transmission of classical learning, particularly in the philosophy of Plato."&lt;/ref&gt; Displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed [[Petrarch]] in making man and his virtues the focus of philosophy.&lt;ref name="intellectual"&gt;Charles B. Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 61 and 63: "From Petrarch the early humanists learnt their conviction that the revival of ''humanae literae'' was only the first step in a greater intellectual renewal" […] "the very conception of philosophy was changing because its chief object was now man—man was at centre of every inquiry".&lt;/ref&gt;

These new movements in philosophy developed contemporaneously with larger religious and political transformations in Europe: the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the decline of [[feudalism]].  Though the theologians of the Protestant Reformation showed little direct interest in philosophy, their destruction of the traditional foundations of theological and intellectual authority harmonized with a revival of [[fideism]] and skepticism in thinkers such as [[Erasmus]], [[Montaigne]], and [[Francisco Sanches]].&lt;ref name="scepticism"&gt;Richard Popkin, ''The History of Scepticism from Savonarola to Bayle'' (Oxford University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the gradual centralization of political power in nation-states was echoed by the emergence of secular political philosophies, as in the works of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (often described as the first modern political thinker, or a key turning point towards modern political thinking), [[Thomas More]], [[Erasmus]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Jean Bodin]], and [[Hugo Grotius]].&lt;ref name="renaissance5"&gt;Copenhaver and Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 274–284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="renaissance6"&gt;Schmitt and Skinner, ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 430–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with [[Newtonian mechanics]] appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of [[evolution]] or [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref name=habgood&gt;''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills &amp; Brown, 1964, pp., 11, 14–16, 48–55, 68–69, 90–91, 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Habgood: pages 48-55 --&gt; Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a ''[[survival of the fittest|struggle for existence]].'' These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal [[sociobiology|patterns of biological cooperation]]. According to [[John Habgood]], all man really knows here is that the [[universe]] seems to be a mix of [[good and evil]], beauty and [[pain]], and that [[suffering]] may somehow be part of the process of creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not be surprised that suffering may be used creatively by God, given their faith in the symbol of the [[Christian cross|Cross]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: page 68-69 --&gt;

Despite some opposition to pagan learning, many of the most distinguished classical scholars held high office in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Church]]. &lt;ref&gt; Some noteworthy exceptions to this tolerance include the closing of the [[Platonic Academy]] in 529; the [[obscurantism]] of [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]]; and the condemnations of [[Ioannis Italos]] and [[George Gemistos Plethon|Georgios Plethon]] for their devotion to ancient philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of antiquity never ceased to be cultivated in the [[Byzantine empire]] due to the impetus given to [[classical studies]] by the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] of Athens in the 4th and 5th centuries, the vigor of the philosophical academy of [[Alexandria]], and to the services of the [[University of Constantinople]], which concerned itself entirely with secular subjects, to the exclusion of [[theology]],&lt;ref&gt;The faculty was composed exclusively of philosophers, scientists, rhetoricians, and [[philology|philologists]] ({{cite book | last=Tatakes |first=Vasileios N. |author2=Moutafakis, Nicholas J. | title=Byzantine Philosophy | year=2003 | publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=0-87220-563-0|pages=189}})&lt;/ref&gt; which was taught in the [[Halki seminary|Patriarchical Academy]]. Even the latter offered instruction in the ancient classics, and included literary, philosophical, and scientific texts in its curriculum. The monastic schools concentrated upon the [[Bible]], theology, and [[liturgy]]. Therefore, the monastic [[scriptoria]] expended most of their efforts upon the transcription of ecclesiastical manuscripts, while ancient-pagan literature was transcribed, summarized, excerpted, and annotated by laymen or clergy like [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]], [[Arethas of Caesarea]], [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], and [[Basilius Bessarion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anastos|first=Milton V.|authorlink=|year=1962|title=The History of Byzantine Science.

In early [[Byzantium]] (5th to 7th century) the architects and mathematicians [[Isidore of Miletus]] and [[Anthemius of Tralles]] used complex mathematical formulas to construct the great [[Hagia Sophia]] church, a technological breakthrough for its time and for centuries afterwards due to its striking geometry, bold design and height. In late Byzantium (9th to 12th century) mathematicians like [[Michael Psellos]] considered mathematics as a way to interpret the world.

[[Middle Eastern Christians]] especially the adherents of the [[Church of the East]] ([[Nestorian]]s), contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the [[Ummayads|Ummayad]] and the [[Abbasids|Abbasid]] periods by translating works of [[Greek philosophers]] to [[Syriac Language|Syriac]] and afterwards to [[Arabic Language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Hill, Donald 1993. p.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of the Middle Ages|author=Brague, Rémi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c8YjEkLPXNYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780226070803#v=onepage&amp;q=House%20of%20Wisdom&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 February 2014|isbn=9780226070803|page=164|date=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 4th through the 7th centuries, scholarly work in the Syriac and Greek languages was either newly initiated, or carried on from the Hellenistic period.

While refined and clarified over the centuries, the [[Roman Catholic]] position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of [[natural law]] as set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]].  For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of [[theistic evolution]], stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both [[monogenism]] and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13554b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo once stated "The intention of the [[Holy Spirit]] is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to Galileo|last= Machamer|first= Peter|year= 1998|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= |isbn= 0-521-58841-3|page= 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 [[John Paul II]], then pope of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], spoke of the relationship this way: "The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer".&lt;ref&gt;Pope [[John Paul II]], 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Church on Western letters and learning has been formidable. The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture. For centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, small monastic communities were practically the only outposts of literacy in Western Europe. In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since. The Church and clergymen have also sought at different times to censor texts and scholars. Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and influence of the Church in relation to western letters and learning.

One view, first propounded by [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophers]], asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. [[Communist states]] have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are the Church's condemnations of the teachings of [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].

The Church's priest-scientists, many of whom were [[Jesuit]]s, have been among the leading lights in [[astronomy]], [[genetics]], [[geomagnetism]], [[meteorology]], [[seismology]], and [[solar physics]], becoming some of the "fathers" of these sciences. Examples include important churchmen such as the [[Augustinian]] abbot [[Gregor Mendel]] (pioneer in the study of genetics), [[Roger Bacon]] (a [[Franciscan]] friar who was one of the early advocates of the [[scientific method]]), and Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]] (the first to propose the [[Big Bang]] theory). Other notable priest scientists have included [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Nicholas Steno]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Giambattista Riccioli]], [[Roger Boscovich]], and [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Even more numerous are Catholic laity involved in science:[[Henri Becquerel]] who discovered [[radioactivity]]; [[Galvani]], [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]], [[Ampere]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]], pioneers in electricity and [[telecommunications]]; [[Lavoisier]], "father of modern [[chemistry]]"; [[Vesalius]], founder of modern [[human anatomy]]; and [[Cauchy]], one of the mathematicians who laid the rigorous foundations of [[calculus]].

Throughout history many of the [[List of Roman Catholic cleric-scientists|Roman Catholic clerics]] have made contributions to science, mostly during periods of Church domination of public life. These cleric-scientists include [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Georges Lemaître]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], [[Nicole Oresme]], [[Jean Buridan]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Christopher Clavius]], [[Nicolas Steno]], [[Athanasius Kircher]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], [[William of Ockham]], and others. The Catholic Church has also produced many [[List of Catholic scientists|lay scientists and mathematicians]].

The Jesuits have made numerous significant contributions to the development of science. For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to earthquakes, and [[seismology]] has been described as "the Jesuit science".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Elizabeth Hough, ''Richter's Scale: Measure of an Earthquake, Measure of a Man'', Princeton University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-691-12807-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rvmDeAxEiO8C&amp;pg=PA68 p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits have been described as "the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David C.|last1=Lindberg|first2=Ronald Leslie|last2=Numbers|authorlink1=David C.

They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on [[Jupiter]]'s surface, the Andromeda nebula and Saturn's rings.

Protestantism had an important influence on science. According to the [[Merton Thesis]] there was a positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Puritanism]] and [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] on the one hand and early [[experimental science]] on the other.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka|Sztompka, Piotr]] (2003), ''Robert King Merton'', in ''[[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]], [[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists]], Malden, Massachusetts Oxford: Blackwell, p. 13, {{ISBN|9781405105958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory, Andrew (1998), Handout for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, [[Robert K. Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642–660&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study God's influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003/&gt;

According of ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United State'' by [[Harriet Zuckerman]], a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American [[Nobel Prizes|Nobel Prize]] Laureates, have identified from [[Protestant]] background.&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HAHCzJfmD5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Scientific+Elite:+Nobel+Laureates+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMIxKistOqUxwIVzNUUCh0pGgC-#v=onepage&amp;q=Scientific%20Elite%3A%20Nobel%20Laureates%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;f=false Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States]'' New York, The Free Pres, 1977, p.68: Protestants turn up among the American-reared laureates in slightly greater proportion to their numbers in the general population.

The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Christian]] setting.&lt;ref name="Rüegg, Walter 1992, pp. XIX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verger1999"/&gt; Prior to the establishment of universities, European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian [[cathedral school]]s or [[monastic school]]s (''Scholae monasticae''), in which [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Pierre (1978): "Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|0-87249-376-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;126–7, 282–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Missionary activity for the Catholic Church has always incorporated education of evangelized peoples as part of its social ministry. History shows that in evangelized lands, the first people to operate schools were Roman Catholics. In some countries, the Church is the main provider of education or significantly supplements government forms of education. Presently, the Church operates the world's largest non-governmental school system.&lt;ref name="Gardner148"&gt;Gardner, p.&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Western Civilization's most influential universities were founded by the Catholic Church.
[[File:Xaviers college.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|The Catholic [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St. Xavier's College in Mumbai]], is one of the most prestigious liberal arts colleges in India]]
The Catholic Church founded the West's first universities, which were preceded by the schools attached to monasteries and cathedrals, and generally staffed by monks and friars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Universities began springing up in Italian towns like [[Salerno University|Salerno]], which became a leading medical school, translating the work of Greek and Arabic physicians into Latin. [[Bologna University]] became the most influential of the early universities, which first specialised in [[canon law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. [[Paris University]], specialising in such topics as theology, came to rival Bologna under the supervision of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. [[Oxford University]] in England later came rival Paris in Theology and [[Salamanca University]] was founded in Spain in 1243. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the universities benefitted from the use of Latin, the common language of the Church, and its internationalist reach, and their role was to "teach, argue and reason within a Christian framework".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost. Compulsory education for both boys and girls was introduced. For example, the [[Puritans]] who established [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1628 founded [[Harvard College]] only eight years later. About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century, including [[Yale University]] (1701). [[Pennsylvania]] also became a centre of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 69–80, 88–89, 114–117, 186–188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Schmidt, ''Kongregationalismus'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band III (1959), Tübingen (Germany), col. 1770&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Princeton University]] was a [[Presbyterian church|Presbyterian]] foundation. Protestantism also initiated translations of the Bible into national languages and hereby supported the development of national literatures.

A large number of [[mainline Protestant]]s have played leadership roles in many aspects of American life, including politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They founded most of the country's leading institutes of higher education.&lt;ref name=mainline2000&gt;McKinney, William. "Mainline Protestantism 2000."

According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in sub-Saharan Africa" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their Christian counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the educational facilities that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

== Medicine and health care ==
[[File:SantaMariaDellaScalaSienaBack.JPG|thumb|upright|Panorama of Siena's [[Santa Maria della Scala (Siena)|Santa Maria della Scala Hospital]], one of Europe's oldest hospitals]]
The administration of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires split and the [[Fall of Rome|demise of the Western Empire]] by the sixth century was accompanied by a series of violent invasions and precipitated the collapse of cities and civic institutions of learning, along with their links to the learning of classical Greece and Rome. For the next thousand years, medical knowledge would change very little.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp82-83&lt;/ref&gt; A scholarly medical tradition maintained itself in the more stable East, but in the West, scholarship virtually disappeared outside of the Church, where monks were aware of a dwindling range of medical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitality was considered an obligation of Christian charity and bishops' houses and the valetudinaria of wealthier Christians were used to tend the sick. And the legacy of this early period was, in the words of Porter, that "Christianity planted the hospital: the well-endowed establishments of the Levant and the scattered houses of the West shared a common religious ethos of charity." 

The [[Byzantine Empire]] was one of the first empires to have flourishing medical establishments. Prior to the Byzantine Empire the Roman Empire had [[hospitals]] specifically for soldiers and slaves. However, none of these establishments were for the public. The hospitals in Byzantium were originally started by the church to act as a place for the poor to have access to basic amenities. Hospitals were usually separated between men and women. Although the remains of these hospitals have not been discovered by archaeologists, recordings of hospitals from the Byzantine Empire describe large buildings that had the core feature of an open hearth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Hospital in the Byzantine Empire|last=Miller|first=Timothy|publisher=Johns Hopkins|year=1985|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishments of the Byzantine Empire resembled the beginning of what we now know as modern hospitals. The first hospital was erected by Leontius of Antioch between the years 344 to 358 and was a place for strangers and migrants to find refuge. Around the same time, a deacon named Marathonius was in charge of hospitals and monasteries in Constantinople. His main objective was to improve urban aesthetics, illustrating hospitals as a main part of Byzantine cities. These early hospitals were designed for the poor. In fact, most hospitals throughout the Byzantine Empire were almost exclusively utilized by the poor. This may be due to descriptions of hospitals similar to "[[Gregory of Nazianzus|Gregory Nazianzen]] who called the hospital a stairway to heaven, implying that it aimed only to ease death for the chronically or terminally ill rather than promote recovery".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Hospital in the Byzantine Empire|last=Miller|first=Timothy|publisher=Johns Hopkins|year=1985|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate between scholars as to why these institutions were started by the church. Many scholars believe that the church founded hospitals in order to receive additional donations. Whatever the case for these hospitals, they began to diffuse across the empire. Soon after, [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil of Caesarea]] developed a place for the sick in which provided refuge for the sick and homeless.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horden|first=Peregrine|date=2005|title=The Earliest Hospitals in Byzantium, Western Europe, and Islam|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1404975.files/Final%20Exam%20Readings/Horden-Earliest%20Hospitals-2005.pdf|journal=MIT Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Blainey likened the Catholic Church in its activities during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for monks and clerics to practice medicine and medical students in northern European universities often took minor Holy orders. Mediaeval hospitals had a strongly Christian ethos, and were, in the words of historian of medicine [[Roy Porter]], "religious foundations through and through", and Ecclesiastical regulations were passed to govern medicine, partly to prevent clergymen profiting from medicine.&lt;ref name="Present pp. 110-112"&gt;[[Roy Porter]]; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 110-112&lt;/ref&gt;  During Europe's [[Age of Discovery]], Catholic missionaries, notably the Jesuits, introduced the modern sciences to India, China and Japan. While persecutions continue to limit the spread of Catholic institutions to some Middle Eastern Muslim nations, and such places as the People's Republic of China and North Korea, elsewhere in Asia the church is a major provider of health care services - especially in Catholic Nations like the [[Philippines]].

Today he [[Roman Catholic Church]] is the largest non-government provider of [[health care]] services in the world.&lt;ref name=Geopolitics&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agnew|first=John|title=Deus Vult: The Geopolitics of Catholic Church|journal=Geopolitics|date=12 February 2010|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39–61|doi=10.1080/14650040903420388}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has around 18,000 clinics, 16,000 homes for the elderly and those with special needs, and 5,500 hospitals, with 65 percent of them located in developing countries.&lt;ref name="World Development p.40"&gt;[[Robert Calderisi]]; ''Earthly Mission - The Catholic Church and World Development''; TJ International Ltd; 2013; p.40&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Church's [[Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers]] said that the Church manages 26% of the world's health care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic_hospitals_represent_26_percent_of_worlds_health_facilities_reports_pontifical_council/ |title=Catholic hospitals comprise one quarter of world's healthcare, council reports :: Catholic News Agency (CNA) |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's involvement in health care has ancient origins.

[[Francisco de Vitoria]], a disciple of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and a Catholic thinker who studied the issue regarding the human rights of colonized natives, is recognized by the United Nations as a father of international law, and now also by historians of economics and democracy as a leading light for the West's democracy and rapid economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Philosophical and Historical Analysis of Modern Democracy, Equality, and Freedom Under the Influence of Christianity |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0010.html |last=de Torre |first=Fr. Joseph M. |year=1997 |publisher=Catholic Education Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Schumpeter]], an economist of the twentieth century, referring to the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]], wrote, "it is they who come nearer than does any other group to having been the 'founders' of scientific economics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Economic Analysis |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |year=1954 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists and historians, such as Raymond de Roover, Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson, and Alejandro Chafuen, have also made similar statements. 

The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties, including the power of reason. That means that they are allowed to explore God's creation and, according to Genesis 2:15, make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way. Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the [[humanities]] and the [[sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Lenski]] (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life'', Revised Edition,  A Doubleday Anchor Book, Garden City, N.Y., pp.348–351&lt;/ref&gt; Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers, in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ, are to follow God's commandments. Industry, frugality, calling, discipline, and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-516247-9}}, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Weerda, ''Soziallehre des Calvinismus'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', 3.

Therefore, craftsmen, industrialists, and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology. As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages. In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other. The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Heimann]], ''Kapitalismus'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3.

[[File:Nativity tree2011.jpg|thumb|right|A [[nativity scene|depiction of the Nativity]] with a [[Christmas tree]] backdrop.]]
Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around the [[liturgical year]]. The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of [[parament]]s and [[vestment]]s for clergy,&lt;ref name="calendar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fortescue|first1=Adrian|title=Christian Calendar|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03158a.htm|website=The Catholic Encyclopedia.|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=18 July 2014|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.

Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name="calendar" /&gt; and Eastern Christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective [[Rite#Christian|rites]]. Calendars set aside holy days, such as [[Solemnity|solemnities]] which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or Mary, the [[saint]]s, periods of [[fasting]] such as [[Lent]], and other pious events such as [[memoria]] or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as Christmas, Easter and [[Pentecost]]: these are the celebrations of Christ's birth, resurrection and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively. A few denominations make no use of a liturgical calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman. ''Handbook of the Christian Year''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic theology enumerates seven sacraments:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1210] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609042152/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM |date=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baptism]] ([[infant baptism|Christening]]), [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] (Chrismation), [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]] (Communion), [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]] (Reconciliation), [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]] (before the [[Second Vatican Council]] generally called Extreme Unction), [[Marriage (Catholic Church)|Matrimony]]

In Christian belief and practice, a ''sacrament'' is a [[rite]], instituted by Christ, that mediates [[divine grace|grace]], constituting a [[Sacred Mysteries|sacred mystery]]. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''. Views concerning both what rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament vary among Christian denominations and traditions.&lt;ref name="ODCC1435"&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 1435f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the Orthodox tradition), [[Holy orders]] ([[ordination]]), [[Penance]] (or [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), [[Anointing of the Sick]], and [[Matrimony]] (see [[Christian views on marriage]]).&lt;ref name="ODCC1435" /&gt;

Taken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognized by churches in the [[High Church]] tradition—notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], many [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]], and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.&lt;ref name="ODCC1435" /&gt; [[Christian denominations]], such as [[Baptists]], which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]'' rather than sacraments.

Today, most [[Christian denominations]] are neutral about [[religious male circumcision]], neither requiring it nor forbidding it. The practice is customary among the [[Coptic Christian|Coptic]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox|Ethiopian]], and [[Eritrean Orthodox]] Churches, and also some other African churches.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Customary in some Coptic and other churches:
*"The Coptic Christians in Egypt and the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians— two of the oldest surviving forms of Christianity— retain many of the features of early Christianity, including male circumcision. Circumcision is not prescribed in other forms of Christianity... Some Christian churches in South Africa oppose the practice, viewing it as a pagan ritual, while others, including the Nomiya church in Kenya, require circumcision for membership and participants in focus group discussions in Zambia and Malawi mentioned similar beliefs that Christians should practice circumcision since Jesus was circumcised and the Bible teaches the practice."
*"The decision that Christians need not practice circumcision is recorded in {{Bibleverse|Acts|15}}; there was never, however, a prohibition of circumcision, and it is practiced by Coptic Christians." [https://web.archive.org/web/20080720054046/http://bartleby.com/65/ci/circumci.html "circumcision"], The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

The same sequence of events happens three times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the [[New Testament]] does give a few guidelines about the consumption of meat, practiced by the [[Christian Church]] today; one of these is not consuming food knowingly offered to pagan [[Idolatry|idols]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2002 |title=The Weaker Brother |journal=Third Way Magazine |volume=25 |issue=10 |page=25 |quote=Christ came for the Gentiles as well as the Jews (the real meaning of that vision in Acts 10:9;16) but he also calls us to look out for each other and not do things that will cause our brothers and sisters to stumble. In Corinthians Paul urges the believers to consider not eating meat when with people who assume that meat must be offered to idols before consumption: 'Food will not bring us close to God,' he writes. 'We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block for the weak.'

Christian cooking combines the food of many cultures in which Christian have lived. A special [[Christmas dinner|Christmas family meal]] is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions, such as [[Sicily]], have special meals for Christmas Eve, when 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as [[Christmas pudding]], [[mince pie]]s, [[fruit cake]] and [[Yule log]].&lt;ref&gt;Broomfield, Andrea (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ_JDp9OgJEC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=christmas+pudding+england&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xzAVTc3WNoqWhQePsJW3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas%20pudding%20england&amp;f=false Food and cooking in Victorian England: a history] pp.149–150.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1729">The '''Curia Calabra''' was a religious station or ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#templum|templum]]'' used for the ritual observation of the [[new moon]] in [[ancient Rome]]. Although its exact location is unclear, it was most likely a roofless enclosure in front of an augural hut ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auguraculum|auguraculum]])'', on the southwest flank of the ''[[Area Capitolina]]'', the precinct of [[Temple of Capitoline Jupiter]]. [[Servius]] identifies the Curia Calabra with a ''[[Casa Romuli]]'' ("Hut of [[Romulus]]") on the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 8.654.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Macrobius]] implies that it was adjacent to the ''Casa''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.15.10, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman calendar]] was originally [[lunar calendar|lunar]]. On the [[Kalends]] or first day of each month, the [[pontifex minor]] occupied the Curia Calabra to await the sighting of the new moon. The [[Rex Sacrificulus]] and the pontifex then carried out a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#res divinae|res divina]]'' (religious service) and sacrifice in honor of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and the Roman people were called to assembly ''(in [[comitia calata]])''. Like ''calata'', the name ''Calabra'' probably derives from ''calare'', "to summon" or "proclaim".&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 6.27; Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.15.10–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1959">The '''day of Judaism''' is an annual day of Christian-Jewish reflection held on January 17 by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Italy]] since 1990. 
 
In 1997, the idea was brought by the interreligious group, Teshuva, from Milan into the 2nd European Ecumenical Assembly (1997) and spread in the Churches of Europe. Since 2001, the [[Italian Episcopal Conference]] was joined by the Italian Jewish community in its promotion. In 2005, both sides assumed a ten-year programme of reflection on the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?item=3088 Day of Judaism in the Churches of Europe, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the assembly of Italian rabbis announced a boycott of the day of Judaism because of a dispute surrounding the modern usage of the [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews]] in Catholic liturgies. The event was nevertheless held by the Catholic bishops of Italy, who ignored the rabbinical boycott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/213449?eng=y Jews and the Catholic Church. The rabbis of Italy don't like this Pope]&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement to resume participation eventually occurred at a meeting organized by Cardinal [[Angelo Bagnasco]] and chief Rabbi [[Riccardo Di Segni]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/09/23/1008067/italian-jewish-leaders-drop-church-boycott Italian Jewish leaders drop Church boycott]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2009, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] indicated that he would celebrate the following day of Judaism in 2010 by paying a visit to the [[Great Synagogue of Rome]], which has been similarly visited by Pope John Paul II during his pontificate. &lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/10/13/1008466/pope-to-visit-rome-synagogue-on-day-of-dialogue Pope to visit Rome synagogue on day of dialogue]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act of 1971''' is a piece of [[India]]n legislation modeled after the [[Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925]], which determines the management of Sikh houses of worship within [[Delhi Union Territory]]. The 1971 act, more stringent than the 1925 act, required that any Sikhs voting for the [[Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee]] be baptized Sikhs (''[[amritdhari]]'').&lt;ref name="ColeSambhi1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.

'''Elder''' is a [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] office in the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] of denominations within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).

== Office of the Melchizedek Priesthood ==
In the LDS Church, "elder" is considered the introductory—or lowest—of five offices of the Melchizedek priesthood. Every person who receives the Melchizedek priesthood is simultaneously ordained to the office of elder; this may be done to male members who are at least 18 years old. In order to be ordained, the member must be determined to be worthy by his local [[Bishop (Mormonism)|bishop]] and [[stake president]].&lt;ref name = section16&gt;"Ordinance and Blessing Policies", ''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The consent of the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] holders of the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] is also required before the ordination is performed, and this is usually done at a semiannual stake conference or an annual general stake priesthood meeting.&lt;ref name = section16/&gt; [[Ordination]] is accomplished by the [[laying on of hands]] and with the stake president's approval, may be performed by any holder of the Melchizedek priesthood.

=== Responsibilities of an elder ===
According to the LDS Church's [[Doctrine and Covenants]], the duty of an elder is to "teach, expound, exhort, baptize, and watch over the church."&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]], {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=section 20|verse=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elders have the authority to administer to and bless the sick and afflicted, to "confirm those who are baptized into the church, by the laying on of hands for the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost",&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine and Covenants, {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=section 20|verse=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; to baptize and give others the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic]] or Melchizedek priesthoods as directed by priesthood leaders, and to take the lead in all meetings as guided by the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine and Covenants, {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=section 46|verse=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An elder may ordain others to the priesthood offices of [[Deacon (Latter Day Saints)|deacon]], [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|teacher]], [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]], or elder.

In practice, elders may be responsible for many of the day-to-day operations of a [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]]. They are [[calling (LDS Church)|called]] to serve in a variety of positions throughout the ward, such as [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] [[Quorum (Mormonism)|quorum]] advisors, [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]] leaders, [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|scout]] leaders, ward mission leader, and [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] leadership. Elders and [[High Priest (Mormonism)|high priests]] (assisted by [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|teachers]] and [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests]]) are also responsible for [[ministering brethren|ministering]] opportunities to serve the needs of assigned respective households in the ward.

=== Organizational Structure ===
Elders are organized into [[Quorum (Mormonism)#Melchizedek Priesthood Quorums|quorums]] that may contain no more than 96 elders. A quorum president, along with two counselors, is called and [[Setting apart|set apart]] under the direction of the stake presidency, and generally serves for a number of years. A secretary is also called to assist the president and his counselors.

All adult men in the ward who are not presently serving in callings that require the ordination of high priest are assigned to the elders quorum.

== The Title of Elder ==
The title "Elder" is not normally used as a personal title (e.g., Elder Evans, Elder Johnson), except by the LDS Church's [[General authority|general authorities]], [[Seventy (LDS Church)|area seventies]], and full-time male [[Mormon missionary|missionaries]]. Often, full-time missionaries serving within a ward are referred to by the members as "the elders."

'''Friedrich Adler''' (29 April 1878 – ca. 11 July 1942) was a [[Germany|German]] [[academia|academic]], [[artist]] and [[designer]]. He was especially renowned for his accomplishments in designing metalwork in the [[Art nouveau]] and [[Art deco]] styles; he was also the first designer to use [[bakelite]].

Adler was born in [[Laupheim]]; his birthplace is now the ''Café Hermes'', an Art nouveau building in the style of the late [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | title = The Jewish Past of Laupheim: The Adler Family  | work =   | publisher =   | url = http://www.culturespace.de/laupheim/english/adler.htm  | doi =   | accessdate = 2010-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1894 to 1897, he studied under [[Hermann Obrist]] and [[Wilhelm von Debschitz]], in whose [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] he also taught from 1904 to 1907, at the School for [[Applied Art]] in [[Munich]]. From 1907 to 1933, he taught at the [[Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg|School for Applied Art in Hamburg]]. In between, he also directed the mastery lessons in [[Nuremberg]], and was busy designing pieces in applied art for over fifty clients.

On 11 July 1942 Adler, who was [[Jew]]ish, was deported to the [[extermination camp]] [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where, judged too old to work, he was killed soon afterwards. There is a [[stolperstein]] in his memory at his last place of employment in Hamburg.

{{Christian mysticism}}

The '''Friends of God''' (German: '''Gottesfreunde'''; or '''gotesvriunde''') was a medieval [[mystical]] group of both ecclesiastical and lay persons&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; within the [[Catholic Church]] (though it nearly became a separate sect) and a center of [[German mysticism]]. It was founded between 1339 and 1343 during the [[Avignon Papacy]] of the [[Western Schism]], a time of great turmoil for the Catholic Church. The Friends of God were originally centered in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], and were also fairly important in [[Strasbourg]] and [[Cologne]]. Some late-nineteenth century writers made large claims for the movement, seeing it both as influential in fourteenth-century mysticism, and as a precursor of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Modern studies of the movement, however, have emphasised the derivative and often second-rate character of its mystical literature, and its limited impact on medieval literature in Germany.&lt;ref name="Bernard McGinn 2005 p408"&gt;McGinn, Bernard. ''The Harvest of Mysticism'', (2005), p408.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name "Friends of God" may have been influenced by various sources. A number of biblical passages use the term (e.g. Judges 8.22, James 2.23, Exodus 33.11, Psalm 138.17, Wisdom 7.27, Lk 12.4, John 15.15). The concept of friendship with God had also been applied by various medieval authors, and particularly among [[Meister Eckhart]] and his followers.&lt;ref name="Bernard McGinn 2005 p408"/&gt;

==History==
The movement grew out of the preaching and teaching of [[Meister Eckhart]], and especially his [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] spiritual heirs the preacher [[John Tauler]] and the writer [[Henry Suso]]. An influence on the Friends of God, although remaining in the background, was the secular priest [[Henry of Nördlingen]],&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of German Biography Volume 8'', Walther Killy et al., eds; K G Saur Verlag Gmbh &amp; Co; Reprint 2011 ed. Edition p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Bavarian Oberland]], who met Tauler and Suso in Basel in 1339. [[:de:Heinrich von Nördlingen|Henry]] had a great deal of interaction with other Bavarian and [[German mystic]]s&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07237a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the Friends of God to ''The Flowing Light of the Deity'' by [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]].

The group achieved a nascent institutional form in 1367 when wealthy layman [[Rulman Merswin]] purchased and restored a derelict monastery in Strasbourg known as the ''grünenwörth'' ('Green Isle').{{sfn|McGinn, p. 417}} Grünenwörth served as a refuge for study for the Friends of God and as a “school of prophets” which produced a number of mystical texts.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;[[Rufus M. Jones|Jones, Rufus M.]], ''Studies in Mystical Religion'', Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock, no date pp. 247-252 (originally published London: Macmillan, 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; Merswin is suspected of being the anonymous author [[The Friend of God from the Oberland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YtM16IJxv2IC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=german+mysticism+friends+of+god&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wMRFd-6KKH&amp;sig=zZJYz_LxGJJzYYfN9oL6kW7zc1k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju3MKthvfXAhUxkeAKHegkClQQ6AEIXDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=german%20mysticism%20friends%20of%20god&amp;f=false Weeks, Andrew. ''German Mysticism From Hildegard of Bingen to Ludwig Wittgenstein'', SUNY Press, 1993, p. 94], {{ISBN|9780791414194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Friends of God, as led by Tauler and Suso, sought a mystical path in line with established Catholic doctrine, following Thomas Aquinas. Rulman Merswin, under the guidance of The Friend of God from the Oberland, wanted to purify the Church. This stress on reform brought The Friends of God into conflict with the Church and not long after Merswin’s death in 1382, they were condemned.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06306a.htm Walsh, Reginald. "Friends of God." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

After Merswin's death, some sources claim that [[Nicholas of Basel]] became the leader. He was eventually [[burned at the stake]] with two of his followers for [[heresy]] at [[Vienna]] around 1395.&lt;ref&gt;[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/religion-past-and-present/nicholas-of-basel-SIM_024125?s.num=24&amp;s.rows=50 "Nicholas of Basel", BrillOnLine]&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship of Nicholas of Basel to the Friends of God is unclear as he was condemned as a [[Beghard]].&lt;ref name=Leff&gt;Leff, Gordon. ''Heresy in the Later Middle Ages: The Relation of Heterodoxy to Dissent, c. 1250 – c. 1450'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1967 (reprinted by Sandpiper Book, 1999), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent member, Martin of Mainz, a follower of Nicholas of Basel, was also burned for heresy in 1393.&lt;ref name=Leff/&gt;

==Texts==
A number of mystical texts are associated with The Friends of God, most notably the [[Theologia Germanica]] and the [[Book of the Nine Rocks]]. Many of the works were attributed to The [[Friend of God from the Oberland]], although probably written by Rulman Merswin himself.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;

'''Gamigin''' is the fourth [[Goetia|Goetic]] [[demon]] described in [[the Lesser Key of Solomon]] (referred to in the Crowley/Mathers edition as '''Samigina'''), and (as '''Gamygyn''') forty-sixth in the [[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]], in both works as a marquis who initially takes the form of a small horse before transforming into a hoarse-voiced human. The Lesser Key of Solomon merely leaves his duties at teaching liberal arts and giving accounts of souls that died in sin.&lt;ref&gt;Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis: The Lesser Key of Solomon, Detailing the Ceremonial Art of Commanding Spirits Both Good and Evil; ed. Joseph H. Peterson; Weiser Books, Maine; 2001. p.7-10&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, [[Thomas Rudd]]'s variant of the Ars Goetia, and the [[Dictionnaire Infernal]] go into more detail, with Gamigin forcing the souls of those who drowned into "airy bodies" to answer questions in either, with Weyer and de Plancy further claiming that Gamigan can do likewise for souls "which dwell in [[Purgatory|purgatorie]] (which is called Cartagra, that is, affliction of soules)".&lt;ref&gt;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (Liber officiorum spirituum); Johann Weyer, ed.

'''Garshāsp''' ({{lang-fa|(گرشاسپ)}} {{IPA-fa|gæɹ'ʃɒːsp|pron}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt;)  is the name of a monster-slaying hero in [[Persian mythology|Iranian mythology]]. The [[Avestan]] form of his name is '''Kərəsāspa''' and in [[Middle Persian]] his name is '''Kirsāsp'''.

==Kərəsāspa / Kirsāsp in Zoroastrian literature==
In the '''[[Zoroastrian]]''' religious text of the [[Avesta]], Kərəsāspa appears as the slayer of ferocious monsters, including the '''Gandarəβa''' and the '''Aži Sruvara'''.  In later Zoroastrian texts Kirsāsp is revived at the end of the world to defeat the monster '''[[Zahhak|Dahāg]]'''.

Kərəsāspa is the son of Θrita and belongs to the Sāma family. Θrita is originally the name of a deity; cf. the Vedic [[Trita]].

===Kərəsāspa and the Aži Sruvara===
According to the [[Zoroastrian]] holy book, [[Avesta]], Kərəsāspa once stopped on a hill to cook his midday meal.  Unbeknownst to Kərəsāspa, the hill was actually the curved back of a sleeping dragon—the Aži Sruvara. As Kərəsāspa's fire began to crackle merrily, the heat from it caused the dragon to stir from its sleep and overturn the hero's kettle.  The startled Kərəsāspa fled, but, on regaining his composure, returned  to slay the dragon that had spoilt his lunch.

Later texts, the ''Persian [[Revayats|Rivayat]]'' and ''Pahlavi Rivayat'', add more details. According to them, the Az ī Srūwar was a dragon with horns, with huge eyes and ears, and teeth upon which the men it had eaten could be seen impaled. It was so long that Kərəsāspa ran along its back for half a day before he reached its head, struck it with his mace, and killed it.

===Kərəsāspa and the Gandarəβa===
Another monster that Kirsāsp fought was the ''Gandarəβa'', Middle Persian ''Gandarw''. (This name is cognate to the Indic [[gandharva]], but the exact way in which the word acquired its respective meanings in Indic and Iranian cultures is uncertain.) The Gandarw lived in the sea.  It was also enormous, big enough to swallow twelve provinces in a single gulp, and so tall that when it stood up the deep sea reached only to its knee and its head was as high as the sun.  The Gandarw pulled Kirsāsp into the ocean, and they fought for nine days. At last, Kirsāsp flayed the Gandarw and bound it with its own skin. Kirsāsp, weary from the combat, had his companion Axrūrag guard the Gandarw while he slept, but it proved too much for him&amp;nbsp;– the Gandarw dragged Axrūrag and Kirsāsp's family into the sea.  When Kirsāsp awakened, he rushed to the sea, freed the captives, and killed the Gandarw.

===Kirsāsp and Dahāg===
The Zoroastrian text called the ''Sūdgar'' tells that when the monster [[Zahhak|Dahāg]], who is now bound in chains on Mount Damāvand, bursts free of his fetters at the end of the world, Kirsāsp will wake from death (his corpse having been guarded from corruption) to destroy Dahāg and save the two thirds of the world that Dahāg has not devoured.

==In Persian literature==
===In the Shāhnāma===

Garshasp or Garshasb was a king who ruled over parts of [[Greater Persia]]. Certain of his deeds are recounted in the epic poem [[Shahnameh|Shāhnāma]], which preserves, in late form, many of the legends and stories of Greater Persia. Garshasb had been ruling for more than 50 years when the royal family fell victim to black magic and were killed one after the other. Legend has it that there were a few members of the Garshasp clan who survived, but also that they remain enchanted to this day.
Garshāsp is only tangentially mentioned in the Shāhnāma. There he appears as a distant ancestor of the hero [[Rostam]], who lived at about the same time as King [[Fereydun]]. Garshāsp is the father of [[Nariman (father of Sām)|Narēmān]], who is the father of [[Saam|Sām]], father of [[Zal|Zāl]], who is in turn Rostam's father.

===In the Garshāspnāma===
Garshāsp  received his own poetic treatment at the hands of [[Asadi Tusi]], who wrote a ''Garshāspnāma'' about this hero.

In the [[Garshāspnāma]], Garshāsp is the son of Esret (اثرط), the equivalent of the Avestan Θrita, and grandson of Sham (Avestan Sāma). His genealogy goes back through other characters not mentioned in the Avesta: Sham is the son of Tovorg (طورگ), son of Šēdasp, son of Tur, who was an illegitimate son of [[Jamshid]] by the daughter of Kurang, king of Zābolestān, begotten at the time that Jamshid had been deposed was fleeing from the forces of [[Zahhak|Zahhāk]].

Zahhāk reigned for 1000 years, and so was still king at the time that Garshāsp was born. On one occasion when Zahhāk was traveling in Zābolestān, he saw Garshāsp and encourages him to slay a dragon that had emerged from the sea and settled on Mt. Šekāvand. Equipped with a special antidote against dragon-poison, and armed with special weapons, Garshāsp succeeds in killing the monster.  Impressed by the child's prowess, Zahhāk now orders Garshāsp to India, where the king&amp;nbsp;– a vassal of Zahhāk's&amp;nbsp;– has been replaced by a rebel prince, Bahu, who does not acknowledge Zahhāk's rule. Garshāsp defeats the rebel and then stays in India for a while to observe its marvels and engage in philosophical discourse. 

After returning from India, Garshāsp woos a princess of [[Rüm|Rum]], restores his father Esret to his throne in Zābol after the king of Kābol defeats him, and builds the city of [[Sistan|Sistān]]. He has further anachronistic adventures in the Mediterranean, fighting in [[Kairouan]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].

When he returns to Iran, his father dies, and Garshāsp becomes king of Zābolestān. Although he has no son of his own, he adopts [[Nariman (father of Sām)|Narēmān]] as his heir, who would become [[Rostam]]'s great-grandfather. The poem ends with another battle and dragon-slaying, followed by Garshāsp's death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">'''Geminus''' of [[Rhodes]] ({{lang-el|Γεμῖνος ὁ Ῥόδιος}}), was a Greek [[astronomer]] and [[mathematician]], who flourished in the 1st century BC. An [[astronomy]] work of his, the ''Introduction to the Phenomena'', still survives; it was intended as an introductory astronomy book for students. He also wrote a work on [[mathematics]], of which only fragments quoted by later authors survive.

==Life==
Nothing is known about the life of Geminus. It is not even certain that he was born in Rhodes, but references to mountains on Rhodes in his astronomical works suggests that he worked there. His dates are not known with any certainty either. A passage in his works referring to the ''Annus Vagus'' (Wandering Year) of the [[Egyptian calendar]] of 120 years before his own time, has been used to imply a date of c. 70 BC for the time of writing,&lt;ref&gt;Dicks, D., ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography.'' New York. (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; which would be consistent with the idea that he may have been a pupil of [[Posidonius]], but a date as late as 50 AD has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, O., ''A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy.'' New York. (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater [[Geminus (crater)|Geminus]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

==Astronomy==
The only work of Geminus to survive is his ''Introduction to the Phenomena'' ({{lang-el|Εἰσαγωγὴ εἰς τὰ Φαινόμενα}}), often just called the ''Isagoge''.  This introductory astronomy book, based on the works of earlier astronomers such as [[Hipparchus]], was intended to teach astronomy for beginning students in the subject. In it, Geminus describes the [[zodiac]] and the motion of the [[Sun]]; the [[constellation]]s; the [[celestial sphere]]; days and nights; the risings and settings of the zodiacal signs; luni-solar periods and their application to [[calendars]]; [[phases of the Moon]]; [[eclipses]]; star phases; terrestrial zones and geographical places; and the foolishness of making weather predictions by the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'', page 91. Oxford University Press. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote a commentary on Posidonius' work ''On Meteorology''. Fragments of this commentary are preserved by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in his commentary on [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ''Physics''.

==Mathematics==
Geminus also wrote extensively on [[mathematics]], including a comprehensive ''Doctrine, (or Theory) of Mathematics.''&lt;ref name="heath1"&gt;Heath, T., A Manual of Greek Mathematics, Dover Publications. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Although this work has not survived, many extracts are preserved by [[Proclus]], [[Eutocius]], and others. He divided mathematics into two parts: ''Mental'' ({{lang-el|νοητά}}) and ''Observable'' ({{lang-el|αἰσθητά}}), or in other words, [[Pure mathematics|Pure]] and [[Applied mathematics|Applied]]. In the first category he placed [[geometry]] and [[arithmetic]] (including [[number theory]]), and in the second category he placed [[mechanics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], [[geodesy]], canonics ([[harmony|musical harmony]]), and [[logistics]]. Long extracts of his work are also preserved by [[Al-Nayrizi]] in his commentary on ''[[Euclid's Elements]].''

'''Gentle Wind Project''' (GWP) was a [[new age]] group based in [[New England]].  Founded circa 1980 by John "Tubby" Miller and Claudia Panuthos (now Mary "Moe" Miller) in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]], GWP members moved to [[Kittery, Maine]] in 1984. The organization was [[dissolution (law)|dissolved]], as part of a [[consent decree]] following a [[fraud]] [[lawsuit]] brought against the group.

==Activities==
GWP described itself as "a not-for profit world healing organization... [with] a healing technology... along with [[Telepathy|telepathic]] abilities... designed to restore and regenerate a person's energetic structure when used one time in a person's life." John Miller claimed to receive telepathic impressions from the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]].  Miller claimed that he used these impressions to create "healing instruments".  These instruments were made available to the public in exchange for set donation prices, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars.

==Legal issues==
=== Litigation initiated by GWP ===
International anti-cult educator Ian Mander&lt;ref name=nz&gt;[http://www.cults.co.nz/gwp/ Gentle Wind Project Closeup] at the New Zealand Cult List&lt;/ref&gt; published a collection of information about GWP on the internet, as did two former followers, Judy Garvey and Jim Bergin, who wrote about their personal experiences with GWP during seventeen years as followers and board members.&lt;ref name=woc&gt;[http://www.windofchanges.org Wind of Changes], published by Judy Garvey and Jim Bergin, former followers of GWP&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, in May 2004, GWP leaders filed a lawsuit in Maine [[U.S. District Court]], consisting of federal [[racketeering]] ([[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]]) and [[Lanham Act|Lanham]] claims, plus state claims, including [[defamation]].

In January 2006, Garvey and Bergin won their Motion for Summary Judgment in January 2006, resulting in dismissal of GWP's federal claims on the merits, and dismissal of the remaining state claims without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction, by Senior District Judge Gene Carter.

In January 2006, after the dismissal of the federal litigation, GWP leaders refiled their lawsuit in Maine State Court ([[York County, Maine|York County]], [[Alfred, Maine]]).  They brought the remaining state claims against Garvey, Bergin, and Mander.

=== Charges filed by Maine Attorney General against GWP ===
The [[Attorney General of Maine]] filed charges against GWP and its officers and directors, citing [[false claims]] and [[fraud]]. The complaint charged that the defendants falsely claimed that the instruments can improve mental, emotional, and physical well-being. The officers and directors were further charged for improperly disbursing hundreds of thousands of dollars to themselves.

The Attorney General asked the court to end sales of the "healing instruments", dissolve the corporation, ban the parties from serving as officers and directors of [[nonprofit corporation]]s, order the return of all funds, and provide for [[restitution]].&lt;ref name=ncahf&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/digest06/06-32.html National Council Against Health Fraud], Consumer Health Digest #06-32, August 08, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==GWP dissolved==
On August 14, 2006, the case was resolved by a [[consent decree]] in which the defendants "agreed to pay [[civil penalties]] and costs and to an [[injunction]] that prohibits them from making certain health and research claims about the "healing instruments" or from serving as [[fiduciary|fiduciaries]] or advisors for any other Maine nonprofit.  The parties have also agreed that GWP will be dissolved, and its remaining [[asset]]s distributed by the Attorney General as restitution to consumers who purchased a "healing instrument" since 2003 and to a Maine [[Charitable organization|charity]] whose charitable [[Mission statement|mission]] is to provide services to those with [[mental health]] disabilities, according to a [[press release]] from the Attorney General's office.  Garvey and Bergin described the proceedings on their website.&lt;ref name=gwp2&gt;[http://www.windofchanges.org/Statement.html Settlement], by Wind of Changes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family Systems Research Group==
The Millers have formed the Family Systems Research Group to continue much of what the Gentle Wind Project had been doing. The new organization is apparently in New Hampshire and sells its products, rather than seeking "donations".&lt;ref&gt;Randi, James. 5 October 2007.

It is an essential component of the Dzogchen tradition for both the [[Bonpo]] and the [[Nyingmapa]].{{sfn|Rossi|1999|p=52}}{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje|1991|p=354}} Knowledge of this ''Ground'' is called ''[[rigpa]]''.{{refn|group=note|Wylie: rig pa; [[IAST]]: vidyā){{Dudjom Rinpoche|Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje|1991|p=336}}}}

==Etymology==
The {{bo|t=གཞི|w=gzhi}} has been rendered as 'Base', 'Basis', 'Ground' and 'Ground of Being' amongst other English glosses. According to [[Dudjom Rinpoche|Dudjom]] the original Sanskrit-term is ''āśraya'' ([[IAST]]; Sanskrit Devanagari: आश्रय; [[w:Etymology|Etymology]]: आ- √श्रि),{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje|1991|p=354 Index of Technical Terms}}{{refn|group=note|name="āśraya"|According to ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2003, 2004&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://glossary.buddhistdoor.com/en/word/15491/asraya Charles Muller, Tokyo Gakuen University (1997), "āśraya"] accessed 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; "āśraya" is a synonym for ''[[ālaya-vijñāna]]'', the "store-house-consciousness. }} but it could also be ''sthāna''.

[[Sam van Schaik]] states that ''gzhi'' is to be distinguished from ''kun gzhi''. In the [[Menngagde|Seminal Heart]] series a distinction is made between ''kun gzhi'', c.q. ''ālaya'', "the base of it all", the samsaric basis of consciousness, of all the samsaric appearances; and ''gzhi'', "the nirvanic basis known as the ground."{{sfn|Schaik|2004}}{{refn|group=note|Sam van Schaik: "....the Seminal Heart distinction between two types of basis, the nirvanic basis known as the ground (gzhi) and the samsaric basis of consciousness, the ālaya (kun gzhi).{{sfn|Schaik|2004}}}}

==Three qualities==
[[File:Sam Taeguk.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Gankyil]]]]
According to the Dzogchen-teachings, the ''Ground'' or [[Buddha-nature]] has three qualities:{{sfn|Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Petit|1999|p=78-79}}
* ''ngo bo'', "essence", openness or emptiness ({{bo|w=ngo bo stong pa}}), 
* ''rang bzhin'', "nature", luminosity, lucidity or clarity (as in the [[luminous mind]] of the [[Five Pure Lights]]) ({{bo|w=rang bzhin gsal ba}}),
* ''thugs rje'', "power", universal [[Karuṇā|compassionate energy]] ({{bo|w=thugs rje kun khyab}}), unobstructed ({{bo|w=ma 'gags pa}}).

(In Goodman &amp; Davidson 1992,) Herbert V. Guenther points out that this ''Ground'' is both a static potential and a dynamic unfolding. They give a [[Process philosophy|process-orientated]] translation, to avoid any essentialist associations, since
{{quote|''ngo-bo'' (facticity) has nothing to do with nor can even be reduced to the (essentialist) categories of substance and quality; [...] ''rang-bzhin'' (actuality) remains open-dimensional, rather than being or turning into a rigid essence despite its being what it is; and that ''thugs-rje'' (resonance) is an atemporal sensitivity and response, rather than a distinct and narrowly circumscribed operation.{{sfn|Goodman|Davidson|1992|p=14}}}}

The 19th/20th-century Tibetan Buddhist scholar, Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, sees the Buddha-nature as ultimate truth,&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; nirvana, which is constituted of profundity, primordial peace and radiance:
{{quote|Buddha-nature is immaculate. It is profound, serene, unfabricated suchness, an uncompounded expanse of luminosity; nonarising, unceasing, primordial peace, spontaneously present nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The Prayer of Kuntuzangpo==
Beings are trapped in samsara by not recognizing the ground. The ''Prayer of Kuntuzangpo'' from the Gonpa Zangthal states:
{{quote|From the beginning you beings are deluded&lt;br /&gt;
Because you do not recognize&lt;br /&gt;
The awareness of the ground{{sfn|Ranjung Yeshe|2006|p=Chapter 9}}}}

'''Hildesheim''' {{IPA-de|ˈhɪldəsˌhaɪ̯m||De-Hildesheim.ogg}} ([[Eastphalian dialect|Eastphalian]]: ''Hilmessen'') is a city in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]] with 103,804 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hildesheim.de/pics/verwaltung/1_1485164460/BEV_Bestand_31_12_2016.pdf Bevölkerung der Stadt Hildesheim zum 31.12.2016]&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the district of [[Hildesheim (district)|Hildesheim]], about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Hanover]] on the banks of the [[Innerste]] River, a small tributary of the [[Leine]] River. With the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] and the [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|St. Michael's Church]] Hildesheim has become a UNESCO [[World Heritage site]] in 1985.

==History==
[[File:Hildesheim night.jpg|left|thumb|The historic market square at night]]
Hildesheim, one of the oldest cities in [[Northern Germany]], became the seat of the [[Bishopric of Hildesheim]] in 815 and may have been founded when the bishop moved from [[Elze]] to the [[Innerste]] [[ford (crossing)|ford]], which was an important market on the [[Hellweg]] trade route. The settlement around the cathedral very quickly developed into a town and was awarded [[Market town|market rights]] by [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto III]] in 983.&lt;ref&gt;Neigenfind, W.: ''Unsere schöne Stadt'', p.46. Hildesheim 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the market was held in a street called Old Market (''Alter Markt'') which still exists today. The first market place was laid out around the church [[St. Andreas, Hildesheim|St. Andreas]]. When the city grew further, a bigger market place became necessary. The present market place of Hildesheim was laid out at the beginning of the 13th century when the city had about 5,000 inhabitants. When Hildesheim obtained [[town privileges|city status]] in 1249, it was one of the biggest cities in Northern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Neigenfind, W.: ''Unsere schöne Stadt'', p.38. Hildesheim 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a city hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present City Hall started in 1268.&lt;ref&gt;Borck, Heinz-Günther: ''Der Marktplatz zu Hildesheim'', p.24. Hildesheim 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519–23 when they engaged in a feud. Hildesheim became [[Lutheran]] in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in imperial (Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Catholic as well. In 1813, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the town became part of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], which was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as a [[Province of Hanover|province]] after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866. In 1868 a highly valuable trove of about 70 Roman silver vessels for eating and drinking, the so-called [[Hildesheim Treasure]], was unearthed by Prussian soldiers.

The city was heavily damaged by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|air raids]] in 1945, especially on 22 March. Although it had little military significance, two months before the end of the war in Europe the historic city was [[Bombing of Hildesheim in World War II|bombed]] as part of the [[Area Bombing Directive]] in order to undermine the morale of the German people. 28.5% of the houses were completely destroyed and 44.7% damaged. 26.8% of the houses remained undamaged. The centre, which had retained its medieval character until then, was almost levelled. As in many cities, priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing, and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings. Most of the major churches, two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war. During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in the basement of the city wall. In 1978, the [[University of Hildesheim]] was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic centre began. Some of the unattractive concrete buildings around the market place were torn down and replaced by replicas of the original buildings. In the autumn of 2007, a decision was made to reconstruct the ''Umgestülpter Zuckerhut'' ("[[Upended Sugarloaf, Hildesheim|Upended Sugarloaf]]"), an iconic half-timbered house famous for its unusual shape. In 2015 the city celebrates it's 1200 anniversary with the [[Day of Lower Saxony]].

==Religions==
In 1542 most of the inhabitants became Lutherans. Today, 28.5% of the inhabitants self-identify as Roman Catholics ([[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hildesheim|Hildesheim Diocese]]) and 38.3% as Protestants ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover]]). 33.0% of the inhabitants are adherents of other religions or do not have a religion at all. The Serbian Orthodox bishop of [[Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Frankfurt and all of Germany|Frankfurt and all of Germany]] has his seat in Himmelsthür (a locality of Hildesheim).

From there, the bay window was removed when the house was remodelled and added to the school at the present site in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Segers-Glocke, Christiane: ''Baudenkmale in Niedersachsen, Band 14.1. - Hildesheim'', p.109.

Hameln 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The store house, one of the oldest profane buildings in Hildesheim, was built of [[sandstone]] in a Gothic style the 15th century. According to other sources it might be even older, i.e. built between the end of the 11th and the middle of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Stadtgeschichte auf dem Hinterhof''. - Hildesheimer Allgemeine Zeitung, 23 June 2009, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The building has two floors. As it did not consist of wood it did not burn down in 1945, but was only damaged and immediately repaired after the war. From 1945 - 1951 it was used for residential purposes. The ''Alte Kemenate'' is not open to the public.

Christians believe that Jesus was both human and divine—the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]]. While there has been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] Christians believe that Jesus is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]], [[God the Son]], and "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]"—both fully divine and fully human.

{{Jesus| in Christianity}}
Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize key elements of the shared beliefs among major denominations based on their [[catechism|catechetical]] or [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] texts.&lt;ref name=CathLuther1 &gt;Jackson, Gregory Lee, ''Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison'' 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-615-16635-3}} Part One: "Areas of Agreement", pages 11-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Orthodox Church: An Introduction to Its History, Doctrine'' by John Anthony McGuckin 2010 pages 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Christian doctrine'' by [[John H. Leith]] 1993 {{ISBN|0-664-25192-7}} pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Christian views of Jesus are derived from various biblical sources, particularly from the [[canonical Gospels]] and [[New Testament]] letters such as the [[Pauline epistles]]. Christians predominantly hold that these works are historically true.&lt;ref&gt;Second Vatican Council, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html ''Dei Verbum'' (V.19)]; Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm ''Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906114843/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm |date=2006-09-06 }}; c.f. Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116]; R.C. Sproul, ''Knowing Scripture'' pp. 45–61; Greg Bahnsen, [http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pt173.htm ''A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics'' (art. 6)]; Scott Foutz, [https://web.archive.org/web/20000414063800/http://www.quodlibet.net/luther.shtml '' Martin Luther and Scripture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Those groups or denominations committed to what are considered biblically [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] Christianity nearly all agree on the following points:&lt;ref&gt;"Who is Jesus? What Do Christians Believe?" Johns Hopkins University. Graduate Christian Fellowship. [http://jhu.edu/gcf/beliefs.html#J] 1 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Christians believe that the mother of Jesus was a virgin.
* Christians believe that Jesus was a human being who was also fully God.
* Christians believe that Jesus came into the world as the son of only one earthly parent, Mary.
* Christians believe that Jesus never sinned or did anything wrong.
* Christians believe that Jesus was eventually martyred, was buried in a tomb, and then on the third day came back to life.
* Christians believe that because he rose from the tomb on the third day, that he lives and has a glorious spiritual body today which can be felt with a touch.
* Christians believe that Jesus eventually ascended back to God the Father.
* Christians believe that Jesus will come back to earth a second time.&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Bibleref2|John|14:1-3}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:10-11}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|21:27}}, {{Bibleref2|Revelation|1:7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some groups considered within Christianity hold beliefs considered to unorthodox. For example, believers in [[monophysitism]] reject the idea that Christ was fully human and God at the same time. Others, such as the [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]], consider Christ to be in possession of a fully physical body after his resurrection.

The five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus are his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], crucifixion, resurrection and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]].&lt;ref name=digby &gt;''Essays in New Testament interpretation'' by Charles Francis Digby Moule 1982 {{ISBN|0-521-23783-1}} page 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key'' by Vigen Guroian 2010 {{ISBN|0-8028-6496-1}} page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 /&gt; These are usually bracketed by two other episodes: his [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] at the beginning and the sending of the [[Paraclete]] (Holy Spirit) at the end.&lt;ref name=digby /&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 &gt;''Scripture in tradition'' by John Breck 2001 {{ISBN|0-88141-226-0}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel accounts of the teachings of Jesus are often presented in terms of specific categories involving his "works and words", e.g., his [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]], [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] and [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]].&lt;ref name=Zuck100 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary'' by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 {{ISBN|0-88207-812-7}} page 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WPent212 &gt;''The words and works of Jesus Christ'' by J. Dwight Pentecost 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-310-30940-6}} page 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians not only attach theological significance to the ''works'' of Jesus, but also to his ''name''. New Testament Scriptures requisite the name of Jesus as the only way to be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acts 4:12|url=https://biblia.com/books/nkjv/Ac4.12|website=Biblia.com|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devotions to the [[Holy Name of Jesus|name of Jesus]] go back to the [[Early Christianity|earliest days of Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Sylvester &gt;Hunter, Sylvester.

''Jesus: the Complete Guide'', 2006. {{ISBN|0-8264-8011-X}} p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; These exist today both in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]]—both Catholic and Protestant.&lt;ref name="Houlden"/&gt;

Christians predominantly profess that through Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, he restored humanity's communion with God with the blood of the [[New Covenant]]. His death on a cross is understood as a redemptive sacrifice: the source of humanity's [[salvation]] and the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for [[sin]]&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §606–618; Council of Trent (1547) in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, ''Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum'' (1965) §1529; {{bibleref2|John|14:2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had entered human history through [[original sin|the sin of Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England,'' article 9; ''Augsburg Confession,'' article 2; ''Second Helvetic Confession,'' chapter 8; {{bibleref2|Romans|5:12–21}}; {{bibleref2|1Cor.|15:21–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christians generally consider Jesus to be the Christ, the long-awaited [[Messiah]], as well as the one and only Son of God. The opening words in the [[Gospel of Mark]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#1:1|1:1]]), "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God", provide Jesus with the two distinct attributions as Christ and as the Son of God. His divinity is again re-affirmed in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#1:11|Mark 1:11]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'' by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 {{ISBN|0-8028-3167-2}} page 288&lt;/ref&gt;  [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:1|Matthew 1:1]] which begins by calling Jesus the Christ and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:16|in verse 16]] explains it again with the affirmation: "Jesus, who is called Christ".

In the Pauline epistles, the word "Christ" is so closely associated with Jesus that apparently for the [[early Christians]] there was no need to claim that Jesus was Christ, for that was considered widely accepted among them. Hence Paul could use the term ''Christos'' with no confusion about who it referred to, and as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#4:15|1 Corinthians 4:15]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#12:5|Romans 12:5]] he could use expressions such as "in Christ" to refer to the followers of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'' by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 {{ISBN|0-8028-3167-2}} page 99&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]], the title "Son of God" is applied to Jesus on many occasions.&lt;ref name=Cathenc &gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Son of God]&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to refer to his divinity, from the beginning in the [[Annunciation]] up to the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Cathenc /&gt; The declaration that Jesus is the Son of God is made by many individuals in the New Testament, and on two separate occasions by [[God the Father]] as a voice from Heaven, and is asserted by Jesus himself.&lt;ref name=Cathenc /&gt;&lt;ref name=OneTeacher &gt;''One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel'' by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 {{ISBN|3-11-018151-7}} pages 240-241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pentecost &gt;Dwight Pentecost ''The words and works of Jesus Christ'' 2000 {{ISBN|0-310-30940-9}} page 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromiley571 &gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-3785-9}} page 571-572&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christology]], the concept that ''the Christ'' is the ''[[Logos]]'' (i.e., "The Word") has been important in establishing the doctrine of the [[divinity]] of Christ and his position as God the Son in the Trinity as set forth in the [[Chalcedonian Creed]]. This derives from the [[John 1:1|opening of the Gospel of John]], commonly translated into English as: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John 1:1|url=https://biblia.com/books/nkjv/Jn1.1|website=Biblia.com|publisher=Faithlife.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the original Greek, ''Logos'' (λόγος) is used for "Word," and in theological discourse, this is often left in its English transliterated form, "Logos".

The ''[[pre-existence of Christ]]'' refers to the doctrine of the [[Person of Christ|personal]] existence of [[Christ]] before his conception. One of the relevant [[Bible]] passages is [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:1|John 1:1-18]] where, in the Trinitarian view, Christ is identified with a pre-existent divine [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] called the Logos or Word. This doctrine is reiterated in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#17:5|John 17:5]] when Jesus refers to the glory which he had with the Father "before the world was" during the [[Farewell discourse]].&lt;ref name=Endo &gt;''Creation and Christology'' by Masanobu Endo 2002 {{ISBN|3-16-147789-8}} page 233&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleref2|John|17:24}} also refers to the Father loving Jesus "before the foundation of the world".&lt;ref name=Endo /&gt; [[Nontrinitarianism|Non-Trinitarian]] views about the pre-existence of Christ vary, with some rejecting it and others accepting it.

Following the [[Apostolic Age]], from the 2nd century forward, several controversies developed about how the human and divine are related within the person of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Editors1999&gt;{{Citation| last = Editors | first =  Erwin Fahlbusch| year = 1999| title = The encyclopedia of Christianity| pages = 463| url = https://books.google.com/?id=z47zgZ75dqgC&amp;pg=PA463&amp;dq=Logos+as+God+in+the+early+church| isbn = 0-8028-2413-7| publisher = Brill| location = Leiden, Netherland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rausch2003&gt;{{Citation| last = Rausch | first =  Thomas P.| year = 2003| title = Who is Jesus? : an introduction to Christology| pages = 149| url = https://books.google.com/?id=8OJCa6euw5gC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 0-8146-5078-3| publisher = Liturgical Press| location = Collegeville, Minn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGrath2007&gt;{{Citation| last = McGrath | first =  Alister E.| year = 2007| title = Christian theology : an introduction| pages = 282| url = https://books.google.com/?id=tHlY94UWi3UC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 1-4051-5360-1| publisher = Blackwell| location = Malden, Mass. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually in 451, the concept of a ''[[Hypostatic union]]'' was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human.&lt;ref name=Editors1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rausch2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, Vol XIV p207, translated edition by H.R.

==Incarnation, Nativity and Second Adam==

[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|''[[Nativity of Jesus]]'', by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]], c. 1490]]{{quote|''He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible''. — [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Colossians#1:15|Colossians 1:15-16]]}}

The above verse from Colossians regards the birth of Jesus as the model for all creation.&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W. ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1988. {{ISBN|0-8028-3785-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Espín, Orlando O. and James B.

[[Apostle Paul]] viewed the birth of Jesus as an event of cosmic significance which brought forth a "new man" who undid the damage caused by the fall of the first man, Adam. Just as the [[Gospel of John|Johannine]] view of Jesus as the incarnate Logos proclaims the universal relevance of his birth, the Pauline perspective emphasizes the birth of a new man and a new world in the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg /&gt; Paul's [[eschatology|eschatological]] view of Jesus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam. Unlike Adam, the new man born in Jesus obeys God and ushers in a world of morality and salvation.&lt;ref name="Pannenberg"/&gt;

In the Pauline view, Adam is positioned as the first man and Jesus as the second: Adam, having corrupted himself by his disobedience, also infected humanity and left it with a curse as its inheritance. The birth of Jesus counterbalanced the fall of Adam, bringing forth redemption and repairing the damage done by Adam.&lt;ref name=Daille &gt;Daille, Jean. ''An exposition of the epistle of Saint Paul to the Philippians'', 1995. {{ISBN|0-8028-2511-7}}. pp. 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century Church Father [[Irenaeus]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When He became incarnate and was made man, He commenced afresh the long line of human beings, and furnished us, in a brief, comprehensive manner, with salvation; so that what we had lost in Adam—namely to be according to the image and likeness of God- that we might recover in Christ Jesus."&lt;ref name=Bethune &gt;Bethune-Baker, James Franklin.

''A History of the Christian Church'', 2010. {{ISBN|1-4400-4446-5}}. pp. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[patristic]] theology, Paul's contrasting of Jesus as the new man versus Adam provided a framework for discussing the uniqueness of the birth of Jesus and the ensuing events of his life. The nativity of Jesus thus began to serve as the starting point for "cosmic Christology" in which the birth, life and resurrection of Jesus have universal implications.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grillmeier, John Bowden.

''The Witness of Jesus, Paul and John: An Exploration in Biblical Theology'', 2008. {{ISBN|0-8308-2888-5}} p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Jesus as the "new man" repeats in the cycle of birth and rebirth of Jesus from his nativity to his resurrection: following his birth, through his morality and obedience to the Father, Jesus began a "new harmony" in the relationship between God the Father and man. The nativity and resurrection of Jesus thus created the author and exemplar of a new humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Rahner, Karl. ''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'', 2004. {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}}. pp. 474 and 1434&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus brought about salvation, undoing the damage of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

==Teachings, parables and miracles==
{{Main article|Parables of Jesus|Miracles of Jesus}}
[[File:Ostromir Gospel 1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Gospel of John]], 1056]]
{{quote|''The words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father who dwells in me does his works.'' — [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:10|John 14:10]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated98" /&gt;}}

In the New Testament the teachings of Jesus are presented in terms of his "words and works".&lt;ref name=Zuck100 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WPent212 /&gt; The words of Jesus include several sermons, in addition to parables that appear throughout the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels (the gospel of John includes no parables). The works include the miracles and other acts performed during his ministry.&lt;ref name=WPent212 /&gt;

Although the [[Canonical Gospel]]s are the major source of the teachings of Jesus, the Pauline epistles, which were likely written decades before the gospels, provide some of the earliest written accounts of the teachings of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Blomb442 &gt;Blomberg,Craig L. ''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey''. B &amp; H Academic, 2009. {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}}. pp. 441-442&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament does not present the teachings of Jesus as merely his own teachings, but equates the words of Jesus with divine revelation, with [[John the Baptist]] stating in [[s:Bible (NIV)/John#3:34|John 3:34]]: "For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit." and Jesus stating in [[s:Bible (NIV)/John#7:16|John 7:16]]: “My teaching is not my own.

===Parables===
The parables of Jesus represent a major component of his teachings in the gospels, the approximately thirty parables forming about one third of his recorded teachings.&lt;ref name="Lockyer174"&gt;Lockyer, Herbert. ''All the Parables of the Bible''. Zondervan, 1988. {{ISBN|978-0-310-28111-5}}. p.174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JDPentecost10"&gt;Pentecost, J. Dwight. ''The parables of Jesus: Lessons in Life from the Master Teacher''. Zondervan, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8254-3458-0}}. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The parables may appear within longer sermons, as well as other places within the narrative.&lt;ref name=Howick7 /&gt; Jesus' parables are seemingly simple and memorable stories, often with imagery, and each conveys a teaching which usually relates the physical world to the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] world.&lt;ref name="Lisco9-11"&gt;Lisco, Friedrich Gustav, and Patrick Fairbairn. ''The parables of Jesus Explained and Illustrated Volume 29''. Nabu Press, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1149508398}}. pp.9-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxenden, Ashton. ''The parables of our Lord.'' William Macintosh Publishers, London, 1864. ASIN: B008RW5N2S. p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Lisco and [[Patrick Fairbairn|Fairbairn]] stated that in the parables of Jesus, "the image borrowed from the visible world is accompanied by a truth from the invisible (spiritual) world" and that the parables of Jesus are not "mere similitudes which serve the purpose of illustration, but are internal analogies where nature becomes a witness for the spiritual world".&lt;ref name="Lisco9-11"/&gt; Similarly, in the 20th century, calling a parable "an earthly story with a heavenly meaning",&lt;ref name="Barclay12"/&gt; William Barclay states that the parables of Jesus use familiar examples to lead others' minds towards heavenly concepts. He suggests that Jesus did not form his parables merely as analogies but based on an "inward affinity between the natural and the spiritual order."&lt;ref name="Barclay12"&gt;Barclay, William.

=== Miracles of Jesus ===
{{quote|''Believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father''. —[[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#10:38|John 10:38]]&lt;ref&gt;''The emergence of Christian theology'' by Eric Francis Osborn 1993 {{ISBN|0-521-43078-X}} page 100&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Christian teachings, the miracles of Jesus were as much a vehicle for his message as were his words. Many of the miracles emphasize the importance of faith, for instance in [[cleansing ten lepers]],{{Bibleref2c|Lk|17:19}} Jesus did not say: "My power has saved you" but says "Rise and go; your faith has saved you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marthaler |first1=Berard L. |last2= |first2= |title=The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology |url= |accessdate= |year= |publisher=Twenty-Third Publications; 3rd Revised edition |location= |isbn= 0-89622-537-2|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lockyer|first1=Herbert |last2= |first2= |title= All the Parables of the Bible|url= |accessdate= |year=1988 |publisher= Zondervan|location= |isbn=978-0-310-28111-5 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the [[Jesus walks on water|Walking on Water]] miracle, [[Apostle Peter]] learns an important lesson about faith in that as his faith wavers, he begins to sink.{{bibleref2c|Mt|14:34-36}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perkins |first1=Pheme |last2= |first2= |title=Reading the New Testament: An Introduction |url= |accessdate= |year=1988 |publisher=Paulist Press |location= |isbn=0-8091-2939-6 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palma il Giovane 001.jpg|thumb|left|Jesus [[Healing the paralytic at Bethesda|healing the paralytic]] by [[Palma il Giovane]], 1592]]

One characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the Gospel accounts is that he delivered benefits freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment for his healing miracles, unlike some high priests of his time who charged those who were healed.&lt;ref name="Blomberg197" /&gt; In [[s:Bible (NIV)/Matthew#10:8|Matthew 10:8]] he advised his disciples to heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, and drive out demons without payment and stated: "Freely you have received; freely give".&lt;ref name="Blomberg197"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blomberg |first1=Craig L.  |last2= |first2= |title=Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey |url= |accessdate= |year=2009 |publisher=B &amp; H Academic |location= |isbn=0-8054-4482-3 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians in general believe that Jesus' miracles were actual historical events and that his miraculous works were an important part of his life, attesting to his divinity and the [[Hypostatic union]], i.e., the dual natures of Christ's humanity and divinity in one [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis.]]&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia on Miracles"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia on Miracles]&lt;/ref&gt; Christians believe that while Jesus' experiences of hunger, weariness, and death were evidences of his humanity, the miracles were evidences of his deity.&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, Herbert.

Christian authors also view the miracles of Jesus not merely as acts of power and omnipotence, but as works of love and mercy: they were performed to show compassion for sinful and suffering humanity.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia on Miracles" /&gt; Authors Ken and Jim Stocker state that "every single miracle Jesus performed was an act of love".&lt;ref&gt;Stocker, Ken. Jim Stocker.  ''Facts, Faith, and the FAQs''. Xulon Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1600347535}}. p.139&lt;/ref&gt; And each miracle involves specific teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, Robert. ''The Miracles of Christ''. Ulan Press, 2012. ASIN: B009QMIYOW. p.133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersbe, Warren W. ''Classic Sermons on the Miracles of Jesus''. Kregel Academic &amp; Professional, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8254-3999-X}}. p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

Since according to the [[Gospel of John]]{{Bibleref2c-nb|Jn|20:30}} it was impossible to narrate all the miracles performed by Jesus, the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] states that the miracles presented in the Gospels were selected for a twofold reason: first for the manifestation of God's glory, and then for their evidential value. Jesus referred to his "works" as evidences of his mission and his divinity, and in {{Bibleref2|John|5:36}} he declared that his miracles have greater evidential value than the testimony of [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia on Miracles" /&gt;

==Crucifixion and atonement==
{{see also|Lamb of God}}
{{Christology}}
The accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus provide a rich background for Christological analysis, from the [[canonical gospels]] to the Pauline epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Mark Allan (ed.) and David R. Bauer (ed.). ''Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology''. Westminster John Knox Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-664-25752-6}}. p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannine]] "agency christology" combines the concept that Jesus is the Son of his Father with the idea that he has come into the world as his Father's agent, commissioned and sent by the Father to represent the Father and to accomplish his Father's work. Implied in each Synoptic portrayal of Jesus is the doctrine that the salvation Jesus gives is inseparable from Jesus himself and his divine identity. Sonship and agency come together in the Synoptic gospels only in the Parable of the Vineyard ({{Bibleref2|Matthew|21:37}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|12:6}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|20:13}}).&lt;ref&gt;Bauckhman, Richard. "The Johannine Jesus and the Synoptic Jesus". [http://richardbauckham.co.uk/uploads/Accessible/Johannine%20Jessus%20&amp;%20Synoptic%20Jesus.pdf] 2 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The submission of Jesus to crucifixion is a sacrifice made as an ''agent of God'' or ''servant of God'', for the sake of eventual victory.&lt;ref name=Cullmann &gt;{{cite book |last1= Cullmann|first1=Oscar |last2= |first2= |title= The Christology of the New Testament|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vc_cPAAACAAJ|accessdate= |year=1959 |publisher= Westminster John Knox Press|location= |isbn=0-664-24351-7 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sadananda |first1=Rathnakara Sadananda |last2= |first2= |title= The Johannine exegesis of God: An Exploration into the Johannine Understanding Of God|url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |publisher=Walter De Gruyter Inc |location= |isbn=3-11-018248-3 |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; This builds upon the [[salvation in Christianity|salvific]] theme of the [[Gospel of John]] which begins in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:36|John 1:36]] with [[John the Baptist]]'s proclamation: "The Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world".&lt;ref name=Pollard &gt;{{cite book |last1=Pollard |first1=T.

R. |last2= |first2=| authorlink= |title=Studies in Revelation |url= |accessdate= |year=1998 |publisher=Kregel Classics |location= |isbn=978-0825424854 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central element in the Christology presented in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened "with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan".&lt;ref name=Matera67 &gt;{{cite book |last1=Matera   |first1=Frank J. |last2= |first2= |authorlink= |title=New Testament Christology |url= |accessdate= |year= 1999|
publisher=Kregel Classics  |location= |isbn= 0-664-25694-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:23|Acts 2:23]], the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus "at the hands of the lawless" is viewed as the fulfilment of the plan of God.&lt;ref name=Matera67 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns'' by Marion L. Soards 1994 {{ISBN|0-664-25221-4}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term "the cross of Christ" used in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#6:12|Galatians 6:12]] may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 &gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwarz  |first1=Hans  |last2= |first2= |title=Christology |url= |accessdate= |year=1998  |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-8028-4463-4 |pages=132–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant [[eschatological]] consequences, as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#2:8|1 Corinthians 2:8]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 /&gt; In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Philippians#2:8|Philippians 2:8]]) died "at the right time" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#4:25|Romans 4:25]]) based on the plan of God.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 /&gt; For Paul the "power of the cross" is not separable from the resurrection of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 /&gt;

[[John Calvin]] supported the "agent of God" Christology and argued that in his trial in [[Pilate's Court]] Jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence, but instead submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the Father.&lt;ref name=CalvinC &gt;{{cite book |last1=Edmondson  |first1=Edmondson  |last2= |first2= |title=Calvin's Christology |url= |accessdate= |year=2004  |publisher=Cambridge University Press  |location= |isbn=0-521-54154-9 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures'' by [[Hughes Oliphant Old]] 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-4775-7}} page 125&lt;/ref&gt; This Christological theme continued into the 20th century, both in the [[Eastern Church|Eastern]] and [[Western Church]]es. In the Eastern Church [[Sergei Bulgakov]] argued that the crucifixion of Jesus was "[[Pre-existence of Christ|pre-eternally]]" determined by the Father before the creation of the world, to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of Adam.&lt;ref name=SBulgakov &gt;{{cite book |last1= Bulgakov |first1= Sergei |last2=Jakim |first2=Boris  |title=The Lamb of God |url= |accessdate= |year= 2008 |publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location= |isbn=0-8028-2779-9  |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western Church, [[Karl Rahner]] elaborated on the analogy that the blood of the Lamb of God (and the water from the side of Jesus) shed at the crucifixion had a cleansing nature, similar to baptismal water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rahner  |first1=Karl  |last2= |first2= |title=Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi |url= |accessdate= |year=2004  |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates  |
location= |isbn=0-86012-006-6 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] believe that the crucifixion was the culmination of Christ's atonement, which began in the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/gethsemane?lang=eng|title=lds.org - Gethsemane|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurrection, Ascension and Second Coming==
{{Main article|Resurrection of Jesus|Ascension of Jesus|Second coming of Christ}}
{{See also|Resurrection of Jesus in Christian art|Ascension of Jesus in Christian art}}
[[File:Rafael - ressureicaocristo01.jpg|thumb|Depictions of the Resurrection of Jesus are [[Resurrection of Jesus in Christian art|central to Christian art]]. Painting by [[Raphael]], 1499-1502.]]
The New Testament teaches that the resurrection of Jesus is a foundation of the Christian faith.{{bibleref2c|1co|15:12-20||1 Cor 15:12-20}} {{bibleref2c|1Peter|1:3|HCSB|1 Pet 1:3}} Christians, through [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in the working of God{{bibleref2c|Colossians|2:12||Col 2:12}} are spiritually resurrected with Jesus, and are [[Redemption (theology)|redeemed]] so that they may walk in a new way of life.{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:4}}

In the teachings of the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic Church]], the resurrection was seen as heralding a [[World to Come|new era]]. Forming a theology of the resurrection fell to [[Apostle Paul]]. It was not enough for Paul to simply repeat elementary teachings, but as {{bibleref2|Hebrews|6:1|NIV}} states, "go beyond the initial teachings about Christ and advance to maturity". Fundamental to Pauline theology is the connection between Christ's Resurrection and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].&lt;ref&gt;''The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology'' by Berard L. Marthaler 2007 {{ISBN|0-89622-537-2}} page 361&lt;/ref&gt; Paul explained the importance of the resurrection of Jesus as the cause and basis of the hope of Christians to share a similar experience in {{bibleref2|1co|15:20-22||1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 15:20-22}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If the cross stands at the center of Paul's theology, so does the Resurrection: unless the one died the death of ''all'', the ''all'' would have little to celebrate in the resurrection of the one.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, James D. G. ''Theology of Paul the Apostle''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0802844231}}. p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Paul taught that, just as Christians share in Jesus' death in baptism, so they will share in his resurrection&lt;ref name = "Ehrman 2006"/&gt; for Jesus was designated the Son of God by his resurrection.{{bibleref2c|Rom.|1:4}} &lt;ref name = "Ehrman 2006"&gt;Ehrman, Bart. Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend. Oxford University Press, USA. 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-530013-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's views went against the thoughts of the Greek philosophers to whom a bodily resurrection meant a new imprisonment in a corporeal body, which was what they wanted to avoid, given that for them the corporeal and the material fettered the spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Reichelt, Karl Ludvig and Sverre Holth. ''Meditation and Piety in the Far East'' , 2004. {{ISBN|0-227-17235-3}} p.30&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Paul believed that the newly resurrected body would be a heavenly body—immortal, glorified, powerful and pneumatic, in contrast to an earthly body which is mortal, dishonored, weak and psychic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|1cor|15:42-49||1 Corinthians 15:42-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apostolic Fathers]], discussed the death and resurrection of Jesus, including [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]] (50−115),&lt;ref&gt;Ignatius makes many passing references, but two extended discussions are found in the [[Letter to the Trallians]] and the [[Letter to the Smyrnaeans]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polycarp]] (69−155), and [[Justin Martyr]] (100−165). Following the [[Constantine I and Christianity|conversion of Constantine]] and the liberating [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]] of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, that focused on Christology helped shape the Christian understanding of the redemptive nature of Resurrection, and influenced both the development of its iconography, and its use within Liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Resurrection and the icon'' by Michel Quenot 1998 {{ISBN|0-88141-149-3}} page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6869">'''American-Jewish comedy''' is, in part, a continuation of the traditional role of humor in Jewish culture among historical and contemporary American performers.  It has appealed to both Jewish and wider mainstream audiences.&lt;ref name="Antler"/&gt;  At various times in American history, the field of comedy has been dominated by Jewish comedians.&lt;ref name="bt"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Jewish Weekly Bulletin|title=Prolific professor takes serious look at Jewish funny men in new book|first=Aleza|last=Goldsmith|date=December 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Borscht Belt]] arose in the early 20th century out of the tradition of [[Yiddish theater]], in Jewish resort areas in the [[Catskill Mountains]] in New York.  Many of the most famous Jewish comedians of the twentieth century launched their careers there.&lt;ref name="forward"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Man Who Wanted To Be Woody Allen|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/128605/#ixzz17vZimjCi|first=Allison Gaudet|last=Yarrow|date=June 7, 2010|publisher=Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the comedians gained a wider mainstream audience with the rise of [[Vaudeville]].&lt;ref name="haunted"/&gt;

Until recent years, most Jewish comedians adopted [[stage name]]s that did not sound ethnic, as a way of gaining wider acceptance.&lt;ref name="forward"/&gt;  Even among those who did not want to be considered Jewish comedians, their experiences as Jews were often included their humor, including their moral sensibility.&lt;ref name="forward"/&gt;

==Themes and styles==

Some common themes among American Jewish comedians include their heritage as Jews,&lt;ref name="Antler"/&gt; experience of living between two worlds (ethnic and mainstream),&lt;ref name="Antler"/&gt; anxiety of living as a minority in America&lt;ref name="Antler"/&gt; and the foibles of American culture.&lt;ref name="Antler"/&gt;  Jewish comedy has often featured ridicule and [[insult jokes]], including insulting other minority groups.&lt;ref name="bt"/&gt;

Characteristics of comedians include wit,&lt;ref name="Antler"/&gt; verbal skills,&lt;ref name="Antler"/&gt; self-mockery,&lt;ref name="Antler"/&gt; and a "critical edge".&lt;ref name="Antler"/&gt;

===Women in Jewish-American humor===
Whereas women had not been prominent in comedic roles in Europe, the changing roles of Jewish women in America allowed for the emergence of a class of female Jewish comedians, who have focused on their perspective as women, often adopting a [[feminism|feminist]] position.&lt;ref name="Antler"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Gift of Jewish Women's Comedy|first=Joyce|last=Antler|url=http://jwa.org/discover/infocus/comedy/|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Warren Jones''' (May 13, 1931 – November 18, 1978) was an [[Americans|American]] [[Cult|religious cult]] leader who, along with his inner circle, initiated and was responsible for a [[mass suicide]] and [[mass murder]] in [[Jonestown]], [[Guyana]].

Jones was the founder and leader of the [[Peoples Temple]] cult which he began in [[Indiana]] during the 1950s. He was officially ordained in 1956 by the Independent Assemblies of God and in 1964 by the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]]. He moved the Temple to [[California]] in 1965 and gained notoriety with [[Peoples Temple in San Francisco|its activities in San Francisco]] in the early 1970s. He then relocated to [[Guyana]].
In 1978, media reports surfaced that human rights abuses were taking place in the Peoples Temple in Jonestown. U.S. Representative [[Leo Ryan]] led a delegation into the commune to investigate what was going on; Ryan and others were murdered by gunfire while boarding a return flight with defectors. Jones subsequently committed a [[murder-suicide|mass murder-suicide]] of 918 of his followers, 304 of whom were children, almost all by [[cyanide]] poisoning via [[Flavor Aid]].

== Early life ==
Jones was born on  May 13, 1931, in a rural area of [[Crete, Indiana|Crete]], Indiana&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rolls|2014|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hall3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hall|1987|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to James Thurman Jones (1887–1951), a [[World War I]] veteran, and Lynetta Putnam (1902–1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levi|1982|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiterman 1982. p. 9-10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent;&lt;ref name="KJbook10" /&gt; he later claimed partial [[Cherokee]] ancestry through his mother, but his maternal second cousin later stated this was untrue.&lt;ref name="KJbook10"&gt;Kilduff, Marshall and Javers, Ron. ''The Suicide Cult''. Bantam Books, 1978. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;While Jim Jones claimed to be partially of Cherokee descent through his mother Lynetta, this story was apparently not true.(Lindsay, Robert. "How Rev. Jim Jones and Black Spencer Gained His Power Over Followers". ''The New York Times''. November 26, 1978). Lynetta's cousin Barbara Shaffer said "there wasn't an ounce of Indian in our family". (Lindsay, Robert. "How Rev. Jim Jones Gained His Power Over Followers". ''The New York Times''. November 26, 1978). Shaffer said that Lynetta was Welsh. ("Jones—The Dark Private Side Emerges". ''Los Angeles Times''. November 24, 1978). The birth records for Lynetta have since been lost. (Kilduff, Marshall and Ron Javers. "Jim Jones Always Led&amp;nbsp;– Or Wouldn't Play". ''San Francisco Chronicle''. December 4, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Economic difficulties during the [[Great Depression]] led to the Jones family moving to the town of [[Lynn, Indiana|Lynn]] in 1934, where Jones grew up in a shack without plumbing.&lt;ref name="World of Criminal Justice, Gale"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jones, Jim (1931 - 1978) American Cult Leader|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/worldcrims/jones_jim_1931_1978|publisher=World of Criminal Justice, Gale.|accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hall5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hall|1987|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Jones was a voracious reader who studied [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], carefully noting the strengths and weaknesses of each.&lt;ref name="raven24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones also developed an intense interest in religion, primarily because he found making friends difficult.&lt;ref name="KJbook10" /&gt; Childhood acquaintances later recalled Jones as being a "really weird kid" who was "obsessed with religion&amp;nbsp;... obsessed with death". They alleged that he frequently held funerals for small animals on his parents' property and had stabbed a cat to death.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/jonestown/filmmore/pt.html ''Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple'']. American Experience, PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones and a childhood friend both claimed that his father, who was an alcoholic, was associated with the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which had gained a stronghold in Depression-era Indiana.&lt;ref name="hall5" /&gt; Jones, however, came to sympathize with the country's repressed [[African-American]] community due to his own experiences as a social outcast. Jones later recounted how he and his father clashed on the issue of race, and how he did not speak with his father for "many, many years" after he refused to allow one of Jones' black friends into the house. After James and Lynetta Jones separated, Jones moved with his mother to [[Richmond, Indiana]].&lt;ref name="raven27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1948 he graduated from [[Richmond High School (Richmond, Indiana)|Richmond High School]] early with honors.&lt;ref name="raven33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, 1949, Jones married Marceline Baldwin (1927–1978), a nurse, and the couple moved to [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. She later died with him in Jonestown.&lt;ref name="raven37" /&gt; He attended [[Indiana University Bloomington]], where a speech by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] about the plight of African-Americans impressed him.&lt;ref name="raven37"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/jonestown/timeline/index.html "Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple - Timeline".] PBS.org. February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Jones moved to [[Indianapolis]], where he attended night school at [[Butler University]], earning a degree in secondary education in 1961, ten years after enrolling.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, James.

==Founding of the Peoples Temple==

=== Indiana beginnings ===

In 1951, Jones began attending gatherings of the [[Communist Party USA]] in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name="millennium"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wessinger|2000|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became flustered with harassment during the [[McCarthy Hearings]],&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt; particularly regarding an event he attended with his mother focusing on [[Paul Robeson]], after which she was harassed by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in front of her co-workers for attending.&lt;ref name="q134"&gt;Jones, Jim. [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=27339 "Transcript of Recovered FBI tape Q 134".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''. Jonestown Project: [[San Diego State University]].&lt;/ref&gt; He also became frustrated with ostracism of open [[communism|communist]]s in the United States, especially during the trial of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="horrock"&gt;Horrock, Nicholas M., "Communist in 1950s", ''The New York Times'', December 17, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; This frustration, among other things, provoked a seminal moment for Jones in which he asked himself, "How can I demonstrate my [[Marxism]]? The thought was, infiltrate the church."&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt;&lt;ref name="q134" /&gt;

Jones was surprised when a [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[District Superintendent (Methodism)|district superintendent]] helped him get a start in the church, even though he knew Jones to be a communist. Jones had not met him through the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="horrock" /&gt; In 1952, he became a student pastor at the Sommerset Southside Methodist Church, but later claimed he left that church because its leaders barred him from [[racial integration|integrating]] blacks into his congregation.&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt; Around this time, Jones witnessed a [[Faith healing|faith-healing]] service at a [[Seventh Day Baptists|Seventh Day Baptist Church]].&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt; He observed that it attracted people and their money and concluded that, with financial resources from such healings, he could help accomplish his social goals.&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt;

Jones organized a mammoth religious convention to take place on June 11 through June 15, 1956, in a cavernous Indianapolis hall called Cadle Tabernacle. To draw the crowds, Jones needed a religious headliner, and so he arranged to share the pulpit with Rev. [[William M. Branham]], a healing evangelist and religious author who at the time was as highly revered as [[Oral Roberts]].&lt;ref name="Reiterman 1982. p. 9-10"/&gt; Following the convention, Jones was able to launch his own church, which changed names until it became the Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel.&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt; The Peoples Temple was initially launched as an inter-racial mission.

=== Racial integrationist ===
[[File:Jim Jones shakes hands with Cecil Williams - January 1977.jpg|thumb|300px|Jim Jones receives a Martin Luther King, Jr. Humanitarian award from [[Cecil Williams (pastor)|Pastor Cecil Williams]], 1977.]]

In 1960, Indianapolis [[Mayor of Indianapolis|Mayor]] Charles Boswell appointed Jones director of the [[Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref name="raven68"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones ignored Boswell's advice to keep a low profile, finding new outlets for his views on local radio and television programs.&lt;ref name="raven68" /&gt; When the mayor and other commissioners asked Jones to curtail his public actions, he resisted and was wildly cheered at a meeting of the [[NAACP]] and [[Urban League]] when he yelled for his audience to be more [[militant (word)|militant]], and then climaxed with, "Let my people go!"&lt;ref name="raven69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Jones also helped to [[Racial integration|racially integrate]] churches, restaurants, the telephone company, the [[Indianapolis Police Department|police department]], a theater, an amusement park, and the [[Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital|Methodist Hospital]].&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt; After [[swastika]]s were painted on the homes of two African-American families, Jones personally walked the neighborhood comforting local black people and counseling white families not to move, in order to prevent [[white flight]].&lt;ref name="raven71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones set up [[Sting operation|stings]] to catch restaurants refusing to serve black customers&lt;ref name="raven71" /&gt; and wrote to [[American Nazi]] leaders and then passed their responses to the media.&lt;ref name="raven72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Jones was accidentally placed in the black ward of a hospital after a collapse in 1961, he refused to be moved; he began to make the beds and empty the bed pans of black patients. Political pressures resulting from Jones' actions caused hospital officials to desegregate the wards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones received considerable criticism in Indiana for his integrationist views.&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt; White-owned businesses and locals were critical of him.&lt;ref name="raven71" /&gt; A swastika was placed on the Temple, a stick of [[dynamite]] was left in a Temple coal pile, and a dead cat was thrown at Jones' house after a threatening phone call.&lt;ref name="raven72" /&gt; Other incidents occurred, although some suspect that Jones himself may have been involved in at least some of them.&lt;ref name="raven72" /&gt;

=== "Rainbow Family" ===
Jim and Marceline Jones adopted several children of at least partly non-Caucasian ancestry; he referred to the household as his "rainbow family",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated: "Integration is a more personal thing with me now. It's a question of my son's future."&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; and also portrayed the Temple overall as a "rainbow family".

The couple adopted three children of [[Korean-American]] ancestry: Lew, Suzanne and Stephanie. Jones had been encouraging Temple members to adopt orphans from war-ravaged [[Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also long been critical of U.S. opposition to communist leader [[Kim Il-Sung]]'s [[Korean War|1950 invasion]] of [[South Korea]], calling it the "war of liberation" and stating that "the south is a living example of all that socialism in the north has overcome".&lt;ref name="q1023"&gt;Jones, Jim. [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=27309 "Transcript of Recovered FBI tape Q 1023".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, he and his wife also adopted Agnes Jones, who was partly of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent.&lt;ref name="millennium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="events"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/jonestown/peopleevents/p_jones.html ''Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple - People &amp; Events ''] PBS.org.

Two years later in 1961, the Joneses became the first white couple in Indiana to adopt a black child, James Warren Jones, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/jonestown/sfeature/race.html "Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple - Race and the Peoples Temple".] PBS.org. February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple also adopted another son, who was white, named Tim.&lt;ref name="millennium" /&gt; Tim Jones, whose birth mother was a member of the Peoples Temple, was originally named Timothy Glen Tupper.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt;

After a 1961 Temple speech about a [[nuclear apocalypse]], and a January 1962 ''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]'' magazine article listing [[Belo Horizonte, Brazil|Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]], as a safe place in a [[nuclear war]], Jones traveled with his family to the city, with the idea of setting up a new Temple location.&lt;ref name="raven77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to Brazil, Jones made his first trip into [[Guyana]], then a [[British Guiana|British colony]].&lt;ref name="raven78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving in Belo Horizonte, the Joneses rented a modest three-bedroom home.&lt;ref name="raven79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones studied the local economy and receptiveness of racial minorities to his message, although language remained a barrier.&lt;ref name="raven81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored local [[Religion in Brazil|Brazilian syncretic religions]].&lt;ref name="raven84"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was careful not to portray himself as a communist in a foreign territory and spoke of an [[Communalism#Communalism in Christianity|apostolic communal lifestyle]] rather than of [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] or Marx.&lt;ref name="raven82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the lack of resources in the locale led the Joneses to move to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in mid-1963.&lt;ref name="raven83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, they worked with the poor in Rio's slums.&lt;ref name="raven83" /&gt;

Jones became plagued by guilt for leaving behind the Indiana civil rights struggle and possibly losing what he had tried to build there.&lt;ref name="raven83" /&gt; When Jones' associate preachers in Indiana told him that the Temple was about to collapse without him, he returned.&lt;ref name="raven85"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

When Jones returned from Brazil in December 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Reiterman &amp; Jacobs 1982, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; he told his Indiana congregation that the world would be engulfed by nuclear war on July 15, 1967, that would then create a new socialist [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] on Earth, and that the Temple had to move to [[Northern California]] for safety.&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1126" /&gt; Accordingly, the Temple began moving to [[Redwood Valley, California]], near the city of [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]].&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt;

According to religious studies professor [[Catherine Wessinger]], while Jones always spoke of the [[social gospel]]'s virtues, he chose to conceal that his gospel was actually communism until the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt; By that time, Jones began at least partially revealing the details of his "Apostolic Socialism" concept in Temple sermons.&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt; He also taught that "those who remained drugged with the opiate of religion had to be brought to enlightenment&amp;nbsp;– socialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Layton|1998|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones often mixed these ideas, such as preaching that, "If you're born in capitalist America, racist America, fascist America, then you're born in sin. But if you're born in socialism, you're not born in sin."&lt;ref name="q1053"&gt;Jim Jones, [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=27318 ''Transcript of Recovered FBI tape Q 1053'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1970s, Jones began deriding traditional [[Christianity]] as "fly away religion", rejecting the [[Bible]] as being a tool to oppress women and non-whites, and denouncing a "Sky God" who was no God at all.&lt;ref name="millennium"/&gt; Jones wrote a booklet titled "The Letter Killeth", criticizing the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jim. [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=14110 "The Letter Killeth".] Original material reprint. ''Department of Religious Studies''. San Diego State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones also began preaching that he was the [[reincarnation]] of Gandhi, [[Father Divine]], [[Jesus]], [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Former Temple member Hue Fortson, Jr. quoted Jones as saying, "What you need to believe in is what you can see&amp;nbsp;... If you see me as your friend, I'll be your friend. As you see me as your father, I'll be your father, for those of you that don't have a father&amp;nbsp;... If you see me as your savior, I'll be your savior. If you see me as your God, I'll be your God."&lt;ref name="pbs.org" /&gt;

In a 1976 phone conversation with John Maher, Jones alternately stated that he was an [[agnostic]] and an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name="jonestown.sdsu.edu"&gt;See, e.g., Jones, Jim in conversation with John Maher, [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=27498 "Transcript of Recovered FBI tape Q 622".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University.]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Temple's fear that the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) was investigating its religious [[tax exemption]], Marceline Jones admitted in a 1977 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' interview that Jones was trying to promote Marxism in the U.S. by mobilizing people through religion, citing Mao as his inspiration.&lt;ref name="NYT1126"&gt;New York Times, "How Rev. Jim Jones Gained His Power Over Followers", Robert Lindsay, November 26, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; She stated: "Jim used religion to try to get some people out of the opiate of religion", and had slammed the Bible on the table yelling "I've got to destroy this paper idol!"&lt;ref name="NYT1126" /&gt; In one sermon, Jones said, "You're gonna help yourself, or you'll get no help! There's only one hope of glory; that's within you! Nobody's gonna come out of the sky! There's no heaven up there! We'll have to make heaven down here!"&lt;ref name="pbs.org" /&gt;

=== Focus on San Francisco ===
{{Main|Peoples Temple in San Francisco}}
[[File:Members of Peoples Temple attend an anti-eviction rally at the International Hotel, San Francisco - January 1977.jpg|thumb|300px|Peoples Temple members attend an anti-eviction rally at the [[International Hotel (San Francisco)|International Hotel, San Francisco]], January 1977]]
Within five years of moving to California, the Temple experienced a period of exponential growth and opened branches in cities including [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Los Angeles]]. By the early 1970s, Jones began shifting his focus to major cities because of limited expansion opportunities in Ukiah. He eventually moved the Temple's headquarters to San Francisco, which was a major center for radical protest movements at the time. The move led Jones and the Temple to become politically influential in San Francisco politics, culminating in the Temple's instrumental role in the mayoral election victory of [[George Moscone]] in 1975. Moscone subsequently appointed Jones as the chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/jonestown/filmmore/pt.html ''Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple'']. PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most cult leaders, Jones was able to gain public support and contact with prominent politicians at the local and national level. For example, Jones and Moscone met privately with vice presidential candidate [[Walter Mondale]] on his campaign plane days before the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 election]], leading Mondale to publicly praise the Temple.&lt;ref name="raven"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=302–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, "[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/650870272.html?dids=650870272:650870272&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+21%2C+1978&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B17&amp;desc=MONDALE%2C+CALIFANO+ALSO+LISTED First Lady Among Cult's References; Mondale, Califano also listed]", November 21, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Rosalynn Carter]] also personally met with Jones on multiple occasions, corresponded with him about [[Cuba]], and spoke with him at the grand opening of the San Francisco headquarters, where he received louder applause than Mrs. Carter.&lt;ref name="raven" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jim.

In September 1977, California assemblyman [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] served as master of ceremonies at a large testimonial dinner for Jones attended by Governor [[Jerry Brown]] and Lieutenant Governor [[Mervyn Dymally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Layton|1998|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that dinner, Brown touted Jones as "what you should see every day when you look in the mirror in the early morning hours... a combination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Albert Einstein]] [ ⁠and ⁠] Chairman Mao".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvey Milk]], who spoke at political rallies at the Temple,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919893-1,00.html "Another Day of Death".] ''Time''. December 11, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote to Jones after one such visit: "Rev Jim, It may take me many a day to come back down from the high that I reach today. I found something dear today. I found a sense of being that makes up for all the hours and energy placed in a fight. I found what you wanted me to find. I shall be back.

In his San Francisco apartment, Jones hosted local political figures, including Davis, for discussions.&lt;ref name="raven369"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke with friend and ''San Francisco Sun-Reporter'' publisher [[Carlton Benjamin Goodlett|Carlton Goodlett]] about his remorse over not being able to travel to socialist countries such as the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], speculating that he could be Chief Dairyman of the U.S.S.R.&lt;ref name="goodlett"&gt;Goodlett, Carlton B., [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=16978 ''Notes on Peoples Temple''], ''reprinted'' in Moore, Rebecca and Fielding M.

While Jones forged alliances with key columnists and others at the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and other press outlets,&lt;ref name="raven285"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=285, 306, 587}}&lt;/ref&gt; the move to San Francisco also brought increasing media scrutiny. After ''Chronicle'' reporter [[Marshall Kilduff]] encountered resistance to publishing an exposé, he brought his story to ''New West'' magazine.&lt;ref name="raven314"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1977, Jones and several hundred Temple members abruptly decided to move to the Temple's compound in Guyana after they learned of the contents of an article by Kilduff about to be published, which included allegations by former Temple members that they were physically, emotionally, and sexually abused.&lt;ref name="kilduff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layton113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Layton|1998|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones named the settlement "[[Jonestown]]" after himself.

Jones had first started building Jonestown, formally known as the "Peoples Temple Agricultural Project", several years before the ''New West'' article was published. Jonestown was promoted as a means to create both a "socialist paradise" and a "sanctuary" from the media scrutiny in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hall|1987|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones purported to establish Jonestown as a benevolent model communist community stating, "I believe we're the purest communists there are."&lt;ref name="q50"&gt;Jones, Jim. [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=27298 "Transcript of Recovered FBI tape Q 50".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University.&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, like the restrictive emigration policies of the Soviet Union, Cuba, North Korea and other communist states, Jones did not permit members to leave Jonestown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious scholar Mary McCormick Maaga argues that Jones' authority decreased after he moved to the isolated commune, because he was not needed for recruitment and he could not hide his [[drug addiction]] from rank and file members.&lt;ref name="mccormick_maaga1998"&gt;McCormick Maaga, Mary. ''Hearing the voices of Jonestown''. [[Syracuse University Press]], 1998. {{ISBN|0-8156-0515-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the allegations prior to Jones' departure, the leader was still respected by some for setting up a racially mixed church which helped the disadvantaged ⁠— ⁠68% of Jonestown's residents were black.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Rebecca.

"Demographics and the Black Religious Culture of Peoples Temple". in ''Peoples Temple and Black Religion in America''. Bloomington: Indiana Press University, 2005. 57-80)&lt;/ref&gt; In Jonestown, Jones started to propagate his belief in what he termed "Translation", where he and his followers would all die together and move to another planet and live blissfully.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=30807 Followership in Peoples Temple: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly] by Wendy M. Edmonds&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New children ===
Jones claimed that he was the biological father of John Victor Stoen, although the birth certificate listed Temple attorney [[Timothy Stoen]] and his wife Grace as the parents of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple repeatedly claimed that Jones fathered the child when, in 1971, Stoen had requested that Jones have sex with Grace to keep her from defecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace defected from the Temple in 1976 and began divorce proceedings against Tim the following year. In order to avoid potentially giving up the boy in a custody dispute with Grace, Jones ordered Tim to take John to Guyana in February 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Tim himself defected in June 1977, the Temple kept John Stoen in Jonestown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to John Stoen, Jones fathered another son, Jim Jon (Kimo), with Carolyn Louise Moore Layton, a Temple member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/WhoDied/bio.php?Id=633 "Jim Jon (Kimo) Prokes"].

=== Pressure and waning political support ===

In the autumn of 1977, Tim Stoen and other Temple defectors with relatives in Jonestown formed a "Concerned Relatives" group.&lt;ref name="raven408"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoen traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] in January 1978 to visit with [[United States Department of State|State Department]] officials and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], and wrote a [[white paper]] detailing his grievances against Jones and the Temple.&lt;ref name="hall227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hall|1987|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoen's efforts aroused the curiosity of California [[United States Representative|Congressman]] [[Leo Ryan]], who wrote a letter on Stoen's behalf to Guyanese Prime Minister [[Forbes Burnham]].&lt;ref name="raven458"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Concerned Relatives also began a legal battle with the Temple over the custody of Stoen's son John.&lt;ref name="Reiterman 1982 p"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most of Jones's political allies broke ties after his departure,&lt;ref&gt;Liebert, Larry, "What Politicians Say Now About Jones", San Francisco Chronicle, November 20, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; some did not. As a show of support, Willie Brown spoke out against enemies at a rally at the Temple, which was also attended by Harvey Milk and then-Assemblyman [[Art Agnos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 19, 1978, Milk wrote a letter to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] defending Jones "as a man of the highest character", and claimed that Temple defectors were trying to "damage Rev. Jones' reputation" with "apparent bold-faced lies".&lt;ref name="milk_let"&gt;Milk, Harvey [http://www.brasscheck.com/jonestown/milk.jpg ''Letter Addressed to President Jimmy Carter, Dated February 19, 1978'']&lt;/ref&gt; Moscone's office issued a press release saying that Jones had broken no laws.&lt;ref name="moore143"&gt;Moore, Rebecca. ''A Sympathetic History of Jonestown''. Lewiston: E. Mellen Press. {{ISBN|0-88946-860-5}}. p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 1978, the Concerned Relatives distributed a packet of documents, including letters and [[affidavit]]s, that they titled an "Accusation of Human Rights Violations by Rev. James Warren Jones" to the Peoples Temple, members of the press, and members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=13080 "Accusation of Human Rights Violations by Rev. James Warren Jones".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University. April 11, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1978, escaped Temple member Deborah Layton provided the group with a further affidavit detailing alleged crimes by the Temple and substandard living conditions in Jonestown.&lt;ref name="laytonaff" /&gt;

Jones was facing increasing scrutiny in the summer of 1978 when he hired [[JFK assassination]] [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] and [[Donald Freed]] to help make the case of a "grand conspiracy" by U.S. intelligence agencies against the Temple. Jones told Lane he wanted to "pull an [[Eldridge Cleaver]]", referring to a fugitive [[Black Panthers|Black Panther]] who was able to return to the U.S. after repairing his reputation.&lt;ref name="reiterman440"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visit by Congressman Ryan and mass suicide at Jonestown ==
[[File:1973 Congressional Pictorial Leo Ryan.jpg|thumb|200px|Congressman [[Leo Ryan]], who was shot and killed on Jones' orders as he and others attempted to leave Jonestown, Guyana in 1978.]]

In November 1978, Leo Ryan led a fact-finding mission to Jonestown to investigate allegations of [[human rights]] abuses.&lt;ref name="raven481"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=481}}&lt;/ref&gt; His delegation included relatives of Temple members, an [[NBC]] camera crew, and reporters for various newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=476–480}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group arrived in the Guyanese capital of [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] on November 15.&lt;ref name="raven481" /&gt; Two days later, they traveled by airplane to [[Port Kaituma]], then were transported to the Jonestown encampment in a limousine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=487–488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones hosted a reception for the Ryan delegation that evening at the central pavilion in Jonestown.

The delegation left hurriedly the afternoon of November 18 after Temple member Don Sly attacked Ryan with a knife.&lt;ref name="raven519"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=519–520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was thwarted, bringing the visit to an abrupt end.&lt;ref name="raven519" /&gt; Ryan and his delegation managed to take along fifteen Temple members who had expressed a wish to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Jones made no attempt to prevent their departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Port Kaituma Airstrip shootings ===
As members of the delegation boarded two planes at the airstrip, Jones' armed guards, called the "Red Brigade," arrived on a tractor and trailer and began shooting at them.&lt;ref name="raven527"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gunmen killed Ryan and four others near a [[Guyana Airways]] [[Twin Otter]] aircraft.&lt;ref name="raven529"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=529–531}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, one of the supposed defectors, Larry Layton, drew a weapon and began firing on members of the party that had already boarded a small [[Cessna]].&lt;ref name="raven533"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=533}}&lt;/ref&gt; An NBC cameraman was able to capture footage of the first few seconds of the shooting at the Otter.&lt;ref name="raven529" /&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:BobBrownKaituma.jpg|thumb|300px|A camera-shot by Bob Brown (NBC) of Jones' "Red Brigade" shooting at the airstrip.]] --&gt;
The five killed at the airstrip were Ryan; NBC reporter [[Don Harris (journalist)|Don Harris]]; NBC cameraman Bob Brown; ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' photographer Greg Robinson; and Temple member Patricia Parks.&lt;ref name="raven529" /&gt; Surviving the attack were future Congresswoman [[Jackie Speier]], then a staff member for Ryan; Richard Dwyer, the [[Deputy Chief of Mission]] from the U.S. Embassy at Georgetown; Bob Flick, a producer for NBC; Steve Sung, an NBC sound engineer; Tim Reiterman, a ''San Francisco Examiner'' reporter; Ron Javers, a ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reporter; Charles Krause, a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporter; and several defecting Temple members.&lt;ref name="raven529" /&gt;

=== Mass murder in Jonestown ===
[[File:Jonestown Houses.jpg|thumb|300px|Houses in Jonestown, Guyana, 1979.]]

Later that same day, 909 inhabitants of Jonestown,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=690 ''Who Died?''], Alternative Considerations of Jonestown, San Diego State University&lt;/ref&gt; 304 of them children, died of apparent [[cyanide poisoning]], mostly in and around the settlement's main pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/18/newsid_2540000/2540209.stm ''1978: Mass suicide leaves 900 dead''.] BBC, November 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act until the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Rapaport, Richard, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/16/INGEM3070J1.DTL&amp;type=printable ''Jonestown and City Hall slayings eerily linked in time and memory''], San Francisco Chronicle, November 16, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI later recovered a 45-minute [[Death tape|audio recording of the suicide in progress]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Jones, [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=29079 "Transcript of Recovered FBI tape Q 42".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

On that tape, Jones tells Temple members that the Soviet Union, with whom the Temple had been negotiating a potential exodus for months, would not take them after the airstrip murders.&lt;ref name="tape" /&gt; The reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with his previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would "parachute in here on us", "shoot some of our innocent babies" and "they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors".&lt;ref name="tape" /&gt; Parroting Jones' prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to [[fascism]], one Temple member states "the ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies".&lt;ref name="tape" /&gt;

With that reasoning, Jones and several members argued that the group should commit "revolutionary suicide" by drinking [[cyanide]]-laced grape-flavored [[Flavor Aid]]. Later-released Temple films show Jones opening a storage container full of [[Kool-Aid]] in large quantities. However, empty packets of grape Flavor Aid found on the scene show that this is what was used to mix the solution, along with a [[sedative]].&lt;ref name="tape" /&gt; One member, Christine Miller, dissents toward the beginning of the tape.&lt;ref name="tape" /&gt;

When members apparently cried, Jones counseled, "Stop these hysterics. This is not the way for people who are socialists or communists to die. No way for us to die. We must die with some dignity."&lt;ref name="tape" /&gt; Jones can be heard saying, "Don't be afraid to die", that death is "just stepping over into another plane" and that it's "a friend".&lt;ref name="tape" /&gt; At the end of the tape, Jones concludes: "We didn't commit suicide; we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world."&lt;ref name="tape" /&gt;

According to escaping Temple members, children were given the drink first and families were told to lie down together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass suicide had been previously discussed in simulated events called "White Nights" on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="laytonaff"&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=13072 "Affidavit of Deborah Layton Blakey".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raven391"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=390–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; During at least one such prior White Night, members drank liquid that Jones falsely told them was poison.&lt;ref name="laytonaff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="raven391" /&gt;

== Death ==
Following the mass murder-suicide, Jones was found dead on the floor resting on a pillow near his deck chair,  with a gunshot wound to his head that Guyanese coroner Cyrill Mootoo stated was consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GuyanaInquest.pdf |title=Guyana Inquest&amp;nbsp;– Interviews of Cecil Roberts &amp; Cyril Mootoo |format=PDF |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was later dragged outside for examination and embalming. The official autopsy conducted in December 1978 also confirms his death as a suicide. Jones' son Stephan believes his father may have directed someone else to shoot him, but that is just speculation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonestown: Paradise Lost]], Interview of Stephan Jones, Documentary airing on Discovery Networks, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An [[autopsy]] of Jones' body also showed levels of the [[barbiturate]] [[Pentobarbital]] which may have been lethal to humans who had not developed [[physiological tolerance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/JimJones.pdf ''Autopsy of Jim Jones by Kenneth H. Mueller''], Jonestown Institute at SDSU&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexuality ==
Jones married Marceline Baldwin in 1949. He began his first affair in 1968 with a woman named Carolyn Layton. He also had many other mistresses during the 1970s; before the move to Jonestown and while in Jonestown. The book ''The Road to Jonestown'' by Jeff Guinn states: "Jones had occasional sex with male followers" but "never as often as he did with women." It states he was most likely bisexual, but his main physical and sexual attraction was definitely towards women.

On December 13, 1973, Jones was arrested and charged with lewd conduct, masturbating in a movie theater restroom  near [[MacArthur Park]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="wise"&gt;Wise, David. [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=17014 "Sex in Peoples Temple".] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University.&lt;/ref&gt; The decoy was an [[Undercover operation|undercover]] [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] [[Vice squad|vice officer]]. Jones is on record as later telling his followers that he was "the only true heterosexual", but at least one account exists of his sexual abuse of a male member of his congregation in front of the followers, ostensibly to prove the man's own homosexual tendencies.&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt;

While Jones banned sex among Temple members outside marriage, he voraciously engaged in sexual relations with both male and female Temple members.&lt;ref name="paranoia"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919897-1,00.html ''Paranoia And Delusions''], ''Time'', December 11, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones, however, claimed that he detested engaging in homosexual activity and did so only for the male temple adherents' own good, purportedly to connect them symbolically with him (Jones).&lt;ref name="paranoia" /&gt;

One of Jones' sources of inspiration was the [[International Peace Mission movement]] leader [[Father Divine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=35339 "FAQ: Who was the leader of Peoples Temple?"] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family aftermath ==

===Marceline===
On the final morning of Ryan's visit, Jones' wife Marceline took reporters on a tour of Jonestown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|pp=505–506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, she was found dead at the pavilion, having been poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surviving sons===
Stephan, Jim Jr., and Tim Jones did not take part in the mass suicide because they were playing with the Peoples Temple [[basketball]] team against the Guyanese national team in Georgetown.&lt;ref name="millennium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jim Jr."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=3047543&amp;lpos=spotlight&amp;lid=tab7pos2 |title=Outside the Lines: Grandson of Jonestown founder is making a name for himself |author=Fish, Jon and Chris Connelly |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of events in Jonestown, Stephan and Tim were both nineteen and Jim Jones Jr. was eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=37978 "Who Survived the Jonestown Tragedy?"] ''Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple''.

During the events at Jonestown, Stephan, Tim, and Jim Jones Jr. drove to the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown in an attempt to receive help. The Guyanese soldiers guarding the embassy refused to let them in after hearing about the shootings at the Port Kaituma airstrip.&lt;ref name="garysmith"&gt;Smith, Gary.

When Jonestown was first being established, Stephan had originally avoided two attempts by his father to relocate to the settlement. He eventually moved to Jonestown after a third and final attempt.

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Limnads''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|m|n|æ|d|z|,_|-|n|ə|d|z}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Λιμνάδες) or '''Limnatides''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Λιμνατιδες) or '''Leimenids''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|m|ɪ|n|ɪ|d|z}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Λειμενίδες) were a type of [[Naiad]].

*[[Bolbe]] (Βόλβη), nymph of a [[Thessalia]]n lake of the same name, also classed as an [[Oceanid]] due to her parentage (daughter of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]])
*Limnaee (Λιμναία), daughter of the [[India]]n river god [[Ganges]], one of the reputed mothers of [[Athis (mythology)|Athis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 5.47 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of encyclicals of Pope Pius XII'''. [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]] promulgated 41 papal [[encyclical]]s, during his reign as [[pope]] for over 19 years, from his election of March 2, 1939, until his death on October 9, 1958.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; The 41 encyclicals of Pius XII exceed the 32 encyclicals written by all his successors ([[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]], [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]], [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]]) during the fifty years that followed (1958–2008).

==Background ==
An encyclical (from [[Latin]] ''encyclia'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "en kyklo, {{lang|grc|ἐν κύκλῳ}}", meaning "general" or "encircling") was a [[Flyer (pamphlet)|circular]] letter sent to all the churches of a particular area in the ancient Christian church.  For the modern Roman Catholic Church, a Papal Encyclical, in the strictest sense, is a letter sent by the pope which is explicitly addressed to Roman Catholic [[bishop]]s of a particular area or to the world, usually treating some aspect of Catholic [[doctrine]].  A Papal Encyclical is generally used for significant issues, and is second in importance only to the highest-ranking document now issued by popes, an [[Apostolic Constitution]]. 

The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its [[incipit|first few words]].

==View of Pope Pius XII ==

[[Pope Pius XII]] held that papal encyclicals, even when they are not [[Papal infallibility|''ex cathedra'']], can nonetheless be sufficiently authoritative to end theological debate on a particular question: 
{{cquote| It is not to be thought that what is set down in Encyclical letters does not demand assent in itself, because in this the popes do not exercise the supreme power of their magisterium.  For these matters are taught by the ordinary magisterium, regarding which the following is pertinent: “He who heareth you, heareth Me.” (Luke 10:16); and usually what is set forth and inculcated in Encyclical Letters, already pertains to Catholic doctrine.  But if the Supreme Pontiffs in their acts, after due consideration, express an opinion on a hitherto controversial matter, it is clear to all that this matter, according to the mind and will of the same Pontiffs, cannot any longer be considered a question of free discussion among theologians.&lt;br&gt;
:&amp;mdash;''Humani Generis''}}

== The use of encyclicals by Pius XII ==

[[Encyclical]]s indicate high [[Papal]] [[:wikt:priority|priority]] for an issue at a given time.  Only pontiffs define when, and  under which circumstances encyclicals should be issued. They may choose to issue  an [[apostolic constitution]], [[Papal bull|bull]], encyclical, [[apostolic letter]] or give a papal [[speech]]. Pontiffs differ on the use of encyclicals. On the issue of [[birth control]] and [[contraception]], for example, [[Pope Pius XI]] issued the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'', while [[Pope Pius XII]] spoke to [[midwive]]s and the [[medical]] profession when he clarified his position on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Acta Apostolicae Sedis, (AAS) 1951, 835, AAS 1958, 90, AAS 1941, 40, AAS 1952, 258&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Paul VI]] published an encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' on the same topic. On matters of [[war]] and [[peace]], Pope Pius XII issued ten encyclicals, most of them after 1945, three of them (''[[Datis nuperrime]]'',  ''[[Sertum laetitiae]]'', and ''[[Luctuosissimi eventus]]'') protesting the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion and crackdown of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]] in 1956. [[Pope Paul VI]] spoke about the war in [[Vietnam]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], issued his protest against the war in [[Iraq]] in speeches. On social issues, [[Pope Leo XIII]] promulgated ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', followed by ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' by Pius XI, and ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' by [[John Paul II]]. Pius XII spoke on the same topic to a [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] in his Christmas messages and to numerous academic and professional associations.&lt;ref&gt;Allocution to the Cardinals AAS 1946, 141, and, AAS 1952, 5, AAS 1955, 15;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[magisterium]] of Pius XII is therefore significantly larger than the below listed 41 encyclicals. Most of the  detailed teachings are in his papal speeches on specific topics such as:

* Conscience, guilt and fair punishment,&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1955, 60,&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ethics of psychological research,&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1958, 268,&lt;/ref&gt;
* Farmers,&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1950, 251&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fashion Industry,&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1957&lt;/ref&gt; 1011,
* Formation of conscience,&lt;ref&gt;AA", 1952, 270&lt;/ref&gt;
* Genetic research,&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1953, 666&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human dignity,&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1951, 215&lt;/ref&gt;
* Medical doctors and the use of weapons,&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1954, 587&lt;/ref&gt;
* Military medical research,&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1953, 744&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list''' of [[mosque]]s that can accommodate at least 5,000 worshipers.

==Definition==
A mosque, or masjid, is a place of worship for followers of [[Islam]]. Mosques listed here are of any [[Islamic schools and branches|religious branch]] which regards themselves as Muslim.

==Measurements==
The default listing is alphabetical; to sort using different criteria, click on the desired column headers. Whilst claims are made about the relative size of mosques many of these claims are not easily substantiated. "Largest" is at best a vague term, which is often not qualified by claimants. Accepted measures of largeness could include area, volume, length, width, height, and/or capacity, although the last is far more subjective. It is important to note therefore that mosques may claim to be "the largest" based on only one of these measurements; and thus that there may be several mosques that have equal claim to be "the largest mosque". Since there is no official body governing these claims, there is no generally accepted criterion for being "the largest mosque".

'''Luis Buñuel Portolés''' ({{IPA-es|ˈlwis βuˈɲwel poɾtoˈles}}; 22 February 1900 – 29 July 1983) was a Spanish [[filmmaker]] who worked in Spain, Mexico and France.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kyrou|first=Ado|title=Luis Buñuel|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Luis-Bunuel|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Luis Buñuel died at age 83, his [[obituary]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him "an [[iconoclast]], moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of [[avant-garde]] [[surrealism]] in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Peter B.|title=Luis Buñuel Dies at 83; Filmmaker for 50 Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/30/obituaries/luis-bunuel-dies-at-83-film-maker-for-50-years.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=30 July 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first picture, ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]''—made in the [[silent film|silent era]]—was called "the most famous short film ever made" by critic [[Roger Ebert]],&lt;ref name=ebert&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Un Chien Andalou Movie Review (1928)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-un-chien-andalou-1928|work=Great Movies: The First 100|publisher=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=9 October 2017|date=16 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his last film, ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]''—made 48 years later—won him Best Director awards from the [[National Board of Review]] and the [[National Society of Film Critics]].&lt;ref name="Ramirez Berg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinfilm.org/essential-cinema/program-notes-that-obscure-object-of-desire |title=Program Notes: THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE |last=Berg |first=Charles Ramírez |publisher=Austin Film Society |accessdate=9 October 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610201718/http://www.austinfilm.org/essential-cinema/program-notes-that-obscure-object-of-desire |archivedate=10 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writer [[Octavio Paz]] called Buñuel's work "the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality...scandalous and subversive".&lt;ref name=paz&gt;{{cite book|last=Paz|first=Octavio|title=On Poets and Others|year=1986|publisher=Arcade Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55970-139-6|pages=152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoiEQ4FiuFsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often associated with the [[surrealist movement]] of the 1920s, Buñuel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. His work spans two continents, three languages, and an array of genres, including [[experimental film]], [[Documentary film|documentary]], [[Melodrama#Film|melodrama]], [[satire]], [[Musical film|musical]], [[Sex in film|erotica]], [[Comedy film|comedy]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[costume drama]]s, [[Fantasy film|fantasy]], [[crime film]], [[Adventure film|adventure]], and [[Western (genre)#Film|western]].  Despite this variety, filmmaker [[John Huston]] believed that, regardless of genre, a Buñuel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinyard|first=Neil|title="The Discreet Charm of Houston and Buñuel: Notes on a Cinematic Odd Couple", in John Huston: Essays on a Restless Director, ed.

==Early years==
[[File:Vista parcial de Calanda. Foto José Antonio Bielsa.JPG|thumb|right|Calanda, Spain|[[Calanda, Spain|Calanda]], Spain]]
Buñuel was born in [[Calanda, Spain|Calanda]], a small town in the [[Teruel (province)|province of Teruel]], in the [[Aragon]] region of Spain, to Leonardo Buñuel, the cultivated scion of an established Aragonese family, and María Portolés, many years younger than her husband, with wealth and family connections of her own.&lt;ref name=Alcala&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcalá|first=Manuel|title=Buñuel (Cine e ideologia)|year=1973|publisher=Edicusa|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-229-0101-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.16–17}} He would later describe his birthplace by saying that in Calanda, "the [[Middle Ages]] lasted until [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]".&lt;ref&gt;Buñuel, Luis. ''My Last Sigh''. Trans. Abigail Israel. Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|0-8166-4387-3}}. page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of seven children, Luis had two brothers, Alfonso and Leonardo, and four sisters: Alicia, Concepción, Margarita and María.&lt;ref name=schwarze&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwarze|first=Michael|title=Luis Buñuel|year=1988|publisher=Plaza &amp; Janes|location=Barcelona|isbn=978-84-01-45079-2|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Buñuel was four and a half months old, the family moved to [[Zaragoza]], where they were one of the wealthiest families in town.&lt;ref name=Alcala /&gt;{{rp|p.22}} In Zaragoza, Buñuel received a strict [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] education at the private Colegio del Salvador.&lt;ref name=Alcala /&gt;{{rp|pp.23–36}} After being kicked and insulted by the study hall proctor before a final exam, Buñuel refused to return to the school.&lt;ref name="directors guide" /&gt;  He told his mother he had been expelled, which was not true; in fact, he had received the highest marks on his world history exam.&lt;ref&gt;Buñuel, Luis. ''My Last Sigh''. Trans. Abigail Israel. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8166-4387-3}}. page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Buñuel finished the last two years of his high school education at the local public school.&lt;ref name="directors guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Luis Bunuel|url=http://www.greatestdirectors.com/buneul.html|website=The Directors Guide|publisher=Website Creations|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even as a child, Buñuel was something of a cinematic showman; friends from that period described productions in which Buñuel would project shadows on a screen using a [[magic lantern]] and a bedsheet.&lt;ref name="A Proposito de Bunuel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gobierno de Aragon|title=A Proposito de Bunuel – Screenplay|url=http://www.american-buddha.com/bunuel.screenplay.htm|accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also excelled at boxing and playing the violin.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt;

[[File:Salvador Dalí 1939.jpg|thumb|left|[[Salvador Dalí]]]]

In his youth, Buñuel was deeply religious, serving at Mass and taking Communion every day, until, at the age of 16, he grew disgusted with what he perceived as the illogicality of the Church, along with its power and wealth.&lt;ref name=brandon&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandon|first=Ruth|title=Surreal Lives: The Surrealists 1917–1945|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0-8021-3727-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9_Z0rVDhNGsC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=bunuel+agronomy#v=onepage&amp;q=bunuel%20agronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.292}}

In 1917, he attended the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]], first studying [[agronomy]] then [[industrial engineering]] and finally switching to [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="smith celebrities"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Warren Allen|title=Celebrities in Hell|year=2002|publisher=Barricade Books|location=Fort Lee, NJ|isbn=978-1-56980-214-4|pages=25|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x73FqQgvzgQC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=luis+bunuel+agronomy#v=onepage&amp;q=luis%20bunuel%20agronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed a very close relationship with painter [[Salvador Dalí]] and poet [[Federico García Lorca]], among other important Spanish creative artists living in the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]], with the three friends forming the nucleus of the Spanish Surrealist [[avant-garde]],&lt;ref name=delgado&gt;{{cite book|last=Delgado|first=Manuel and Alice J.

Although we seemed to have little in common—I was a redneck from Aragon, and he an elegant Andalusian—we spent most of our time together... We used to sit on the grass in the evenings behind the Residencia (at that time, there were vast open spaces reaching to the horizon), and he would read me his poems. He read slowly and beautifully, and through him I began to discover a wholly new world."&lt;ref name="my last sigh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buñuel|first=Luis|title=My last sigh|year=1983|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-52854-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.62}} Buñuel's relationship with Dalí was somewhat more troubled, being tinged with jealousy over the growing intimacy between Dalí and Lorca and resentment over Dalí's early success as an artist.&lt;ref name=brandon /&gt;{{rp|p.300}}

[[File:Lorca (1914).jpg|thumb|right|[[Federico García Lorca]]]]

Since he was 17, he steadily dated the future poet and dramatist [[Concha Méndez]], with whom he vacationed every summer at [[San Sebastián]]. He introduced her to his friends at the Residencia as his fiancée.&lt;ref name=bellver&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellver|first=Catherine Gullo|title=Absence and Presence: Spanish Women Poets of the Twenties and Thirties|year=2001|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg, PA|isbn=978-0-8387-5463-4|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=John Chapman|title=Women Poets of Spain, 1860–1990: Toward a Gynocentric Vision|year=1997|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago| isbn=978-0-252-06559-0|pages=125|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i8RlmBiUl68C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=concha+mendez+bunuel#v=onepage&amp;q=concha%20mendez%20bunuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;   After five years, she broke off the relationship, citing Buñuel's "insufferable character".&lt;ref name=agonia.net&gt;{{cite web|title=Biografia Concha Mendez Cuesta|url=http://portugues.agonia.net/index.php/author/0028634/index.html|publisher=Agonia.Net|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his student years, Buñuel became an accomplished hypnotist. He claimed that once, while calming a hysterical prostitute through [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] suggestion, he inadvertently put one of the several bystanders into a trance as well.&lt;ref name="my last sigh" /&gt;{{rp|p.67}} He was often to insist that watching movies was a form of hypnosis:  "This kind of cinematographic hypnosis is no doubt due to the darkness of the theatre and to the rapidly changing scenes, lights, and camera movements, which weaken the spectator's critical intelligence and exercise over him a kind of fascination."&lt;ref name="my last sigh" /&gt;{{rp|p.69}}

Buñuel's interest in films was intensified by a viewing of [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Destiny (1921 film)|Der müde Tod]]'': "I came out of the [[Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier|Vieux Colombier]] [theater] completely transformed. Images could and did become for me the true means of expression.

==Career==

===Early French period  (1925–1930)===
[[File:Jean epstein 1920.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jean Epstein]], Buñuel's first film collaborator]]
In 1925 Buñuel moved to Paris, where he began work as a secretary in an organization called the International Society of Intellectual Cooperation.&lt;ref name="bfi vol 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Paul|title="L'Age d'Or" in British Film Institute Film Classics, Volume 3|year=2003|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-1-57958-328-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V96tee1l2q8C&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=bunuel+intellectual+cooperation#v=onepage&amp;q=bunuel%20intellectual%20cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.124}} He also became actively involved in cinema and theater, going to the movies as often as three times a day.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Alan Larson|title=Republic of Images: A History of French Filmmaking|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-674-76267-1|pages=152|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ESVZOghoi6kC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=jean+epstein+luis+bunuel#v=onepage&amp;q=jean%20epstein%20luis%20bunuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these interests, he met a number of influential people, including the pianist [[Ricardo Viñes]], who was instrumental in securing Buñuel's selection as artistic director of the Dutch premiere of [[Manuel de Falla]]'s puppet-opera ''[[El retablo de maese Pedro]]'' in 1926.&lt;ref name=talens&gt;{{cite book|last=Taléns|first=Jenaro|title=The Branded Eye: Buñuel's Un Chien Andalou|year=1993|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8166-2046-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5209-5Ai_ZwC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=bunuel+abel+gance#v=onepage&amp;q=bunuel%20abel%20gance}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.29}}

He decided to enter the film industry and enrolled in a private film school run by [[Jean Epstein]] and some associates.&lt;ref name=williams /&gt;  At that time, Epstein was one of the most celebrated commercial directors working in France, his films being hailed as "the triumph of [[impressionism]] in motion, but also the triumph of the modern spirit".&lt;ref name=sadoul&gt;{{cite book|last=Sadoul|first=Georges|title=Dictionary of Film Makers|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-02151-8|pages=77|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PvsZikRu-hAC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=jean+epstein+reputation#v=onepage&amp;q=jean%20epstein%20reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Before long, Buñuel was working for Epstein as an assistant director on ''[[Mauprat (film)|Mauprat]]'' (1926) and ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher (1928 French film)|La chute de la maison Usher]]'' (1928),&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Gwynne|title=A Companion to Luís Buñuel|year=2005|publisher=Tamesis|location=Woodbridge|isbn=978-1-85566-108-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r5_VlQTnbD0C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=bunuel+epstein#v=onepage&amp;q=bunuel%20baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also for [[Mario Nalpas]] on ''La Sirène des Tropiques'' (1927), starring [[Josephine Baker]].&lt;ref name=fandor&gt;{{cite web|title=Siren of the Tropics|url=http://www.fandor.com/films/siren_of_the_tropics|website=fandor|publisher=Our Film Festival, Inc.|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He appeared on screen in a small part as a smuggler in [[Jacques Feyder]]'s ''[[Carmen (1926 film)|Carmen]]'' (1926).&lt;ref name="brain juice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Luis Buñuel|url=http://www.brain-juice.com/cgi-bin/show_bio.cgi?p_id=136|website=brain-juice|publisher=Brain-Juice.Com, Inc.|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Buñuel somewhat derisively refused to acquiesce to Epstein's demand that he assist Epstein's mentor, [[Abel Gance]], who was at the time working on the film ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'', Epstein dismissed him angrily, saying "How can a little asshole like you dare to talk that way about a great director like Gance?"&lt;ref name=talens /&gt;{{rp|p.30}} then added "You seem rather surrealist.

After parting with Epstein, Buñuel worked as film critic for ''La Gaceta Literaria'' (1927) and ''Les Cahiers d'Art'' (1928).&lt;ref name=talens /&gt;{{rp|p.30}} In the periodicals ''L'Amic de les Arts'' and ''La gaseta de les Arts'', he and Dalí carried on a series of "call and response" essays on cinema and theater, debating such technical issues as segmentation, [[Cut-up technique|découpage]], "photogenia" (founded on the [[Insert (filmmaking)|insert shot]]) and [[Film editing|rhythmic editing]].&lt;ref name="dali collected writings"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalí|first=Salvador|title=The Collected Writings of Salvador Dalí|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-56027-6|url=http://www.paolocirio.net/work/amazon-noir/amazon-noir-books/AMAZON-NOIR--The_Collected_Writings_of_Salvador_Dal%C3%AD--By--Salvador_Dali_Haim_N_Finkelstein--0521560276.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also collaborated with the celebrated writer [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]] on the script for what he hoped would be his first film, "a story in six scenes" called ''Los caprichos''.&lt;ref name=talens /&gt;{{rp|pp.30–31}}  Through his involvement with ''Gaceta Literaria'', he helped establish Madrid's first cine-club and served as its inaugural chairman.&lt;ref name="gomez mesa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gómez Mesa|first=Luis.|title=La generación cinematográfica del '27|journal=Cinema 2002|year=1978|issue= 37|pages=52–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that he met his future wife, Jeanne Rucar Lefebvre,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lille]], 29 February 1908 [http://www.redaragon.com/trebede/feb2000/articulo2.asp] – [[Mexico City]], 4 November 1994 [http://elpais.com/diario/1994/11/07/agenda/784162802_850215.html]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[gymnastics]] teacher who had won an Olympic bronze medal.

The script was written in six days at Dalí's home in [[Cadaqués]]. In a letter to a friend written in February 1929, Buñuel described the writing process: "We had to look for the plot line.

Although ''Un Chien Andalou'' is a [[silent film]], during the original screening (attended by the elite of the Parisian art world),  Buñuel played a sequence of phonograph records which he switched manually while keeping his pockets full of stones with which to pelt anticipated hecklers.&lt;ref name="maverick arts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Un Chien Andalou|url=http://www.maverick-arts.com/cgi-bin/MAVERICK?&amp;issue=340|publisher=Maverick Arts Magazine|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the premiere, Buñuel and Dalí were granted formal admittance to the tight-knit community of Surrealists, led by poet [[André Breton]].&lt;ref name=hoberman /&gt;

====''L'Age d'Or'' (1930)====
Late in 1929, on the strength of ''Un Chien Andalou'', Buñuel and Dalí were commissioned to make another short film by [[Marie-Laure de Noailles|Marie-Laurie]] and [[Charles de Noailles]], owners of a private cinema on the [[Place des États-Unis]] and financial supporters of productions by Jacques Manuel, [[Man Ray]] and [[Pierre Chenal]].&lt;ref name="bfi vol 3" /&gt;{{rp|p.124}}  At first, the intent was that the new film be around the same length as ''Un Chien'', only this time with sound. But by mid-1930, the film had grown segmentally to an hour's duration.&lt;ref name="bfi vol 3" /&gt;{{rp|p.116}} Anxious that it was over twice as long as planned and at double the budget, Buñuel offered to trim the film and cease production, but Noailles gave him the go-ahead to continue the project.&lt;ref name="bfi vol 3" /&gt;{{rp|p.116}}

The film, entitled ''[[L'Age d'Or]]'', was begun as a second collaboration with Dalí, but, while working on the scenario, the two had a falling out;  Buñuel, who at the time had strong leftist sympathies,&lt;ref name=gubern&gt;{{cite book|last=Gubern|first=Román and Paul Hammond|title=Luis Bunuel: The Red Years, 1929–1939|year=2012|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=978-0-299-28474-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=elueEkeLL_oC&amp;pg=PA427&amp;lpg=PA427&amp;dq=bunuel+espana+1936#v=onepage&amp;q=bunuel%20espana%201936}}&lt;/ref&gt; desired a deliberate undermining of all bourgeois institutions, while Dalí, who eventually supported the Spanish nationalist dictator [[Francisco Franco]] and various figures of the European aristocracy, wanted merely to cause a scandal through the use of various [[Scatology|scatological]] and anti-Catholic images.&lt;ref name="film reference"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marxism – European Cinema Before and After World War II|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Independent-Film-Road-Movies/Marxism-EUROPEAN-CINEMA-BEFORE-AND-AFTER-WORLD-WAR-II.html|website=film reference|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The friction between them was exacerbated when, at a dinner party in Cadaqués, Buñuel tried to throttle Dalí's girlfriend, [[Gala Dalí|Gala]], the wife of Surrealist poet [[Paul Éluard]].&lt;ref name=thurlow&gt;{{cite book|last=Thurlow|first=Clifford|title=Making Short Films: The Complete Guide from Script to Screen, 2nd ed|year=2008|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84520-803-5|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HX8XcfTw6KIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In consequence, Dalí had nothing to do with the actual shooting of the film.&lt;ref name=dali&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalí|first=Salvador|title=The Secret Life of Salvador Dali|year=1942|publisher=Dial Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.276–277}}   During the course of production, Buñuel worked around his technical ignorance by filming mostly in sequence and using nearly every foot of film that he shot. Buñuel invited friends and acquaintances to appear, gratis, in the film; for example, anyone who owned a tuxedo or a party frock got a part in the salon scene.&lt;ref name="bfi vol 3" /&gt;{{rp|p.116}}

* In his 1982 autobiography ''Mon Dernier soupir'' (''My Last Sigh'', 1983, ''My Last Breath'', 1994), Buñuel wrote that at the request of director [[Robert Florey]], he submitted a treatment of a scene about a disembodied hand, which was later included in the movie ''[[The Beast with Five Fingers]]'' (1946), starring [[Peter Lorre]], without acknowledgement of Buñuel's contribution or payment of any compensation.&lt;ref name="my last sigh" /&gt;{{rp|p.189}}  However, Brian Taves, film scholar and archivist with the [[Library of Congress]], has challenged the truth of this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taves|first=Brian|title=Whose Hand?

With the husband/wife team of Janet and [[Luis Alcoriza]], he wrote the scenario for ''Si usted no puede, yo sí'', which was filmed in 1950 by [[Julián Soler]].&lt;ref name=baxter /&gt;{{rp|p.203}} He also continued developing the idea for a surrealistic film called ''Ilegible, hijo de flauta'', with the poet [[Juan Larrea (poet)|Juan Larrea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurney|first=Robert|title="Juan Larrea and the Film Buñuel Did Not Make", in Companion to Spanish Surrealism, ed.

During this period, Dancigers was busy producing films for the actor/director [[Fernando Soler]], one of the most durable of Mexican film personalities, having been referred to as the "national paterfamilias".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stock|first=Ann Marie|title=Framing Latin American Cinema: Contemporary Critical Perspectives|year=1997|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8166-2972-5|pages=213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VFTpFmrV5cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although Soler typically preferred to direct his own films, for their latest collaboration, ''[[El Gran Calavera]]'', based on a play by Adolfo Torrado, he decided that doing both jobs would be too much trouble, so he asked Dancigers to find someone who could be trusted to handle the technical aspects of the directorial duties.&lt;ref name="cine mexicano"&gt;{{cite web|title=El gran calavera (1949)|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/peliculas/gran_calavera.html|website=Más de Cien Años de Cine Mexicano|publisher=Cine Club – Cine Mexicano|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buñuel welcomed the opportunity, stating that: "I amused myself with the montage, the constructions, the angles... All of that interested me because I was still an apprentice in so-called 'normal' cinema."&lt;ref name="cine mexicano" /&gt;  As a result of his work on this film, he developed a technique for making films cheaply and quickly by limiting them to 125 shots.&lt;ref name=schreiber /&gt;{{rp|p.73}} ''El Gran Calavera'' was completed in 16 days at a cost of 400,000 pesos (approximately $46,000 US at 1948 exchange rates).&lt;ref name=acevedo-munoz /&gt;{{rp|p.52}}  The picture has been described as "a hilarious screwball send-up of the Mexican [[nouveau riche]]... a wild roller coaster of mistaken identity, sham marriages and misfired suicides",&lt;ref name ="Harvard.edu" /&gt; and it was a big hit at the box office in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dent|first=David W.|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Mexico|year=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham MD|isbn=978-0-8108-4291-5|pages=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkiJlXXbAy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the picture was re-made by Mexican director Gary Alazraki under the title ''[[The Noble Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de las Carreras|first1=María Elena|title=El gran calavera (The Great Madcap, 1949), directed by Luis Buñuel|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/sites/default/files/files/GranCalavera_EssayDeLasCarreras.pdf|publisher=The Los Angeles Conservancy|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1949, Buñuel renounced his Spanish citizenship to become a naturalized Mexican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulver|first=Andrew|title=A short history of Spanish cinema|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/mar/29/short-history-spanish-cinema|work=newEurope|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=1 September 2012|location=London|date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commercial success of ''El Gran Calavera'' enabled Buñuel to redeem a promise he had extracted from Dancigers, which was that if Buñuel could deliver a money-maker, Dancigers would guarantee "a degree of freedom" on the next film project.&lt;ref name=Doniol-Valcroze /&gt;  Knowing that Dancigers was uncomfortable with experimentalism, especially when it might affect the bottom line, Buñuel proposed a commercial project titled ''¡Mi huerfanito jefe!'', about a juvenile street vendor who can't sell his final lottery ticket, which ends up being the winner and making him rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los olvidados (1950)|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/peliculas/olvidados.html|website=Las 100 mejores películas del cine mexicano: 2|publisher=Cine Club – Cine Mexicano|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dancigers was open to the idea, but instead of a "''[[feuilleton]]''", he suggested making "something rather more serious".&lt;ref name="ibanez and palacio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibañez|first=Juan Carlos and Manuel Palacio|title="Los Olvidados/The Young and the Damned", in The Cinema of Latin America, ed.

Buñuel remained in Mexico for the rest of his life, although he spent periods of time filming in France and Spain. In Mexico, he filmed 21 films during an 18-year period.  For many critics, although there were occasional widely acknowledged masterpieces like ''Los olvidados'' and [[Él (film)|''Él'']] (1953), the majority of his output consisted of generic fare which was adapted to the norms of the national film industry, frequently adopting melodramatic conventions that appealed to local tastes.&lt;ref name=lim&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Dennis|title=Mexican-era Luis Buñuel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/08/entertainment/ca-secondlook8|accessdate=20 September 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other commentators, however, have written of the deceptive complexity and intensity of many of these films, arguing that, collectively, they, "bring a philosophical depth and power to his cinema, together offering a sustained meditation on ideas of religion, class inequity, violence and desire."&lt;ref name ="Harvard.edu" /&gt; Although Buñuel usually had little choice regarding the selection of these projects,&lt;ref name=Delmas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delmas|first1=Jean|title=Buñuel, Citizen of Mexico|journal=Jeune Cinema|date=February 1966|issue= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; they often deal with themes that were central to his lifelong concerns:&lt;ref name=adler&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adler|first1=Renata|title=Screen: Bunuel's Relentless 'Nazarin':Film Set in the Mexico of Porfirio Diaz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E1D7163AE134BC4951DFB0668383679EDE|accessdate=27 September 2014|work=New York Times|agency=The New York Times Company|date=21 June 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As busy as he was during the 1950s and early 1960s, there were still many film projects that Buñuel had to abandon due to lack of financing or studio support, including a cherished plan to film Mexican novelist [[Juan Rulfo]]'s ''[[Pedro Páramo]]'', of which he said how much he enjoyed "the crossing from the mysterious to the real, almost without transition.  I really like this mixture of reality and fantasy,  but I don't know how to bring it to the screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poniatowska|first=Elena|title=Palabras cruzadas|year=1961|publisher=Ediciones Era|location=Mexico City|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other unrealized projects during his lifetime included adaptations of [[André Gide]]'s ''Les caves du Vatican''; [[Benito Pérez Galdós]]'s ''[[Fortunata y Jacinta]]'', ''[[Doña Perfecta]]'', and ''Ángel Guerra''; [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[The Loved One]]''; [[William Golding]]'s ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''; [[Dalton Trumbo]]'s ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]''; [[J.

====Mexico and beyond: return to international filmmaking (1954–1960)====
[[File:S.Kragujevic, Gérard Philipe 1955.JPG|thumb|175px|[[Gérard Philipe]], popular French star of Buñuel's ''[[La Fièvre Monte à El Pao]]''. At one point during the filming, Buñuel asked Philipe, who was visibly dying of cancer, why the actor was making this film, and Philipe responded by asking the director the same question, to which both said they didn't know.&lt;ref name=hagopian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hagopian|first1=Kevin|title=Fever Mounts in El Pao|url=http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/filmnotes/fnf02n11.html|website=New York State Writers Institute|publisher=Writers Institute|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As much as he welcomed steady employment in the Mexican film industry, Buñuel was quick to seize opportunities to re-emerge onto the international film scene and to engage with themes that were not necessarily focused on Mexican preoccupations.&lt;ref name=acevedo-munoz /&gt;{{rp|p.144}}  His first chance came in 1954, when Dancigers partnered with Henry F. Ehrlich, of [[United Artists]], to co-produce a film version of [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', using a script developed by the Canadian writer [[Hugo Butler]].  The film was produced by George Pepper, the former executive secretary of the Hollywood Democratic Committee.  Both Butler and Pepper were emigres from Hollywood who had run afoul of authorities seeking out communists.&lt;ref name=schreiber /&gt;{{rp|p.75}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsdefrance.com/review/the-young-one-1960.html|title=Review of the film The Young One (1960)|first=James|last=Travers|date=27 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result, ''[[Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'', was Buñuel's first color film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-adventures-of-robinson-crusoe|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buñuel was given much more time than usual for the filming (three months), which was accomplished on location in Manzanillo, a Pacific seaport with a lush jungle interior, and was shot simultaneously in English and Spanish.&lt;ref name="axmaker robinson crusoe"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Axmaker|first1=Sean|title=Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1954)|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/66823/Adventures-of-Robinson-Crusoe/articles.html|website=Turner Classic Movies|publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the film was released in the United States, its young star [[Dan O'Herlihy]] used his own money to fund a Los Angeles run for the film and gave free admission to all members of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], who in turn rewarded the little-known actor with his only [[Oscar award|Oscar]] nomination.&lt;ref name="axmaker robinson crusoe" /&gt;

In the mid-1950s, Buñuel got the chance to work again in France on international co-productions.  The result was what critic [[Raymond Durgnat]] has called the director's "revolutionary triptych", in that each of the three films is "openly, or by implication, a study in the morality and tactics of armed revolution against a right-wing dictatorship."&lt;ref name=durgnat /&gt;{{rp|p.100}}  The first, ''[[Cela s'appelle l'aurore]]'' (Franco-Italian, 1956) required Buñuel and the [['Pataphysics|"pataphysical"]] writer [[Jean Ferry]] to adapt a novel by [[Emmanuel Roblès]] after the celebrated writer [[Jean Genet]] failed to deliver a script after having been paid in full.&lt;ref name=aranda /&gt;{{rp|p.100}}  The second film was [[Death in the Garden|''La Mort en ce jardin'']] (Franco-Mexican, 1956), which was adapted by Buñuel and his frequent collaborator [[Luis Alcoriza]] from a novel by the Belgian writer [[José-André Lacour]].  The final part of the "triptych" was ''[[La Fièvre Monte à El Pao]]'' (Franco-Mexican, 1959), the last film of the popular French star [[Gérard Philipe]], who died in the final stages of the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Canby|first1=Vincent|title=Film: From Bunuel, 'Los Ambiciosos,' at the Public|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/12/movies/film-from-bunuel-los-ambiciosos-at-the-public.html|accessdate=30 September 2014|agency=New York Times|date=12 February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buñuel was later to explain that he was so strapped for cash that he, "took everything that was offered to me, as long as it wasn't humiliating."&lt;ref name=hagopian /&gt;

In 1960, Buñuel re-teamed with scenarist Hugo Butler and organizer George Pepper, allegedly his favorite producer,  to make his second English-language film, a US/Mexico co-production called ''[[The Young One]]'', based on a short story by writer and former CIA-agent [[Peter Matthiessen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=hZuzxKQfhYUC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=george+pepper+Buñuel#v=onepage&amp;q=pepper | title=My Last Sigh: The Autobiography of Luis Bunuel| isbn=9780345803719| last1=Bunuel| first1=Luis| date=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This film has been called "a surprisingly uncompromising study of racism and sexual desire, set on a remote island in the Deep South"&lt;ref name ="Harvard.edu" /&gt; and has been described by critic Ed Gonzalez as, "salacious enough to make [[Elia Kazan]]'s [[Baby Doll]] and [[Louis Malle|Luis Malle's]] [[Pretty Baby (1978 film)|''Pretty Baby'']] blush."&lt;ref name="The Young One 4 out of 4"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=The Young One 4 out of 4|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-young-one|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the film won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival for its treatment of racial discrimination,&lt;ref name=bentley /&gt;{{rp|p.151}} the US critics were so hostile upon its release that Buñuel was later to say that, "a Harlem newspaper even wrote that I should be hung upside down from a lamppost on Fifth Avenue....I made this film with love, but it never had a chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=The Young One: Buñuel's Neglected Masterpiece|url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2009/07/22909/|website=jonathanrosenbaum.net|accessdate=30 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084401/http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2009/07/22909/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of film historian Peter Harcourt: "if ''The Young One'' must still be considered a 'bad' film by conventional standards, then it is one of the most subtle, most challenging and most distinguished bad films ever made."&lt;ref name="peter harcourt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harcourt|first1=Peter|title=Luis Buñuel: Spaniard and Surrealist|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1967|volume=20|issue=3|page=12|url=http://www.austinlibrary.com:2138/stable/pdfplus/1210106.pdf?acceptTC=true&amp;jpdConfirm=true|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late international period (1961–1977)===
[[File:Silvia Pinal (1970).jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Silvia Pinal]] starred in ''Viridiana'' (1961). She was re-united with Buñuel again, starring in ''El ángel exterminador'' (1962) and in ''Simón del desierto'' (1964). Pinal is pictured here in 1970.]]

At the 1960 Cannes Festival, Buñuel was approached by the young director [[Carlos Saura]], whose film [[The Delinquents (1960 film)|''Los Golfos'']] had been entered officially to represent Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los Golfos|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3299/year/1960.html|publisher=Festival de Cannes|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years earlier, Saura had partnered with [[Juan Antonio Bardem]] and [[Luis García Berlanga]] to form a production company called UNINCI,&lt;ref name="andrew whittaker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whittaker|first1=Andrew|title=Speak the Culture: Spain: Be Fluent in Spanish Life and Culture|date=2008|publisher=Thorogood Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1854186058|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rZS8SWMroUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the group was keen to get Buñuel to make a new film in his native country as part of their overall goal of creating a uniquely Spanish brand of cinema.&lt;ref name=aranda /&gt;{{rp|p.190–91}} At the same time, Mexican actress [[Silvia Pinal]] was eager to work with Buñuel and talked her producer-husband [[Gustavo Alatriste]] into providing additional funding for the project with the understanding that the director, who Pinal described as "a man worshiped and idolized", would be given "absolute freedom" in carrying out the work.&lt;ref name="agustin de gracia"&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Gracia|first1=Agustín|title=Recuerdan a Luis Buñuel a 30 años de su fallecimiento|url=http://www.laopinion.com/entretenimientocine/article/20130731/Recuerdan-a-Luis-Bunuel-a-30-anos-de-su-fallecimiento&amp;template=print|accessdate=4 October 2014|work=laopinion.com|date=31 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006094142/http://www.laopinion.com/entretenimientocine/article/20130731/Recuerdan-a-Luis-Bunuel-a-30-anos-de-su-fallecimiento%26template%3Dprint|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Buñuel agreed to work again in Spain when further support was provided by producer [[Pere Portabella]]'s company ''Film 59''.&lt;ref name="pere portabella"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pere Portabella|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/films/556|website=Film Exhibitions|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buñuel and his co-scenarist [[Julio Alejandro]] drafted a preliminary screenplay for ''[[Viridiana]]'', which critic [[Andrew Sarris]] has described as incorporating "a plot which is almost too lurid to synopsize even in these enlightened times",&lt;ref name="sarris viridiana"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarris|first1=Andrew|title=The Devil and the Nun|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/film/movie/contents/the_devil_and_the_nun_sarris.pdf|website=warwick.ac.uk|publisher=University of Warwick|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with rape, incest, hints of necrophilia, animal cruelty and sacrilege, and dutifully submitted it to the Spanish censor, who, to the surprise of nearly everyone, approved it after requesting only minor modifications and one significant change to the ending.&lt;ref name="d'lugo films of carlos saura"&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Lugo|first1=Marvin|title=The Films of Carlos Saura: The Practice of Seeing|date=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-03142-2|pages=42–43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUAks4YGLWAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Buñuel accommodated the censor's demands, he came up with a final scene that was even more provocative than the scene it replaced: "even more immoral", as Buñuel was later to observe.&lt;ref name="ebert viridiana"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Viridiana|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-viridiana-1961|website=The Great Movies|publisher=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Buñuel had more than adequate resources, top-flight technical and artistic crews, and experienced actors, filming of ''Viridiana'' (which took place on location and at Bardem's studios in Madrid) went smoothly and quickly.&lt;ref name=Pavlovi&gt;{{cite book|last=Pavlović|first=Tatjana|title=100 Years of Spanish Cinema|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4051-8419-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtFXpxyWMi4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 98}}

Buñuel submitted a cutting copy to the censors and then arranged for his son, Juan Luis, to smuggle the negatives to Paris for the final editing and mixing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viridiana.50|url=http://www.viridiana50.com/uninci.php|website=viridiana50.com|publisher=Ministerio de Cultura de España|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensuring that the authorities would not have an opportunity to view the finished product before its planned submission as Spain's official entry to the 1961 Cannes Festival.&lt;ref name=buache&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buache|first1=Freddy|title=The Cinema of Luis Buñuel|date=1973|publisher=Tantivy Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-498-01302-7|pages=117–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's director general of cinematography José Munoz-Fontan presented the film on the last day of the festival and then, on the urging of Portabella and Bardem, appeared in person to accept the top prize, the [[Palme d'Or]], which the film shared with the French entry ''[[Une aussi longue absence]]'', directed by [[Henri Colpi]].&lt;ref name="buache french edition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buache|first1=Freddy|title=Buñuel|date=1975|publisher=L'Age d'Homme| location=Lausanne| isbn=9782825133415| page=119| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuo1JTpoxQAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, ''[[l'Osservatore Romano]]'', the Vatican's official organ, denounced the film as an insult not only to Catholicism but to Christianity in general.&lt;ref name=malcolm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malcolm|first1=Derek|title=Luis Buñuel: Viridiana|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/apr/01/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm|accessdate=5 October 2014|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=1 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequences to nearly all concerned were swift: Munoz-Fontan was cashiered from his government post,&lt;ref name="buache french edition" /&gt; the film was banned in Spain for the next 17 years, all mention of it in the press was prohibited, and the two Spanish production companies UNINCI and ''Film 59'' were disbanded.&lt;ref name="d'lugo films of carlos saura" /&gt;

Buñuel went on to make two more films in Mexico with Pinal and Alatriste, ''[[El ángel exterminador]]'' (1962) and ''[[Simón del desierto]]'' (1965)— along with ''Viridiana'', they form the so-called "Buñuelian trilogy" — and was later to say that Alatriste had been the one producer who gave him the most freedom in creative expression.&lt;ref name="Rowman &amp; Littlefield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alfaro|first1=Eduardo de la Vega|title="The Decline of the Golden Age and the Making of the Crisis," in Mexico's Cinema: A Century of Film and Filmmakers, edited by Joanne Hershfield and David R.

In 1963, actor [[Fernando Rey]], one of the stars of ''Viridiana'', introduced Buñuel to producer [[Serge Silberman]], a Polish entrepreneur who had fled to Paris when his family died in the Holocaust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serge Silberman, productor de Luis Buñuel y de Akira Kurosawa|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2003/07/25/agenda/1059084008_850215.html|accessdate=13 October 2014|work=El Pais|agency=http://elpais.com/|date=25 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had worked with several renowned French directors, including [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], [[Jacques Becker]], [[Marcel Camus]] and [[Christian-Jaque]].&lt;ref name="ronald bergan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bergan|first1=Ronald|title=Serge Silberman:  Flamboyant film producer prepared to go out on a limb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/28/guardianobituaries.filmnews|accessdate=13 October 2014|work=The Guardian,|agency=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=27 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silberman proposed that the two make an adaptation of [[Octave Mirbeau]]'s [[The Diary of a Chambermaid (novel)|''Journal d'une femme de chambre'']], which Buñuel had read several times.&lt;ref name="gonzalez chambermaid"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=The Diary of a Chambermaid|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-diary-of-a-chambermaid|website=Slant Magazine.|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buñuel wanted to do the filming in Mexico with Pinal, but Silberman insisted it be done in France.&lt;ref name="gonzalez chambermaid" /&gt;

Pinal was so determined to work again with Buñuel that she was ready to move to France, learn the language and even work for nothing in order to get the part of [[Célestine (Mirbeau)|Célestine]], the title character.&lt;ref name="rivera pinal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rivera J.|first1=Héctor|title=Las experiencias de Silvia Pinal con Buñuel y Gustavo Alatriste|journal=Proceso|date=13 July 1997|issue=n1080|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silberman, however, wanted French actress [[Jeanne Moreau]] to play the role, so he put Pinal off by telling her that Moreau, too, was willing to act with no fee. Ultimately, Silberman got his way, leaving Pinal so disappointed that she was later to claim that Alatriste's failure to help her secure this part led to the breakup of their marriage.&lt;ref name="rivera pinal" /&gt; When Buñuel requested a French-speaking writer with whom to collaborate on the screenplay, Silberman suggested the 32-year-old [[Jean-Claude Carrière]], an actor whose previous screenwriting credits included only a few films for the comic star/director [[Pierre Étaix]], but once Buñuel learned that Carrière was the scion of a wine-growing family, the newcomer was hired on the spot.&lt;ref name="ronald bergan" /&gt; At first, Carrière found it difficult to work with Buñuel, because the young man was so deferential to the famous director that he never challenged any of Buñuel's ideas, until, at Buñuel's covert insistence, Silberman told Carrière to stand up to Buñuel now and then; as Carrière was later to say: "In a way, Buñuel needed an opponent.

This was the second attempt to film Mirbeau's novel, the first being [[The Diary of a Chambermaid (1946 film)|a 1946 Hollywood production]] directed by [[Jean Renoir]], which Buñuel refused to view for fear of being influenced by the famous French director, whom he venerated.&lt;ref name="david kalat"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=Diary of a Chambermaid|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/474221%7C474228/Diary-of-a-Chambermaid.html|website=Turner Classic Movies|publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buñuel's version, while admired by many, has often been compared unfavorably to Renoir's, with a number of critics claiming that Renoir's ''Diary'' fits better in Renoir's overall ''oeuvre'', while Buñuel's ''Diary'' is not sufficiently "Buñuelian".&lt;ref name="Geoffrey T.

The 1970 film ''[[Tristana (film)|Tristana]]'' is a film about a young woman who is seduced and manipulated by her guardian, who attempts to thwart her romance with a young artist and who eventually induces her to marry him after she loses one of her legs due to a tumor. It has been considered by scholar Beth Miller the least understood of Buñuel's films, and consequently one of the most underrated, due to a "consistent failure to apprehend its political and, especially, its socialist-feminist statement".&lt;ref name="beth miller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Beth|title="From Mistress to Murderess," in Women in Hispanic Literature: Icons and Fallen Idols, edited by Beth Kurti Miller|date=1983|publisher=University of California Press| isbn=978-0520043671| pages=340–41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cCIcUaEznYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buñuel had wanted to make a film of [[Benito Pérez Galdós]]' novel ''[[Tristana (novel)|Tristana]]'' as early as 1952, even though he considered Galdós' book the author's weakest, in Buñuel's words: "of the 'I love you, my little pigeon' genre, very kitsch".&lt;ref name=fujiwara&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fujiwara|first1=Chris|title=Tristana|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&amp;id=628630%7C449958&amp;name=Tristana|website=TCM Summer Under the Stars|publisher=Turner Entertainment Network|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing ''Viridiana'' and in the wake of the scandal its release caused in 1962, the Spanish censor flatly turned down this project,&lt;ref name=durgnat /&gt;{{rp|p.152}} and Buñuel had to wait for 8 years before he could receive backing from the Spanish production company Epoca Films.&lt;ref name=fujiwara /&gt; The censors had threatened to deny permission for the film on the grounds that it encouraged duelling, so Buñuel had to approach the subject matter very gingerly, in addition to making concessions to his French/Italian/Spanish producers, who insisted on casting two of the three primary roles with actors not of Buñuel's choosing: [[Franco Nero]] and Catherine Deneuve.&lt;ref name="faulkner literary adaptations" /&gt;{{rp|p.128}} On this occasion, however, Deneuve and Buñuel had a more mutually satisfactory working relationship, with Deneuve telling an interviewer, "but in the end, you know, it was actually rather a wonderful shoot. ''Tristana'' is one of my favorite films. Personally, as an actress, I prefer ''Tristana'' to ''Belle de Jour''."&lt;ref name=fujiwara /&gt;

The germ of the idea for their next film together, ''[[The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie]]'' (1972) came from Buñuel and Serge Silberman discussing uncanny repetition in everyday life; Silberman told an anecdote about how he had invited some friends for dinner at his house, only to forget about it, so that, on the night of the dinner party, he was absent and his wife was in her nightclothes.&lt;ref name=pinkos&gt;{{cite web| last1=Pinkos| first1=Jefferey| title=Dinner Is Served| url=http://lonestarfilmsociety.com/discreet-charm-of-the-bourgeoisie/| website=Lone Star Film Society| accessdate=12 December 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223031928/http://lonestarfilmsociety.com/discreet-charm-of-the-bourgeoisie/| archivedate=23 December 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film tells of a group of affluent friends who are continually stymied in their attempts to eat a meal together, a situation that a number of critics have contrasted to the opposite dilemma of the characters in ''The Exterminating Angel'', where guests of a dinner party are mysteriously unable to leave after having completed their meal.&lt;ref name=lim /&gt; For this film, Buñuel, Silberman and Carrière assembled a top-flight cast of European performers, "a veritable rogues' gallery of French art-house cinema", according to one critic.&lt;ref name="budd wilkins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilkins|first1=Budd|title=The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-discreet-charm-of-the-bourgeoisie-6699|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, Buñuel made use of a [[video monitors|video-playback monitor]], which allowed him to make much more extensive use of [[crane shot]]s and elaborate [[tracking shot]]s, and enabled him to cut the film in the camera and eliminate the need for [[Re-shoot|reshoots]].&lt;ref name=pinkos /&gt; Filming required only two months and Buñuel claimed that editing took only one day.&lt;ref name=pinkos /&gt; When the film was released, Silberman decided to skip the Cannes Festival in order to concentrate on getting it nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], which it won, leading Buñuel to express his contempt for a process that relied on the judgment of, "2500 idiots, including for example the assistant dress designer of the studio."&lt;ref name=pinkos /&gt;

As was his habit, Buñuel took advantage of the popular success of ''Discreet Charm'' to make one of the "puzzling, idiosyncratic films he ''really'' wanted to make".&lt;ref name="Polizzotti milky way" /&gt; In 1973, at the [[Monastery of El Paular|Monastery of Paular]] in the Spanish [[Somosierra]], he wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Phantom of Liberty]]''(1974) with Carrière for production by Silberman and his Hollywood partners.&lt;ref name=aranda /&gt;{{rp|p.249}} The resulting film is a series of 12 distinctive episodes with separate protagonists, linked together only by following a character from one episode to another in a relay-race manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lanzagorta|first1=Marco|title=The Phantom of Liberty| url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2002/cteq/phantom/|website=Senses of Cinema|publisher=Film Victoria, Australia|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buñuel has stated that he made the film as a tribute to poet [[Benjamin Péret]], a founding member of French Surrealism,&lt;ref name="bill krohn" /&gt;{{rp|p.170}} and called it his "most Surrealist film".&lt;ref name=aranda /&gt;{{rp|p.249}}

Buñuel's final film was ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]'' (1977), adapted by Buñuel and Carrière from an 1898 novel by [[Pierre Louÿs]] called ''[[La Femme et le pantin]]'', which had already been used as the basis of films directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]] ([[The Devil is a Woman (1935 film)|''The Devil is a Woman'']], 1935) and [[Julien Duvivier]] (''[[La Femme et le Pantin]]'', 1959). The film, which tells the story of an older man who is obsessed by a young woman who continually evades his attempts to consummate a sexual relationship, starred the Spanish actor [[Fernando Rey]], appearing in his fourth Buñuel film. Initially, the part of the young woman was to be played by [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]], who had achieved international fame for her roles in ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' and [[The Passenger (1975 film)|''The Passenger'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grimes|first1=William|title=Maria Schneider, Actress in ''Last Tango'', Dies at 58|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/movies/04schneider.html|accessdate=16 December 2014|work=New York Times|date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but once shooting started, according to Carrière, her drug usage resulted in a "lackluster and dull" performance that caused tempestuous arguments with Buñuel on the set and her eventual dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=David|title=David Thomson on Films: Remembering Maria Schneider|journal=New Republic|date=8 February 2011|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/82975/david-thomson-films-remembering-maria-schneider|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serge Silberman, the producer, decided to abandon the project at that point, but was convinced by Buñuel to continue shooting with two different actresses, [[Angela Molina]] and [[Carole Bouquet]] playing the same role in alternating sequences throughout the film. In his autobiography, Buñuel claimed that this unusual casting decision was his own idea after drinking two dry martinis, saying: "If I had to list all the benefits derived from alcohol, it would be endless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pinkos|first1=Jefferey|title=Buñuel's Pursuit of That Obscure Object|url=http://lonestarfilmsociety.com/that-obscure-object-of-desire/|website=Lone Star Film Society|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223155848/http://lonestarfilmsociety.com/that-obscure-object-of-desire/|archivedate=23 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have reported that Carrière had first broached the idea while developing the film's scenario, but had been brushed off by Buñuel as "the whim of a rainy day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=That Obscure Object of Desire|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/that-obscure-object-of-desire|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]'', Buñuel retired from filmmaking. In 1982, he wrote (along with Carrière) his autobiography, ''Mon Dernier Soupir'' (''My Last Sigh''), which provides an account of his life, friends, and family as well as a representation of his eccentric personality. In it, he recounts dreams, encounters with many well-known writers, actors, and artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] as well as antics, like dressing up as a nun and walking around town.

In his seventies, Buñuel once told his friend, novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]]: "I'm not afraid of death.

==Technique and influences==
{{main|Filmmaking technique of Luis Buñuel}}
[[File:SilviaPinalStatue.JPG|thumb|Silvia Pinal was one of Buñuel's "stock company" of actors and was his preferred choice for the lead in his film ''[[Tristana (film)|Tristana]]'', a part which finally went to [[Catherine Deneuve]]&lt;ref name="faulkner literary adaptations"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faulkner|first1=Sally|title=Literary Adaptations in Spanish Cinema|date=2004|publisher=Tamesis|location=London|isbn=978-1855660984|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yeMgJsea3-8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
Buñuel's technique of filmmaking was strongly influenced by mise-en-scene, sound editing and use of music. The influences on his filmmaking have included a positive relationship to surrealism and a critical approach to atheism and religion. Buñuel's style of directing was extremely economical; he shot films in a few weeks, rarely deviating from his script (the scene in ''[[Tristana (film)|Tristana]]'' where [[Catherine Deneuve]] exposes her breasts to Saturno – but not the audience – being a noted exception) and shooting in order as much as possible to minimize editing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Sean|title="Luis Buñuel", in The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide|year=2004|publisher=Sasquatch Books|location=Seattle WA|isbn=978-1-57061-415-6|pages=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qiQLs-6SocC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He remained true throughout his working life to an operating philosophy that he articulated at the beginning of his career in 1928:  "The guiding idea, the silent procession of images that are concrete, decisive, measured in space and time—in a word, the film—was first projected inside the brain of the filmmaker".&lt;ref name="an unspeakable betrayal" /&gt;{{rp|p.135}}  In this, Buñuel has been compared with [[Alfred Hitchcock]], another director famous for precision, efficiency and preplanning, for whom actually shooting the film was an anticlimax, since each man would know, in Buñuel's words, "exactly how each scene will be shot and what the final montage will be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stam|first=Robert|title="Hitchock and Buñuel: Authority, Desire and the Absurd", in Hitchcock's Rereleased Films: From Rope to Vertigo, ed. by Walter Raubicheck and Walter Srebnick|year=1991|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-8143-2326-7|pages=117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CfVeQ5BaPVsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to actress [[Jeanne Moreau]]:  "He was the only director I know who never threw away a shot. He had the film in his mind. When he said 'action' and 'cut,' you knew that what was in between the two would be printed."&lt;ref name=yakir&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yakir|first1=Dan|title=Two Old Masters: Luis Buñuel|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/luis-bunuel-remembered|website=Film Comment|publisher=Film Society of Lincoln Center|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lusterware''' or '''Lustreware''' (respectively the US and all other English spellings) is a type of [[pottery]] or [[porcelain]] with a [[metal]]lic glaze that gives the effect of [[iridescence]], produced by metallic [[oxide]]s in an [[ceramic glaze|overglaze]] finish, which is given a second firing at a lower temperature in a "[[Muffle furnace|muffle kiln]]", [[redox|reduction]] [[kiln]], which excludes oxygen.

Lustre decoration was first used as a [[glass]]-painting technique.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/l/lustre_painted_bowl.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  While some scholars see this as a purely Islamic invention originating in [[Fustat]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson, R. 1991. The Islamic Lands and China. In: H. Tait (ed.), Five Thousand Years of Glass. London: British Museum Press, 112-143; p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; others place the origins of lustre decoration in Roman and [[Coptic Egypt]] during the centuries preceding the rise of [[Islam]].  Staining glass vessels with copper and silver pigments was known from around the 3rd century AD,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni, S. 2001. Glass from Islamic Lands. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd., p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; although true [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] technology probably began sometime between the 4th and 8th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pradell, T., Molera, J., Smith, A.D., Tite, M.S. 2008.

{{Anchor|Islamic lustreware}}
Lustre glazes were applied to pottery in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 9th century; the technique later became popular in [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], the upper part of the [[mihrab]] is adorned with polychrome and monochrome lusterware tiles; dating from 862 to 863, these tiles were most probably imported from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=szNMwUFyjbkC&amp;pg=PA40 Catherine Hess, Linda Komaroff and George Saliba (2004), ''The arts of fire: Islamic influences on glass and ceramics of the Italian Renaissance'', Getty Publications, p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en Mihrab of the Great Mosque of Kairouan (Qantara mediterranean heritage)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184012/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam forbade the use of precious metal dishes and vessels for eating, which had been normal for pre-Islamic elites, and there was therefore a market for elaborate and expensive glass and ceramic equivalents.  The reminiscence of shining metal, especially gold, made lustreware especially attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 24-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Lusterware was produced in quantity in [[Egypt]] during the [[Fatimid dynasty]] in the 10th–12th centuries. While the production of lusterware continued in the [[Middle East]], it spread to [[Europe]] through [[Al-Andalus]]. [[Málaga]] was the first centre of [[Hispano-Moresque ware]], before it developed in the region of [[Valencia]], and then to [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Italy]], where it was used to enhance [[maiolica]]. In the 16th century lustred maiolica was a specialty of [[Gubbio]], noted for a rich ruby red, and at [[Deruta]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Chapters 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

After a gap of several centuries in Persian production, it was revived in the [[Safavid]] period from about the 1630s, in a rather different style, typically producing small pieces with designs often in a dark copper colour over a dark blue (cobalt) background. Unlike other Persian wares of the period, these use traditional Middle Eastern shapes and decoration rather than Chinese-inspired ones, and also do not take their shapes from metalware. Designs featured plant forms and animals, and generally flowed freely over the whole surface, typically taking up over half the surface area.  Production, which was never large, appears to have mostly been from about 1650 to 1750, but with rather inferior wares produced into the 19th century.  It is often thought to have been centred in [[Kirman]], though firm evidence is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 80-84; Blair &amp; Bloom, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clement massier.jpg|thumb|Lustreware vase by Clement [[:fr:Massier]], circa 1900]]
Metallic lustre of another sort produced English lustreware, which imparts to a piece of pottery the appearance of an object of silver, gold or copper. Silver lustre employed the new metal [[platinum]], whose chemical properties were analyzed towards the end of the 18th century, John Hancock of Hanley invented the application of a platinum technique, and "put it in practice at [[Josiah Spode|Mr Spode's manufactory]], for Messrs. Daniels and Brown",&lt;ref&gt;Hancock's memoir, quoted by Ross Taggart, ''The Frank P. and Harriet C. Burnap Collection of English Pottery in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery'', rev. ed. (Kansas City) 1967, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; about 1800. Very dilute amounts of powdered gold or platinum were dissolved in [[aqua regia]]&lt;ref&gt;Aqua regia, a mixture of [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and added to spirits of tar for platinum and a mixture of turpentine, flowers of sulfur and linseed oil for gold.  The mixture was applied to the glazed ware and fired in an enameling kiln, depositing a thin film of platinum or gold.&lt;ref&gt;Technical description from Taggart 1967:168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum produced the appearance of solid silver, and was employed for the middle class in shapes identical to those uses for silver [[tea service]]s, ca. 1810-1840.  Depending on the concentration of gold in the lustring compound and the under slip on which it was applied, a range of colours could be achieved, from pale rose and lavender, to copper and gold. The gold lustre could be painted or stenciled on the ware, or it could be applied in the resist technique, in which the background was solidly lustred, and the design remained in the body color. In the resist technique, similar to [[batik]], the design was painted in glue and size in a glycerin or honey compound, the lustre applied by dipping, and the resist washed off before the piece was fired.

Lustreware became popular in [[Staffordshire pottery]] during the 19th century, where it was also used by [[Josiah Wedgwood]], who introduced pink and white lustreware simulating mother o' pearl effects in dishes and bowls cast in the shapes of shells, and silver lustre, introduced at Wedgwood in 1805. In 1810 Peter Warburton of [[New Hall, Cambridge|New Hall]] patented a method of [[transfer-printing]] in gold and silver lustre. [[Sunderland Lustreware]] in the [[North East England|North East]] is renowned for its mottled pink lustreware, and lustreware was also produced in [[Leeds, Yorkshire]], where the technique may have been introduced by Thomas Lakin.&lt;ref&gt;Taggart 1967:169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedgwood's lusterware made in the 1820s spawned the production of mass quantities of copper and silver lustreware&lt;ref&gt;Silver was produced from platinum salts; fully lustred teasets imitating silver models were introduced in 1823 for middle-class households (L.G.G. Ramsey, ed. ''The Connoisseur New Guide to Antique English Pottery, Porcelain and Glass'' p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; in England and Wales. Cream pitchers with appliqué-detailed spouts and meticulously applied handles were most common, and often featured stylized decorative bands in dark blue, cream yellow, pink, and, most rare, dark green and purple. Raised, multicolored patterns depicting pastoral scenes were also created, and sand was sometimes incorporated into the glaze to add texture. Pitchers were produced in a range of sizes from cream pitchers to large milk pitchers, as well as small coffeepots and teapots. [[Tea set]]s came a bit later, usually featuring creamers, sugar bowls, and slop bowls.

Large pitchers with transfer printed commemorative scenes appear to have arrived around the middle of the 19th century. These were purely decorative and today command high prices because of their historical connections. Delicate lustre imitating [[mother-of-pearl]] was produced by Wedgwood and at [[Belleek Pottery|Belleek]] in the mid-century, derived from  [[bismuth nitrate]].&lt;ref&gt;John Fleming and Hugh Honour, ''Dictionary of the Decorative Arts'', 1977, ''s.v.'' "Lustre".&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the impetus of the [[Aesthetic Movement]], [[William de Morgan]] revived lustrewares in a manner drawing from lustred majolica and Hispano-Moresque wares, with fine, bold designs.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 168-170&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, copper lusterware became popular because of its lustrousness. Apparently, as gaslights became available to the rich, the fad was to place groupings of lusterware on mirror platforms to be used as centerpieces for dinner parties. Gaslights accentuated their lustrousness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

After high-ranking members of Saudi Arabia's religious establishment denounced the movement in general, and Saudi [[Grand Mufti]] and [[Permanent Committee]] head [[Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh]]'s criticism of Rabee al-Madkhali specifically, the movement lost its support base within the wider [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name=harald/&gt; The remaining followers of Madkhali within Saudi Arabia tend to be foreign workers of Western origins, Saudis from Rabee al-Madkhali's hometown, and Kuwaitis and Yemenis.&lt;ref name=jarret30&gt;Jarret M. Brachman, ''Global Jihadism'', pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Madkhali also retains a national network of disciples to promote his work and monitor the activities of competitor clerics,&lt;ref name=jarret29/&gt; and although Madkhalists are outnumbered by followers of [[Society of the Revival of Islamic Heritage]] in Kuwait, they retain an extensive international network in the Middle East, Europe and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=carn/&gt; Despite losing its audience in its country of origin, the movement had branched outward by the early 2010s, with Madkhalists gaining followers in western [[Kazakhstan]], where the [[Government of Kazakhstan]] views them and other Islamists with suspicion.&lt;ref name=kazakh&gt;Almaz Rysaliev, [http://iwpr.net/report-news/west-kazakhstan-under-growing-islamic-influence "West Kazakhstan Under Growing Islamic Influence."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193120/http://iwpr.net/report-news/west-kazakhstan-under-growing-islamic-influence |date=2013-10-29 }} [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]].

On Friday, 24 August 2012, Islamists loyal to Muhammad al-Madkhali, one of the movement's figureheads and Rabee al-Madkhali's brother,&lt;ref&gt;Mansoor Jassem Alshamsi, ''Islam and Political Reform in Saudi Arabia: The Quest for Political Change and Reform'', pg. 111.

September 4th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another break between Madkhalists and the mainstream of purist Salafism has been the reaction to the [[Arab Spring]]. While most purist Salafists initially opposed both the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]], eventually they threw their support behind the opposition in both cases due to the extreme violence on the part of the Qaddafi and Asad regimes; the Madkhalists attacked the mainstream purists for these stances.&lt;ref name=carn/&gt;

==Tenets==
{{salafi|Related}}
Madkhalism is often compared to [[Wahhabism]], sharing a number of tenents with the wider movement.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=zuhur/&gt; Media analysts have warned against generalizing such Islamists movements despite their differences, however.&lt;ref name=kazakh/&gt; Madkhali has borrowed heavily from elder Salafist scholar [[Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani]]; Madkhali adopted more extreme positions than Albani in his teaching, however, and Madkhalists were dismayed when Albani praised hardline clerics [[Safar Al-Hawali]] and [[Salman al-Ouda]].&lt;ref name=jarret29/&gt;

A cornerstone of Madkhalist discourse is unquestioning loyalty to governments, even those that use extreme and unjustified violence against their subjects.&lt;ref name=carn/&gt; Unlike other Islamist groups which often oppose dictatorial government in the Middle East, the Madkhalist movement is openly supportive of such regimes.&lt;ref name=omar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martijn de Koning, pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rich41&gt;Richard Gauvain, ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God'', pg. 41. [[New York City|New York]]: Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Jamestown Foundation]], [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4c9c50952.html Salafists Challenge al-Azhar for Ideological Supremacy in Egypt]. 16 September 2010, Terrorism Monitor Volume: 8 Issue: 35&lt;/ref&gt; Madkhalists argue that the governments of Arab countries rule by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]], otherwise God would not have allowed them to take power; anyone who opposes their view is labeled as a member of the [[Khawarij]], an ancient Muslim sect.&lt;ref name=jarret30/&gt;

Relations with governments of countries which are Muslim but not Arab have not always been as smooth. Both Madkhali brothers actively encouraged Muslims inside and outside of [[Indonesia]] to join the armed [[Maluku sectarian conflict]] which continued from the late 1990s until the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Noorhaidi Hasan, ''Laskar Jihad'', pg. 151. [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]: [[Cornell Southeast Asia Program]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohan Gunaratna, ''Inside Al Qaeda: global network of terror'', pg. 201. Volume 3 of  the [[University of St Andrews]]' Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence series. London: [[C. Hurst &amp; Co.]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2000, Muhammad al-Madkhali went so far as to declare the prohibition of [[jihad]] by then Indonesian President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], himself an internationally recognized Islamic scholar, as being contrary to [[sharia]] law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Hefner, "Civil Pluralism Denied?" Taken from ''New Media in the Muslim World: The Emerging Public Sphere'', pg. 170. Eds. Dale F. Eickelman and Jon W. Anderson. [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]: [[Indiana University Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|9780253342522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though often lumped together with all other Salafists and Islamists, the Madkhalists have been noted for their opposition to and mutual rivalry with [[Salafist jihadism]].&lt;ref name=kazakh/&gt; The Madkhalist movement has been described as politically quietist, eschewing the organized political efforts of the mainstream of Salafism and even going as far as to declare those who participate in modern political system to be heretics or even [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]].&lt;ref&gt;Martijn de Koning, pg. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Joffé, ''Islamist Radicalisation in Europe and the Middle East: Reassessing the Causes of Terrorism'', pg. 317. [[London]]: [[I.B. Tauris]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Such politically active Salafists are often described by followers of Madkhalism as part of an international conspiracy against "true Salafism."&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, "Politicizing," pg. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Western intelligence agencies have identified Madkhalists as a group which can be supported and funded discreetly by the US, in comparison to the rest of the groups seen under the wider Salafi movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/StealingAlQaidasPlaybookJarretBrachmanWilliamMcCants 'U.S. could discretely fund mainstream Salafi figures like Madkhali ...' ].&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction with non-Muslim societies, where most Madkhalists reside, also distinguishes the movement. While most Salafists in the [[Western world]] are noted for lack of participation in the wider society, Madkhalists in particular are noted for minimizing contact with non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Martijn de Koning, pg. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Also unlike the wider Islamist movement, Madkhalists seem uninterested in converting Western societies to Islam, preferring to simply accept and defend their rights as a minority community.&lt;ref&gt;Martijn de Koning, pg. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The polemics of the Madkhalists are markedly different from other Salafist groups as well. A noted feature of Madkhalism during Muslim dogmatic exchanges is attacking the opponent instead of discourse regarding the actual topic of discussion.&lt;ref name=rich41/&gt; The person of the movement's leader, Rabee al-Madkhali, also carries a heavy focus uncharacteristic of rival movements such as Qutbism. Madkhalists have been described as obsessed with defense of the movement's leader, often dramatising or exaggerating praise given by Salafist scholars and attempting to stifle or intimidate Salafists with opposing views to those of Madkhali and Madkhalists.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, "Politicizing," pg. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; A common mantra promoted by Madkhali is that questioning the movement's clerics is forbidden as a general rule, and only allowed in cases of necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Roel Meijer, "The Problem of the Political in Islamist Movements."

The Sanctuary of '''Madonna della Ceriola''' ({{lang-it|santuario della Madonna della Ceriola}}), is a [[Roman Catholic]] church in the municipality of [[Monte Isola]], [[Italy]]. It is located on the summit of the [[lake island]] also named ''Monte Isola''.

== Location ==
[[File:Madonna della ceriola volta.png|thumb|left|Vault frescoes]]
The church is located at an [[elevation]] of 600 [[Sea level|MSL]] in the highest point of the island, which offers a wide view of Lake Iseo and its surrounding mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web | title = Madonna della Ceriola: panorama e suggestioni  | publisher = Brescia Oggi|  language = it | url = http://www.bresciaoggi.it/territori/citt%C3%A0/madonna-della-ceriola-panorama-e-suggestioni-1.5068349 | access-date = 2016-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest village to the sanctuary is Cure (466 [[Sea level|MSL]]).

== History ==
[[File:Madonna della ceriola statua.png|thumb|left|Madonna's wooden statue]]
A first church on the top of the mountain was built during the 13th century,&lt;ref name=TCI /&gt; likely on a pagan temple location.&lt;ref name=sant /&gt; Present-day building was fulfilled in the 16th century, but its inner part was modified the following century by the insertion of a new [[chancel]]. The bell tower was built in 1750.

The church was the first Marian shrine to be built near [[Lake Iseo]]. The wooden statue worshipped in the shrine goes back to the 12th century and is known as Madonna ''della Ceriola'' presumabily because it was engraved in a block of [[Quercus cerris|Austrian oak]] wood (in [[Italian language|Italian]] ''cerro''). It represents the Holy Virgin on a [[throne]] taking baby Jesus with her arms.&lt;ref name=sant&gt;{{   Cite web | title = Santuario della Madonna della Ceriola |  url = http://www.iseolake.info/it/vivi-il-lago/arte-e-cultura/chiese-e-luoghi-religiosi/673-santuario-della-madonna-della-ceriola | language = it | access-date = 2016-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the church, with some [[fresco]]es and paintings and two fine saints' statues flanking the Virgin, there are many [[ex-voto]] tablets celebrating numerous [[miracle]]s attributed the Madonna. One of the most resonant among them was the protection granted to the islanders against a [[cholera]] outbreak of 1816: in sign of gratitude every second Sunday of July is still celebrated a feast called ''Madonna del Cholera''  (''Madonna of the Cholera''). In 1924 the statue was solemnly [[coronation|coronated]] with a golden [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] realised melted golden jeweley presented by the inhabitants of  [[Monte Isola]].&lt;ref name = valcam /&gt;

== Access to the church ==
[[File:Madonna della ceriola ex voto.png|thumb|left|Ex-voto tablet]]
The Sanctuary is reached by a cobbled mule-track linking it with the village of Cure.&lt;ref name=TCI /&gt; Fifteen chapels built in the second part of the 20th century and depicting the [[rosary#Mysteries of the Rosary|mysteries of the Rosary]] are located alongside the last part of the track.&lt;ref name = valcam /&gt; The shrine can also be accessed following a longer walking path starting near [[Peschiera Maraglio]] jetty&lt;ref&gt;{{   Cite web | title = Madonna della Ceriola – Itinerario  | url =  http://www.tuttomonteisola.it/index.php/madonna-della-ceriola-itinerario/ | language = it |access-date = 2016-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (185 [[Sea level|MSL]]).

{{Maya religion}}

'''Death rituals''' were an important part of [[Maya religion]]. The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] greatly respected [[death]]; they were taught to fear it and grieved deeply for the dead. They also believed that certain deaths were more noble than others.

==Background==
The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] were [[ritual]]istic people, who paid great respect to the destructive nature of their [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]]. They had many traditions to commemorate the recently deceased and worship long-departed ancestors.

People who died by [[suicide]], [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]], complications of [[childbirth]] and in battle were thought to be transported directly into [[heaven]].

Before [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish influence]], there may not have been a common idea of the [[afterlife]]. The Yucatec Maya believed that there were different routes after death. A pot from a Pacal tomb depicts ancestors of [[Maya rulers|Maya kings]] sprouting through the [[earth]] like fruit trees and together creating an orchard. The Maya had several forms of ancestor worship. They built [[Cult image|idols]] containing ashes of the dead and brought them food on [[festival]] days. Alternatively, a [[temple]] could be built over an [[urn]]. In those that were sacrificed, the most common way was cutting the abdomen, and taking out the [[heart]].

==Customs==
The Maya dead were laid to rest with [[maize]] placed in their mouth. Maize, highly important in Maya culture, is a symbol of rebirth and also was food for the dead for the journey to the [[otherworld]]. Similarly, a [[jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] or stone bead placed in the mouth served as currency for this journey. Often, whistles carved from rocks into the shapes of gods or animals were included in the grave offerings to help the deceased find their way to [[Xibalba]]. The Maya associated the color red with death and rebirth and often covered graves and [[Skeleton|skeletal]] remains with [[cinnabar]]. The bodies of the dead were wrapped in [[cotton]] mantles before being buried. Burial sites were oriented to provide access to the otherworld. Graves faced north or west, in the directions of the Maya heavens, and others were located in caves, entrances to the underworld. 
	
Burial practices of the Maya changed over the course of time. In the late [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic period]], people were buried in a flexed position, later the dead were laid to rest in an extended position. In the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]], the elite constructed vaulted tombs, and some rulers ordered the construction of large burial complexes. In the [[Postclassic period]], [[cremation]] became more common.

== Beliefs about the afterlife ==
[[Image:AhPuch.jpg|right|frame|Mayan death god in the [[lunar eclipse]] tables of the [[Dresden Codex]]]]

The [[Maya peoples|Maya]] believe that the soul is bound to the body at birth. Only death or sickness can part the body and soul, with death being the permanent parting. To them, there is an afterlife that the soul reaches after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life|last=Weider|first=R.|publisher=Gale Research|year=1998|isbn=|location=Detroit, MI|pages=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that, deceased ancestors can still contact their descendants, answering advice when they are asked. This contact can be used at certain times in the season, or when certain family matters pertain to the ancestors. Understanding the perception of what the deceased do in their afterlife can give ideas towards what rituals need to be performed and what types of items one must be buried with in order to successfully navigate the afterlife.

=== Reincarnation ===
The aspect of reincarnation is one strongly mentioned in Mayan beliefs and religion. The ''[[Popol Vuh]]'' gives importance to the Maize deity, and how the Mayan people themselves descended from maize people created by this god. In the ''Popol Vuh'' that the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] Maya wrote, one of the few surviving [[Codex|codices]], it tells the story of the reincarnation of the Maize god. In the tale, the maize god retreats to the underworld and with two hero twins battling the monsters and lords of the place, makes way back to the earthen world. He is reborn again, dies, and on and on the cycle continues. In this aspect, it is believed by the Mayans that the Earth itself is a living being. As they came from corn, consuming corn or having sex then brings one closer to the earth.

=== Ideas about the afterlife ===
The concept of the afterlife, or [[Xibalba]], differs between the Mayan ethnic groups. Many have a generalized belief of all souls going to the afterlife, being reincarnated or having another role to participate in after death, but these ideas change dramatically with the rise of Christianity. With that came the idea of Xibalba being a location of punishment. The longer one spent in Xibalba, the worse a life they led while living. With this belief, heaven became a paradise for many to strive for. The [[Chontal of Tabasco]] are an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|last=Knowles-Berry|first=Susan M.|publisher=G.K. Hall and Co.|year=1995|isbn=|series=Vol. 8, Middle Americas and the Caribbean|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethnic groups ====
To the [[Awakatek people|Awakateko]] and the [[Chuj people|Chuj]], the ancestors remain in contact and have the ability to affect the affairs of the living even in death. The Awakateko believed that the afterlife is a place where all ancestors remain, and that there is nowhere to pass on to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|last=Barber|first=Kathlene|publisher=G.K. Hall and Co.|year=1995|isbn=|series=Vol. 8, Middle Americas and the Caribbean|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; But to the Chuj, any contracts made with the dead are binding. If one does not follow these contracts, the ancestor can plague the one bound to the contract with illness or misfortune. To Them, they can contact their ancestors at altars, caves, or places connected to Mayan societies. The association of caves to the underworld is one intertwined with the older Mayan civilization and is an aspect continued by the Chuj people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|last=Maxwell|first=Judith M.|publisher=G. K. Hall and Co.|year=1995|isbn=|series=Vol. 8, Middle Americas and the Caribbean|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other ethnic groups that believe ritual items are needed in order to make the journey into the afterlife. The [[Lacandon people|Lakandon]] bury their people facing the sun, and wrapped in a tunic and hammock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|last=Dow|first=James W.|publisher=G. K. Hall and Co.|year=1995|isbn=|series=Vol. 8, Middle Americas and the Caribbean|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] bury their dead in a straw sleeping mat, with a hat, sandals and a net provided to help in the journey to the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|last=Dow|first=James W.|publisher=G.K. Hall and Co.|year=1995|isbn=|series=Vol. 8, Middle Americas and the Caribbean|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In others it was believed a dog was needed to help make the journey through the afterlife. Often a dog was ritually sacrificed, or an effigy buried along with the deceased in order to complete this task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mythologies|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|series=Vol. 1|location=|pages=1189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the goods buried with the person were what the tribe believed was needed to complete one's cross into the next, whether it be the afterlife, heaven or reincarnation.

Other ethnic groups believed that the spirits of the dead still had tasks to complete in the afterlife. The [[Mam people|Mam]], before fully accepting Christian values thought that the dead lived within volcanoes and other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|last=Watanabe|first=John M.|publisher=G.K. Hall and Co.|year=1995|isbn=|volume=Vol. 8, Middle Americas and the Caribbean|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], souls of the dead might be reincarnated or go to assist in moving the sun across the sky. The Tz'utujil in Santiago feared that souls of drowning victims inhabited the bottom of Lake Atitlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|last=Carlsen|first=Robert S.|publisher=G.K. Hall and Co.|year=1995|isbn=|series=Vol. 8, Middle Americas and the Caribbean|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this difference in the idea of what one's ancestor does in death, came a change in how and what they were buried with. Those who still had a journey or a task may need more or less items, and it depended on how those of the tribe believed on what occurred after death.

But many ethnic groups also observed a celebration of their deceased ancestors later on. The [[Poqomam people|Poqomam]] gather after death and hold a feast that may last for nine days. Then they pray for that deceased person every day of the dead for the next seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|last=Mast|first=Ian|publisher=G.K. Hall and Co.|year=1995|isbn=|series=Vol. 8, Middle Americas and the Caribbean|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tzotzil of Chamula]] also have a similar holiday for celebrating the dead, though theirs occurs every year. Their belief is that souls return to visit and partake of food once a year, in a celebration called K'in Santo. The family members must perform a ritual to the deities to ask release of the souls of their dead relatives and to allow them entrance into the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures|last=Rosenbaum|first=Brenda|publisher=GK. Hall and Co.|year=1995|isbn=|series=Vol. 8, Middle Americas and the Caribbean|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tombs==
There have been many archaeological discoveries of lavish tombs within ceremonial complexes from the Classic period. However, only a [[Maya city]]’s most important ruler was buried in this way. These aristocrats were placed in tombs at the bottoms of funerary [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] that sometimes consisted of nine stepped platforms, perhaps symbolizing the nine layers of the [[Xibalba|underworld]]. Other temples were constructed with 13 vaults symbolizing the layers of the heavens in Maya cosmology. These temples reflected the continued worship of these nobles. In some instances, members of the royal family or young attendants would be sacrificed to accompany the lord in death.

The tombs were filled with precious goods including fine polychrome [[pottery]], effigy figurines, jade and marble pieces, masks, [[mushroom]] figures. While these figures were found in Maya tombs, many of these items were also used in the service of food, drink and for additional ritual purposes.&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=84|url=http://artsbma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|Obsidian]] and exotic shells have also been found in Mayan tombs.   In the [[Tomb of the Red Queen]]  inside Temple XIII in [[Palenque]], the remains of a noble woman and all the objects inside the sarcophagus were completely covered with bright red [[vermilion]] dust,  made of ground [[cinnabar]], perhaps intended to suggest blood, the symbol of life.

Other elite members of society were buried in vaults. The bodies of higher-ranking members of society were buried inside sarcophagi. They sometimes were buried in crypts or underneath the family home. These funerary constructions of the royal often destroyed the residence itself. Commoners were also buried near or under their houses. These graves did not have extensive burial offerings, but often contained objects that identified the individual: a tool or possession.

'''Mírzá Muhammad `Alí''' ({{lang-fa|{{big|میرزا محمد علی}}}} &amp;nbsp;1852&amp;ndash;1937) was one of the sons of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. He was the eldest son of his father's second wife, Fatimih Khanum, later known as Mahd-i-'Ulya, whom Bahá'u'lláh married in [[Tehran]] in 1849.  Muhammad `Alí [[Persian names|received the title]] from his father of ''&lt;u&gt;Gh&lt;/u&gt;usn-i-Akbar'' ("Greatest Branch" or "Greater Branch").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taherzadeh|2000|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[elative (gradation)|elative]] is a stage of gradation in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] that can be used both for a [[superlative]] or a [[comparative]]. ''&lt;u&gt;Gh&lt;/u&gt;usn-i-Akbar'' could mean "Greatest Branch" or "Greater Branch."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bahá'í sidebar}}

==Early years==

Mírzá Muhammad `Alí was born on December 16, 1853 in Baghdad during Bahá'u'lláh's first year of exile in that city.  In 1863, at the age of nine, he accompanied his family in their exile to Constantinople and Adrianople.  During the final days in Adrianople, Mírzá Muhammad `Alí wrote about eighty letters to the believers of the Bahá'í Faith, such as those in Baghdad and its surrounding towns. He also asked permission of his father to travel abroad and spread the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Behai |first=Shua Ullah |pages=194-195 |editor1-last=Stetson |editor1-first=Eric |date=December 5, 2014 |title=A Lost History of the Baha'i Faith: The Progressive Tradition of Baha'u'llah's Forgotten Family |url=http://www.voxhumri.com/books/a-lost-history-of-the-bahai-faith/ |publisher=Vox Humri Media |isbn=978-0692331354 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927005108/http://www.voxhumri.com/books/a-lost-history-of-the-bahai-faith/ |archivedate=September 27, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of fifteen, when Baha’u’llah's family was imprisoned in [[Acre (city)|Acre]], the duty of copying [[List of writings of Bahá'u'lláh#'Akká|Bahá'u'lláh's writings]] was given to Mírzá Muhammad `Alí.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Behai |first=Shua Ullah|page= 198  |editor1-last=Stetson |editor1-first=Eric |date=December 5, 2014 |title=A Lost History of the Baha'i Faith: The Progressive Tradition of Baha'u'llah's Forgotten Family| url=http://www.voxhumri.com/books/a-lost-history-of-the-bahai-faith/|publisher= Vox Humri Media |isbn=978-0692331354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute with `Abdu'l-Bahá==

In the [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|''Kitáb-i-‘Ahd'']] ("Book of the Covenant"), Bahá'u'lláh appointed [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] as his successor,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1994|pp=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Muhammad `Ali given a station "beneath" that of `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref name="ahd"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were noted explicitly by their titles, with Muhammad Ali being called ''&lt;u&gt;Gh&lt;/u&gt;usn-i-Akbar'' and `Abdu'l-Bahá being called ''&lt;u&gt;Gh&lt;/u&gt;usn-i-A'zam''. As time passed, Muhammad `Alí claimed that `Abdu'l-Bahá was not sharing power. According to some interpretations, Muhammad `Alí insisted that he should instead be regarded as the leader of the Bahá'ís. Many accusations were leveled against each other by both `Abdu'l-Bahá and Muhammad `Alí, culminating in Muhammad `Alí's accusing his older brother of conspiring against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]]. This resulted in the imprisonment and near-death of `Abdu'l-Bahá and his family. Almost all Bahá'ís accepted `Abdu'l-Bahá as Bahá'u'lláh's successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taherzadeh|2000|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of `Abdu'l-Bahá's death, [[Shoghi Effendi]] was appointed the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the Faith by `Abdu'l-Bahá in his ''[[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]]'', while Muhammad `Alí was reprimanded in the same document as "The Center of Sedition, the Prime Mover of mischief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=‘Abdu’l-Bahá |authorlink=‘Abdu’l-Bahá |origyear=1901-08 |year=1990 |title=The Will And Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá |publisher= Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA| chapter= Part One| chapter-url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/wt-1.html#pg6| isbn= 978-0877433736 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Bahá'u'lláh's ''Kitáb-i-`Ahd'' named Muhammad `Alí as "after" `Abdu'l-Bahá's, he took the opportunity of `Abdu'l-Bahá's death to try to revive his claim to leadership, but his attempt to occupy the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]] by force left him on the losing end of a legal battle that removed any rights he had to the property.

The division between rival sects with Mírzá Muhammad `Alí and Shoghi Effendi as their respective leaders was short-lived and Shoghi Effendi emerged as the leader of the global Bahá'í community, labeling Muhammad `Alí the arch-breaker of the [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adamson|2009|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mírzá Muhammad `Alí would lead the small Unitarian Baha'i denomination.  In 1904, he sent his oldest son, [[Shua Ullah Behai]], to the United States where he led the Unitarian Baha'i community.  From 1934 to 1937, Behai published ''Behai Quarterly'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | editor-last = Cole | editor-first = Juan R.I. |editor-link= Juan Cole | editor2-last =  Quinn | editor2-first = Sholeh | editor3-last = Smith | editor3-first = Peter |editor3-link= Peter Smith (historian) | editor4-last =  Walbridge | editor4-first =  John | title = Behai Quarterly | journal = Documents on the Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Movements | volume = 08 | issue = 2 | publisher = h-net.msu.edu |date = July 2004| url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/docs/vol8/bq.htm | accessdate = October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "Unitarian" Bahá'í magazine written in English and featuring the writings of Mirza Muhammad `Alí and various other Unitarian Bahais, including [[Ibrahim George Kheiralla]].&lt;ref name="WarburgStudies"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Warburg | first = Margit | title = Bahá'í: Studies in Contemporary Religion | publisher = Signature Books | date =  | page = 64 | url = http://signaturebooks.com/?p=1164 | isbn = 1-56085-169-4 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This schism had very little effect overall.

==Death==

Mirza Muhammad `Alí died on December 10, 1937, in [[Haifa]] Palestine. His remains were carried by hand from his house to King’s Way, a distance of one mile, where the remains were placed on a vehicle and escorted to Acre, where again he was carried by hand to his burial plot at [[Bahji]], near the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]]. Memorial services were held at Haifa on Tuesday, January the 18th, 1938. Some supplications which were revealed by Bahá'u'lláh towards Mírzá Muhammad `Alí were recited:

: ''“..O my God, verily this is a branch who hath branched from the firm and lofty tree of Thy Singleness and One-ness…. assist him with the hosts of earth and heaven, and help, O my God, whosoever helpeth him, choose whosoever chooseth him, and assist whosoever cometh to him. Then forsake whosoever denieth him and desireth him not.”''

His death was broadcast by radio stations, including the British Broadcasting Corporation. Some individuals who delivered memorial speeches include Abdullah Bey Mokhles (Professor and the Secretary of National Muslim Society), Bishop Hajjar (Archbishop of Acre for the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]]), Wadi Effendi Boustani (Arabian philosopher poet and prominent advocate), and [[Abu Salma]] (20th century Palestinian poet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Behai |first=Shua Ullah| page= 251-253  |editor1-last=Stetson |editor1-first=Eric |date=December 5, 2014 |title=A Lost History of the Baha'i Faith: The Progressive Tradition of Baha'u'llah's Forgotten Family| url=http://www.voxhumri.com/books/a-lost-history-of-the-bahai-faith/|publisher= Vox Humri Media |isbn=978-0692331354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prayer flag''' is a colorful rectangular [[textile|cloth]], often found strung along mountain ridges and peaks high in the [[Himalayas]]. They are used to bless the surrounding countryside and for other purposes. Prayer flags are believed to have originated with [[Bon (religion)|Bon]].&lt;ref&gt; Barker, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; In Bon, [[shamanism|shamanistic]] ''Bonpo'' used [[primary color|primary-colored]] plain flags in Tibet.&lt;ref name="PF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prayerflags.com/download/article.pdf |title=Radiant Heart: The Prayer Flag Tradition |accessdate=2007-12-29 |format=PDF |website=prayerflags.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional prayer flags include [[woodblock printing|woodblock-printed]] text and images.

==History==
[[File:Prayer flag.jpg|thumb|Prayer flag at Sarchu.]]
[[File:Prayer Flags (2563937875).jpg|thumb|Close-up view of prayer flags.]]
[[File:Prayerflags.jpg|thumb|Lung ta prayer flags hang along a mountain path in [[Nepal]].]]

Nepal [[Buddhist Sūtra|Sutras]], originally written on cloth banners, were transmitted to other regions of the world as prayer flags.&lt;ref name=Baker1&gt;Barker, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; Legend ascribes the origin of the prayer flag to the [[Gautama Buddha]], whose prayers were written on battle flags used by the ''[[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'' against their adversaries, the ''[[asura]]s''.&lt;ref name=Beer60&gt;Beer, page 60&lt;/ref&gt; The legend may have given the Indian ''[[bhikku]]'' a reason for carrying the heavenly banner as a way of signifying his commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]''.&lt;ref name=wise-11-12&gt;Wise, page 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge was carried into [[Tibet]] by 800 CE,and the actual flags were introduced no later than 1040 CE, where they were further modified.&lt;ref name=wise-11-12/&gt; The Indian monk [[Atisha]] (980 – 1054 CE) introduced the Indian practice of printing on cloth prayer flags to Tibet and Nepal.&lt;ref name=Beer60/&gt;

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], prayer flags were discouraged but not entirely eliminated. Many traditional designs may have been lost. Currently, different styles of prayer flags can be seen all across the Tibetan region.

==''Lung ta/Darchog'' styles==
[[File:Prayer flags in the wind.jpg|thumb|Prayer flags in the [[Qilian Mountains]], China.]]
[[File:Waddell-p411-The-Tibetan-LUNG-Horse.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] "lung ta" or "[[Wind Horse|wind horse]]" from an 1895 book by [[Laurence Waddell|Laurence Austine Waddell]]]]
There are two kinds of prayer flags: horizontal ones, called ''Lung ta'' (Wylie: ''rlung-rta'', meaning "[[Wind Horse]]") in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], and vertical ones, called ''Darchog'' (Wylie: ''dar-lcog'', meaning "flagstaff").

''Lung ta'' (horizontal) prayer flags are of square or rectangular shape, and are connected along their top edges to a long string or thread. They are commonly hung on a diagonal line from high to low between two objects (e.g., a rock and the top of a pole) in high places such as the tops of temples, monasteries, [[stupas]], and mountain passes

''Darchog'' (vertical) prayer flags are usually large single rectangles attached to poles along their vertical edge. Darchog are commonly planted in the ground, mountains, cairns, and on rooftops, and are iconographically and symbolically related to the ''[[Dhvaja]]''.

==Color and order==
[[File:0403 Prayers Colors Kathmandu Bodnath 2006 Luca Galuzzi.jpg|thumb|Prayer flags in [[Kathmandu]], Nepal.]]

Traditionally, prayer flags come in sets of five: one in each of five colors. The five colors are arranged from left to right in a specific order: blue, white, red, green, and yellow. The five colors represent the [[Mahābhūta#Fifth and sixth elements|five elements]]&lt;ref name="PF"/&gt; and the [[Five Pure Lights]]. Different elements are associated with different colors for specific traditions, purposes and [[sadhana]]. Blue symbolizes the sky and space, white symbolizes the air and wind, red symbolizes fire, green symbolizes water, and yellow symbolizes earth.&lt;ref name="PF"/&gt;  According to [[Traditional Tibetan medicine]], health and harmony are produced through the balance of the five elements.&lt;ref name="PF"/&gt;

==Symbols and prayers==

The center of a prayer flag traditionally features a ''[[Wind horse|Lung ta]]'' (powerful or strong horse) bearing three flaming jewels (specifically ''[[cintamani (jewel)|ratna]]'') on its back. The ''Ta'' is a symbol of speed and the transformation of bad fortune to good fortune. The [[triratna|three flaming jewels]] symbolize the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the [[Dharma]] (Buddhist teachings), and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] (Buddhist community): the three cornerstones of Tibetan philosophical tradition.

Surrounding the ''Lung ta'' are various versions of approximately 400 traditional [[mantra]]s, each dedicated to a particular deity. These writings include mantras from three of the great Buddhist Bodhisattvas: [[Padmasambhava]] (Guru Rinpoche), [[Avalokiteśvara]] (Chenrezig, the [[bodhisattva]] of compassion, and the patron of the [[Tibetan people]]), and [[Manjusri]].

In addition to mantras, prayers for a long life of good fortune are often included for the person who mounts the flags.

Images or the names of four powerful animals, also known as the [[Shambhala Buddhism#Shambhala Terma|Four Dignities]], adorn each corner of a flag: the [[Dragon#East Asia|dragon]], the [[garuda]], the [[tiger]], and the [[snowlion]].

==Symbolism and tradition==
Traditionally, prayer flags are used to promote peace, compassion, strength, and wisdom. The flags do not carry prayers to gods, which is a common misconception; rather, the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] believe the prayers and [[mantra]]s will be blown by the wind to spread the good will and compassion into all pervading space.   Therefore, prayer flags are thought to bring benefit to all.

By hanging flags in high places the ''Lung ta'' will carry the blessings depicted on the flags to all beings. As wind passes over the surface of the flags, which are sensitive to the slightest movement of the wind, the air is purified and sanctified by the mantras.

The prayers of a flag become a permanent part of the universe as the images fade from exposure to the elements. Just as life moves on and is replaced by new life, Tibetans renew their hopes for the world by continually mounting new flags alongside the old. This act symbolizes a welcoming of life's changes and an acknowledgment that all beings are part of a greater ongoing cycle.

According to traditional belief, because the symbols and mantras on prayer flags are sacred, they should be treated with respect. They should not be placed on the ground or used on clothing. Old prayer flags should be burned.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Timing of hanging and taking down==
Some believe that if the flags are hung on inauspicious [[astrology|astrological]] dates, they may bring negative results for as long as they are flying. The best time to put up new prayer flags is in the morning on sunny, windy days.

Old prayer flags are replaced with new ones annually on the [[Losar|Tibetan New Year]].

He was awarded the [[Templeton Prize]] in 1980.

== Biography ==
Ralph Wendell Burhoe was born on 21 June 1911, in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]]. He attended [[Harvard University]] from 1928 to 1932 as a student of [[meteorology]] and [[climatology]], though never completing his degree.  He then entered [[Andover Newton Theological School]].&lt;ref name=sch&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e4oaXKWybqgC ''Theology in a Global Context: The Last Two Hundred Years''], Hans Schwarz, [[Wm. B. Eerdmans]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-8028-2986-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2986-3}}, 597 pages, p.561-562&lt;/ref&gt; Burhoe spent eighteen months in theological study at Andover.  Instead of becoming a minister as he had planned, he returned to Harvard University as an employee of the [[Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory]], finding some success as a scientist.  He went on to become the first full-time executive director of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] starting in 1947.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; His position at the AAAS brought him into close contact with such eminent scientists as the astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]], the geologist [[Kirtley Mather]], and the biologist [[George Wald]]. While there, he was one of the founders of the [[Institute on Religion in an Age of Science]].&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; In 1965, Burhoe joined the faculty at the [[Meadville Lombard Theological School]], the [[Unitarian Universalist]] seminary then in [[Hyde Park, Chicago]]. There he facilitated the founding of ''[[Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science]]'' and the Center for Advanced Study in Religion and Science (CASIRAS). After retiring from Meadville in 1974 he was affiliated with the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago]], where in 1988 he founded the Chicago Center for Religion and Science.&lt;ref name=remember&gt;[http://www.usao.edu/~facshaferi/BURHOE.HTML Remembering Ralph Burhoe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221174116/http://www.usao.edu/~facshaferi/BURHOE.HTML |date=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes are interred in the crypt at [[First Unitarian Church of Chicago]] where he was a member.

== Contributions ==
Ralph Wendell Burhoe pursued a passionate investigation into the differences and similarities of [[theology]] and science, becoming one of the world's most informed voices in communicating this evolving research. He played a major role in the interdisciplinary pursuit of issues at the boundary of science and religion by offering a common ground for dialogue. According to theologian [[Hans Schwarz (theologian)|Hans Schwarz]], the journal Zygon has "achieved a circulation far beyond the confines of theological journals." &lt;ref name=sch/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">A process of [[secularization]] in [[Syria]] occurred under the [[French Mandate of Syria|French mandate]] in the 1920s. Syria has been governed by the Arab nationalist [[Baath Party]] since 1963. The Baath regime combined [[Arab Socialism]] with elements of [[secularism|secular ideology]] and an [[authoritarian]] political system which also incorporated aspects of [[Islamic law]], with different court systems operating for religious minorities. Non-Muslims are forbidden from the role of head of state.

==Secularism in the Syrian constitution==
The [[Constitution of Syria]], drafted in 1973, makes Islam the state religion. The third article ruled that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) The religion of the President of the Republic has to be Islam.
(2) Islamic jurisprudence is a main source of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sy00000_.html Syria - Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, Article 35 guarantees religious freedom for every recognized religious communities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) The freedom of faith is guaranteed.  The state respects all religions.
(2) The state guarantees the freedom to hold any religious rites, provided they do not disturb the public order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sy00000_.html Syria - Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Syrian revolution began, the Constitution was amended in 2012. Article 3 now read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The religion of the President of the Republic is Islam; Islamic jurisprudence shall be a major source of legislation; The State shall respect all religions, and ensure the freedom to perform all the rituals that do not prejudice public order; The personal status of religious communities shall be protected and respected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/5100f02a2.html Syrian Arab Republic: Constitution, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Personal status]] law is still based on [[Sharia]]&lt;ref name=Sharia1&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/Syria_APS.doc|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|page=13|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied by Sharia Courts.&lt;ref name=Sharia2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/islamic-family-law/home/research/legal-profiles/syria-syrian-arab-republic/|title=Islamic Family Law: Syria (Syrian Arab Republic)|publisher=Law.emory.edu|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria has a dual legal system which includes both secular and religious courts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Syria-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;Civil and criminal cases are heard in secular courts, while the Sharia courts handle personal, family, and religious matters in cases between Muslims or between Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=140&amp;edition=8&amp;ccrcountry=169&amp;section=89&amp;ccrpage=37|title=Syria - Country report - Countries at the Crossroads - 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslim communities have their own religious courts using their own religious law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/syria/31.htm|title=Syria - Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Proposed constitutional changes===
After Russian-brokered [[Syrian peace process|peace talks]] between Syrian civil war parties in [[Astana]] in January 2017, [[Russia]] offered a draft for a future constitution of Syria, which would inter alia turn the "[[Syrian Arab Republic]]" into the "Republic of Syria", introduce decentralized authorities as well as elements of [[Federalization of Syria|federalism]] like "association areas", strengthen the parliament at the cost of the presidency, and realize [[Islam and secularism|secularism]] by abolishing Islamic jurisprudence as a source of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria Opposition Rejects Russian Draft of New Constitution|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-25/syria-opposition-rejects-russian-draft-of-new-constitution|publisher=Bloomberg|date=25 January 2017|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian draft constitution recognizes Kurdish language, no mentions of federalism|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/26012017|publisher=Rudaw|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=رووداو تنشر مسودة الدستور السوري التي أعدها خبراء روس|url=http://www.rudaw.net/mobile/arabic/middleeast/syria/250120172|publisher=Rudaw|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moscow invites Kurds and Syrian opposition to explain Astana|url=http://aranews.net/2017/01/moscow-invites-kurds-and-syrian-opposition-to-explain-astana/|publisher=[[ARA News]]|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Democratic Federation of Northern Syria==
In the de facto autonomous [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]], secularism was introduced, including civil law in personal status, proclaiming absolute equality of women under the law and a ban on [[forced marriage]] as well as [[polygamy]], &lt;ref name=jolie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37337908|title=Kurdish 'Angelina Jolie' devalued by media hype|work=BBC|date=2016-09-12|accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; while underage marriage was outlawed as well.&lt;ref name=underage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/11/syrian-kurds-tackle-underage-marriages-polygamy/|title=Syrian Kurds tackle conscription, underage marriages and polygamy|work=ARA News|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=2016-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116150435/http://aranews.net/2016/11/syrian-kurds-tackle-underage-marriages-polygamy/|archivedate=16 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in Syrian history, [[civil marriage]] is being allowed and promoted.&lt;ref name=marriage&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria Kurds challenging traditions, promote civil marriage|url=http://aranews.net/2016/02/syria-kurds-challenging-traditions-promote-civil-marriage/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222111444/http://aranews.net/2016/02/syria-kurds-challenging-traditions-promote-civil-marriage/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-02-22|publisher=ARA News|date=2016-02-20|accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shilahara Dynasty''' ([[IAST]]: Śilāhāra; also Sinhara, Shailahara, Shrilara, or Silara) was a royal clan that established itself in northern and southern [[Konkan]], present-day [[Mumbai]] and southern Maharashtra during the [[Rashtrakuta]] period.

They were split into three branches; one branch ruled North [[Konkan]], the second South Konkan (between 765 and 1029), while the third ruled what is now known as modern districts of Satara, Kollapura and Belagavi between 940 and 1215 after which they were overwhelmed by the [[Chalukya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origins==
The dynasty originally began as vassals of the [[Rashtrakuta]] dynasty which ruled the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] plateau between the 8th and 10th centuries.  Govinda II, a [[Rashtrakuta]] king, conferred the kingdom of North Konkan (modern districts of [[Thane District|Thane]], [[Mumbai Suburban District|Mumbai]] and [[Raigad District|Raigad]]) on Kapardin ([[Sanskrit]]: Wearing the kaparda, a peculiar braid or knot of hair - also a term for god [[Shiva]]/ [[Rishabhanatha]]) I, founder of the Northern Silhara family, around 800.  Since then North Konkan came to be known as Kapardi-dvipa or Kavadidvipa. The capital of this branch was Puri, now known as Rajapur in the Raigad District.

The dynasty bore the title of ''Tagara-puradhishvara'', which indicates that they originally hailed from Tagara (modern Ter in the [[Osmanabad District]]).

Around 1343 the island of [[Salsette]], and eventually the whole archipelago, passed to the [[Muzaffarids (Gujarat)|Muzaffarid dynasty]].

[[Shilaharas of Southern Maharashtra]] at Kolhapur was the latest of the three and was founded about the time of downfall of the Rashtrakuta Empire.

All the branches of this family traced their descent from the legendary Vidyadhara prince [[Nagananda|Jimutavahana]], who sacrificed himself to rescue a Naga prince from the clutches of [[Garuda]]. The family-name ''Shilahara'' (meaning "mountain-peak food" in Sanskrit) is supposed to have been derived from this incident. Even single inscriptions have more than one form of the name, one has the three forms Silara, Shilara and Shrillara.

Lassen suggests that the Shilaharas were of Afghan origin as Silar Kafirs are still found in Afghanistan, but the "Ayya" used in the names of almost all their ministers and the non-Sanskrit names of some of the chiefs support the view that they were of [[Kannada]]  origin. The Shilaharas of South [[Konkan]] were the vassals of [[Rashtrakuta]]s and ruled from 765 to 1020.&lt;ref&gt;Dept. Gazetteer: Thane,1982: Dept. Gazetteer: 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

This house's history is known through one record, the Kharepatan plates of Rattaraja issued in 1008. Rattaraja was the last ruler of this dynasty. The document is extremely important as it not only gives the genealogy of the ten ancestors of Rattaraja but also mentions their exploits. The founder, Sanaphulla, was vassal of the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rastrakuta]] emperor Krisna I who had established his power over [[Konkan]] by 765 and probably handed it to Sanaphulla. The Kharepatan plates declare that Sanaphulla obtained lordship over the territory between Sahya mountain and the sea through the favour of Krisnaraja.

Sana-phulla's son Dhammayira is known to have built a fort at Vallipattana on the Western Coast. Aiyaparaja secured victory at Chandrapuri ([[Chandor]]) in Goa. The reign of Avasara I proved to be uneventful. His son Adityavarman, who described as brilliant as the Sun in valour, offered help to the kings of Chandrapuri and Chemulya (modern Chaul), 30 miles to the south of Bombay, so the influence of the Shilaharas had spread over the whole of [[Konkan]]. At this time Laghu Kapardi, the ruler of the [[Thane]] branch, was just a boy and the help given to the ruler of Chaul must have been at his expense. Avasara II continued the policy of his father. Indraraja's son Bhima is styled as 'Rahuvadgrasta Chandramandala' because he overthrew the petty ruler of Chandor. At this time the Kadamba ruler Sasthadeva and his son Chaturbhuja were trying to overthrow the Rastrakuta rule. This explains Bhima's opposition to Chandrapuri or Chandor. Avasara III, no doubt, ruled in troubled times, but had no contribution of his to make. Finally, Rattaraja, loyal to the Rastrakutas, was compelled to transfer his allegiance to Taila II .

Soon after the issue of the plates in 1008, the rule of [[Konkan]] passed over to the later Chalukyas.  (Dept. Gazetteer: Kolaba,1964, Dept. Gazetteer: 2002 )

The Shilahara family at [[Kolhapur]] was the latest of the three and was founded about the time of the downfall of the [[Rashtrakuta]] Empire. They ruled over southern [[Maharashtra]]; the modern districts of Satara, Kolhapur and Belgaon. Their family deity was the goddess Mahalakshmi, whose blessing they claimed to have secured in their copperplate grants (Mahalakshmi-labdha-vara-prasada). Like their relatives of the northern branch of [[Konkan]], the Shilaharas of [[Kolhapur]] claimed to be of the lineage of the Vidyadhara Jimutavahana. They carried the banner of golden Garuda. One of the many titles used by the Shilaharas was ''Tagarapuravaradhisvara'', supreme sovereign ruler of Tagara.&lt;ref&gt;Bhandarkar : 1957, Fleet: 1896&lt;/ref&gt;

The first capital of the Shilaharas was probably at Karad during the reign of Jatiga-II as known from their copper plate grant of Miraj and 'Vikramankadevacharita' of Bilhana.&lt;ref&gt;(Dept. Gazetteer: 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Hence sometimes they are referred as 'Shilaharas of Karad'. Later on although the capital was shifted to [[Kolhapur]], some of their grants mention Valavada, and the hill fort of Pranalaka or Padmanala, ([[Panhala]]) as the places of royal residence. Even though the capital was shifted to [[Kolhapur]], Karhad retained its significance during the Shilahara period. This branch rose to power the latter part of the [[Rashtrakuta]] rule and so, unlike the kings of the other two branches, those of this branch do not mention the genealogy of the [[Rashtrakuta]]s even in their early grants. Later on they acknowledged the suzerainty of the [[Kalyani Chalukya|later Chalukya]] for some time. ''They had used [[Kannada]] as the official language as can be seen from their inscriptions''. This branch continued to hold the Southern [[Maharashtra]] from circa 940 to 1220.

It seems that [[Bhoja II (Shilahara dynasty)|Bhoja II]], the last ruler of this family, was overthrown and dispossessed by Singhana in or soon after 1219-20 (Saka 1131) as is borne out by one of Singhana’s inscriptions dated Saka 1160.&lt;ref&gt;Fleet: 1896&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Squire Fridell''' (born February 9, 1943) is an American [[actor]] and co-owner and operator of GlenLyon Vineyards,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.glenlyonwinery.com/about/family-clan/details/2&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps best known for his infectious enthusiasm displayed in over three thousand television [[commercials]].

== Career ==

Since 1978, he has portrayed “The Toyotaman” in American TV ads for The [[Toyota Motor Corporation]].  From 1985 to 1991, he served as the official "[[Ronald McDonald]]" clown character in American television commercials for the [[McDonald's Corporation]] chain of fast-food restaurants, and even played the character in ''[[Mac and Me]]'' and the voice talent of a character in the 1989 [[DIC Entertainment|DiC]] animated film ''The Adventures of Ronald McDonald: McTreasure Island''. From the 1970s until the mid-1990s, Fridell also had supporting character roles in a number of popular TV series, such as ''[[Rosetti and Ryan]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Newhart]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'' and ''[[Adam-12]]''.

In 1980, [[Harmony Books]] published Fridell's book, ''Acting in Television Commercials for Fun and Profit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Squire Fridell Reveals How-to In Commercials |work=[[Anchorage Daily News]] |date=December 22, 1980 |page=d-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently re-released by [[Random House]] in 2005.

Fridell returned as himself in several Toyota commercials in 2010, responding to the image damage the company suffered due to a slow response to safety issues in 2009.

In the summer of 1961, Squire Fridel III, was a seasonal firefighter for the California Department of Forestry (CDF), (now called Cal-Fire) and was stationed at the Alder Point Station in Humboldt, California. He reported directly to CDF Engineer Del Schank, Sr. who went on to make a career in the CDF as a fire captain and still lives in Napa, CA. He is fondly remembered for his cooking abilities and his midnight appropriations of car fenders. His sense of humor was clearly evident even at this early stage of his life. That same summer, he worked with the now-famous Keith Kay, of NBC and CBS War Photographer and producer fame.

He currently resides with his wife, Suzy, at [[Glen Ellen, California|Glen Ellen]] (in the [[Sonoma Valley]] region of that state) where they have operated the GlenLyon Vineyards and Winery since 1989. Squire and Suzy (a professional dancer and dance teacher for many years) have one daughter, Lexy, who is pursuing an acting career in [[New York City]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1051">'''Sternomancy''', from the Greek [[sternon]] (chest) is a [[divination]] practice involving reading the markings or bumps on the [[chest]] or [[breast bone]] (or the area "from the [[breast]] to the [[Abdomen|belly]]", according to some sources).  Sternomancy may have been commonly practiced on victims of [[sacrifice]], including [[human sacrifice]]. Sternomancy may also include speaking through the chest (believed to be an early form of [[ventriloquism]]).

The size and shape of the sternum bone are taken into consideration, as well as the way in which the bone burns when placed into a [[fire]]. The old holiday custom of the breaking of a chicken's or turkey's [[furcula|wishbone]] by two persons is actually a remnant of this type of divination.

Sternomancy is related to [[phrenology]] (head-reading), [[palmistry]] (chiromancy) and [[scapulomancy]] (divination by observing animal shoulder-blades).

The  '''Religious Institute, Inc.''' is a progressive American multi-faith organization dedicated to advocating for [[sexual health]], [[sex education|education]], and justice in faith communities and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religiousinstitute.org/about-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123223619/http://www.religiousinstitute.org/about-us |archivedate=2012-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-founded in 2001 by [[Debra Haffner]], a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] and [[sexology|sexologist]], and Larry Greenfield, an American Baptist minister and theologian.

The Religious Institute’s stated purpose is "to change the way America understands the relationship of sexuality and religion". Among its objectives are building a network of clergy and other religious leaders who are dedicated to sexual justice, promoting sexuality education in faith communities, and educating policymakers and the general public about a progressive religious view of sexuality.

==Religious Declaration on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing==
In May 1999, twenty theologians from various traditions came together to formulate the "Religious Declaration on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing". It offers a progressive religious framework for sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |publisher=[[SIECUS]] |url=http://www.adherents.com/misc/siecus_press_rel.html |date=January 18, 2000 |title=Historic Religious Statement Calls on Faith Communities to Promote Sexual Justice and Healing for All |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, it had been endorsed by over 2,250 religious leaders from over 35 religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Virginity or death!: and other social and political issues of our time |last=Pollitt |first=Katha |authorlink=Katha Pollitt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I7MAbzvcpv8C&amp;pg=PA207 |page=207 |publisher=Random House |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A new start==
At its inception, the Religious Institute was a program of Christian Community, Inc. That organization became defunct in February 2012. In March 2012,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/90-0802328/religious-institute.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; the Religious Institute incorporated as an independent organization, Religious Institute, Inc, and received IRS recognition as a non-profit educational organization shortly thereafter.

The Religious Institute addresses a variety of sexual and reproductive justice concerns through advocacy, education, and development of resources as well as through partnerships with clergy and congregations, national religious organizations, and sexual and reproductive health organization.

===Sexually healthy faith communities===
The Religious Institute believes that all religious communities are responsible for addressing sexuality. It defines a sexually healthy faith community as one that is “committed to fostering spiritual, sexual, and emotional health among the congregation and providing a safe environment where sexuality issues are addressed with respect, mutuality, and openness.” Sexuality is integrated with spirituality in liturgies, pastoral care, religious education with both youth and adults, and in community social action programs.

===Sexuality education===
The Religious Institute believes that religious communities have a unique role in providing sexuality education. Its publication ''A Time to Speak: Faith Communities and Sexuality Education'' provides ideas and resources for faith communities on how to provide sexuality education for their congregants as well as support sexuality education in their communities.

===Seminary education===
The Religious Institute has engaged seminaries in the United States to institute new courses and institutional changes on sexuality issues, through sexuality education for seminarians, including a classroom graduate course; an online, graduate-level course; faculty and student training workshops; and ongoing research on seminary practices.
This work builds on a 2009 study by the Religious Institute, ''Sex and the Seminary: Preparing Ministers for Sexual Justice and Health''&lt;ref&gt;http://religiousinstitute.org/research-report/sex-and-the-seminary-preparing-ministers-for-sexual-health-and-justice&lt;/ref&gt; that surveyed 36 seminaries and rabbinical schools of varying size and geographic location, representing a range of Christian, Jewish and Unitarian Universalist traditions, which found sexuality courses largely absent from most seminary curricula and degree requirements. This study also outlines the criteria by which a seminary, rabbinical or divinity school could be considered as sexually healthy and responsible.

In January 2012, the Religious Institute began classifying seminaries, rabbinical and divinity school meeting a majority of the criteria as Sexually Healthy and Responsible Seminaries. At that time, twenty institutions met this criteria, compared to ten at the time of the 2009 study.

===Adolescent sexuality===
The Religious Institute feels that faith communities serve more youth than any other agency other than schools and therefore has the opportunity and obligation to have honest discussions with adolescents about sexuality. The Institute encourages faith communities to speak openly with teens about their sexuality, provide accurate information, and affirm sexuality as a blessing.

===Reproductive justice===
The Religious Institute affirms the moral agency of women and asks faith communities to support reproductive rights. It holds that abortion should be safe, legal, accessible, and rare. It supports "responsible procreation", accessible and affordable contraception, prenatal care, and "intentional parenting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWsSiN1I2AUC&amp;pg=PA229 |chapter=An open letter to religious leaders on abortion as a moral decision |year=2005 |title=Jesus is not a Republican: the religious right's war on America |publisher=Da Capo Press |pages=229–233 |editor=Clint Willis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage equality===
The Religious Institute believes that [[marriage equality]] concerns not only issues of gaining access to legal protections for same-sex couples, but it is also a matter of justice. It calls upon religious communities to affirm [[sexual diversity]] and all loving, mutual relationships as sacred.

===Sexual and gender diversity===
The Religious Institute challenges religious leaders to speak publicly about issues of sexual diversity and to advocate, both in secular and faith-based contexts, for the justice and the full inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, including the ordination of LGBT clergy. On the completion of the Institute's "Open Letter to Religious Leaders on Sexual and Gender Diversity", Haffner commented, “Sexual and gender oppression can no longer be portrayed as virtuous and morally defensible. While religious denominations continue to debate issues of sexuality, the silence and condemnation of clergy have led to destroyed relationships, suicidal despair and discrimination and violence against LGBT persons. Denying that God created diversity as a blessing is denying Biblical teaching."

===Sexual abuse prevention===
The Religious Institute recognizes the responsibility of each faith community to ensure that it is sexually healthy and free of abuse and harassment. It works with congregations on issues of [[child sexual abuse]] and healthy childhood sexuality, sexual offenses and offenders, and how to develop democratic processes for times when action is required.

===HIV/AIDS===
The Religious Institute believes that all faith communities are "called by God to affirm a life of hope and healing in the midst of HIV/AIDS." In its publication ''The Age of AIDS: A Guide for Faith-Based Communities'' the Religious Institute in conjunction with PBS, Frontline, and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]](CPB) provides resources for faith communities in responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

==Services==

===Technical assistance===
The Religious Institute staff work with clergy, congregations, and denominational bodies on a one-time, short-term, or long-term basis to address sexuality issues. Staff can help choose or plan curricula, develop safe congregation policies, identify local consultants or referral sources, and respond to difficult situations and circumstances around a sexuality issue.

===Training workshops and speaking engagements===
The Religious Institute provides keynote speakers and workshop leaders for congregations as well as regional and national meetings on sexuality, spirituality, and religion; sexuality education for youth, parents, and adults; building sexually healthy faith communities; and other sexuality and religion topics.

===Media===
Religious Institute staff assist the media in identifying spokespeople from various denominations to speak on sexual justice issues.

===Clearinghouse===
The Religious Institute's clearinghouse includes information on sexuality and religion, including practices, resources, trends, and current controversies.

'''Thomas L. Thompson''' (born January 7, 1939 in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]) is a biblical scholar and theologian. He was professor of [[theology]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]] from 1993 to 2009, lives in Denmark and is now a Danish citizen.

Thompson is closely associated with the [[biblical minimalism|minimalist]] movement known as [[The Copenhagen School (theology)|The Copenhagen School]] (other figures include [[Niels Peter Lemche]], Keith Whitelam, and [[Philip R. Davies]]), a loosely knit group of scholars who hold that the Bible cannot be used as a source to determine the history of ancient Israel, and that "Israel" itself is a problematic concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Casey]] ''Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths?'' T&amp;T Clark 2014 THOMAS L. THOMPSON p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Thompson was raised as a Catholic and obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Duquesne University]], in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States, in 1962. After a year in Oxford, he moved to Tübingen, where he studied for twelve years with Kurt Galling and Herbert Haag.&lt;ref name="Intro" &gt;Philip R Davies.'Introduction' to Thomas L. Thompson, ''Biblical Narrative and Palestine's History: Changing Perspectives 2,'' Routledge 2014 p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime he was instructor in theology at [[Dayton University]] (1964–65) and Assistant Professor in Old Testament studies at the [[University of Detroit]] (1967–69). He then studied Catholic Theology at the [[University of Tübingen]]; his dissertation, "The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham", was completed in 1971 but rejected by the Catholic faculty (one of his examiners was [[Joseph Ratzinger]], then Tübingen's Professor of Systematic Theology and later Pope Benedict XVI). Thompson then considered submitting his dissertation to the Protestant faculty, but left Tübingen in 1975 without a degree. The rejected dissertation was published in 1974 by [[Walter de Gruyter|De Gruyter Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e1x9Rs_zdG8C&amp;pg=PP1 P.R.F. Moorey, "A Century of Biblical Archaeology", p.114].&lt;/ref&gt; The work, together with  John Van Seters' ''Abraham in History and Tradition'', became one of the pioneer works of [[Biblical minimalism]].&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt;

While teaching part-time at the [[University of North Carolina]] he was invited to finish his studies at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], receiving his Ph.D. in Old Testament Studies ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="memoire"&gt;Thompson, Thomas L. 2011. On the Problem of Critical Scholarship: A Memoire [http://www.bibleinterp.com/opeds/critscho358014.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3090200153/thompson-thomas-l-1939.html|title=Thompson, Thomas L. 1939– - Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy around his dissertation prevented him from obtaining a position at a North American university.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Thompson.''The Mythic Past'' (Basic Books: New York, 1999), p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; He continued as a private scholar while working as a high school teacher, janitor and house painter until he was awarded a guest professorship at the [[École Biblique]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 1984. This appointment proved controversial among Israelis, who, according to Thompson, objected to his earlier study casting doubt on the historicity of the Jewish origin narratives. He then worked on a project on Palestinian place names for [[UNESCO]], criticizing Israeli authorities for de-Arabicizing Palestinian place names. Accusations of [[antisemitism]] led to the project being closed.&lt;ref name="memoire"/&gt;

Thompson was named a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Fellow in 1988. He taught as visiting associate professor at [[Lawrence University]] (1988–89) and as associate professor at [[Marquette University]] (1989–1993), but did not receive tenure. In 1990, he met Danish theologian [[Niels Peter Lemche]] at a conference and in 1993 joined the faculty of the department of Theology at the [[University of Copenhagen]] as Professor in Old Testament exegesis. He retired and was granted emeritus status in 2009.

Thompson is general editor for the series ''Copenhagen International Seminar'' and associate editor of the ''[[Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament]]'', and serves on the editorial boards of the journals ''Holy Land Studies'' and ''Dansk Teologisk Tidsskrift''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalofbiblicalstudies.org/vitae/thomas_l_thompson.htm|title=Curricumul vitae for T.

==Old Testament writings==
The focus of Thompson's writing has been the interface between the Bible (specifically the Old Testament) and archaeology. His ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' (1974) was a critique of the then-dominant view that [[biblical archaeology]] had demonstrated the historicity of figures such as [[Abraham]] and other Biblical patriarchs.&lt;ref name="Brettler 1-21"&gt;Marc Brettler. "The Copenhagen School: The Historiographical Issues The Copenhagen School: The Historiographical Issues", ''AJS Review'', Vol. 27, No. 1 (April 2003), p. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''The Early History of the Israelite People From the Written and Archaeological Sources'' (1993) set out his argument that the biblical history was not reliable, and concludes: "The linguistic and literary reality of the biblical tradition is folkloristic in essence. The concept of a ''benei Israel'' ... is a reflection of no sociopolitical entity of the historical state of Israel of the Assyrian period...."&lt;ref name="Brettler 1-21"/&gt; In ''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past]]'' (U.S. title: ''The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel''), he argued that the Old Testament was entirely, or almost entirely, a product of the period between the fifth and second centuries B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dannyreviews.com/h/Bible_History.html A book review by Danny Yee]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson's arguments were criticized by many Biblical scholars, prominent among them [[William G. Dever]] in his book ''[[What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?]]'', which has been described as "a very polemic and partly vehement attack not least against Professor Thomas L. Thompson".&lt;ref name=Hagelia/&gt; Thompson himself reviewed Dever's book and provided his own responses to Dever's critiques. The fact that Thompson, as a target of many of the critiques advanced in the book would have chosen to review it, was criticized by H. Hagelia.&lt;ref name=Hagelia&gt;H. Hagelia. (2002). "Review or response? A critical evaluation of Thomas L. Thompson's review of William G. Dever." ''Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament'', 16(2), 314-318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament writings==
Thompson presented a criticism of the historicity of the [[New Testament]] in his 2005 book, ''The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David'',&lt;ref name="Thompson.Messiah.Myth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Thomas L.|authorlink=Thomas L. Thompson|title=The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bSkxEucWDAC&amp;pg=PA8|date=20 April 2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-3911-0|page=8|chapter=Historicizing the Figure of Jesus, the Messiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/thomas-l-thompson/the-messiah-myth-the-near-eastern-roots-of-jesus-and-david-9780712668439.aspx|title=The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David by Thomas L Thompson - Books - Random House Books Australia|last=[www.randomhouse.com.au]|first=Random House Books Australia|website=Random House Australia|access-date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the biblical accounts of both King David and Jesus of Nazareth are mythical in nature and based on Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Greek and Roman literature. For example, he argues that the resurrection of Jesus is taken directly from the myths about [[Dionysus]], which he described as a "dying and rising god". Thompson did not draw a final conclusion on the [[Historicity of Jesus|historicity or ahistoricity of Jesus]]. He was a fellow of the short-lived [[Jesus Project]] from 2008 to 2009 which was disbanded after funding was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Thoughts on the Demise of The Jesus Project|url=http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/JesusProject.htm|website=The Jesus Puzzle|publisher=[[Earl Doherty]]|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Messiah Myth'' was criticized by New Testament scholars such as [[Bart Ehrman]], who in 2012 published a criticism of [[Christ myth theory|Jesus ahistoricity theory]] proponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lataster|first1=Raphael|title=Questioning the Plausibility of Jesus Ahistoricity Theories — A Brief Pseudo-Bayesian Metacritique of the Sources|journal=The Intermountain West Journal of Religious Studies|date=2015|volume=6:1|page=63|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&amp;context=imwjournal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)|Did Jesus Exist?

''Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth.'' HarperOne, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2012 Thompson responded with the online article, ''Is This Not the Carpenter’s Son? A Response to Bart Ehrman'', in which he rejects Ehrman's characterization of his views as "mythicist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Thomas L.|title=Is This Not the Carpenter’s Son?

Thompson and Thomas Verenna coedited the 2012 book ''Is This Not the Carpenter?: The Question of the Historicity of the Figure of Jesus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://universitypublishingonline.org/open_pdf/CBO9781844657308A005?pubCode=ACU&amp;urlPrefix=acumen&amp;productCode=undefined Table of Contents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Thomas L.|last2=Verenna|first2=Thomas S.|title="Is this Not the Carpenter?": The Question of the Historicity of the Figure of Jesus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4SQZwEACAAJ|year=2012|publisher=Equinox|isbn=978-1-84553-986-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction defined the purpose of the collected essays: "Neither establishing the historicity of an historical Jesus nor possessing an adequate warrant for dismissing it, our purpose is to clarify our engagement with critical historical and exegetical methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Thomas L.

'''Uparkot caves''', also ''' Uperkot caves''', are ancient man-made [[caverns]]. The caves are a part of the [[Junagadh Buddhist Cave Groups]] situated in the eastern part of [[Junagadh]] of the [[India]]n state of [[Gujarat]].

==Caves==
These caves located at Uperkot beyond the 300&amp;nbsp;ft deep moat, close to Adi Kadi vav, were carved in 2nd–3rd century A.D. These caves have influence of [[Satavahana]] architecture with combination of ''[[Indo-Scythian|Graeco-Scythian]]'' style.

According to [[Archaeological Survey of India|ASI]] "The cave group is in three tiers, with all members of each galleries shown in semi-relief, but only two storeys having regular floors. The caves at Uparkot are cut into two floors. On the first floor, there is a ''[[Temple tank|Kunda]]'', a deep tank about 11 feet square, with a covered verandah round three sides of it. There is a big chamber with six pillars supporting the roof adjoining it. Under the corridor, in the rest of the area, in the walls on the north-east and west sides are stone bench-recesses, divided into long compartments with a base moulded in architectural courses below, and a frieze above, ornamented with horseshoe shaped ''chaitya'' windows and checker carvings.

"'''White Tulip'''" is the 18th [[List of Fringe episodes|episode]] of the [[Fringe (season 2)|second season]] of the American [[science fiction]] [[drama]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''. It follows a scientist ([[Peter Weller]]) in his quest to time travel back and save his fiancée, while the Fringe team investigates the consequences of his actions, and [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]) struggles to tell his son [[Peter Bishop|Peter]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]) he was stolen from the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] as a boy.

The episode was co-written by [[J.H. Wyman]] and [[Jeff Vlaming]], and was directed by [[Thomas Yatsko]]. Wyman later stressed the importance of "White Tulip" in the show's evolution, calling it a "mythalone" because its elements were designed to create the ideal episode to satisfy both new and hardcore viewers. Elements from this episode, in particular the idea of the white tulip as a sign of forgiveness, would be reused in later episodes.

It first aired in the United States on April 15, 2010 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] to an estimated 6.624 million viewers. It received positive reviews, and earned a nomination for Outstanding Sound Editing For A Series at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]]. It was ranked the best episode of the entire series by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', while [[IGN]] and [[Den of Geek]] ranked it as the second best.

==Plot==
[[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]) struggles with writing a letter to [[Peter Bishop|Peter]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]) to explain the events from 1985 that led Walter to bring Peter to his universe from the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel one]]. As he contemplates the final letter, he and the rest of the Fringe team are called to investigate several dead bodies in a passenger car of a train. Walter, after being told the victims' personal electronics were drained of power, suspects someone drew energy from both the people and their devices' batteries. They trace the man responsible to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[astrophysics]] professor Alistair Peck ([[Peter Weller]]), and enter his residence to search for clues, finding evidence that Alistair was studying time travel. Alistair arrives while the Fringe team is there, and activates a mechanism on his body, causing him to travel back in time.

Alistair reappears on the train at the same point in time as his previous travel, again having drained the people aboard it, and alters his behavior to avoid another encounter with the Fringe team. However, when they are brought to investigate this time, they have a feeling of déjà vu and find other evidence that points to Alistair, and determine that he is trying to go back in his personal time line several months ago to prevent the death of his fiancée in a car collision. Alistair is found at his MIT office.  Walter, having read through Alistair's writings on time travel, offers to go in and talk to Alistair first before the armed officers attempt to seize him.

[[File:White_Tulips.JPG|thumb|left|As a central theme of the episode, Walter seeks the sign of a white tulip as a sign of God's forgiveness and hope that Peter can forgive him.]]
Walter approaches Alistair as a fellow man of science, who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require a great deal more power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, a few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite being a man of science, Walter's torment over the years drove him to believe in a higher power, and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip.

Alistair considers this, but with Walter's time up, a SWAT team starts to move in. Alistair jumps back in time again by only a few hours to complete the modified power calculations based on Walter's comments, and to prepare a pre-addressed letter he brings with him. As the SWAT team barges in, Alistair re-engages his time machine. Alistair's modifications have worked, as he finds himself in the field, minutes before his fiancée's death. Alistair is able to make it to his fiancée in time, reuniting with her in the car just long enough to say "I love you" before they are both killed by the collision.

In the present, the events of the episode never occurred, and Walter, having time to contemplate the letter to Peter instead of being called to the case, tosses it into the fireplace. Later, he receives an envelope in the mail—the one Alistair had prepared and instructed to be delivered to Walter on this specific date. Inside, Walter finds a drawing of a white tulip.

==Production==

"White Tulip" was co-written by executive producer [[J. H.

[[IGN]] announced in January 2010 that actor [[Peter Weller]] had been cast in a guest starring role for an upcoming episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/106/1061568p1.html |title=Exclusive: The Star of a Sci-Fi Classic Comes to Fringe |work=[[IGN]]|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=2010-01-16 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he had normally kept his distance from episodic television because it "burns [him] out" and he was pursuing a [[Ph.D]] at [[UCLA]], his wife, a big ''Fringe'' fan, read the script and convinced him to accept the part of Alistair Peck, telling him "You've got to do this, it's beautiful, it's about a guy who wants to save his wife".&lt;ref name=ew3/&gt;&lt;ref name=blastr1/&gt; During a conference call with journalists, Weller also cited the character's "tremendously romantic and very moving" storyline as another reason he accepted the part.&lt;ref name=blastr1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blastr.com/2010/04/peter-weller-time-travels.php |title=Peter Weller time-travels on Fringe; plus, RoboCop! |work=[[Blastr]].com|last=Huddleston|first=Kathie|date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought the four-page scripted scene between him and [[John Noble]] was "rare for television [and] wonderfully written.

For the episode's time travel elements, sound effects editor Bruce Tanis explained his choices of sound during an interview with ''Designing Sound'': "I used vocals from the dialog to create high-pitched jittery tones that played against the visual of his time-jumping. He would start to flicker faster and faster as he ramped up to the moment of leaping so I wanted to play up the fragmented sense of time we had visually and create the idea that he was somehow jumping over other people to land at a different point in time. It also had electrical humming and zapping to support the electrical nature of the device".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://designingsound.org/2010/07/bruce-tanis-special-cutting-weird-things-on-fringe/ |title=Bruce Tanis Special: Cutting Weird Things on "Fringe"  |work=Designing Sound |last=Isaza |first=Miguel |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive producer J. H. Wyman later indicated how "White Tulip" helped with the evolution of the show in an interview: "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution came in the form of ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2010/09/23/pinker-wyman-tease-season-three-of-fringe/ |title=Pinker, Wyman Tease Season Three of "Fringe" |work=[[Slice of SciFi]] |last=Hickerson |first=Michael|date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Pinkner later listed "White Tulip" as one of their favorite episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogcritics.org/video/article/fringes-executive-producers-on-entrada-the/ |title =Fringe's Executive Producers on "Entrada," the Changes at Hand, and the Love Triangle – Part II |date=  2010-12-09 |accessdate= 2011-02-04 |work = Blogcritics.com|first = |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
Reviews of "White Tulip" were overwhelmingly positive. Ken Tucker from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' enjoyed the episode, writing "Fringe is becoming ever more adroit at blending its mythology with its paranormal cases". He also praised guest star [[Peter Weller]]'s performance.&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/04/16/fringe-season-2-episode-18-peter-weller/ |title='Fringe' recap: Walter, a 'White Tulip,' and Peter Weller |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially expecting a "filler" episode, Ramsey Isler of ''[[IGN]]'' said he was "pleasantly proven wrong", as the "story turned out to be one of the best of the series". Isler continued that "the writers really did a good job of integrating the overall mythology into a standalone story that is actually damn good... It's brilliant storytelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/108/1084165p1.html |title=Fringe: "White Tulip" Review |work=[[IGN]] |last=Isler |first=Ramsey |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Hanson of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' enjoyed the episode, but wished Astrid got more screen time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/04/fringe-do-over.html |title='Fringe': Do-over |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Hanson |first=Andrew |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Heisler of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode an ''A'', explaining "Horror. Confusion.

''The A.V.

'White Tulip' is ''Fringe''{{'}}s purest, finest example of fulsome emotions tempered by stringent ideas. The tulip of the title represents forgiveness — faith in love — and became within the series a semi-recurring symbol of fragile hope, and, to the show's audience, a cynosure of the devotion of ''Fringe'' fandom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20647938_20663740,00.html |title='Fringe': 19 Best Episodes |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Jeff |last=Jensen |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2013-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN ranked it as the second best, explaining that "despite a few technical flaws with special effects and a little under-utilization of Weller in the first half, the veteran cast delivers an excellent script with skill."&lt;ref name=ignrankings&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/22/top-10-fringe-episodes |title=Top 10 Fringe episodes |publisher=[[IGN]] |first=Ramsey |last=Isler |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"White Tulip" was referenced multiple times in the season three episode "[[Subject 13]]". Executive producer [[J. H. Wyman]] later commented in an interview that "the 'White Tulip' stuff is all connected thematically because that was the episode where Walter believes in God," and further explained that these themes would return again in the [[The Day We Died|season three finale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Exclusive-Fringe-Producers-1029815.aspx?rss=news&amp;partnerid=spi&amp;profileid=05 |title=Exclusive: Fringe Producers on Peter and Olivia's First Meeting…and Their Future! |publisher=[[TV Guide]] |first=Damian |last=Holbrook |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final reference to the white tulip is in season five, the series finale, which aired January 18, 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3722">'''Yer-sub''' ('''Yar-Sub''' also '''Yer-Su''' or '''Yir-sub''') are a category of nature spirits in the [[Altaic mythologies|Turkic-Mongolian belief]] of [[Tengriism]]. The name means "Earth&amp;ndash;Water" in [[Turkic languages]].

The word Yer-Sub had two meanings. One was the name of natural spirits, the other the visible world, the Native Land.

==Spirits of Earth and Water==
Tengrist people believe that Yer-sub spirits exist in trees, lakes, mountains, stones, and sometimes in a whole empire, and that Yer-sub spirits are the forgotten souls of ancestors. They think that, if the name of an ancestor is not mentioned any more, that ancestor's soul will become object in the nature.

Tengrists are required to be careful and respectful towards nature, so as not to disturb the Yer-sub spirits. They also must be thankful to them, when they take something from nature.

Demons and spirits served important functions in pre-industrial Turkic / Altaic societies and were considered to be very interactive in the lives and domains of humans. Some spirits were benevolent and could be helpful in human tasks, others were harmful and often destructive. These spirits were also considered to be derived from ancestors or certain deceased humans. Such spirits could appear at will in various forms including that of different animals or human form. Some of these spirits could also participate in malevolent activity to harm humans, such as drowning humans, obstructing the harvest, or sucking the blood of livestock and sometimes humans. Hence, the Turkic peoples were obliged to appease these spirits to prevent the spirits from their potential for erratic and destructive behaviour.

Yar-Sub or Yer-Su is mentioned together with Gök-Tengri in the Orkhon Inscriptions, under the name ''Yduk'' (Turkish: Iduk, Idık "Sacred") Yar-Sub (Earth-Water). One of the records states: "Turkic Tengri and Turkic sacred Yer-Sub said in Heaven: "Let not the Turkic people vanish! Let them be a Nation!" The ancient Turkic people called the visible world occupied by their people Yar-Sub (Earth-Water) or Middle Earth, emphasising its central location.

==Natural forces==
In Turkic community, each '''boy''' (clan) and tribe had their territory, the boundaries of which outlined their world. This Yar-Sub (Land-Water or Earth-Aqua) was theirs, beyond which were others possessions. Their own limited Yer-Sub (Yer-Su) was not just a settled space but also a smaller version of the world. For each boy (clan), their land was the centre of the world and a focus of order and harmony. "Native land" was not only a geographical concept, but was also a space that could be emotionally perceived by man. It was the land of the Clan and of the Ata-Ana (Ancestors) and could never be sold or given away.

The dominant role in determining the fate of people and ulus (nations) belonged to Gök-Tengri, but natural forces yielded to Yar-Sub. Sometimes on Tengri's command, Yer-Sub punished people for their sins. But they are generally considered benevolent. To appease Yar-Sub, sacrifices were made every spring in preparation for the cattle-breeding season and before planting crops. With the disintegration of the ancient Turkic states, the rituals to Yer-Sub (Yer-Su) began to take on distinct local forms. As in ancient ages, they were conducted in the upper rivulets and on the shores of lakes. White rams were sacrificed and hung on a tree, under which a prayer was conducted. After the ritual, participants feasted and exchanged gifts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5754">'''ʿAnāq bint Ādam''' (أناف بنت آدم) is, in some varieties of [[Islam]]ic mythology, a daughter of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] and [[Eve]], sometimes even their first child. She is portrayed as evil.

==Summary of traditions==

A summary of the diverse traditions about ʿAnāq is provided by Roberto Tottoli:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to some reports ʿAnāq was born alone, with no twin brother, or, in other reports, she was [[Cain|Cain's]] sister, and he, after killing [[Abel]], brought her to Yemen, where he married her&lt;ref&gt;For this tradition, Tottoli cites [[Al-Kisa'i|al-Kisāʾī]], ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya|Qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʾ]]'', ed. by Isaac Eisenberg (Leiden 1922–23), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; ... She was said to be the first one to commit fornication and to act badly on earth and because of this she was later killed. Some traditions add particulars about her monstrous appearance, such as that she had two heads, or twenty fingers with two nails each, or that she had long nails. It is also stated that she was the first person killed on earth, and that she was killed by ravaging beasts or by a gigantic lion sent by God. The name ʿAnāq is usually employed in connection with the story of her son [[ʿŪj]], the giant who survived the Flood and was later killed by [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Tottoli, “ʿAnāq”, in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE'', ed. by Kate Fleet and others (first published online 2009), &lt;https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_22679&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Significance of name==

ʿAnāq's name seems to correspond in some way to male giant [[Anak]] in Hebrew tradition, where he is portrayed as the father of [[Og]] (just as ʿAnāq is the mother of ʿŪj). However, her name can also be understood to mean ‘misfortune’ or ‘calamity’ or to evoke the word ''ʿināq'' (‘embrace’).&lt;ref&gt;Amina Inloes, 'Negotiating Shīʿī Identity and Orthodoxy through Canonizing Ideologies about Women in Twelver Shīʿī Aḥādīth on Pre-Islamic Sacred History in the Qurʾān' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Exeter, 2015), pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word also means '[[caracal]]' (a kind of [[lynx]]) (more usually in the fuller form ''ʿanāq al-arḍ'').&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Tottoli, “ʿAnāq”, in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE'', ed. by Kate Fleet and others (first published online 2009), &lt;https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_22679&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example ''ḥadīth''==

One ''[[ḥadīth]]'' mentioning ʿAnāq, for example, is the following, included in ''[[al-Kāfī]]'' by [[Muḥammad ibn Yaʿqūb al-Kulaynī]] (864-941 CE), where Muḥammad attributes the material to [[ʿAlī]], and translated by Amina Inloes.&lt;ref&gt;Amina Inloes, 'Negotiating Shīʿī Identity and Orthodoxy through Canonizing Ideologies about Women in Twelver Shīʿī Aḥādīth on Pre-Islamic Sacred History in the Qurʾān' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Exeter, 2015), p. 100, citing .&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;O people! Corruption (''baghy'') leads its perpetrator to the Fire. The first to commit [the crime of] corruption against Allah was ʿAnāq, the daughter of Adam. She was the first person whom Allah killed, and she used to inhabit a place made of earth. She had twenty fingers; on each finger were two claws like two sickles. So Allah set upon her a vulture like a mule, and it overpowered her like a lion overpowers an elephant, or a wolf overpowers a camel. So We killed her, and thus Allah has killed the tyrants when they were in their best condition and secure in their positions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cultural significance==

The role of ʿAnāq in Islamicate traditions can be seen as similar to that of [[Lilith]] in Judaeo-Christian traditions, providing a monstrous female near the very beginning of human existence, through whom misogynistic ideology can be conveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Amina Inloes, 'Negotiating Shīʿī Identity and Orthodoxy through Canonizing Ideologies about Women in Twelver Shīʿī Aḥādīth on Pre-Islamic Sacred History in the Qurʾān' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Exeter, 2015), pp. 99-102.&lt;/ref&gt;
