      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5215">'''Abraham Yagel'''&lt;ref&gt;Abraham ben Hananiah dei Galicci Yagel or Jagel&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Monselice]] 1553 &amp;ndash; 1623) was an Italian Jewish catechist, philosopher, and [[Kabbalah|cabalist]]. He lived successively at [[Luzzara]], [[Venice]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Sassuolo]].

==Life and identity==
[[Giulio Bartolocci]],&lt;ref&gt;"Bibliotheca Magna Rabbinica," i. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by De Rossi,&lt;ref&gt;"Dizionario," i. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf,&lt;ref&gt;"Bibl. Hebr." i., No. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julius Fürst]],&lt;ref&gt;"Bibl. Jud." ii. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; erroneously identified Abraham Yagel with the Christian censor [[Camillo Jagel]], declaring that Abraham Jagel embraced Christianity and changed his name to "Camillo Jagel." The untenability of this identification has been proved by later scholars, including [[Hananiah Coèn]].&lt;ref&gt;"Saggio di Eloquenza Ebrea," p. 25, Florence, 1827&lt;/ref&gt;

Coèn's chief argument is that many books dated as early as 1611 bear the signature of "Inquisitor Camillo Jagel," while Abraham Yagel was known in 1615 as a pious Jew, as is shown by the following adventure related by himself. In 1615 he was captured by bandits soon after leaving Luzzara, between [[Reggio Emilia|Reggio]] and [[Guastalla]]. His traveling companion, Raphael Modena, a rich Jew of Sassuolo, to whose house Yagel acted as family adviser, was captured with him. Yagel was sent back by the bandits to Modena's family for a ransom; the sum being too high, the rabbis and influential Jews of Modena came to his aid, and, supported by the duke and his brother, the cardinal, obtained Modena's liberty.

==Works==
Many details of Yagel's life are given in his "Ge Ḥizzayon," the first part of which was published by [[Baruch Mani]] (Alexandria, 1880). It purports to be the relation of a dream in which he saw his deceased father, to whom he narrated the events of his life. After his father's death he went, an inexperienced youth, to Luzzara, where he became involved in an inheritance trial, and was thrown into prison. It seems that he was imprisoned for a considerable time, for he wrote there one of his important works.

Yagel was the author of the following works: "Leḳaḥ Ṭob," a catechism (Venice, 1587); "Moshia' Ḥosim," a treatise on curing the pest by prayer and fasting (Venice, 1587; this work is extant in manuscript under the title "Oraḥ Ḥayyim"; see Neubauer, "Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS." No. 2310, 1); "Eshet Ḥayil," on the virtues of a wife and her duties toward her husband (Venice, 1606); "Bet Ya'ar ha-Lebanon" (see below); "Be'er Sheba'," on the secular sciences; "Peri Megadim," not extant, but mentioned by Yagel in another work.

It is evident that Yagel endeavored to make his "Leḳaḥ Ṭob" conform to the catechisms then used by the Roman clergy; like the latter, he pointed out seven "cardinal sins" (), six other sins that are "hated by God," and four sins that themselves "cry out for vengeance." With the Roman clergy, he treats of the three virtues of faith, hope, and charity, and defines faith in the Christian sense. On the other hand, he deviates much from the Christian catechisms by omitting the Decalogue, lest the heretics say that the Torah is only the Decalogue (comp. Ber. 12a). [[Isaiah Horowitz]], Yagel's contemporary, quotes in his "Shene Luḥot ha-Berit" (section "Gate of Letters," s.v. ) a long passage from the "Leḳaḥ Ṭob," treating of love toward one's neighbor. This work has been translated into Latin by [[Ludwig Veil]] (London, 1679), [[Carpzov]] (Leipsic, 1687), [[Odhelius]] (Frankfort-on-the-Oder, 1691), [[Hermann van der Hardt]] (Helmstädt, 1704), and [[Johannes Buxtorf|Buxtorf]] (unpublished). A Judæo-German translation was made by [[Jacob b. Mattithiah Treves]] (Amsterdam, 1658), and was followed by three German translations—one by Bock (Leipsic, 1694), one from Van der Hardt's Latin translation (Jesnitz, 1722), and one by [[Karl Anton]] (Brunswick, 1756). An English translation from one of the Latin versions, called "The Jews' Catechism, Containing the Thirteen Articles of the Jewish Religion" was printed in London (1721).

"Bet Ya'ar ha-Lebanon," in four parts, discusses Cabala, metaphysics, and natural history. The thirtieth chapter of the second part was published by Reggio in his "Iggerot Yashar" (Vienna, 1834).

The English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the word ''agnostic'' in 1869, and said "It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe."
Earlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as [[Sanjaya Belatthaputta]], a 5th-century BCE [[Ancient Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] who expressed agnosticism about any [[afterlife]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html |title=Samaññaphala Sutta: The Fruits of the Contemplative Life |others=a part of the Digha Nikaya translated in 1997 by Thanissaro Bhikkhu |quote=If you ask me if there exists another world (after death),&amp;nbsp;...

==Defining agnosticism==

{{quote|Agnosticism is of the essence of science, whether ancient or modern. It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe.

Consequently, agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of popular theology, but also the greater part of anti-theology. On the whole, the "bosh" of [[heterodoxy]] is more offensive to me than that of orthodoxy, because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason and science, and orthodoxy does not.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/Rdetc/AgnAnn.html "Agnosticism: A Symposium"], ''The Agnostic Annual.'' 1884&lt;/ref&gt;|Thomas Henry Huxley}}

{{quote|That which Agnostics deny and repudiate, as immoral, is the contrary doctrine, that there are propositions which men ought to believe, without logically satisfactory evidence; and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html "Agnosticism and Christianity"], ''Collected Essays V'', 1899&lt;/ref&gt;|Thomas Henry Huxley}}

{{quote|Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle&amp;nbsp;... Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn.html "Agnosticism"], ''Collected Essays V'', 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=Thomas Henry|date=April 1889|title=Agnosticism|journal=[[Popular Science|The Popular Science Monthly]]|publisher=[[D.

Being a scientist, above all else, [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting, objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. [[Karl Popper]] would also describe himself as an agnostic.&lt;ref name="Edward Zerin 1998"&gt;Edward Zerin: Karl Popper On God: The Lost Interview. ''Skeptic'' '''6''':2 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; According to philosopher [[William L. Rowe]], in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.&lt;ref name=RoweRoutledge/&gt;

[[George H. Smith]], while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word,&lt;ref&gt;George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word,&lt;ref&gt;George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to [[theism]] and [[atheism]] and promotes terms such as [[agnostic atheism]] (the view of those who do not ''believe'' in the existence of any [[deity]], but do not claim to ''know'' if a deity does or does not exist) and [[agnostic theism]] (the view of those who do not claim to ''know'' of the existence of any deity, but still ''believe'' in such an existence).&lt;ref name=Smith1979&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FI7ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=atheism+the+case+against+god&amp;q=agnostic+theist#search_anchor |title=Atheism: The Case Against God |first=George H |last=Smith |authorlink=George H. Smith |pages=10–11 |quote=Properly considered, agnosticism is not a third alternative to theism and atheism because it is concerned with a different aspect of religious belief. Theism and atheism refer to the presence or absence of belief in a god; agnosticism refers to the impossibility of knowledge with regard to a god or supernatural being. The term ''agnostic'' does not, in itself, indicate whether or not one believes in a god. Agnosticism can be either theistic or atheistic. |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-87975-124-1 }}

I usually reply with a question like, "Well, are you a Republican or an American?" The two words serve different concepts and are not mutually exclusive. Agnosticism addresses knowledge; atheism addresses belief. The agnostic says, "I don't have a knowledge that God exists." The atheist says, "I don't have a belief that God exists." You can say both things at the same time. Some agnostics are atheistic and some are theistic.}}

''Agnostic'' ({{ety|grc|ἀ- (a-)|without||[[wikt:γνῶσις|γνῶσις]] (gnōsis)|knowledge}}) was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 to describe his philosophy, which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| page = 63| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}

Early [[Christian]] church leaders used the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[gnosis]]'' (knowledge) to describe "spiritual knowledge". Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of [[Gnosticism]] in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense.&lt;ref name="nknxjx"&gt;{{cite web|title=ag·nos·tic|website=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2011|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=agnostic&amp;submit.x=20&amp;submit.y=28|accessdate= November 15, 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of [[Skepticism|skeptical]], evidence-based inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97DaE6BzKTsC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Aphorisms and Reflections |first=Henrietta A.| last=Huxley|publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2004|edition=reprint |pages=41–42|isbn=978-1-4191-0730-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean "not knowable".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Additions Series, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
In technical and marketing literature, "agnostic" can also mean independence from some parameters—for example, "platform agnostic"&lt;ref name=SparkSheet&gt;{{cite web

===Qualifying agnosticism===
[[Scottish Enlightenment]] philosopher [[David Hume]] contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt. He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (e.g. [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] such as "all bachelors are unmarried" or "all triangles have three corners").&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David, "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" (1748)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
;Strong agnosticism (also called "hard", "closed", "strict", or "permanent agnosticism"): The view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities, and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience. A strong agnostic would say, "I cannot know whether a deity exists or not, and neither can you."&lt;ref name="Oppy2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oppy |first=Graham|title=Arguing about Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlVtfUxPD14C&amp;pg=PA15|date=September 4, 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45889-4|pages=15–}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
;Weak agnosticism (also called "soft", "open", "empirical", or "temporal agnosticism"): The view that the existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, one will withhold judgment until evidence, if any, becomes available. A weak agnostic would say, "I don't know whether any deities exist or not, but maybe one day, if there is evidence, we can find something out."&lt;ref name="Oppy2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poidevin2010" /&gt;
;Apathetic agnosticism: The view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans. Therefore, their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apatheticagnostic.com/ourchurch/faith.html|title=Commentary on the Articles of Faith|author=John Tyrrell|year=1996|quote=To believe in the existence of a god is an act of faith.

presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of God. The skeptical empiricism of [[David Hume]], the [[antinomy|antinomies]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], and the existential philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts, regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of God.&lt;ref name="RoweRoutledge-online"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.texttribe.com/routledge/A/Agnosticism.html |title=Agnosticism |first=William L. |last=Rowe |authorlink=William L.

{{quote|Let us call this unknown something: God. It is nothing more than a name we assign to it. The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something (God) exists, could scarcely suggest itself to Reason. For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it. For at the very outset, in beginning my proof, I would have presupposed it, not as doubtful but as certain (a presupposition is never doubtful, for the very reason that it is a presupposition), since otherwise I would not begin, readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist. But if when I speak of proving God's existence I mean that I propose to prove that the Unknown, which exists, is God, then I express myself unfortunately. For in that case I do not prove anything, least of all an existence, but merely develop the content of a conception.}}

[[David Hume|Hume]] was Huxley's favourite philosopher, calling him "the Prince of Agnostics".&lt;ref&gt;A Hundred Years of British Philosophy, By Rudolf Metz, pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] wrote to his mistress, telling of a visit by Hume to the [[Baron D'Holbach]], and describing how a word for the position that Huxley would later describe as agnosticism didn't seem to exist, or at least wasn't common knowledge, at the time.

{{quote|The first time that M. Hume found himself at the table of the Baron, he was seated beside him. I don't know for what purpose the English philosopher took it into his head to remark to the Baron that he did not believe in atheists, that he had never seen any. The Baron said to him: "Count how many we are here." We are eighteen. The Baron added: "It isn't too bad a showing to be able to point out to you fifteen at once: the three others haven't made up their minds."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Campbell Mossner, ''The Life of David Hume'', 2014, pg.483&lt;/ref&gt;|Denis Diderot}}

Raised in a religious environment, [[Charles Darwin]] (1809-1882) studied to be an Anglican clergyman. While eventually doubting parts of his faith, Darwin continued to help in church affairs, even while avoiding church attendance. Darwin stated that it would be "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist".&lt;ref name=Fordyce&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 Letter 12041] – Darwin, C.

Agnostic views are as old as [[philosophical skepticism]], but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] (1825-1895) to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the "unconditioned" ([[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]) and the "unknowable" ([[Herbert Spencer]]). Though Huxley began to use the term "agnostic" in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to [[Charles Kingsley]], Huxley discussed his views extensively:&lt;ref name="Huxley1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Henry Huxley|authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=The Major Prose of Thomas Henry Huxley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAdUIXC32GkC&amp;pg=PA357|year=1997|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-1864-6|pages=357–}}

{{quote|I neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man. I see no reason for believing it, but, on the other hand, I have no means of disproving it. I have no ''a priori'' objections to the doctrine. No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about ''a priori'' difficulties. Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else, and I will believe that. Why should I not? It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter&amp;nbsp;...

It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities. I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions&amp;nbsp;...

That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true. But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties. I have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego, noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it, too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.}}

And again, to the same correspondent, May 6, 1863:&lt;ref name="HuxleyHuxley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonard Huxley|author2=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-azeZXAf6MMC&amp;pg=PA347|date=December 22, 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-04045-7|pages=347–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless I know that I am, in spite of myself, exactly what the Christian would call, and, so far as I can see, is justified in calling, atheist and infidel. I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father [who] loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I—who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds—have to these doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.}}

Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Collected Essays, Vol. V: Science and Christian Tradition| first=Thomas| last=Huxley| isbn= 1-85506-922-9| publisher=Macmillan and Co 1893| pages=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. They were quite sure they had attained a certain "gnosis"–had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble. And, with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion&amp;nbsp;...

So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of "agnostic". It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the "gnostic" of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant.&amp;nbsp;... To my great satisfaction the term took.}}

In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on ''The existence and nature of God'', in which he characterized himself as an atheist. He said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Russell| first= Bertrand| title=Collected Papers, Vol 10|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half. If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter.}}

However, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Papers, Vol. 10'', p.258&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|That sort of God is, I think, not one that can actually be disproved, as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can.}}

In Russell's 1947 pamphlet, ''Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic?'' (subtitled ''A Plea For Tolerance in the Face of New Dogmas''), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:&lt;ref name="Ewell2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Ewell|title=Traveling with Philosophes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYgDxc90buUC&amp;pg=PA348|date=August 27, 2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-85361-8|pages=348–}}

No. An atheist, like a Christian, holds that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that we can know there is a God; the atheist, that we can know there is not. The Agnostic suspends judgment, saying that there are not sufficient grounds either for affirmation or for denial.}}

[[File:RobertGIngersoll.jpg|thumb|[[Robert G. Ingersoll]]]]
[[Robert G. Ingersoll]] (1833-1899), an [[Illinois]] lawyer and politician who evolved into a well-known and sought-after orator in 19th-century America, has been referred to as the "Great Agnostic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brandt | first = Eric T., and Timothy Larsen | title = The Old Atheism Revisited: Robert G.

In an 1896 lecture titled ''Why I Am An Agnostic'', Ingersoll related why he was an agnostic:&lt;ref name="infidels1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/why_i_am_agnostic.html |title=Why I Am Agnostic|publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Is there a supernatural power—an arbitrary mind—an enthroned God—a supreme will that sways the tides and currents of the world—to which all causes bow? I do not deny. I do not know—but I do not believe. I believe that the natural is supreme—that from the infinite chain no link can be lost or broken—that there is no supernatural power that can answer prayer—no power that worship can persuade or change—no power that cares for man.

I believe that with infinite arms Nature embraces the all—that there is no interference—no chance—that behind every event are the necessary and countless causes, and that beyond every event will be and must be the necessary and countless effects.

Is there a God? I do not know. Is man immortal? I do not know. One thing I do know, and that is, that neither hope, nor fear, belief, nor denial, can change the fact. It is as it is, and it will be as it must be.}}

In the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as:&lt;ref name="infidels1"/&gt;
{{quote|We can be as honest as we are ignorant. If we are, when asked what is beyond the horizon of the known, we must say that we do not know.}}

In 1885 Ingersoll explained his comparative view of agnosticism and atheism as follows: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacoby |first=Susan |date=2013 |title=The Great Agnostic |location= |publisher=Yale University Press |page =17 | isbn=978-0-300-13725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints. Some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to [[materialism]]. Some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.&lt;ref name="EB-Agnosticism"/&gt;

===Theistic===
Theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist (''etsi deus non-daretur''), or as if God did exist (''etsi deus daretur'').&lt;ref name=SM&gt;

Religious scholars such as Laurence B. Brown criticize the misuse of the word agnosticism, claiming that it has become one of the most misapplied terms in metaphysics.

According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific [[truth]].&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.&lt;ref name=YOJC&gt;{{cite book| title=The Yes of Jesus Christ: Spiritual Exercises in Faith, Hope, and Love| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Cross Roads Publishing|year=2005}}

"Agnosticism", said Ratzinger, "is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man&amp;nbsp;... The knowledge of God has always existed".&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the [[scientific method]], a readiness to be purified by the truth.&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] sees merit in examining what it calls "partial agnosticism", specifically those systems that "do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge".&lt;ref name="CEnc1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The [[Council of the Vatican]] declares, "God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation".&lt;ref name="CEnc1"/&gt;

[[Blaise Pascal]] argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as [[Pascal's Wager]]: the [[Infinity|infinite]] expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer "bet" to choose God.&lt;ref name=PKPW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| title=Argument from Pascal's Wager| year=2007 | accessdate=May 25, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605044148/http://peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| archivedate=June 5, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atheistic===
According to [[Richard Dawkins]], a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues, "I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Bantam Press, p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; "Temporary Agnostics in Practice" (TAPs), and "Permanent Agnostics in Principle" (PAPs). He states that "agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; one day we may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability.", and considers PAP a "deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Bantam Press, pp&amp;nbsp;47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ignosticism]] is the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the [[theological noncognitivism|noncognitivist]] view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |title=The Argument From Non-Cognitivism |accessdate=October 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6N59bmP1Y?url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Ayer|A.&amp;nbsp;J. Ayer]], [[Theodore Drange]], and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept "a deity exists" as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 115: "There can be no way of proving that the existence of a God&amp;nbsp;... is even probable.&amp;nbsp;... For if the existence of such a god were probable, then the proposition that he existed would be an empirical hypothesis. And in that case it would be possible to deduce from it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experimental propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses alone. But in fact this is not possible."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drange"&gt;Drange, ''Atheism''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Collins''' (21 June 1676 O.S.{{snd}}13 December 1729 O.S.) was an English philosopher, and a proponent of [[deism]].

==Life and writings==
Collins was born in [[Heston]], near [[Hounslow]] in [[Middlesex]], England. He was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]], and studied law at the [[Middle Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CLNS693A|name=Collins, Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most interesting episode of his life was his intimacy with [[John Locke]], who in his letters speaks of him with affection and admiration. In 1715 he settled in [[Essex, England|Essex]], where he held the offices of justice of the peace and deputy-lieutenant, which he had previously held in Middlesex. He died at his house in [[Harley Street]], London.

His writings gather together the results of previous English [[Freethought|freethinker]]s. The imperturbable courtesy of his style is in striking contrast to the violence of his opponents; and, in spite of his unorthodoxy, he was not an atheist or even an agnostic. In his own words, "Ignorance is the foundation of atheism, and freethinking the cure of it" (''Discourse of Freethinking'', 105).

==Essay concerning the Use of Reason==
His first notable work was his ''Essay concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions the Evidence whereof depends on Human Testimony'' (1707), in which he rejected the distinction between "above reason" and "contrary to reason", and demanded that revelation should conform to man's natural ideas of God. Like all his works, it was published anonymously, although the identity of the author was never long concealed.

==A Discourse of Freethinking==
Six years later appeared his chief work, ''A Discourse of Freethinking, occasioned by the Rise and Growth of a Sect called Freethinkers'' (1713). Notwithstanding the ambiguity of its title, and the fact that it attacks the priests of all churches without moderation, it contends for the most part, at least explicitly, for no more than must be admitted by every Protestant. Freethinking is a right which cannot and must not be limited, for it is the only means of attaining a knowledge of truth, it essentially contributes to the well-being of society, and is not only permitted but enjoined by the Bible. In fact the first introduction of Christianity and the success of all missionary enterprise involve freethinking (in its etymological sense) on the part of those converted.

In England this essay, which was regarded and treated as a plea for [[deism]], caused a great sensation, eliciting several replies, from among others [[William Whiston]], Bishop Hare, Bishop [[Benjamin Hoadly]], and [[Richard Bentley]], who, under the signature of "Phileleutherus Lipsiensis", roughly handles certain arguments carelessly expressed by Collins, but triumphs chiefly by an attack on the trivial points of scholarship, his own pamphlet being by no means faultless in this very respect. [[Jonathan Swift]] also, being satirically referred to in the book, made it the subject of a caricature.

==Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion==
In 1724 Collins published his ''Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion'', with ''An Apology for Free Debate and Liberty of Writing'' prefixed. Ostensibly it is written in opposition to Whiston's attempt to show that the books of the [[Old Testament]] did originally contain prophecies of events in the [[New Testament]] story, but that these had been eliminated or corrupted by the Jews, and to prove that the fulfilment of prophecy by the events of Christ's life is all "secondary, secret, allegorical, and mystical," since the original and literal reference is always to some other fact. Since, further, according to him the fulfilment of prophecy is the only valid proof of Christianity, he thus secretly aims a blow at Christianity as a revelation. The canonicity of the New Testament he ventures openly to deny, on the ground that the canon could be fixed only by men who were inspired.

No less than thirty-five answers were directed against this book, the most noteworthy of which were those of Bishop [[Edward Chandler (bishop)|Edward Chandler]], Arthur Sykes and [[Samuel Clarke]]. To these, but with special reference to the work of Chandler, which maintained that a number of prophecies were literally fulfilled by Christ, Collins replied with his ''Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered'' (1727). An appendix contends against Whiston that the book of Daniel was forged in the time of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]].

==Necessitarianism==
In philosophy, Collins takes a foremost place as a defender of [[Necessitarianism]]. His brief ''Inquiry Concerning Human Liberty'' (1715) has not been excelled, at all events in its main outlines, as a statement of the determinist standpoint.

He was attacked in an elaborate treatise by [[Samuel Clarke]], in whose system the freedom of will is made essential to religion and morality. During Clarke's lifetime, fearing perhaps being branded as an enemy of religion and morality, Collins made no reply, but in 1729 he published an answer, entitled ''Liberty and Necessity''.

==Other works==
Besides these works he wrote
* ''A Letter to Mr [[Henry Dodwell|Dodwell]]'', arguing that the soul may be material, and, secondly, that if the soul be immaterial it does not follow, as Clarke had contended, that it is immortal.
* ''Vindication of the Divine Attributes'' (1710)
* ''Priestcraft in Perfection'' (1709), in which he asserts that the clause "the Church ... Faith" in the twentieth of the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] was inserted by fraud.

Collins became known as one of the best read men in England. He was a [[bibliophile]] who amassed one of the largest private libraries of the time, consisting of some 6,906 books on all subjects, but particularly favoring works on history, theology, and philosophy.

It has been argued (see Jacobson, "The England Libertarian Heritage") that Collins was the unknown author of ten of "The Independent Whig" essays.

==Family==

Collins was the son of Henry Collins and Mary. He had two sisters: Anne Collins (born 1678), who married Henry Lovibond (born 1675), and Mary Collins (born 1680), who married Edward Lovibond (1675–1737), a merchant and Director of the East India Company. Mary and Edward's son was the poet [[s:Lovibond, Edward (DNB00)|Edward Lovibond]].

He married first Martha Child (1677–1703) a daughter of Sir [[Francis Child (died 1713)|Francis Child]] MP (1642–1713) and Elizabeth, {{née|Wheeler}} (1652–1720). They had two sons both of whom died young, the eldest in infancy, the second was Anthony Collins ({{circa|lk=no|1701}}{{snd}}1723); and two daughters: Elizabeth Collins (born {{circa|lk=no|1700}}) who, in 1738, married Walter Cary; and Martha Collins ({{circa|lk=no|1700}}{{snd}}1744) who, in 1741, married [[Robert Fairfax, 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] (1706–1793). His second marriage was to Elizabeth Wrottesley (born {{circa|lk=no|1680}}), a daughter of Walter Wrottesley, 3rd [[Baron Wrottesley|Baronet Wrottesley]] (1659–1712) and Eleanora, {{née|Archer}} (1661–1692).

[[File:biskup antun mahnic.jpg|thumb|right|Anton Mahnič]]

'''Anton Mahnič''', also spelled '''Antun Mahnić''' in Croatian orthography (14 September 1850 – 30 December 1920), was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[Roman Catholic]] bishop, theologian and philosopher, founder and the main leader of the [[Croatian Catholic movement]].

==Biography==
Mahnič was born in [[Kobdilj]] near [[Štanjel]] in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] [[County of Gorizia and Gradisca]] (in today's [[Slovenia]]). He finished theological studies in [[Vienna]] and then worked as a priest and a teacher in [[Gorizia]]. During this period, he became actively involved in the Slovene political life, criticising the liberal Catholic current within the [[Slovene national movement]].

In 1896, he became Bishop of [[Krk (town)|Krk]] ([[Croatia]]). In his bishopric he initiated many religious societies and activities, and started Catholic publishing, including a magazine for Christian philosophy called ''Hrvatska straža''. He founded Catholic student magazines and societies all over the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]. He wrote many articles and works in the theological, philosophical, esthetical and political area. Later Mahnić initiated a Pius society, with its weekly newspaper ''Jutro''.  These groups of Catholic intellectuals, gathered around these papers, joined together in the '''[[Croatian Catholic movement]]''') before the [[First World War]]. After the war, Mahnić was persecuted during the Italian occupation, and he went to [[Zagreb]], where he died.

Mahnić's main goal was defending and promoting Catholic faith and its moral principles in Croatian public and social life, which were endangered by [[liberalization]] and [[secularization]]. Also important issue for him was spiritual and intellectual education of the youth.

On this basis, biotic ethics defines a human purpose to secure and propagate life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} These principles are related to [[bioethics]], and to [[environmental ethics]] that seek to conserve existing species. However, biotic ethics value more generally organic gene/protein life itself, the structures and processes shared by all the biota.

Biotic ethics defines life as "a process whose outcome is the self-reproduction of complex molecular patterns".{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This organic molecular life has a special place in nature in its complexity and in the laws that allow it to exist,&lt;ref name = "Gribbin" &gt;{{Cite book | last = Gribbin | first = J. | last2 = Rees | first2 = M. | year = 1989 | title = Cosmic Coincidences | publisher = Bantam Books | location = New York | ISBN = 0-553-34740-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the biological unity of all life,&lt;ref name = "Baldauf" &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baldauf | first1 = S.

Based on these science-based insights, biotic ethics can provide a foundation for rational secular ethics, while also consistent with religious doctrines that value life.

Technological advances toward seeding other solar systems, and the foundations of panbiotic ethics | journal = J.

These issues raise basic ethical questions. How far can we change, and still preserve, life and humanness? May we modify the DNA and proteins that are central to biology? May we create hardy man/machine cyborgs, or will these threaten to replace organic life? How much life should we construct in space? In general, biotic ethics may approve these developments if they help to propagate life. This ethical guidance may be in fact vital when advancing technology makes human designs self-fulfilling. Life can then survive only if the will to survive is itself always propagated.

Biotic ethics (or "life-centered ethics"), and its extension to space as panbiotic ethics, were  developed formally.{{when|date=March 2013}}{{by whoM}}&lt;ref name = "Bioethics"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Seeding Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Panspermia3"/&gt; Biotic ethics is [[consequentialist]], with principles that are consistent with [[environmental ethics]], including [[Deep Ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Naess | first = A. |  year = 1973 | title = The Shallow and the Deep, Long Range Ecology Movements | location = Oslo }}&lt;/ref&gt; biocentric ethics &lt;ref name = "Bill"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bill |first = D. | title = The Deep, Long Ecological Movement 1960 – 2000. A Review  | journal = Ethics and the Environment | year = 2001 | volume = 6 | pages = 18–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and aspects of [[anthropocentrism]], that aim to protect existing species and ecosystems. Biotic ethics is similar but more general, as it values not specific species but the core processes of all gene/protein life, present and future.

==Science-based arguments for biotic ethics==

===The unity of life===
[[Biology]] uses [[DNA]] sequences in a [[genetic code]] for proteins that in turn help to reproduce the DNA sequences. All cellular biota share these gene/protein cycles, a common DNA code, and complex [[proteins]], [[Cell membrane|membrane]]s and [[adenosine triphosphate]] energy apparatus of cells. This complexity, and common roots,&lt;ref name = "Baldauf" /&gt;  and a shared future, unite all life.&lt;ref name = "Cosmology"  &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner |first = Michael N. | title = Life in the cosmological future: Resources, biomass and populations  | journal = Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | year = 2005 | volume = 58 | pages = 167–180 | url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFCosmologyJBIS2005Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The special place of life in nature===
Biology depends on the precise coincidence of the laws of nuclear physics, gravity, electro-magnetic forces and thermodynamics that allow stars, habitable planets, chemistry and biology to exist.&lt;ref name ="Gribbin"/&gt; Further, life has an effective purpose, self-propagation. Therefore a universe that contains life, contains purpose. In these respects the universe came to a unique point in life.

==Applications of biotic ethics==

===How far can we transform, but still preserve, humanity and life?===
Fundamental changes in biology may be desired, especially for adaptation to space, as foreseen by authors from [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] to [[Freeman Dyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Dyson | first = F. | year = 1988 | title = Infinite in All Directions | publisher = Harper and Row | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Futurists also examined the ethics of human life in space  and of planetary terraforming in these respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hart | first = M. H. | year = 1985 | title = Interstellar migrations, the biological revolution, and the future of the galaxy. In Interstellar Migration and the Human Experience, B. R. Finney and E. M. Jones, eds. | publisher = University of California Press  | location = Berkeley, California }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hargrove | first = E. C. | year = 1986 | title = Beyond Spaceship Earth – Environmental Ethics in the Solar System | publisher = Sierra Club Books | location = San Francisco }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McKay | first = C. P. | title = Does Mars have rights? An approach to the environmental ethics of planetary engineering. In Moral Expertise, D. MacNiven, ed. | year = 1990 | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Marshall | first = A. | title = Ethics and the extraterrestrial environment | year = 1993 | journal = J. Applied Philosophy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fogg | first = M. J. | title = Terraforming: engineering planetary environments | year = 1995 | publisher = Society of Automotive Engineers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptation to space may involve resistance to radiation, photosynthetic and solar-sail organs, artificial and robotic organs, and adaptation to microgravity. If humans are so altered, will humankind still survive? Do we aim to preserve the human species, or help its evolution? By biotic ethics, the human species will not become extinct if our genes are preserved and extended in advanced post-humans, similar to the effects of natural evolution.

More basic transformations alter DNA to XNA and add new nucleic bases, and design proteins that contain synthetic amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Freemont | first1 = P. F. | last2 = Kitney | first2 = R. I. | year = 2012 | title = Synthetic Biology | publisher = World Scientific | location = New Jersey |  ISBN = 978-1-84816-862-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kirby | first1 = J. | last2 = Kisling | first2 = J. D. | title = Metabolic  engineering of microorganisms for isoprenoid production  | journal = Nat. Prod. Rep. | year = 2008 | volume = 25 | pages = 656–661 | doi=10.1039/b802939c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kool | first = E. T. | title = Replacing the nucleobases in DNA with designer molecules  | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1021/ar000183u | volume=35 | pages=936–943}}&lt;/ref&gt; These developments affect core gene/protein processes. Does this altered biochemistry still continue our form of organic life? Biotic ethics may approve them if they help to continue gene/protein reproduction.

However, biotic ethics cannot permit replacing biological life by robots, even if more hardy and intelligent than humans. By biotic ethics, eliminating organic life for any reason is the ultimate evil. Robots may be useful, but control should remain with biological brains with a vested  self-interest to propagate organic gene/protein life.

===Future biota, and life in space===
Biotic and panbiotic ethics recommend using space to maximize life. Indeed, [[astroecology]] experiments showed that asteroid/meteorite materials can support thousands of trillions of humans in the Solar System, and trillions of trillions in the galaxy. Life may then realize its full potentials in a future where all matter becomes living biomass or its supporting matrix.&lt;ref name = "Cosmology" /&gt;

Biotic ethics seek to maximize life, and can support its expansion. For that purpose, [[directed panspermia]] can soon seed other [[planetary system]]s with life.&lt;ref name = "Panspermia3" /&gt; Solar sails can launch microbial capsules to nearby stars, or to clusters of new [[star system]]s in star-forming clouds. Diverse microorganisms in the payload can populate new environments, and eukaryotic spores can jump-start higher evolution. Interference with alien life, if any, can be avoided by targeting young planetary systems where local life, especially advanced life, would not have started yet.&lt;ref name = "Panspermia3" /&gt; We cannot abandon life to certain death by the exploding Sun, to protect aliens who may or may not exist.

Biotic ethics states our commitment to our family of gene/protein life. If we are alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Davies | first = P. |  year = 2010 | title = The Eerie Silence | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; the fate of all life is in our hands. Some of the new life started by directed panspermia may evolve intelligent civilizations who will promote life further in the galaxy, fulfilling the objectives of panbiotic ethics.&lt;ref name = "Panspermia3" /&gt;

===Relations among biotic, biocentric, anthropocentric and panbiotic ethics===
[[Biocentrism (ethics)|Biocentrism]] and [[Deep Ecology]] seek to preserve present species and ecosystems.&lt;ref name = "Bill" /&gt; These objectives are consistent with biotic ethics that value gene/protein life in any biological form, including future life-forms.

With this general view, biotic ethics commends but does not require human survival as such, as long as life itself continues. However, only technological humans can secure life beyond the duration of the Sun, possibly for trillions of eons.&lt;ref name = "Cosmology" /&gt; Therefore, biotic ethics do require human (or post-human) survival to secure life. Also, as humans, we wish to continue sentient life that can enjoy conscious existence, a further motivation to propagate life. Biotic ethics then makes humans interdependent with all life. Humans can secure the future of  life, and this future can give human existence a cosmic purpose.&lt;ref name = "Bioethics" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Seeding Book" /&gt;

'''Black is beautiful''' is a [[cultural movement]] that was started in the US in the 1960s by [[African American]]s. It later spread beyond the United States, most prominently in the writings of the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] of [[Steve Biko]] in [[South Africa]].

It aims to dispel the racist notion that [[black people]]'s natural features such as skin color, facial features and hair are inherently ugly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bucks.edu/~docarmos/BCMnotes.html Some notes on the BLACK CULTURAL MOVEMENT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220045250/http://www.bucks.edu/~docarmos/BCMnotes.html |date=December 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rock (abolitionist)|John Rock]] was long thought to be the first to coin the phrase "black is beautiful" — during a speech in 1858—but historical records indicate he never actually used the specific phrase on that day.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Negro History'', [[Association for the Study of Negro Life and History]],Vol.54,No. 4 (Oct., 1969)pp. 405–406&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also encouraged men and women to stop trying to eliminate African-identified traits by [[straightening their hair]] and attempting to [[Skin whitening|lighten or bleach their skin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rastafarispeaks.com/cgi-bin/forum/config.pl?noframes;read=79921 Jamaica Says Black Is Beautiful]&lt;/ref&gt;

This movement began in an effort to counteract the racist notion in [[American culture]] that features typical of Blacks were less attractive or desirable than those of Whites. Research indicates that the idea of blackness being ugly is highly damaging to the psyche of African Americans, manifesting itself as [[internalized racism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderforum.uni-koeln.de/genderealisations/weedon.html Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective] by Chris Weedon, Cardiff University &lt;blockquote&gt;In her novel ''[[The Bluest Eye]]'' (1970), [[Toni Morrison]] depicts the effects of the legacy of 19th century racism for poor black people in the United States. The novel tells of how the daughter of a poor black family, Pecola Breedlove, internalizes white standards of beauty to the point where she goes mad. Her fervent wish for blue eyes comes to stand for her wish to escape the poor, unloving, racist environment in which she lives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This idea made its way into black communities themselves&lt;ref&gt;''"Black is Beautiful" and the Color Preferences of Afro-American Youth'' – Claud Anderson, Rue L. Cromwell, ''The Journal of Negro Education'', Vol. 46, No. 1 (Winter, 1977), pp. 76–88 {{doi|10.2307/2966874}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to practices such as [[Paper Bag Party|paper bag parties]]: social events which discriminated against dark-skinned African-Americans by only admitting lighter-skinned individuals.

==History==
While the Black is Beautiful movement started in the 1960s, this fight for equal rights and a positive perception of the [[African Americans|African American]] body starts much earlier in American history. The reason this moment took form was because the media and society as a whole had a negative perception of the African American body as suitable only for slave status.&lt;ref&gt;Cassandra Jackson, ''Violence, Visual Culture, and the Black Male Body'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Black is Beautiful movement was based around a fight for an equal perception of the black body to help undo all the negative ideas brought about by a history based in white supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie M. H. Camp, "Black Is Beautiful: An American History." ''Journal of Southern History'' 81#3 (2015): 675+. [http://search.proquest.com/openview/9504cc0ef53aaa2eaa2b1f04187bf540/1?pq-origsite=gscholar online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proving that Black is Beautiful has bled into fashion, where the idea is that dressing with sophistication in mind allows for one to command automatic respect from those around them. This is best exemplified in Black Dandyism, a male fashion movement best described through Monica Miller's book ''Slaves to Fashion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.papermag.com/how-black-men-birthed-dandyism-the-street-style-movement-that-means-fa-2429257179.html |title= How Black Men Birthed Dandyism – the Street Style Movement That Means Far More Than Meets the Eye |first=Beatrice |last= Hazlehurst |date=July 1, 2017  |magazine=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since slaves were forbidden from wearing expensive or beautiful fabrics, dressing up the Black body has historically been a radical statement of self-hood and equality. Black Dandyism has morphed over the years, moving from simply dressing sharply in the fashion of the times to what is now the combination of dressing sharply and loud, African-inspired prints and colors that subvert notions of traditional masculinity.

The '''Center for Philosophy of Science''' is an academic center located at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] dedicated to research in the [[philosophy of science]]. The Center was founded by [[Adolf Grünbaum]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Philosophy at Pitt: Three Sites of Inquiry|url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/philosophy-pitt-three-sites-inquiry|publisher=Pitt Chronicle|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Director of the Center is [http://www.edouardmachery.com/ Edouard Machery].

==History==
[[File:PhilofSciOfficePitt.jpg|thumb|right|Home of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Philosophy of Science on the eighth floor of the [[Cathedral of Learning]]]]
Throughout its history, the Center has been associated with a number of notable individuals from philosophy of science, including nearly 300 visiting professors from more than 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Philosophy at Pitt: Three Sites of Inquiry|url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/philosophy-pitt-three-sites-inquiry|publisher=Pitt Chronicle|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center's inaugural Annual Lecture Series included lectures from the noted philosophers [[Paul K. Feyerabend]], [[Adolf Grünbaum]], [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Michael Scriven]], and [[Wilfrid Sellars]]. Later Annual Lecture Series participants include [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Philip Morrison]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[George Wald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=a brief history|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/About/history/history_1.htm|publisher=Center for Philosophy of Science|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nobel Prize]]–winning economist [[Alvin E.

'''Claude Serge Fischer''' (born January 9, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[sociologist]] and Professor of Sociology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He has taught undergraduate and graduate courses in urban sociology, research methods, and American society at UC Berkeley. He was elected a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20170915195158/https://amphilsoc.org/members/electedApril2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Fischer was born in [[Paris]], [[France]] on January 9, 1948. He came to the [[United States]] in 1952 at the age of 4. He was raised in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], but finished high school in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He graduated from [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]].

Fischer graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[sociology]] from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1968. After completing his B.A., he went to [[Harvard University]] and completed his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1970) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1972) in sociology. After completing his Ph.D., he joined the faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1972.

== Work ==
Fischer's early research focused on the [[social psychology]] of urban life and on social networks. In 1982, he published the book ''To Dwell Among Friends: Personal Networks in Town and City'' and in 1984, he published the book ''The Urban Experience''. He is credited with developing the 'subcultural theory of urbanism'. He worked on the study of social networks, in which he developed techniques for the survey study of networks and studied urban-rural differences in personal networks.

He has also worked on American social history, beginning with a study of the early telephone's place in social life. He published the book ''America Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940'' in 1992. In that book, he presents the first social history of this vital but little-studied technology. He examine how Americans  encountered, tested, and ultimately embraced it with enthusiasm. He  was also the founding editor of ''Contexts'', the American Sociological Association's magazine of sociology for the general reader. He was also its executive editor through 2004.

== Awards and honors ==
Fischer and his books have received many awards and honors. The following are the awards and honors received by Fischer and his books.
* 1986 Distinguished Scholarship Award of the Pacific Sociological Association for ''To Dwell Among Friends'' (1982)
* 1995 Dexter Prize, Outstanding Book, from the Society for the History of Technology, for ''America Calling'' (1992)

'''Cretan pederasty''' was an archaic form of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederasty]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ephorus|Ephorus of Cyme]] in [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography'' 10.21.4&lt;/ref&gt; that involved the ritual kidnapping (''harpagmos'') of a noble boy by an adult male of the aristocratic class, with the consent of the boy's father.

The man (known as ''φιλήτωρ – philetor,'' "befriender") took the boy (known as ''kleinos,'' "glorious") into the wilderness, where they spent two months hunting and feasting with their friends. If the boy was satisfied with the conduct of his would-be comrade, he changed his title from ''kleinos'' to ''parastates'' (''κλεινός / παραστάτης'', "sidekick," indicating he had fought in battle alongside his lover)&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Kroll "Knabenliebe" in Pauly-Wissowa, ''Realencyclopaedie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft,'' vol. 11, cols. 897-906 [http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/kroll-pederasty.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; returned to the philetor and lived in close bonds of public intimacy with him.&lt;ref&gt;John Addington Symonds, ''A Problem in Greek Ethics,'' X p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The function of the institution, beside teaching the youth adult skills, was supposed to confirm the status of the best men, and to offer both lover and beloved the chance to give proof of a noble character deserving of respect.&lt;ref&gt;D. B. Dodd, '"Athenian Ideas about Cretan Pederasty," in T. Hubbard (ed.), ''Greek Love Reconsidered,'' New York, 2000; pp.33-41&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancient Greek historical tracts trace the origins of the tradition to mythological times. [[Aristotle]] states that it was king [[Minos]] who established pederasty as a means of population control on the island community: ''[They] "segregated the women and instituted sexual relations among the males so that women would not have children."''&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics,'' II.10&lt;/ref&gt; The practice seems to have been reserved for the aristocracy, and it was a reciprocal acknowledgment and cultivation of honor. The man was honored by being allowed to take the boy, and the boy's honor was increased by being thus taken. As the historian [[Strabo]] records it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"(The Cretans) have a peculiar custom in regard to love affairs, for they win the objects with their love, not by persuasion, but by abduction; the lover tells the friends of the boy three or four days beforehand that he is going to make the abduction; but for the friends to conceal the boy, or not to let him go forth the appointed road, is indeed a most disgraceful thing, a confession, as it were, that the boy is unworthy to obtain such a lover; and when they meet, if the abductor is the boy’s equal or superior in rank or other respects, the friends pursue him and lay hold of him, though only in a very gentle way, thus satisfying the custom; and after that they cheerfully turn the boy over to him to lead away; if, however, the abductor is unworthy, they take the boy away from him."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent scholarship has suggested that the practice may have been adopted by the Dorians around 630 BC, spreading from Crete to [[Spartan pederasty|Sparta]] and then to the rest of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;William Armstrong Percy III, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," in ''Same–Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West,'' Binghamton, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
This custom was highly regarded, and it was considered shameful for a youth to not acquire a male lover. Again, Strabo:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It is disgraceful for those who are handsome in appearance or descendants of illustrious ancestors to fail to obtain lovers, the presumption being that their character (masculinity) is responsible for such a fate.  But the parastathentes (those who stand by their lover in battle) receive honors; for in both the dances and the races they have the positions of highest honor, and are allowed to dress in better clothes than the rest, that is, in the habit given them by their lovers; and not then only, but even after they have grown to manhood, they wear a distinctive dress, which is intended to make known the fact that each wearer has become kleinos, for they call the loved one kleinos (distinguished) and the lover philetor."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not surprisingly, these same Cretans were credited with introducing the myth of Zeus kidnapping Ganymede to be his lover in Olympus &amp;ndash; though even the king of the gods had to make amends to the father. This myth, however, is denounced by [[Plato]] in his ''Laws'' as having been made up to justify purely sensual practices: &lt;blockquote&gt;''And we are unanimous in accusing the Cretans of fabricating the story of Ganymede: because they believed that their laws had come from Zeus, they have also attached this story to the god, thinking that they could reap the fruit of this pleasure and say that they were following the god's example. But that is the realm of myth.'' (636B-D)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strabo also indicates that it is the boy’s [[masculinity]] that consigns him his lover: &lt;blockquote&gt;''The most desirable youths, according to Cretan conventions, are not the exceptionally handsome ones, but rather those who are distinguished for manly courage and orderly behavior.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;Together the boy and his lover live in the wilderness for a time, and at some point during the courtship the two made an offering of a [[ex voto|votive tablet]] and an animal sacrifice at the sanctuary of Hermes and Aphrodite, on [[Dikti|Mt. Dikte]], close to the cave where Zeus was said to have been reared.

Upon their return the lover gives the boy expensive gifts, among which a military outfit, an ox (a sacrifice to [[Zeus]]), and a drinking cup (symbolic of spiritual accomplishment). At that time, according to Strabo, the boy also is empowered to choose between continuing or putting an end to his relationship with his abductor, and to denounce the man if he misbehaved in any way. Here the cycle of honor given and returned is completed, but now it is the boy's turn to grant - or withhold - that honor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The youth sacrifices the ox to Zeus and gives a feast to those who came down with him from the mountains. He then declares, concerning his relationship with the lover, whether it took place with his consent or not; the convention encourages this in order that, if any violence is used against him in the abduction, he may restore his honor and break off the relationship.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A late comment by the Roman historian [[Cornelius Nepos]] claims that Cretan youths had more than one lover: "Quite young men in Crete are praised  for having had as many lovers as they could."&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Nepos, ''Preface,'' 3-5; trans. Thomas K. Hubbard&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeological findings==

A number of archaeological findings have been interpreted as documentation of the Cretan pederastic rites. At a rustic shrine dedicated to Hermes and Aphrodite, at [[Kato Syme]], approximately sixty kilometers east of [[Hagia Triada]], excavations led by Angeliki Lembessi have uncovered numerous bronze objects and remains of animal sacrifices.

Among these were found bronze figures of youths from the Minoan period (before 1100 BC), indicating  this to have been a long-standing sanctuary site. Such figurines were offered over the course of many centuries. Little from Minoan and Mycenean times that survived the Dark Age (1200-800) after their fall could have influenced the Archaic Greeks (800-480). Minoans did have sensual art dominated by sexual symbols such as snakes and bulls, by the lithe bodies of wasp-waisted youths usually wearing loin-cloths, and by bare-breasted females. The terra cotta piece discovered near Phaistus showing four nude males with peaked caps dancing in a ring and the nude fisherman on a fresco from the Mycenean colony at Thera are exceptional, but not overtly pederastic. Certain later vases and terra cotta figurines also suggest some influence by sub-Mycenean on geometric art but none of the figural decorations that appeared on Mycenean or on Minoan vases or walls during the second millennium are clearly homoerotic. If those peoples institutionalized pederasty, their art does not indicate that fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece|last = Percy|first = William A.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1996|isbn = 0252022092|location = Illinois|pages = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:Image:Cretan votive tablet - man and youth ritual.jpg|One set]], dated to c. 8th-7th century BC and presently in the [[Louvre]] depicts a male couple consisting of an older bearded male and a younger male with long, flowing hair and curls in front. The older partner, who carries a horn bow, grasps the younger by the arm and draws him close. The younger carries a slain goat on his shoulders, presumably a sacrificial animal. They are looking intently at each other, their legs and feet touch, and the genitals of the younger male are exposed.

Another bronze piece, dated c. 750 BC and presently in the [[Heraklion]] Museum, shows two helmeted but otherwise nude youths, one older than the other. They both display erections and stand beside each other holding hands. Yet another bronze cutout dated to the 7th century BC shows a lad, nude except for a long, decorative cape and sandals, holding a bow and quiver. These pieces document that this Cretan initiatory tradition continued over many centuries and that later offerings left by pairs of lovers at this shrine became more elaborate and erotically explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce L. Gerig, 2005, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths and folktales==
Beside the myths, a couple of Cretan pederastic folktales have come down to us, albeit in fragmentary form. In both tales the boy is named Leucocomas (leukos = bright / kóme = hair) and puts his lover to the test by challenging him to perform a number of difficult tasks, known as "athlon" (the same term used of the twelve [[Labors of Heracles]], "dodekathlos"). In the tale of Euxinthetus and Leucocomas the lover must bring the boy's dog from Prasus back to [[Gortyn]], a distance of one hundred eighty stadia (over twenty eight kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' X.4.12&lt;/ref&gt; In the other tale, that of [[Promachus]] ("forward fighter") and Leucocomas, the boy set his lover a number of arduous tasks, culminating in retrieving a priceless helmet. Promachos, however, infuriated by his beloved's endless and unreasonable demands, retrieved the helmet but placed it on the head of another boy, leading Leucocomas to kill himself in a jealous fit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]], ''Narrations'' 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of science''' addresses and refines problems within [[science]] in order to improve science as a whole and its role in society. It is distinct from the academic positions of [[antiscience]] or [[anti-intellectualism]] which seek to reject entirely the scientific method.

==Philosophical critiques==
[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|200px|thumb|"All methodologies, even the most obvious ones, have their limits." ―[[Paul Feyerabend]] in ''[[Against Method]]'']]

[[Philosophy of science|Philosopher of science]] [[Paul Feyerabend]] advanced the idea of [[epistemological anarchism]], which holds that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the [[scientific progress|progress of science]] or the growth of [[knowledge]], and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself.&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;{{cite book | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Feyerabend | title = Against Method | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend advocates a democratic society where science is treated as an equal to other [[ideology|ideologies]] or social institutions such as [[religion]], and [[education]], or [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[mythology]], and considers the dominance of science in society [[authoritarian]] and unjustified.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; He also contended (along with [[Imre Lakatos]]) that the [[demarcation problem]] of distinguishing science from [[pseudoscience]] on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt;

Feyerabend also criticized science for not having evidence for its own philosophical precepts. Particularly the notion of Uniformity of Law and the Uniformity of Process across time and space, as noted by [[Steven Jay Gould]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Stephen J|title=[[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]: Myth and Metaphor in the Discovery of Geological Time|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=120|isbn=0-674-89198-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We have to realize that a unified theory of the physical world simply does not exist" says Feyerabend, "We have theories that work in restricted regions, we have purely formal attempts to condense them into a single formula, we have lots of unfounded claims (such as the claim that all of chemistry can be reduced to physics), phenomena that do not fit into the accepted framework are suppressed; in physics, which many scientists regard as the one really basic science, we have now at least three different points of view...without a promise of conceptual (and not only formal) unification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-86091-184-5 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 100 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, science is [[begging the question]] when it presupposes that there is a universal truth with no proof thereof.

Historian [[Jacques Barzun]] termed science "a [[faith]] as [[fanaticism|fanatical]] as any in [[history]]" and warned against the use of scientific thought to suppress considerations of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] as integral to [[human]] existence.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Barzun, ''Science: The Glorious Entertainment'', Harper and Row: 1964. p. 15. (quote) and Chapters II and XII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Stanley Aronowitz]] scrutinizes science for operating with the presumption that the only acceptable criticisms of science are those conducted within the methodological framework that science has set up for itself. That science insists that only those who have been inducted into its community, through means of training and credentials, are qualified to make these criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-8166-1659-0 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = viii (preface) | publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]] | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronowitz also alleges that while scientists consider it absurd that [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] uses biblical references to bolster their claim that the [[Bible]] is true, scientists pull the same tactic by using the tools of science to settle disputes concerning its own validity.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Aronowitz in conversation with Derrick Jensen in {{cite book | isbn = 1-931498-52-0 | title = Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance, and the Culture of Control | page = 31 | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing Company | last = Jensen | first = Derrick | year = 2004 | authorlink = Derrick Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher of religion [[Alan Watts]] criticized science for operating under a materialist model of the world that he posited is simply a modified version of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic worldview]], that "the universe is constructed and maintained by a Lawmaker" (commonly identified as [[God]] or the [[Logos]]). Watts asserts that during the rise of secularism through the 18th to 20th century when scientific philosophers got rid of the notion of a lawmaker they kept the notion of law, and that the idea that the world is a material machine run by law is a presumption just as unscientific as religious doctrines that affirm it is a material machine made and run by a lawmaker.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watts Audio lecture "Myth and Religion: Image of Man" and "Out Of Your Mind, 1: The Nature of Consciousness: 'Our image of the world' and 'The myth of the automatic universe'"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology===

David Parkin compared the [[epistemology|epistemological]] stance of science to that of [[divination]]. He suggested that, to the degree that divination is an epistemologically specific means of gaining insight into a given question, science itself can be considered a form of divination that is framed from a Western view of the nature (and thus possible applications) of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkin|first1=David|chapter=Simultaneity and Sequencing in the Oracular Speech of Kenyan Diviners|page=185|editor-last1=Peek|editor-first1=Philip M.|title=African divination systems : ways of knowing|date=1991|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=9780253343093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polymath]] and [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Episkopos]] of [[Discordianism]] [[Robert Anton Wilson]] stresses that the instruments used in scientific investigation produce meaningful answers relevant only to the instrument, and that there is no objective vantage point from which science could verify its findings since all findings are relative to begin with.&lt;ref name="Anton Wilson 1999 4"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1-56184-002-5 | title = The New Inquisition | page = 4 | publisher = New Falcon Publications | last = Anton Wilson | first = Robert | year = 1999 | authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
[[File:An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Wright of Derby]] (1768) ''An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump'', National Gallery, London]]
Several academics have offered critiques concerning [[ethics]] in science. In ''Science and Ethics'', for example, the professor of philosophy [[Bernard Rollin]] examines the relevance of ethics to science, and argues in favor of making education in ethics part and parcel of scientific training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first=Bernard E. | last=Rollin | year=2006
 | title=Science and Ethics
 | publisher=Cambridge University Press
 | isbn=0-521-85754-6
 | oclc=238793190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social science]] scholars, like [[anthropologist]]s like [[Tim Ingold]], and scholars from [[philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], like [[Adorno]] in [[critical theory]], have criticized modern science for subservience to economic and technological interests.&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p9"&gt;"Many would agree that modern science has become so corrupted by its association with positivist methodology, and by its subservience to commercial and military interests" {{harv|Ingold|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related criticism is the debate on positivism. While before the 19th century science was perceived to be in opposition to religion, in contemporary society science is often defined as the antithesis of the [[humanities]] and [[the arts]].&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p19"&gt;"Keith Hart is sensitive to the way in which the meaning of science has changed over the centuries. His strategy for revealing such changes is to show how successive generations have responded to the question of what science is not. Where once the antitheses of science were myth and religion, now they are the humanities and creative arts." {{harv|Ingold|1996|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many recent thinkers, such as [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[E. F. Schumacher]] considered that the 17th century [[scientific revolution]] shifted science from a focus on understanding [[nature]], or [[wisdom]], to a focus on manipulating nature, i.e. [[power (sociology)|power]], and that science's emphasis on manipulating nature leads it inevitably to manipulate people, as well.&lt;ref name=UW&gt;Fritjof Capra, ''Uncommon Wisdom'', {{ISBN|0-671-47322-0}}, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Science's focus on quantitative measures has led to critiques that it is unable to recognize important qualitative aspects of the world.&lt;ref name=UW/&gt;

==Methodology==
===Cognitive and publication biases===
While many scientists and skeptics point out cognitive biases that may permeate commonsense thinking and cause illogical conclusions, the same biases are much less likely to be examined within the scientific community.  Critics argue that the biggest bias within science is motivated reasoning, whereby scientists are more likely to accept evidence that supports their hypothesis and more likely to scrutinize findings that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists do not practice pure induction but instead often come into science with preconceived ideas and often will, unconsciously or consciously, interpret observations to support their own hypotheses through confirmation bias.

However, systematic issues in the publication system of academic journals can often compound these biases.  Issues like [[publication bias]], where studies with non-significant results are less likely to be published, and selective outcome reporting bias, where only the significant outcomes out of a variety of outcomes are likely to be published, are common within academic literature. These biases have widespread implications, such as the distortion of meta-analyses where only studies that include positive results are likely to be included.&lt;ref name=Ioannidis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ioannidis|first1=John P.A.|last2=Munafò|first2=Marcus R.|last3=Fusar-Poli|first3=Paolo|last4=Nosek|first4=Brian A.|last5=David|first5=Sean P.|title=Publication and other reporting biases in cognitive sciences: detection, prevalence, and prevention|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=May 2014|volume=18|issue=5|pages=235–241|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2014.02.010|pmid=24656991|pmc=4078993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical outcomes can be manipulated as well, for example large numbers of participants can be used and trials overpowered so that small difference cause significant effects or inclusion criteria can be changed to include those are most likely to respond to a treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenhalgh|first1=T.|last2=Howick|first2=J.|last3=Maskrey|first3=N.|title=Evidence based medicine: a movement in crisis?|journal=BMJ|date=13 June 2014|volume=348|issue=jun13 4|pages=g3725–g3725|doi=10.1136/bmj.g3725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether produced on purpose or not, all of these issues need to be taken into consideration within scientific research, and peer-reviewed published evidence should not be assumed to be outside of the realm of bias and error; some critics are now claiming that many results in scientific journals are false or exaggerated.&lt;ref name=Ioannidis/&gt;

==Feminist critiques==
{{See also|Feminist philosophy of science}}
Feminist scholars and women scientists such as [[Emily Martin (anthropologist)|Emily Martin]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Ruth Hubbard]], [[Londa Schiebinger]] and Bonnie Spanier have critiqued science because they believe it presents itself as objective and neutral while ignoring its inherent [[gender bias]]. They assert that gender bias exists in the language and practice of science, as well as in the expected appearance and social acceptance of who can be scientists within society.&lt;ref name="Aggressive egg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Math classes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=USA|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Emily|title=The Egg and the Sperm: How Science Has Constructed a Romance Based on Stereotypical Male-Female Roles|journal=Signs|issue=3|date=Spring 1991|volume=16|pages=485–501|doi=10.1086/494680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] says that the "moral and political insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex, and relations within and between the social and natural worlds."&lt;ref name=Harding_method&gt;{{cite book|author=Harding, Sandra|editor=Nancy Tuana|year=1989|title=Feminism &amp; Science|chapter= 'Is Therea Feminist Method'|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20525-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] is a prominent example of this kind of feminist work within biological science. Some feminists, such as [[Ruth Hubbard]] and [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], criticize traditional [[rhetoric of science|scientific discourse]] as being historically biased towards a male perspective.&lt;ref name="shildrick"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Price, Janet |author2=Shildrick, Margrit |title=Feminist Theory and the Body: A Reader |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-92566-5 |page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hubbard, Ruth|year=1990|title=The Politics of Women's Biology|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-1490-8|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created and/or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lindlof | first1 = Thomas R. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Bryan C. | title = Qualitative Communication Research Methods | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, Calif | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7619-2493-7 |page = 357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other feminist scholars, such as [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "A historian looks at gender and science," ''International Journal of Science Education'', vol. 9 (1987), p. 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenore Blum]],&lt;ref&gt;Lenore Blum, "AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives," in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M. Leggett, eds., ''Complexities: Women in Mathematics'', Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Gray (scholar)|Mary Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Gray, "Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Beth Ruskai,&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Ruskai, "Why women are discouraged from becoming scientists," ''The Scientist'', March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram,&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram, "Introduction," ''Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979'', Rutgers University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized some gender and science theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women's experiences in different cultures and historical periods.  For example, the first generation of women to receive advanced university degrees in Europe were almost entirely in the natural sciences and medicine -- in part because those fields at the time were much more welcoming of women than were the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, ''Science, Women and Revolution in Russia'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Koblitz and others who are interested in increasing the number of women in science have expressed concern that some of the statements by feminist critics of science could undermine those efforts, notably the following assertion by Keller:&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, ''Reflections on Gender and Science'', Yale University Press, 1985, p. 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
Just as surely as inauthenticity is the cost a woman suffers by joining men in misogynist jokes, so it is, equally, the cost suffered by a woman who identifies with an image of the scientist modeled on the patriarchal husband.  Only if she undergoes a radical disidentification from self can she share masculine pleasure in mastering a nature cast in the image of woman as passive, inert, and blind.

==Language in science==
Emily Martin examines the metaphors used in science to support her claim that science reinforces socially constructed ideas about gender rather than objective views of nature. In her study about the fertilization process, Martin describes several cases when gender-biased perception skewed the descriptions of biological processes during fertilization and even possibly hampered the research. She asserts that classic metaphors of the strong dominant sperm racing to an idle egg are products of gendered stereotyping rather than a faithful portrayal of [[human fertilization]]. The notion that women are passive and men are active are socially constructed attributes of gender which, according to Martin, scientists have projected onto the events of fertilization and so obscuring the fact that eggs do play an active role. For example, she wrote that "even after having revealed...the egg to be a chemically active sperm catcher, even after discussing the egg's role in tethering the sperm, the research team continued for another three years to describe the sperm's role as actively penetrating the egg."&lt;ref name="Aggressive egg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=David|title=New Theory on How The Aggressive Egg Attracts Sperm|journal=Discover|date=June 1992|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1992/jun/theaggressiveegg55|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Gilbert, a developmental biologist at Swarthmore College supports her position: "if you don’t have an interpretation of fertilization that allows you to look at the egg as active, you won’t look for the molecules that can prove it. You simply won’t find activities that you don’t visualize."&lt;ref name="Aggressive egg"/&gt;

==Media and politics==
{{main|Politicization of science}}
The [[mass media]] face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a [[scientific debate]] requires considerable expertise regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the [[Politicization of science|use of science and scientific arguments by politicians]]. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and ''facts'' whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the [[mass media]] frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] include the controversy over the [[MMR vaccine|MMR inoculation]], and the 1988 forced resignation of a government minister, [[Edwina Currie]], for revealing the high probability that battery eggs were contaminated with ''[[Salmonella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2519000/2519451.stm "1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim"], "On This Day," BBC News, December 3, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists and philosophers suggest that scientific theories are more or less shaped by the dominant political, economic, or cultural models of the time, even though the scientific community may claim to be exempt from social influences and historical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-86091-646-8 | title = Against Method | page = 66 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-8166-1659-0 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | pages = 272–273, 276 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Zoologist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] thought that the Darwinian theory of evolution overstressed a painful "we must struggle to survive" way of life, which he said was influenced by [[capitalism]] and the struggling lifestyles people lived within it.&lt;ref name="Anton Wilson 1999 4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1-4043-1945-X | title = Mutual Aid | page = Preface to the 1914 edition | publisher = Porter Sargent | last = Kropotkin | first = Peter | year = 1955 | authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx also thought that science was largely driven by and used as capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-8166-1659-0 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = 40 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Anton Wilson]], [[Stanley Aronowitz]], and [[Paul Feyerabend]] all thought that the [[military-industrial complex]], large [[corporation]]s, and the grants that came from them had an immense influence over the research and even results of scientific experiments.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robert Anton: 1999, pg 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-86091-184-5 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 102 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yo2"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-8166-1659-0 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = 20 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronowitz even went as far as to say "It does not matter that the scientific community ritualistically denies its alliance with economic/industrial and military power. The evidence is overwhelming that such is the case. Thus, every major power has a national science policy; the United States Military appropriates billions each year for 'basic' as well as 'applied' research".&lt;ref name="yo2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">'''Egonomics''' is a form of self-management first proposed by [[Thomas Schelling]] in his paper "Egonomics, or the Art of Self-Management."  Schelling suggested that individuals suffer from a sort of [[split-personality]] disorder whereby the present self wants a specific thing (e.g., eating a cookie) but the future or past self wants a different thing (e.g., losing weight).  Both selves exist, but do not exist at the same time. 

Schelling wrote: "What I have in mind is an act or decision that a person takes ...[based upon] preferences [that] differ from what they were earlier...If the person could make the final decision about that action at the earlier time, precluding a later change in mind, he would make a different choice ..."{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Schelling suggested a number of strategies for dealing with this issue in his paper, such as [[precommitment]], use of [[Bright-line rule|bright line rules]], delay tactics, or creating a pre-arranged deal between selves.

On similar lines, contrary to Schelling’s definition, author [[Gaurav Madan]] defines “Egonomics” as a composite of two terms – “Ego” and “omics”. In his view, Ego means the self-awareness, a part of the mind that mediates between the [[conscious]] and the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] and is responsible for reality testing, and also a sense of personal identity. However, the suffix –omics derives its meaning from [[biology]] that means a study in the totality of an entity, which in this case is self. Thus, he suggests “Egonomics” as a process of developing holistic awareness of “awareness” itself. He further adds, it should not be confused self-perception, self-identity or similar terms.

Similar to the work of Schelling, Gaurav affirms that "at the core of Egonomics is the idea that within each individual exists two selves: the past or future self and the present self, constantly at odds, leading to a sort of cognitive dissonance between the two. Both selves exist within us and are equally valid, but aren’t always active at the same time. It’s a natural and ongoing conflict between immediate desire and long-term desires, we call longing." Egonomics is the pursuit of awareness of that longing.

An '''enumerative definition''' of a concept or term is a special type of [[extensional definition]] that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that fall under the concept or term in question.  Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets.

An example of an enumerative definition for the set
; [[extant species|extant]] [[monotreme]] species
(for which the [[intensional definition]] is ''species of currently-living mammals that [[oviparity|lay eggs]]'') would be
: [[platypus|platypi]]
: echidnae:
:: [[short-beaked echidna]]
:: long-beaked echidnae:
::: [[Sir David's long-beaked echidna]]
::: [[eastern long-beaked echidna]]

'''Fluentd''' is a [[cross platform]] [[open-source software|open-source]] [[data collection]] software project originally developed at Treasure Data. It is written primarily in the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] programming language.

== Overview ==
Fluentd is a [[Big Data]] tool for semi- or un-structured data sets. Like [[Apache Kafka]], it analyzes [[Logfile#Event logs|event log]]s, [[Application software|application]] logs, and [[clickstream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pasupuleti, Pradeep and Purra, Beulah Salome (2015). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=evioCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 ''Data Lake Development with Big Data'']. pp. 44–45; 48. [[Packt]]. {{ISBN|1785881663}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suonsyrjä and Mikkonen, the "core idea of Fluentd is to be the unifying layer between different types of log inputs and outputs.",&lt;ref&gt;Suonsyrjä, Sampo and Mikkonen, Tommi [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TRWcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 "Designing an Unobtrusive Analytics Framework for Monitoring Java Applications"], pp. 170–173 in ''Software Measurement''. Springer. {{ISBN|3319242857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluentd is available on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.&lt;ref&gt;Fluentd.org. [http://www.fluentd.org/download "Download Fluentd"]. Retrieved 10 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Fluentd was created by Sadayuki Furuhashi as a project of the [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]]-based firm Treasure Data. Written primarily in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], its source code was released as [[open-source software]] in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Chris (30 October 2013). [https://jaxenter.com/treasure-data-breaking-down-the-hadoop-barrier-2-107032.html "Treasure Data: Breaking down the Hadoop barrier"]. ''JAXenter''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fluentd-architecture"&gt;Fluentd.org. [http://www.fluentd.org/architecture "What is Fluentd?"]. Retrieved 10 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
The company announced $5 million of funding in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Treasure Data raises $5M, fuses Hadoop and data warehouse in Amazon’s cloud |author= Derrick Harris |work= GigaOm |date= July 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Users ==

Fluentd was one of the data collection tools recommended by [[Amazon Web Services]] in 2013, when it was said to be similar to [[Apache Flume]] or [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Best Practices for Amazon EMR |author= Parviz Deyhim |date= August 2013 |publisher= Amazon Web Services |url= http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Amazon_EMR_Best_Practices.pdf |page= 12 |access-date= March 24, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160326193947/http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Amazon_EMR_Best_Practices.pdf |archive-date= 2016-03-26 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Cloud Platform]]'s [[BigQuery]] recommends Fluentd as default real-time data-ingestion tool, and uses Google's customized version of Fluentd, called google-fluentd, as a default logging agent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Cloud Platform]] (2016). [https://cloud.google.com/solutions/real-time/fluentd-bigquery "Real-time logs analysis using Fluentd and BigQuery"]. Retrieved 10 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Google Cloud Platform (2016).

'''Francesco Cattani da Diacceto''' (16 November 1466 – 10 April 1522) was a [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher of the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Life==

Diacceto was born in Florence on 16 November 1466, the son of Zanobi Cattani da Diacceto and Lionarda di Francesco di Iacopo Venturi.&lt;ref name=varchi/&gt; In his nineteenth year he married Lucretia di Cappone di Bartolomeo Capponi, with whom he had seven sons and six daughters. From 1491 to 1492 he studied philosophy under [[Oliviero Arduini]] at the [[University of Pisa]].  When he returned to Florence he became a disciple of [[Marsilio Ficino]] and a member of the intellectual group known as the [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]].&lt;ref name=kris/&gt; He is sometimes considered Ficino's successor.&lt;ref name=trecc/&gt; Unlike Ficino, Diacceto tried to reconcile the philosophies of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]].&lt;ref name=deitz/&gt; Also, he was not concerned with trying to Christianise Plato or [[Plotinus]], so he provides a much clearer account of Neoplatonic [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[astrology]]; however, he appears to have been less interested in the subject than Ficino.&lt;ref name=ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Daniel Pickering Walker]]|title=Spiritual and Demonic Magic: From Ficino to Campanella|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-XjCKQi1lgC|date=1958|page=31|isbn=0-271-02045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Diacceto died in Florence on 10 April 1522.

==Works==

The works of Diacceto, in the original Latin, are collected in the 1563 edition, ''Opera Omnia'', edited by [[Theodor Zwinger]] and published in Basel.

''[[De Pulchro]]'', which is based on Plotinus, contains Diacceto's Neoplatonic theory of magical and astrological effects, in a chapter entitled: "The twofold soul, first and second, and its cognition likewise twofold, from which derives the appetite for beauty, and natural Magic: the nature of which he shows and which he differentiates from superstitious magic."&lt;ref name=ref/&gt;

'''Francisco Antônio de Moraes Accioli Dória''' (born 1945, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[mathematician]], [[philosopher]], and [[genealogist]]. Francisco Antônio Dória received his B.S. in [[Chemical Engineering]] from the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] (UFRJ), Brazil, in 1968 and then got his doctorate from the [[Brazilian Center for Research in Physics]] (CBPF), advised by [[Leopoldo Nachbin]] in 1977. Dória worked for a while at the Physics Institute of UFRJ, and then left to become a Professor of the Foundations of Communications at the School of Communications, also at UFRJ. Dória held visiting positions at the [[University of Rochester]] (NY), [[Stanford University]] (CA) (here as a Senior Fulbright Scholar), and the [[University of São Paulo]] (USP). His most prolific period spawned from his collaboration with [[Newton da Costa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Brazilian logician and one of the founders of [[paraconsistent logic]], which began in 1985. He is currently Professor of Communications, Emeritus, at UFRJ and a member of the [[Brazilian Academy of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academia.org.br/artigos/o-poder-da-matematica&lt;/ref&gt;

His main achievement (with Brazilian logician and philosopher [[Newton da Costa]]) is the proof that [[chaos theory]] is undecidable (published in 1991), and when properly axiomatized within classical set theory, is incomplete in the sense of [[Gödel]]. The decision problem for [[chaotic dynamical system]]s had been formulated by mathematician [[Morris Hirsch]].

More recently da Costa and Dória introduced a formalization for the [[P = NP]] hypothesis which they called the “exotic formalization,” and showed in a series of papers that axiomatic set theory together with exotic P = NP is [[consistent]] if set theory is consistent. They then prove:

If exotic P = NP together with axiomatic set theory is omega-consistent, then axiomatic set theory + P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP is consistent.

(So far nobody has advanced a proof of the omega-consistency of set theory + exotic P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP.) They also showed that the equivalence between exotic P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP and the usual formalization for P = NP, is independent of set theory and holds of the standard integers. If set theory plus that equivalence condition has the same provably total recursive functions as plain set theory, follows the consistency of P = NP with set theory.

Dória is also interested in the theories of [[hypercomputation]] and in the foundations of economic theory.

'''Frederick Irwin''' "'''Fred'''" '''Dretske''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|ɛ|t|s|k|i}}; December 9, 1932 – July 24, 2013) was an American [[philosopher]] noted for his contributions to [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers|author1=Shook, J.R.|author2=Hull, R.T.|date=2005|volume=1|publisher=Thoemmes Continuum|isbn=9781843710370|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ijpj1tB3Qr0C|page=660|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born to Frederick and Hattie Dretske, Dretske first planned to be an engineer, attending [[Purdue University]]. He changed his mind after taking the university's only philosophy course, deciding philosophy was the only thing he wanted to do in his life.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/fred-dretske&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in 1954 with a degree in electrical engineering and serving in the Army, he enrolled in graduate school in philosophy at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he received his PhD in 1960. His dissertation, supervised by [[May Brodbeck]], was on the philosophy of time.

Dretske’s first academic appointment was to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1960, where he rose to the rank of full Professor. In 1988 he was recruited to [[Stanford University]], where he was the Bella and Eloise Mabury Knapp Professor of Philosophy. He remained at Stanford until his retirement in 1998, after which he was Professor Emeritus in Philosophy at Stanford and Senior Research Scholar in Philosophy at [[Duke University]] until his death.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

Dretske held [[internalism and externalism|externalist]] views about the mind, and thus he tried in various writings to show that by means of mere [[introspection]] one actually learns about his or her own mind less than might be expected. His later work centered on conscious experience and self-knowledge, and he was awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.institutnicod.org/seminaires-colloques/conferences-et-prix-jean-nicod/archives/?lang=fr&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pratt.duke.edu/news/american-academy-arts-and-sciences-elects-petroski-five-others-duke |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713160230/http://pratt.duke.edu/news/american-academy-arts-and-sciences-elects-petroski-five-others-duke |archivedate=2015-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his death, he was survived by his second wife Judith Fortson, by his children Kathleen Dretske and Ray Dretske, and by a stepson, Ryan Fortson.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/newsobserver/obituary.aspx?pid=166139448|title=Frederick I.

==Philosophical work==

===''Seeing and Knowing'' (1969)===

Dretske’s first book, ''Seeing and Knowing'', deals with the question of what is required to know that something is the case on the basis of what is seen. According to the theory presented in Seeing and Knowing, for a subject S to be able to see that an object b has property P is:

(i) for b to be P
(ii) for S to see b
(iii) for the conditions under which S sees b to be such that b would not look the way it now looks to S unless it were P
and (iv) for S, believing that conditions are as described in (iii), to take b to be P.&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1969, pp. 78-93)&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, for me to see that the soup is boiling - to know, by seeing, that it is boiling - is for the soup to be boiling, for me to see the soup, for the conditions under which I see the soup to be such that it would not look the way it does were it not boiling, and for me to believe that the soup is boiling on that basis.

===''Knowledge and the Flow of Information'' (1981)===

Dretske’s next book returned to the topic of knowledge gained via perception but substantially changes the theory. Dretske had become convinced that [[information theory]] was required to make sense of knowledge (and also belief). He signaled this change at the beginning of the new book, opening the Preface with the lines “In the beginning there was information. The word came later.”&lt;ref&gt;(Dretske 1981, vii)&lt;/ref&gt; Information, understood in Dretske’s sense, is something that exists as an objective and mind-independent feature of the natural world and can be quantified. Dretske offers the following theory of information:

A signal r carries the information that s is F = The conditional probability of s’s being F, given r (and k), is 1 (but, given k alone, less than 1).&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1981, p. 65)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, for a red light (r) to carry the information that a goal (s) has been scored (is F) is for the probability that a goal has been scored, given that the light is red (and given my background knowledge of the world, k), to be 1 (but less than 1 given just my background knowledge).

With this theory of information, Dretske then argued that for a knower, K, to know that s is F = K’s belief that s is F is caused (or causally sustained) by the information that s is F.&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1981, p. 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

His theory of knowledge thus replaced conscious appearances with the idea that the visual state of the observer carries information, thereby minimizing appeal to the mysteries of consciousness in explaining knowledge.

Dretske’s work on belief begins in the last third of Knowledge and the Flow of Information,&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1981, pp. 169-235)&lt;/ref&gt; but the theory changed again in the book that followed, Explaining Behavior (1988). There Dretske claims that actions are the causing of movements by mental states, rather than the movements themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1988, p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; Action is thus a partly mental process itself, not a mere product of a mental process. For the meaning - the content - of a belief to explain an action, on this view, is for the content of the belief to explain why it is that the mental state is part of a process that leads to the movement it does.&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1988, pp. 79-85)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Explaining Behavior:  Reasons in a World of Causes'' (1988)===

According to ''Explaining Behavior'', a belief that s is F is a brain state that has been recruited (through operant conditioning) to be part of movement-causing processes because of the fact that it did, when recruited, carry the information that s is F.&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1988, 51-77)&lt;/ref&gt; Being recruited because of carrying information gives a thing (such as a brain state) the function of carrying that information, on Dretske’s view, and having the function of carrying information makes that thing a representation.

Beliefs are thus mental representations that contribute to movement production because of their contents (saying P is why the brain state is recruited to cause movement), and so form components of the process known as acting for a reason.

An important feature of Dretske’s account of belief is that, although brain states are recruited to control action because they carry information, there is no guarantee that they will continue to do so. Yet, once they have been recruited for carrying information, they have the function of carrying information, and continue to have that function even if they no longer carry information. This is how misrepresentation enters the world.&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1988, pp. 64-70)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Naturalizing the Mind'' (1995)===

Dretske’s last monograph was on consciousness.  Between the representational theory of belief, desire, and action in Explaining Behavior and the representational theory of consciousness found in Naturalizing the Mind, Dretske aimed to give full support to what he calls the “Representational Thesis.” This is the claim that:

(1) All mental facts are representational facts, and
(2) All representational facts are facts about informational functions.&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1995, p. xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Naturalizing the Mind'' Dretske argues that when a brain state acquires, through natural selection, the function of carrying information, then it is a mental representation suited (with certain provisos) to being a state of consciousness. Representations that get their functions through being recruited by operant conditioning, on the other hand, are beliefs, just as he held in ''Explaining Behavior''.&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1995, pp. 2-22)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other philosophical work===

In addition to the subjects tackled in Dretske’s book-length projects, he was also known as a leading proponent, along with [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]] and [[Michael Tooley]], of the view that laws of nature are relations among universals.

In his 1970 article "Epistemic Operators", Fred Dretske discusses [[epistemic closure]] and its relationship to [[philosophical skepticism]].  The principle of epistemic closure holds the following to be valid:

* S knows p.
* S knows p entails q.
* S knows q.

For example,

# John knows that he is eating oatmeal.
# John knows that eating oatmeal entails that he is not eating scrambled eggs.
# John knows that he is not eating scrambled eggs.

Epistemic closure, however, is vulnerable to exploitation by the skeptic.  Eating oatmeal entails not eating scrambled eggs.  It also entails not eating scrambled eggs while being deceived by an evil demon into believing one is eating oatmeal.  Because John does not have evidence to suggest that he is not being deceived by an evil demon, the skeptic argues that John does not know he is eating oatmeal.  To combat this attack by the skeptic, Dretske develops [[relevant alternatives theory]] (RAT).

RAT holds that an agent need only be able to rule out all ''relevant'' alternatives in order to possess knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Dretske, Fred. 1970. "Epistemic Operators", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 67, pp. 1007–23.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to RAT, every knowledge claim is made against a spectrum of relevant alternatives entailed by the original knowledge claim.  Also entailed by a knowledge claim are irrelevant alternatives.  The skeptic's alternatives fall into this irrelevant category.  The following applies RAT to Johns oatmeal:

# John knows that he is eating oatmeal (as opposed to eating scrambled eggs, eating a bagel, bathing in oatmeal, etc.)
# John knows that eating oatmeal entails that he is not eating scrambled eggs.
# John knows that he is not eating scrambled eggs.
# John knows that eating oatmeal entails that he is not eating scrambled eggs while being deceived by an evil demon into believing he is eating oatmeal.
# John does not know that he is not eating scrambled eggs while being deceived by an evil demon.  (This alternative is irrelevant; it does not lie within the spectrum of relevant alternatives implied by his initial claim.)

Although it provides a defense from the skeptic, RAT requires a denial of the principle of epistemic closure.  Epistemic closure does not hold if one does not know all of the known entailments of a knowledge claim.  The denial of epistemic closure is rejected by many philosophers who regard the principle as intuitive.

Another issue with RAT is how one defines "relevant alternatives."  "A relevant alternative," Dretske writes, "is an alternative that might have been realized in the existing circumstances if the actual state of affairs had not materialized."&lt;ref&gt;Dretske (1970, p. 1021)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gentō Sokuchū''' ({{CJKV|j={{linktext|玄|透|即|中}}}}) was a [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] priest and the 50th abbot of [[Eihei-ji]], the school's head temple. He was part of a 17th and 18th century movement within the Sōtō school that sought to bring the school's teachings back in line with those of the 13th century founding teacher, [[Dōgen]].&lt;ref name="Foulk, p.56"&gt;Foulk, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, he edited major editions of works by Dōgen and succeeded in disseminating them widely. He is best remembered for compiling the ''Eihei Rules of Purity'' (''Eihei Shingi''), a collection of writings by Dōgen laying out a strict code of conduct for monks. These rules had been largely unheeded in the school in the preceding several centuries, and Gentō used his high position as abbot of [[Eihei-ji]] to reintroduce and enforce them.&lt;ref name="Foulk, p.56"/&gt; His work on the ''Eihei Rules of Purity'' was completed in 1794 while he was serving as the eleventh abbot of [[Entsū-ji]].&lt;ref name="Heine, p.245"&gt;Heine, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he became the 50th abbot of Eihei-ji.&lt;ref name="Heine, p.245"/&gt; He was also involved in editing Dōgen's master work, the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]''.&lt;ref name="leighton"&gt;Leighton, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his efforts on monastic rules, he also sought to remove what he perceived to be non-Sōtō elements within the school.&lt;ref name="Foulk, p.56"/&gt; He de-emphasized the use of [[koan]]s due to their apparent historical association with the competing [[Rinzai]] school.&lt;ref name="Heine, p.245"/&gt; In 1796 he also had the sangha hall (''sōdō'', 僧堂) at Eihei-ji rebuilt in imitation of the [[Song Dynasty]] structures that Dōgen had described.&lt;ref name="Foulk, p.57"&gt;Foulk, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; The previous building, dating from only fifty years earlier, was built in a [[Ming Dynasty]] style based on temples of the recently introduced [[Ōbaku]] school.&lt;ref name="Foulk, p.57"/&gt; Gentō's former student at Entsū-ji was the famous wandering monk [[Ryōkan]]. The Buddhist scholar [[Michel Mohr]] suggests that Gentō's fanaticism for 'purifying' the Sōtō school probably informed Ryōkan's decision to become an itinerant monk without an association to any temple.&lt;ref name="Heine, p.245"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Hajime Tanabe'''|田辺 元|Tanabe Hajime|February 3, 1885 – April 29, 1962}} was a Japanese philosopher of the [[Kyoto School]]. In 1947 he became a member of the [[Japan Academy]], in 1950 he received the [[Order of Culture|Order of Cultural Merit]], and in 1957 an honorary doctorate from [[Freiburg University|University of Freiburg]].

He was born in Tokyo. His father was the school principal of [[Kaisei Academy]]. He enrolled in the university of Tokyo first as a natural sciences student, then moved to literature and philosophy. After graduation, he worked in [[Tohoku University]] as lecturer.

==Biography==
Tanabe was a founding member of what has become known in the West as the Kyoto School, which also includes the notable philosophers [[Kitaro Nishida]] and [[Keiji Nishitani]]. While the latter philosophers have received recognition in western philosophy, Tanabe's writing has received less notice. All the philosophers of this school received opprobrium for their perceived active role in the Japanese empire's nationalistic regime. However, their participation in resistance to the political environment has been documented widely by [[James Heisig]]. Tanabe has come under more scrutiny and opprobrium for his political activities, though scholarship{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} provides some mitigation of the harsher picture of Tanabe as an ardent fascist in the mold of his one-time teacher, [[Martin Heidegger]].

Tanabe was born in a household devoted to education. His father was principal at the Kaisei high school. Tanabe's father was also a scholar of Confucius, whose teachings may have influenced Tanabe's philosophical and religious thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ozaki|first=Makoto|title=Introduction to the Philosophy of Tanabe|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanabe also taught English at Kaisei after graduating from the [[University of Tokyo]].

After graduating from university, [[Kitaro Nishida]] invited Tanabe to teach at Kyoto Imperial University (now Kyoto University). After Nishida's retirement from teaching, Tanabe succeeded him. Though they began as friends, and shared several philosophical concepts such as Absolute Nothingness, Tanabe became increasingly critical of Nishida's philosophy. Many of Tanabe's writings after Nishida left the university obliquely attacked the latter's philosophy.

Tanabe accepted the position of Associate Professor at Kyoto University in 1919. He spent two years studying in Germany at Berlin University and then the University of Freiburg from 1922-1924. At Freiburg, he studied under [[Edmund Husserl]] and was tutored by the young Heidegger. The influence of these two philosophers stayed with Tanabe throughout his life, and much of his thought exhibits the assumptions and terminology of [[ontology]].

During the Japanese expansion and war effort, Tanabe worked with Nishida and others to maintain the right for free academic expression. Though he criticized the [[Nazi]]-inspired letter of Heidegger, Tanabe himself was caught up in the [[Japanese militarism|Japanese war effort]], and his letters to students going off to war exhibit many of the same terms and ideology used by the reigning military powers. Even more damning are his essays written in defense of Japanese racial and state superiority, exploiting his theory of the Logic of Species to herald and abet the militaristic ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hubbard, Jamie, 'Tanabe's Metanoetics: The Failure of Absolutism,' in Unno and Heisig, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war years, however, Tanabe wrote and published little, perhaps reflecting the moral turmoil that he attests to in his monumental post-war work, ''Philosophy as Metanoetics''. The work is framed as a confession of repentance (metanoia) for his support of the war effort. It purports to show a philosophical way to overcome philosophy itself, which suggests that traditional western thought contains the seeds of the ideological framework that led to World War II.

His activities, and the actions of Japan as a whole, haunted Tanabe for the rest of his life. In 1951, he writes:

{{quote|But as the tensions of World War II grew ever more fierce and with it the regulation of thinking, weak-willed as I was, I found myself unable to resist and could not but yield to some degree to the prevalent mood, which is a shame deeper than I can bear. The already blind militarism had led so many of our graduates precipitously to the battlefields; among the fallen were more than ten from philosophy, for which I feel the height of responsibility and remorse. I can only lower my head and earnestly lament my sin.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heisig, James, 'The Self That Is Not a self,' in Unno and Heisig, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He lived for another eleven years after writing these words, dying in 1962 in Kita-Karuizawa, Japan.

==Thought==
As James Heisig and others note, Tanabe and other members of the Kyoto School accepted the western philosophical tradition stemming from the Greeks. This tradition attempts to explain the meaning of human experience in rational terms. This sets them apart from other eastern writers who, though thinking about what life means and how best to live a good life, spoke in religious terms.

Although the Kyoto School used western philosophical terminology and rational exploration, they made these items serve the purpose of presenting a unique vision of reality from within their cultural heritage. Specifically, they could enrich a discussion of the ultimate nature of reality using the experience and thought of various forms of [[Buddhism]] like [[Zen]] and [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], but embedded in an analysis that calls upon conceptual tools forged and honed in western philosophy by thinkers ranging from [[Plato]] to [[René Descartes]] to Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;Cestari, Matteo, "Between Emptiness and Absolute Nothingness: Reflections on Negation in Nishida and Buddhism," p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanabe's own contribution to this dialog between eastern and western philosophy ultimately sets him off from the other members of the Kyoto School. His radical critique of philosophical reason and method, while stemming from [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], which emerges in his work ''Philosophy as Metanoetics'', easily sets him off as a major thinker with a unique position on perennial philosophical questions. Some commentators, for example, suggest that Tanabe's work in [[Metanoetics]] is a forerunner of deconstructionism.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Maraldo, 'Metanoetics and the Crisis of Reason: Tanabe, Nishida, and Contemporary Philosophy,' in Unno, pp. 235-255&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanabe engaged with philosophers of Continental philosophy, especially [[Existentialism]]. His work is often a dialog with philosophers like Kierkegaard, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and Heidegger. Because of his engaging these thinkers, especially the first two, Tanabe's thought has been characterized as Existentialist, though Makoto Ozaki writes that Tanabe preferred the terms "existentialist philosophy of history," "historical existentialism," or "existential metaphysics of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ozaki|page=193}} By these terms, Ozaki paraphrases Tanabe as meaning "a synthesis of relativistic historicism and individualistic existentialism."&lt;/ref&gt; In his masterpiece, ''Philosophy as Metanoetics'', Tanabe characterized his work as "philosophy that is not a philosophy," foreshadowing various approaches to thinking by deconstructionists.

Like other Existentialists, Tanabe emphasizes the importance of philosophy as being meaning; that is, what humans think about and desire is finding a meaning to life and death. In company with the other members of the Kyoto School, Tanabe believed that the foremost problem facing humans in the modern world is the lack of meaning and its consequent [[Nihilism]]. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], following Kierkegaard in his ''Concept of Anxiety'', was keen to characterize this as [[Nothingness]]. Heidegger, as well, appropriated the notion of Nothingness in his later writings.

The Kyoto School philosophers believed that their contribution to this discussion of Nihilism centered on the Buddhist-inspired concept of nothingness, aligned with its correlate [[Sunyata]]. Tanabe and Nishida attempted to distinguish their philosophical use of this concept, however, by calling it [[Absolute Nothingness|Absolute Nothingess]]. This term differentiates it from the Buddhist religious concept of nothingness, as well as underlines the historical aspects of human existence that they believed Buddhism does not capture.

Tanabe disagreed with Nishida and Nishitani on the meaning of Absolute Nothingness, emphasizing the practical, historical aspect over what he termed the latter's [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]ism. By this, Tanabe hoped to emphasize the working of Nothingness in time, as opposed to an eternal Now. He also wished to center the human experience in action rather than contemplation, since he thought that action embodies a concern for [[ethics]] whereas contemplation ultimately disregards this, resulting in a form of [[Monism]], after the mold of [[Plotinus]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Fredericks, James, 'Philosophy as Metanoetics', in Unno and Heisig, pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, echoing Kierkegaard's undermining in ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' of [[Systematic Philosophy|systematic philosophy]] from Plato to [[Baruch Spinoza]] to Hegel,&lt;ref&gt;Tanabe's stance on system-building in philosophy is an open question. Heisig, for example, notes the systematic approach that Tanabe takes to philosophy. Tanabe's writings in the philosophy of science often give the appearance of identifying basic metaphysical principles which, combined with Absolute Nothingness, reveal something akin to Aristotle's axioms, the guiding archetypes for matter and thought.&lt;/ref&gt; Tanabe questions whether there is an aboriginal condition of preexisting awareness that can or must be regained to attain enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Fredericks, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanabe's insistence on this point is not simply philosophical and instead points again to his insistence that the proper mode of human being is action, especially ethics. However, he is critical of the notion of a pre-existing condition of enlightenment because he accepts the Kantian notion of [[radical evil]], wherein humans exhibit an ineluctable propensity to act against their own desires for the good and instead perpetrate evil.&lt;ref&gt;Laube, Johannes, "The Way of Metanoia and the Way of the Bodhisattva," in Unno and Heisig, pp. 318 and 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For critique, see Hubbard, Jamie, "Tanabe's Metanoetics: The Failure of Absolutism," in Unno and Heisig, p. 368 and pp. 374-376.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Demonstration of Christianity===
Tanabe's "Demonstration of Christianity" presents [[religion]] as a cultural entity in tension with the [[existential]] meaning that religion plays in individual lives. Tanabe uses the terms genus to represent the universality of form that all entities strive for, contrasting them with the stable, though ossified form they can become as species as social systems.

Tanabe contraposes [[Christianity]] and [[Christ]], represented here as the opposition between [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and [[Jesus]].  Jesus, in Tanabe's terms, is a historical being who manifests the action of Absolute Nothingness, or [[God]] understood in non-theistic terms. God is beyond all conceptuality and human thinking, which can only occur in terms of self-identity, or [[Being]]. God becomes, as manifested in human actions, though God can never be reduced to being, or self-identity.

For Tanabe, humans have the potential to realize compassionate divinity, Nothingness, through continual death and resurrection, by way of seeing their nothingness. Tanabe believes that the Christian [[Incarnation]] narrative is important for explaining the nature of reality, since he believed Absolute Nothingness becoming human exemplifies the true nature of the [[divinity|divine]], as well as exemplar to realization of human being in relationship to divinity. Jesus signifies this process in a most pure form, thereby setting an example for others to follow.

Ultimately, Tanabe chooses philosophy over religion, since the latter tends toward socialization and domestication of the original impulse of the religious action. Philosophy, understood as [[Metanoetics]], always remains open to questions and the possibility self-delusion in the form of [[radical evil]]. Therefore, Tanabe's statement is a philosophy "of" religion.

'''Helping behavior''' refers to voluntary actions intended to help the others, with reward regarded or disregarded. It is a type of [[prosocial behavior]] (voluntary action intended to help or benefit another individual or group of individuals,&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., &amp; Mussen, P. H. (1989). ''The Roots of Prosocial Behavior in Children.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-33771-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R. (2006). ''How children develop, exploring child development student media tool kit &amp; Scientific American Reader to accompany how children develop.'' New York: Worth Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7167-6113-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; such as sharing, comforting, rescuing and helping).

[[Altruism]] is distinguished from helping behavior. Altruism refers to prosocial behaviors that are carried out without expectation of obtaining external reward (concrete reward or social reward) or internal reward (self-reward).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, P. A., Bernzweig, J., Eisenberg, N., &amp; Fabes, R. A. (1991). The development and socialization of prosocial behavior. In R. A. Hinde, &amp; J. Groebel (Ed), ''Cooperation and prosocial behaviour'' (pp. 54–77). New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-39999-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives on helping behavior==

===Kin selection theory===

[[Kin selection]] theory explains altruism in an [[evolution]]ary perspective. Since [[natural selection]] aids in screening out [[species]] without abilities to adapt the challenging environment, preservation of good traits and superior [[gene]]s are important for survival of future generations (i.e. [[inclusive fitness]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WMD-4F1Y9M7-39&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=e23db7a0d5b0fc631783d45f5bebbce5 Hamilton, W. D. (1964). The genetical evolution of social behavior. I, II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology, 7,'' 1–52].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton, W. D.]] (1971) Selection of selfish and altruistic behavior in some extreme models. In J. F. Eisenberg &amp; W. S. Sillon (Eds.), ''Man and beast: Comparative social behavior.'' Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Kin selection refers to the tendency to perform behaviors that may favor the chance of survival of people with similar genetic base.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Hoffman|Hoffman, M. L.]] (1981) Is altruism part of human nature? ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 40''(1), 121-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sober, E., &amp; Wilson, D. S. (1998). ''Unto others: The evolution and psychology of unselfish behavior.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael, F.C. (1984) Co-operative breeding by the Australian Bell Miner Manorina melanophrys Latham: A test of kin selection theory. ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. 14'', 137-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. D. Hamilton]] has proposed a mathematical expression for the kin selection:

:::::::::::::: rB&gt;C

"where B is the benefit to the recipient, C is the cost to the altruist (both measured as the number of offspring gained or lost) and r is the coefficient of relationship (i.e. the probability that they share the same gene by descent)."&lt;ref name="Madsen, E.

An experiment conducted in Britain supports kin selection&lt;ref name="Madsen, E. A. 2007"/&gt; The experiment is illustrated by diagrams below. The result shows that people are more willing to provide help to people with higher relatedness and occurs in both gender and various cultures. The result also show gender difference in kin selection which men are more affected by the cues of similar genetic based than women.

===Reciprocal altruism===
[[Reciprocal altruism]] is the idea that the incentive for an individual to help in the present is based on the expectation of the potential receipt in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Trivers|Trivers, Robert]] (1971) The evolution of reciprocal altruism. ''Quarterly Review of Biology, 46,'' 35-56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Trivers]] believes it to be advantageous for an organism to pay a cost to his or her own life for another non-related organism if the favor is repaid (only when the benefit of the sacrifice outweighs the cost).

As [[Peter Singer]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Singer|Singer, Peter]] (1994). ''Ethics.'' Oxford: Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt; notes, “reciprocity is found amongst all social mammals with long memories who live in stable communities and recognize each other as individuals.” Individuals should identify cheaters (those who do not reciprocate help) who lose the benefit of help from them in the future, as seen in blood-sharing in [[vampire bat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, G. S. (1984) ‘Reciprocal Food Sharing in the Vampire Bat’, ''Nature, 308'', 181-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade in economic trades and business&lt;ref&gt;Loch, C. H., &amp; Wu, Y. (2007). "Behavioral Operations Management". ''Foundations and Trends in Technology, Information and Operations Management,1''(3),  121-232.&lt;/ref&gt; may underlie reciprocal altruism in which products given and received involve different exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, H., and Hill, K. (1985). Food Sharing among Ache Foragers: Tests of Explanatory Hypotheses. ''Current Anthropology, 26,'' 223–245.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic trades follow the “I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine” principle. A pattern of frequent giving and receiving of help among workers boost both productivity and social standing.

===Negative-state relief model===

The [[negative-state relief model]] of helping&lt;ref name="Fultz. J 1988"&gt;Fultz. J, Schaller.M, &amp; Cialdini. R.B. (1988). Empathy, sadness and distress: Three related but distinct vicarious affective responses to anothers' suffering. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 14,'' 312- 315.&lt;/ref&gt; states that people help because of [[egotism|egoism]]. Egoistic motives lead one to help others in bad circumstances in order to reduce personal distress experienced from knowing the situation of the people in need. Helping behavior happens only when the personal distress cannot be relieved by other actions. The model explains also people’s avoidance behavior from people in need: this is another way of reducing distress.

====Supporting studies====
1) Guilt feelings were induced to subjects by having participants accidentally ruin a student’s thesis data or seeing the data being ruined. Some subjects experience positive events afterwards, e.g. being praised. Results show that subjects who experience negative guilt feelings are more motivated to help than those who had neutral emotion. However, once the negative mood was relieved by receiving praise, subjects no longer had high motivation in helping.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B., Darby, B. L., Vincent, J. E. (1973). Transgression and altruism: a case of hedonism. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 9''(6), 501-516.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Negative state relief.JPG|600px|[[Negative State Relief Model]]]]

2) Schaller and Cialdini&lt;ref name="Fultz. J 1988"/&gt; found that people who are anticipating positive events (listening to a comedy tape), will show low helping motivation since they are expecting their negative emotions to be lifted up by the upcoming stimulation.

===Empathy-altruism hypothesis===

Helping behavior may be initiated when we feel [[empathy]] for the person, that is, identifying with another person and feeling and understanding what that person is experiencing.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., Akert. R.M. (1997). ''Social Psychology (2nd Ed.)''. The US: Addison-Ewsley Educational Publishers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilovich, T., Keltner, D. &amp; Nisbett, R.E. (2006)'' Social Psychology''. New York: W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Empathy-altruism hypothesis by Daniel Batson (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D., &amp; Shaw, L.L. (1991). Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives. ''Psychological Inquiry, 2'',107-122.&lt;/ref&gt; the decision of helping or not depends primarily on whether you feel empathy for the person and secondarily on the cost and rewards (social exchange concerns). It can be illustrated in the following diagram:

The hypothesis was supported by some studies. For example, a study conducted by Fultz and his colleagues (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Fultz, J., Batson, C.D., Fortenbach, V.A., McCarthy, P.M., &amp; Varney, L. (1986). Social evaluation and the empathy altruism hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,50'',761-769.&lt;/ref&gt; divided participants into a high-empathy group and a low-empathy group. They both had to listen to another student, Janet, who reported feeling lonely. The study found that high-empathy group (told to imagine vividly how Janet felt) volunteered to spend more time with Janet, whether or not their help is anonymous, which makes the social reward lower. It shows that if the person feels empathy, they will help without considering the cost and reward, and it complies with the empathy-altruism hypothesis.

===Responsibility – prosocial value orientation===
A strong influence on helping is a feeling of and belief in one's responsibility to help, especially when combined with the belief that one is able to help other people. The responsibility to help can be the result of a situation focusing responsibility on a person, or it can be a characteristic of individuals (leading to helping when activated by others' need). Staub has described a "prosocial value orientation" that made helping more likely both when a person was in physical distress and psychological distress. Prosocial orientation was also negatively related to aggression in boys, and positively related to "constructive patriotism". The components of this orientation are a positive view of human beings, concern about others' welfare, and a feeling of and belief in one's responsibility for others' welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staub|first=Ervin|title=The psychology of good and evil: What leads children, adults and groups to help and harm others|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-52880-1|pages=592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social exchange theory===

According to the [[Social exchange theory|social-exchange theory]], people help because they want to gain goods from the one being helped.&lt;ref&gt;Foa, U. G., &amp; Foa, E. B. (1975). ''Resource theory of social exchange.'' Morrisontown, N.J.: General Learning Press.&lt;/ref&gt; People calculate [[Reward system|rewards]] and costs of helping others, and aim at maximizing the former and minimizing the latter, which is known as a “[[minimax]]” strategy.

Rewards are incentives, which can be materialistic goods, social rewards which can improve one’s image and reputation (e.g. praise) or self-reward.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T. (1975). On the conflicts between biological and social evolution and between psychology and moral tradition. ''American Psychologist, 30,'' 1103–1126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, M. A., &amp; Sigmund, K. (1998). Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring. ''Nature, 393,'' 573-576.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, M. A., Page, K. M., &amp; Sigmund, K. (2000). Fairness versus reason in the ultimatum game. ''Science, 289,'' 1773–1775.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilovich, T., Keltner, D. &amp; Nisbett, R.E. (2006). ''Social Psychology.'' New York: W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rewards are either external or internal. External reward is things that obtained from others when helping them, for instance, friendship and gratitude. People are more likely to help those who are more attractive or important, whose approval is desired.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, D. (1970). Altruism—An examination of the concept and a review of the literature. ''Psychological Bulletin, 72,'' 258-302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, R. K. (1979). Whom does helping help? Paper presented at the Eastern Psychological Association convention, April.&lt;/ref&gt; Internal reward is generated by oneself when helping, for example, sense of goodness and self-satisfaction. When seeing someone in distress, one would empathize the victim and are aroused and distressed. We may choose to help in order to reduce the arousal and distress.&lt;ref&gt;Piliavin, J. A., &amp; Piliavin, I. M. (1973). The Good Samaritan: Why does he help? Unpublished manuscript, University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;
Preceding helping behavior, people consciously calculate the benefits and costs of helping and not helping, and they help when the overall benefit of helping outweigh the cost.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, D. G. (1999). ''Social psychology. (6th ed.).'' United States of America: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Social exchange.JPG|400px|Social Exchange Theory]]

==Implications==

===Cultural differences===
A major [[Cultural identity|cultural difference]] is the difference between [[collectivism]] and [[individualism]]. Collectivists attend more to the needs and goals of the group they belong to, and individualists focus on their own selves. With such contrast, collectivists would be more likely to help the ingroup members, but less frequent than individualists to help strangers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Triandis, H. C.]] (1991). Cross-cultural differences in assertiveness/competition vs. group loyalty/cooperation. In R. A. Hinde, &amp; J. Groebel (Ed), ''Cooperation and prosocial behavior (pp. 78–88).'' New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic environment===
Helping is influenced by [[economic environment]] within the culture. In general, frequency of helping behavior is inversely related to the country economic status.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, R. V., Norenzayan, A., Philbrick, K. (2001) Cross-cultural differences in helping strangers. ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 32(5),'' 543-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural vs. urban area===
The context influences helping behaviors. While there is a myth that small towns are "safer" and "friendlier", it has yet to be proven. In a meta-analytical study by Nancy Steblay, she found out the in either extreme, urban  (300,000 people or more) or rural environments(5,000 people or less), are that worst places if you're looking for help.&lt;ref&gt;Steblay, N. M. (1987). Helping behavior in rural and urban environments: A meta-analysis. ''Psychology Bulletin, 102,'' 346-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choosing a role===
[[Edgar Schein|Edgar Henry Schein]], former professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, assigns three different roles people follow when responding to offers of help. These generic helping roles are The Expert Resource Role, The Doctor Role, The Process Consultant Role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schein|first=Edgar H.|title=Helping : how to offer, give, and receive help|year=2009|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Pub.|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-57675-863-2|pages=53–54|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Expert Resource Role is the most common of the three. It assumes the client, the person being helped, is seeking information or expert service that they cannot provide for themselves. For example, simple issues like asking for directions or more complex issues like an organization hiring a financial consultant will fall into this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schein|first=Edgar H.|title=Helping : how to offer, give, and receive help|year=2009|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Pub.|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-57675-863-2|pages=54–57|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doctor Role can be confused with the Expert Role because they seem to overlap each other. This role includes the client asking for information and service but also demands a diagnosis and prescription. Doctors, counselors, coaches, and repair personnel fulfill this kind of role. Contrary to the expert role, the Doctor Role shifts more power to the helper who is responsible for the previously mentioned duties; diagnosing, prescribing, and administering the cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schein|first=Edgar H.|title=Helping : how to offer, give, and receive help|year=2009|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Pub.|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-57675-863-2|pages=57–61|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schein describes the Process Consultant Role where the helper focuses on the communication process from the very beginning. Before help can start, there needs to be an establishment of trust between the helper and the client. For example, in order for a tech consultant to be effective, he or she has to take a few minutes to discuss what the situation is, how often the problem occurs, what has been tried before, etc. before transitioning into the expert role or the doctor role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schein|first=Edgar H.|title=Helping : how to offer, give, and receive help|year=2009|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Pub.|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-57675-863-2|pages=61–64|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel (Schmuel) Hugo Bergman''' (occasionally Bergmann), or '''Samuel Bergman''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: שמואל הוגו ברגמן; December 25, 1883 – June 18, 1975) was an Israeli [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
Born and raised in [[Austria-Hungary]], Bergmann was a keen member of the [[Prague]] intelligentsia visiting the salon group that met at the house of [[Berta Fanta]]. Bergmann was to marry her daughter Else Fanta.&lt;ref name = "yivo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Fanta_Berta |title=YIVO &amp;#124; Fanta, Berta |publisher=Yivoencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Else emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in 1920,&lt;ref name=hugo&gt;Spector, Scott. "Bergmann, Hugo." YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe 27 July 2010. 2 February 2014 [http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Bergmann_Hugo link]&lt;/ref&gt; and founded, together with [[Martin Buber]], the movement [[Brit Shalom (political organization)|Brit Shalom]] which promoted a "[[binational solution|dual-national]]" area where Jews and [[Arab]]s could live under equal conditions.

He translated several of [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s books about [[Threefold Social Order]] into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

He became a [[Professor]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and later on the [[dean (education)|dean]] of the university. His best friends from Prague to Israel were [[Franz Kafka]], who was a schoolmate of his, the philosopher [[Felix Weltsch]], who later also worked in the University Library of Jerusalem, and [[Max Brod]], who was introduced by Bergman into Zionism as early as before 1910.

He wrote on the nature of quantum mechanics and causality where he interpreted spontaneity in nature with the psychological idea that the closer we come to elements in nature or components in the individual, the less tenable is strict causal determinism and the more freedom we must grant to decisive personal elements.

"In corresponding areas of physics, the statistical law of averages takes on the same functions in determining temporal position and in prediction and reconstruction that the strict law of causality previously covered, but with the distinction that the individual case could be temporally located and predicted or reconstructed before, whereas now we deal only with the average." (1929)

He is the father of [[Martin S. Bergmann]], professor of psychology at [[New York University]], and the uncle of the Czech philosopher and historian [[Pavel Bergmann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">'''Ironist''' (n. Ironism) (from Greek: ''eiron'', ''eironeia''), a term coined by [[Richard Rorty]], describes someone who fulfills three conditions:

{{Quotation|
# She has radical and continuing doubts about the [[final vocabulary]] she currently uses, because she has been impressed by other vocabularies, vocabularies taken as final by people or books she has encountered; 
# She realizes that argument phrased in her present vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts; 
# Insofar as she philosophizes about her situation, she does not think that her vocabulary is closer to reality than others, that it is in touch with a power not herself. |Richard Rorty|Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p.73}}

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'', Rorty argues that [[Proust]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Heidegger]], [[Derrida]], and [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov|Nabokov]], among others, all exemplify Ironism to different extents.

'''Johann Georg Hamann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑː|m|ə|n}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhaːman|lang}}; 27 August 1730 – 21 June 1788) was a German philosopher, whose work was used by his student [[Johann Gottfried Herder|J. G. Herder]] as a main support of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement, and associated by historian of ideas  [[Isaiah Berlin]] with the [[Counter-Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Magus of the North: J.

==Biography==
[[Image:Johann Georg Hamann.jpg|thumb|Johann Georg Hamann (20th century drawing)]]
Hamann was born on 27 August 1730 in [[Königsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia). Initially he studied theology at the [[University of Königsberg]], but became a clerk in a mercantile house and afterward held many small public offices, devoting his leisure to reading philosophy. His first publication was a study in political economy about a dispute on nobility and trade.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Meineke: „Die Vortheile unserer Vereinigung“: Hamanns Dangeuil-Beylage im Lichte der Debatte um den handeltreibenden Adel. [In German] In: [http://www.degruyter.com/view/books/9783110290721/9783110290721.46/9783110290721.46.xml Beetz, Manfred / Rudolph, Andre (Ed.). Johann Georg Hamann: Religion und Gesellschaft (2012)''], pp. 46–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' of “the Magus of the North” ({{lang-de|Magus im Norden}}). His translation of [[David Hume]] into German is considered by most scholars as the one that Hamann's friend, Immanuel Kant, had read and referred to as inspiration for awakening from "dogmatic slumber". Hamann and Kant held each other in mutual respect, although Hamann once declined an invitation by Kant to co-write a physics textbook for children.

==Philosophical arguments==
His distrust of autonomous, disembodied [[reason]] and [[the Enlightenment]] ("I look upon logical proofs the way a well-bred girl looks upon a love letter" was one of his many witticisms) led him to conclude that faith in [[God]] was the only [[solution]] to the vexing problems of [[philosophy]]. His most notable contributions to philosophy were his thoughts on language, which have often been considered as a forerunner to the linguistic turn in postmodern philosophy and also Wittgenstein's philosophy. He famously said that "Reason is language" ("Vernunft ist Sprache").&lt;ref name="Brief"&gt;Johann Georg Hamann, ''Brief an Herder'', v. 8. August 1784, in: Johann Georg Hamann, ''Briefwechsel'', 7 vols., Arthur Henkel (ed.), Wiesbaden: Insel Verlag, 1955–75, vol. 5, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kant's biographers compared him with Hamann: {{Quotation|Kant made reason the rule of his life and the source of his philosophy; Hamann found the source of both in his heart. While Kant dreaded enthusiasm in religion, and suspected in it superstition and fanaticism, Hamann reveled in enthusiasm; and he believed in revelation, miracles, and worship, differing also in these points from the philosopher. In some respects they complemented each other; but the repelling elements were too strong to make them fully sympathetic. The difference in their stand-points, however, makes Hamannn’s views of Kant all the more interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeimmanuelkan00stucgoog|last=Stuckenberg|first=J. H. W.|title=The Life of Immanuel Kant|location= London|publisher=Macmillan|date=1882|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Influences on Hamann==
Hamann was greatly influenced by David Hume. This is most evident in Hamann's conviction that faith and belief, rather than knowledge, determine human actions. Also, Hamann asserted that the efficacy of a concept arises from the habits it reflects rather than any inherent quality it possesses. Hamann famously used the image of [[Socrates]], who often proclaimed to know nothing, in his ''Socratic Memorabilia'', an essay in which Hamann critiques the Enlightenment's dependence on reason.

==Hamann's influence==
Hamann was one of the precipitating forces for the [[Counter-Enlightenment]]. He was, moreover, a mentor to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and an admired influence on Goethe, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], Kierkegaard, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], and [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] devoted a chapter to Hamann in his volume, ''Studies in Theological Styles: Lay Styles'' (Volume III in the English language translation of ''The Glory of the Lord'' series). Most recently, Hamann's influence can be found in the work of the theologians [[Oswald Bayer]] ([[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]), [[John Milbank]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), and [[David Bentley Hart]] ([[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]). Finally, in [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s important summative work, ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity'' (Taylor, 2016),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Charles (2016) ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamann is given credit, along with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and Herder, for inspiring Taylor's "HHH" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.

==The character of Hamann's writing==
Hamann's writings consist of small essays. They display two striking tendencies. The first is their brevity, in comparison with works by his contemporaries. The second is their breadth of allusion and delight in extended analogies. For example, his work ''Golgatha and Scheblimini! By a Preacher in the Wilderness'' (1784) was directed against [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''Jerusalem, or on Religious Might and Judaism'' (1782). His work was also significantly reactive and reparative: rather than advance a “position” of his own, his principal mode of thinking was to respond to others' work.

==Music==
Hamann was a [[lutenist]], having studied this instrument with [[Timofey Belogradsky]] (a student of [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]]), a Ukrainian virtuoso then living in [[Königsberg]].

==Editions==
Fragments of his writings were published by Cramer, under the title of ''Sibyllinische Blätter des Magus aus Norden'' (1819), and a complete edition by Roth (7 vols., 1821–25, with a volume of additions and explanations by Wiener, 1843). ''Hamann's des Magus in Norden Leben und Schriften'', edited by Gildemeister, was published in 5 vols., 1857–68, and a new edition of his ''Schriften und Briefen'', edited by Petri, in 4 vols., 1872-74.

'''Ronald Henry Nixon''' (10 May 1898 – 14 November 1965), later known as '''Sri Krishna Prem''' or '''Sri Krishnaprem''', was a British spiritual aspirant who went to India in the early 20th century. Together with his spiritual teacher Sri Yashoda Mai (1882-1944), he founded an ashram at [[Mirtola]], near [[Almora]], India. He was one of the first Europeans to pursue orthodox [[Vaishnavite]] [[Hinduism]]. Remaining a strict [[Gaudiya Vaishnavite]] the rest of his life, he was highly regarded, and had many Indian disciples. (Correction: By all accounts, and especially by the account of his foremost disciple Sri [[Madhava Ashish]], Krishna Prem transcended the dogmas and practices of his early Vaishnava sectarianism and affirmed a universal spiritual path shorn of "orthodoxy" and blind traditionalism.){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Early life==
Ronald Henry Nixon,&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;{{rp|218}} more commonly called Ronald Nixon, was born in [[Cheltenham]], England, in 1898,&lt;ref name=jones06&gt;"Krishna Prem, Sri (1898&amp;ndash;1965) Western-born Vaishnavite Guru" in {{cite book |last=Jones |first=Constance |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |year=2006 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=9780816075645 |page=246 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ronald%20Nixon%22 |author2=James D. Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and educated in [[Taunton]].&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;
His mother was a [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]] and his father was reportedly in the glass and china business.&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;{{rp|218}}

At age 18, Nixon became a [[Royal Flying Corps|British fighter pilot]] in the First World War.&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;&lt;ref name=brooks89/&gt; On one occasion, he experienced an escape from death that he believed was miraculous, in which a "power beyond our ken" saved him from several enemy planes.&lt;ref&gt;Page 17 in {{cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Seymour B.|title=The masters speak: an American businessman encounters Ashish and Gurdjieff |year=2010 |publisher=Quest Books/Theosophical Pub.

His experiences of death and destruction during the war filled him with a "sense of futility and meaninglessness".&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;{{rp|218}}

After the war, Nixon enrolled in [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he studied English literature.&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt; During this period Nixon also studied philosophy, and became acquainted with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedanta Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Pali]], and developed an interest in going to India to learn more about the practical aspects of Indian religion.&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;{{rp|218}}&lt;ref name=brooks89&gt;"The Case of Sri Krishna Prem" in {{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Charles R.|title=The Hare Krishnas in India|year=1989|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|isbn=9788120809390 |pages=98–101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5tjtDZ438h4C&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ronald%20Nixon%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in India==
In 1921, while still in England, Nixon accepted the offer of a teaching position at the [[University of Lucknow]], in northern India.&lt;ref name=brooks89/&gt; As it turned out, the university's vice-chancellor, Gyanendra Nath Chakravarti, was also spiritually inclined and interested in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and offered Nixon assistance.
Over time, Nixon came to regard Gyanendra's wife, Monica Devi Chakravarti, as his spiritual teacher. 
In 1928, Monika took [[sanyassa|vows of renunciation]] in the [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavite]] tradition, where these vows are called ''vairagya''.&lt;ref name=jones06/&gt; She adopted the monastic name of Sri Yashoda Mai. Soon thereafter, she initiated Nixon into vairagya, and he adopted Krishna Prem as his monastic name.&lt;ref name=jones06/&gt;

In 1930, Sri Yashoda Mai and Krishna Prem together founded an ashram at [[Mirtola]], near [[Almora]], in mountainous north-central India (state of [[Uttarakhand]]). The ashram "began and has continued to be"&lt;ref name=jones06/&gt; aligned with strict orthodox [[Vaishnavism]]. In 1944, Yashoda Ma died and Krishna Prem succeeded her as head of the ashram.&lt;ref name=jones06/&gt; He travelled little, but in 1948 he visited South India, meeting [[Ramana Maharshi|Sri Ramana Maharshi]], as well as [[Aurobindo|Sri Aurobindo]] and [[Mirra Alfassa]] ("The Mother").&lt;ref name=jones06/&gt; 
Sardella states that Nixon appears to have been "the first European to embrace [[Vaishnavism]] in India".&lt;ref name=sardello13&gt;{{cite book |last=Sardella |first=Ferdinando |title=Modern Hindu personalism: the history, life, and thought of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199865901 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYSXPg9GUpwC&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ronald%20Nixon%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}} 
Haberman states that Nixon "was perhaps the first Westerner to tread the path of [[Krishnaism|Krishna-bhakti]], and was certainly the first to have any official affiliation with the [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] of [[Braj]]."&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;{{rp|223}}

Krishna Prem, despite his English origins, became widely accepted and admired in the Indian Hindu community.  Brooks wrote that "Krishna Prem's evident intellectual and inspirational qualities gained him wide fame and many disciples in India, as reflected in numerous books on his life and teachings."&lt;ref name=brooks89/&gt;{{rp|100}}
[[Gertrude Emerson Sen]] wrote that "I know of no other person like Krishnaprem, himself 'foreign' to begin with, who has drawn so many Indians to himself".&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;{{rp|220}}
His biographer [[Dilipkumar Roy|Dilip Kumar Roy]] wrote that Krishnaprem "had given a filip [stimulus] to my spiritual aspiration".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Haberman, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haberman wrote that Krishna Prem "was recognized as a Hindu saint by many Indians of his day."&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;{{rp|217}} When Nixon died in 1965, he was hailed by [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], then president of India, as a "great soul".&lt;ref name=haberman93&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haberman |first=David L. |title=A cross‐cultural adventure: The transformation of Ronald Nixon |journal=Religion |date=1 July 1993 |volume=23|issue=3|pages=217–227|doi=10.1006/reli.1993.1020 |publisher=Routledge |issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|221}}  Nixon's final words were "my ship is sailing".&lt;ref name=haberman93/&gt;{{rp|221}}

{{Expert-subject|Philosophy/Eastern|date=November 2008}}
'''''Li''''' （理, pinyin ''[[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|lǐ]]''）is a concept found in [[neo-Confucian]] [[Chinese philosophy]]. 
It refers to the underlying reason and order of nature as reflected in its organic forms.

It may be translated as "rational [[principle]]" or "law." It was central to [[Zhu Xi]]'s integration of [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. Zhu Xi held that ''li'', together with ''[[qi]]'' (氣: vital, material force), depend on each other to create structures of nature and matter. The sum of ''li'' is the ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]''.

This idea resembles the [[Buddhist]] notion of ''li'', which also means "principle." Zhu Xi maintained, however, that his notion is found in ''[[I Ching]]'' (''Book of Changes''), a classic source of [[Chinese philosophy]].
Zhu Xi's school came to be known as the School of ''Li'', which is comparable to [[rationalism]]. To an even greater extent than Confucius, Zhu Xi had a naturalistic world-view. His world-view contained two primary ideas: qi and li. Zhu Xi further believed that the conduct of the two of these took places according to Tai Ji.

Holding to Confucius and Mencius' conception of humanity as innately good, Zhu Xi articulated an understanding of ''li'' as the basic pattern of the universe, stating that it was understood that one couldn't live without ''li'' and live an exemplary life. In this sense, ''li'' according to Zhu Xi is often seen as similar to the [[Tao|Dao]] in [[Taoism|Daoism]] or to [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] and also to the [[Dharma]] in [[Hinduism]] . [[Wang Yangming]], a philosopher who opposed Zhu Xi's ideas, held that ''li'' was to be found not in the world but within oneself. Wang Yangming was thus more of an [[idealist]] with a different [[epistemic]] approach.

==Sources==
The philosophical concept of ''li'' is inherently difficult to define and is easily mistranslated into various simplifications of the core idea.
Many philosophers have tried to better explain it, [[Alan Watts]] being one of the prominent 20th century authors on the subject.
{{Quotation|

The ''tao'' is a certain kind of order, and this kind of order is not quite what we call order when we arrange everything geometrically in boxes, or in rows. That is a very crude kind of order, but when you look at a plant it is perfectly obvious that the plant has order. We recognize at once that it is not a mess, but it is not symmetrical and it is not geometrical looking. The plant looks like a Chinese drawing, because they appreciated this kind of non-symmetrical order so much that it became an integral aspect of their painting. In the Chinese language this is called ''li'', and the character for ''li'' means the markings in jade. It also means the grain in wood and the fiber in muscle. We could say, too, that clouds have ''li'', marble has ''li'', the human body has ''li''. We all recognize it, and the artist copies it whether he is a landscape painter, a portrait painter, an abstract painter, or a non-objective painter. They all are trying to express the essence of ''li''. The interesting thing is, that although we all know what it is, there is no way of defining it. Because ''tao'' is the course, we can also call ''li'' the watercourse, and the patterns of ''li'' are also the patterns of flowing water. We see those patterns of flow memorialized, as it were, as sculpture in the grain in wood, which is the flow of sap, in marble, in bones, in muscles. All these things are patterned according to the basic principles of flow. In the patterns of flowing water you will find all kind of motifs from Chinese art, immediately recognizable, including the S-curve in the circle of yang-yin{{sic}}.

So ''li'' means then the order of flow, the wonderful dancing pattern of liquid, because Lao-tzu likens ''tao'' to water:

The great ''tao'' flows everywhere, to the left and to the right, 
It loves and nourishes all things, but does not lord it over them.

His "astonishing philosophic power" served only to increase the "plausibility" of a dangerous infidelity. Comte was, once unmasked, a "blank, avowed, unblushing Atheist." [...] Some of the Reformed writers were careful enough to note that technically Comte was not an atheist since he never denied the existence of God, merely his comprehensibility. Practically, however, this made little difference. It only pointed to the skepticism and nescience&lt;!--correct--&gt; at the core of his positivism. The epistemological issues dominated the criticism of Comte. Quickly, his atheism was traced to his sensual psychology (or "sensualistic psychology", as Robert Dabney preferred to say)." Charles D.

None of us would seriously consider the possibility that all the gods of Homer really exist, and yet if you were to set to work to give a logical demonstration that Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, and the rest of them did not exist you would find it an awful job. You could not get such proof. Therefore, in regard to the Olympic gods, speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the Christian God, I should, I think, take exactly the same line."

'''''Maka hannya haramitsu''''' ({{CJKV|j=摩訶般若波羅蜜}}), the Japanese transliteration of '''''Mahāprajñāpāramitā''''' meaning '''''The Perfection of Great Wisdom''''', is the second book of the [[Shōbōgenzō]] by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. It is the second book in not only the original 60 and 75 fascicle versions of the text, but also the later 95 fascicle compilations. It was written in [[Kyoto]] in the summer of 1233, the first year that Dōgen began occupying the temple that what would soon become [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]].&lt;ref name=Gudo&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Nishijima|first1=Gudo|last2=Cross|first2=Chodo|authorlink1=Gudo Nishijima|year = 1994| title = Master Dogen's Shōbōgenzō| volume=1|pages=31–40|publisher = Dogen Sangha| isbn=1-4196-3820-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the title suggests, this chapter lays out Dōgen's interpretation of the [[Heart Sutra|''Mahaprajñāpāramitāhṛdaya Sūtra'']], or ''Heart Sutra'', so called because it is supposed to represent the heart of the 600 volumes of the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]''. The ''Heart Sutra'' focuses on the Buddhist concept of [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]], or wisdom, which indicates not conventional wisdom, but rather wisdom regarding the [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] of all [[phenomena]]. As Dōgen argues in this chapter, prajñā is identical to the practice of [[zazen]], not a way of thinking.&lt;ref name=Vow&gt;{{citation|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|author-link=Shohaku Okumura| title=Living By Vow: A Practical Introduction to Eight Essential Zen Chants and Texts| year=2012| publisher=Simon and Schuster| isbn=9781614290100| pages=134–135, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allusions to other works==
[[image:Tang 334 134 24.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Heart Sutra]], seen here in a 12th-century manuscript, is the subject of Dōgen's essay and is heavily referenced]]
Although Dōgen's writing usually references other Buddhist works with heavy frequency, ''Maka hannya haramitsu'' only references the Heart Sutra, the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra, and a poem about a [[wind chime|wind bell]] by his teacher, [[Tiantong Rujing]]. The poem is from ''Record of the Words of Master Rujing'' and is as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The whole body is like a mouth hanging in empty space.
Not questioning the winds from east, west, south, or north,
Equally all of them, speaking of prajñā:
Ding-dong-a-ling ding-dong.&lt;ref name=Vow/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
According to [[Shohaku Okumura]], the wind bell or hanging mouth represents ourselves while the winds represent all of the different circumstances that can face us. Regardless of what comes our way, we need not discriminate. When we view the world without discrimination, we express prajñā and see the reality of life. The last line is an [[onomatopoeia]] for the sound the bell makes, representing the expression of prajñā, wisdom of reality itself, as well as the [[Pratītyasamutpāda|interdependence]] of all things.&lt;ref name=Vow/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2541">'''Menyhért''' '''Palágyi''', in German '''Melchior''' or '''Meinhert Palagyi''' (16 December 1859 in [[Paks]], [[Hungary]] – 14 July 1924 in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], and [[physicist]] of [[Jewish]] descent (his original name was Silberstein). He was the elder brother of the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[poet]] Ludwig Palágyi.

Palágyi presented new theory of space and time (1901), which had a certain similarity with the space-time formalism of [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]] in the context of [[special relativity]] theory (e.g. Palagyi used the imaginary time coordinate ''it'' as the [[Spacetime|fourth dimension]] of "space-time"). However, his philosophy had little in common with the physics of relativity theory. Therefore, in  1914 he expressed his criticism of the theories of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]]. However, in a subsequent paper [[Max Born]] showed that Palagyi's criticism was misguided.

Palagyi's concept of vital fantasy makes him an ancestor of [[cybernetic]] [[anthropology]]. His theory of virtual movement forms the basis for different movement-therapeutic concepts. Palágyi also engaged in controversy with [[Edmund Husserl]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- See WP:FILMPLOT for more information. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. --&gt;
Dan Millman is a university student as well as a locally famous gymnast who dreams of winning a National Championship competition. He suffers from restlessness, and on one occasion, Dan attempts to compensate for the restlessness by running along streets before sunrise. At a car-service station, he encounters an old man who seems to know more about Dan's problem than Dan himself knows, whom Dan later nicknames "Socrates". Dan is unsettled by Socrates' knowledge; by the fact that Socrates had appeared in a nightmare as a faceless janitor, clad in mismatched shoes (by which he is identified in waking life), who sweeps up the pieces of Dan's shattered leg; and by the old man's extraordinary speed, agility, and coordination. As a result of his exposure to the last, Dan seeks to learn the secret behind it.

Socrates, prodded by the impatient and defiant Dan, gives the boy a series of tasks and lessons. The central concept of "Soc's" philosophy is this: that one must live entirely in the present moment. Other ideas include the related notion that at no time is "nothing going on" and the idea that an appropriate time exists for fighting and another for abstaining from violence. These lessons are conveyed through practical lessons, long contemplation, and one spectacular mystical experience. Dan gradually learns to appreciate every moment; to view the journey toward a goal as more meaningful and significant than the attainment; to pay attention to that which he is doing &amp;ndash; thus increasing his gymnastic prowess; and (to a slightly lesser extent) control himself. Throughout the lesson, Dan learns virtually nothing about his mentor, other than the philosophy, Socrates' belief that service is the most noble action possible (hence his choice to work as a car serviceman), and the presence of another [[protégé]].

This protégé, a woman of Dan's own age named Joy, has learned and integrated Socrates' philosophy into her life, to the extent that she seems as wise as Socrates himself. Dan attempts to ask her for information regarding Socrates, but receives little. Joy treats Dan indulgently, though she evidently respects him.

One day, Dan drives recklessly, and his motorcycle collides with a car that ran a red light, causing his right [[femur]] bone to shatter. He is rushed to a hospital, where a metal bar is placed in his leg to maintain its integrity. As a result, his gymnastic coach believes that Dan cannot compete in the National competition. Dan, hurt by this lack of faith, recovers from the injury and resumes his training under Socrates' tutelage. Eventually, he is restored to full health and strength, while his coordination improves and his mind is set entirely on the present moment. He competes in the U.S. Trials for the Olympics and achieves a victory.

Slightly before the competition, Dan diverts the bus he is riding to Socrates' station, only to find that Socrates has vanished without a trace. At the arena, he attempts to teach his teammate Tommy what he has learned, but fails due to Tommy's emotional insecurity and lack of comprehension. Dan then is called upon for his turn to perform on the [[Rings (gymnastics)|still rings]]. While he does his routine, Dan performs flawlessly just like Pommel Horse tryouts. Moments before he completes his routine, Socrates is in his thoughts asking him three questions: "Where are you, Dan?" "Here." "What time is it?" "Now." "What are You?" "This Moment." Dan then performs triple consecutive flips, with the commentators frantically speaking and the judges staring at him in amazement. He then dismounts, and the rings swing outwards, eventually touching each other. The screen goes black, leaving his last moment unknown.

The postscript states that Dan and his Berkeley Gymnastics Team won their first National title. It is implied at the end, in a postscript appearing on screen, that Dan of the film and Dan the author of the [[Way of the Peaceful Warrior|book]] on which the film is based are one and the same. It is also stated that the later Dan lives with his wife Joy.

&lt;!--NB—THE DATES ARE NON-AUTOFORMATTED--&gt;
'''Phan Đình Phùng''' ({{IPA-vi|faːn ɗîŋ̟ fûŋm|lang}}; 1847{{spaced ndash}}January 21, 1896) was a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] revolutionary who led rebel armies against [[French colonial empire|French colonial]] forces in Vietnam. He was the most prominent of the [[Confucian]] court scholars involved in anti-French military campaigns in the 19th century and was cited after his death by 20th-century nationalists as a [[Folk hero|national hero]]. He was renowned for his uncompromising will and principles—on one occasion,&lt;ref&gt;Marr, pp. 61&amp;ndash;62.&lt;/ref&gt; he refused to surrender even after the French had desecrated his ancestral [[tomb]]s and had arrested and threatened to kill his family.

Born into a family of [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]] from [[Hà Tĩnh Province]], Phan continued his ancestors' traditions by placing first in the metropolitan imperial examinations in 1877. Phan quickly rose through the ranks under Emperor [[Tự Đức]] of the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], gaining a reputation for his integrity and uncompromising stance against corruption. Phan was appointed as the Imperial Censor, a position that allowed him to criticise his fellow mandarins and even the emperor. As the head of the censorate, Phan's investigations led to the removal of many incompetent or corrupt mandarins.

Upon Tự Đức's death, Phan almost lost his life during a power struggle in the imperial court. The regent [[Tôn Thất Thuyết]] disregarded Tự Đức's will of succession, and three emperors were deposed and killed in just over a year. Phan protested against Thuyet's activities, was stripped of his honours and briefly jailed, before being exiled to his home province. At the time, France had just conquered Vietnam and made it a part of [[French Indochina]]. Along with Thuyet, Phan organised rebel armies as part of the [[Cần Vương movement]], which sought to expel the French and install the boy Emperor [[Hàm Nghi]] at the head of an independent Vietnam. This campaign continued for three years until 1888, when the French captured Hàm Nghi and exiled him to [[Algeria]].

Phan and his military assistant [[Cao Thắng]] continued their guerrilla campaign, building a network of spies, bases and small weapons factories. However, Cao Thắng was killed in the process in late 1893. The decade-long campaign eventually wore Phan down, and he died from dysentery as the French surrounded his forces.

==Court official==
Phan was born in the village of [[Đông Thái]] in the northern central coast province of [[Hà Tĩnh Province|Hà Tĩnh]]. Đông Thái was famous for producing high-ranking [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]] and had been the home of senior imperial officials since the time of the [[Lê Dynasty]]. Twelve consecutive generations of the Phan family had been successful mandarinate graduates.&lt;ref name="m61"/&gt; All three of Phan's brothers who lived to adulthood passed the imperial examinations and became mandarins.&lt;ref name="m61"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkin, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, Phan indicated his distaste for the classical curriculum required of an aspiring mandarin. He nevertheless persevered with his studies, passing the regional exams in 1876 and then topping the metropolitan exams the following year.&lt;ref name="m61"&gt;Marr, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In his exam response, Phan cited Japan as an example of how an Asian country could make rapid military progress given sufficient willpower.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkin, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phan was never known for his scholarly abilities; it was his reputation for principled integrity that led to his quick rise through the ranks under the reign of Emperor [[Tự Đức]].&lt;ref name="m61"/&gt; He was first appointed as a district mandarin in [[Ninh Bình Province]], where he punished a Vietnamese [[Roman Catholic]] priest, who, with the tacit support of French missionaries, had harassed local non-Catholics. Amid the diplomatic controversy that followed, he avoided blaming the unpopular alliance between Vietnamese Catholics and the French on Catholicism itself, stating that the partnership had arisen out of the military and political vulnerabilities of Vietnam's imperial government.&lt;ref name="m61"/&gt; Despite this, the [[Huế]] court eventually removed Phan from this post.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt;

Phan was transferred to the Huế court as a member of the censorate, a watchdog body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing that the vast majority of the court mandarins were making a mockery of a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt; Tự Đức later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the [[viceroy]] of the northern region.&lt;ref name="m62"&gt;Marr, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt; Phan openly criticised [[Tôn Thất Thuyết]], the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest.&lt;ref name="k"&gt;Karnow, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a historical geography of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.&lt;ref name="g24"&gt;Goscha, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his prominent position in the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], little is known about Phan's personal stance on Vietnamese relations with France, which was in the process of colonising Vietnam.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt; France had first invaded in 1858,&lt;ref name="mc43"&gt;McLeod, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; beginning the [[colonization of Cochinchina|colonisation of southern Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, pp. 44&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt; Three provinces were ceded under the 1862 [[Treaty of Saigon]],&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; and a further three in 1867 to form the colony of [[Cochinchina]].&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, there was debate in the Huế court on the best strategy to regain the territory. One group advocated military means, while another believed in the use of diplomacy in addition to financial and religious concessions.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, pp. 51&amp;ndash;53.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Tự Đức's death in 1883, the whole of Vietnam was colonised, henceforth incorporated with [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] into [[French Indochina]].&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his death in 1883, the childless Tự Đức had named his nephew, [[Kiến Phúc]], as his successor,&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt; rather than [[Dục Đức]], his most senior heir. Tự Đức had written in his will that Dục Đức was depraved and unworthy of ruling the country.&lt;ref name="c15"&gt;Chapuis, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, led by Thuyet, the regents enthroned Dục Đức under the pressure of the ladies of the court.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c15"/&gt; Phan protested against the violation of Tự Đức's will of succession and refused to sanction anyone other than Kien Phuc. Lucky to escape the death penalty, Phan was stripped of his positions.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt; Later, Dục Đức was deposed and executed by Thuyet on the grounds of ignoring court etiquette, ignoring the mourning rites for Tự Đức and having affairs with the late emperor's consorts.&lt;ref name="c15"/&gt; Phan again protested the regents' actions and was briefly imprisoned by Thuyet, before being exiled to his home province.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt;

==Revolutionary career==

=== Cần Vương ===
&lt;!--
[[File:Vua Ham Nghi.jpg|thumb|Emperor Hàm Nghi]] --&gt;
Phan rallied to the cause of the boy Emperor [[Hàm Nghi]]&amp;mdash;the fourth monarch in little over a year&amp;mdash;after an abortive royal uprising at Huế in 1885.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis, pp. 15&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Thuyet and fellow regent [[Nguyễn Văn Tường]] had enthroned [[Hiệp Hòa]] after disposing of Dục Đức. However, the new emperor was wary of the regents' behaviour and attempted to avoid their influence, leading Thuyet to organise his execution.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The teenage [[Kiến Phúc]] ascended the throne, but was poisoned by his adoptive mother [[Học phi Nguyễn Thị Hương|Học Phi]]&amp;mdash;one of Tự Đức's wives&amp;mdash;whom he caught having intercourse with Tuong.&lt;ref name="c17"&gt;Chapuis, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Kien Phuc was thus replaced by his 14-year-old brother Hàm Nghi. In the meantime, the French concluded that the regents were causing too much trouble and had to be disposed of.&lt;ref name="c17"/&gt;

Thuyet had already decided to place Hàm Nghi at the head of the ''[[Cần Vương movement|Phong Trào Cần Vuơng]]'' (''Loyalty to the Emperor Movement''), which sought to end French rule with a royalist rebellion. Phan helped the cause by setting up bases in [[Hà Tĩnh]] and creating his own guerrilla army.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt; Thuyet had hoped to secure support from the [[Qing Dynasty]] of China,&lt;ref name="c21"&gt;Chapuis, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; but Phan thought that Vietnam's best chance of effective support came from [[Siam]].&lt;ref name="g24"/&gt; [[Gia Long]], the founder of the Nguyễn Dynasty and great-grandfather of Tự Đức, had married his sister off to the King of Siam. He had also used Siam as a base-in-exile during his quest for the throne in the 1780s.&lt;ref name="g24"/&gt; However, direct appeals to the Siamese government only yielded a few pack trains of firearms and ammunition.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt; In preparation for the revolt, Thuyet had been building up an armed base at [[Tan So]] for over a year.&lt;ref name="c17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c20"&gt;Chapuis, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the Cần Vương revolt started on July 5, 1885 when Thuyet launched a surprise attack against the colonial forces after a diplomatic confrontation with the French.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="k99"&gt;Karnow, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="c19"&gt;Chapuis, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Thuyet took Hàm Nghi northwards to the Tan So mountain base near the border with Laos after the attack failed. The campaign was launched when the emperor issued the Can Vuong edict that had been prepared by the regent.&lt;ref name="c20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phan initially rallied support from his native village and set up his headquarters on Mount [[Vũ Quang]], which overlooked the coastal French fortress at Hà Tĩnh. Phan's organisation became a model for future insurgents. For flexibility, he divided his operational zone into twelve districts.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt; His forces upheld military discipline and wore uniforms.&lt;ref name="c93"&gt;Chapuis, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Phan initially used the local [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-gentry]] as his military commanders. Their first notable attack targeted two nearby Catholic villages that had collaborated with French forces. Colonial troops arrived a few hours later, quickly overwhelming the rebels and forcing them to retreat to their home village, where the retribution was heavy.&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt; Phan managed to escape but his elder brother was captured by the same former viceroy of northern Vietnam who had been removed from office as a result of Phan's critical report. The disgraced official was now a French collaborator, serving as the governor of [[Nghệ An Province]].&lt;ref name="m62"/&gt;

The strategy of attempting to pressure Phan into capitulating was a classical strategy of coercion. The French used an old friend and fellow villager to make an emotional and deeply Confucian appeal for Phan to surrender in order to save his brother, his ancestral tombs and his entire village. Phan was reported to have replied:&lt;ref name="m63"/&gt;

{{quote|From the time I joined with you in the Can Vuong movement, I determined to forget the question of family and village. Now I have but one tomb, a very large one, that must be defended: the land of Vietnam. I have only one brother, very important, that is in danger: more than twenty million countrymen. If I worry about my own tombs, who will worry about defending the tombs of the rest of the country? If I save my own brother, who will save all the other brothers of the country? There is only one way for me to die now.&lt;ref name="m63"&gt;Marr, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Phan was later reported to have simply retorted, "If anyone carves up my brother, remember to send me some of the soup".&lt;ref name="m63"/&gt; However, he held no illusions about the prospect of successfully driving out the French, stating "It is our destiny. We accept it."&lt;ref name="c93"/&gt;

This incident and Phan's response are often cited as one of the reasons why he was so admired by the populace and among future generations of Vietnamese anti-colonialists: he adhered to the highest personal standards of patriotism. He identified with a countrywide cause, far removed from the questions of family and region.&lt;ref name="m63"/&gt;

Phan's men were well-trained and disciplined, and the military inspiration behind his rebellion was derived from [[Cao Thang]], a bandit leader who had been protected from royal forces by Phan's brother a decade earlier.&lt;ref name="m61"/&gt; They operated in the provinces of [[Thanh Hóa Province|Thanh Hóa]] in the north, [[Hà Tĩnh Province|Hà Tĩnh]], [[Nghệ An Province|Nghệ An]] in the centre and [[Quảng Bình Province|Quảng Bình]] in the south, with their strongest areas being the two central provinces.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt; In 1887, Phan concluded that his tactics were misguided, ordering his subordinates to cease open combat and resort to guerrilla tactics. His men built up a network of [[base camp]]s, food caches, intelligence agents and peasant supply contacts. Phan traveled to the north in the hope of coordinating strategic and tactical plans with other leaders. In the meantime, Cao Thang led a force of around 1,000 men with some 500 firearms between them.&lt;ref name="c93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m63"/&gt; Cao Thang produced around 300 rifles by disassembling and copying 1874-model French weapons that had been captured.&lt;ref name="m63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="g25"&gt;Goscha, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of creating such replica guns, they captured Vietnamese artisans. According to French officers who later captured some of the Vietnamese copies, the weapons were proficiently reproduced. The only details in which they were regarded as being defective were in the tempering of the springs, which were improvised with [[umbrella]] spokes, and the lack of [[rifling]] in the barrels, which curtailed range and accuracy.&lt;ref name="m64"&gt;Marr, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the weaponry used by Phan's rebels was far inferior to that of their adversaries, and their inland positions were within firing range of the [[French Navy]].&lt;ref name="g24"/&gt; The Vietnamese could not rely on China to give them material support, and other European powers such as Portugal, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were unwilling to sell them weapons for various reasons. Thus, Phan had to explore overland routes to procure weapons from Siamese sources&amp;mdash;using seafaring transport was impossible due to the presence of the French Navy.&lt;ref name="g24"/&gt; He instructed his followers to create a secret route from Hà Tĩnh through Laos into northeastern Siam; one such route from Mount Vu Quang was believed to have been created around 1888.&lt;ref name="g25"/&gt; It is unclear if Phan himself went to Thailand,&lt;ref name="g25"/&gt; but a young female supporter named Co Tam was his designated arms buyer in [[Tha Uthen]], which boasted a substantial expatriate Vietnamese community.&lt;ref name="g25"/&gt; In 1890, the Siamese Army transported around 1,000 Austrian repeating-rifles from Bangkok to [[Luang Prabang]] in Laos. However, it is unclear whether the weapons found their way into Vietnamese hands or whether they were related to Co Tam's activities.&lt;ref name="g25"/&gt;

===After Cần Vương===
In 1888, Hàm Nghi's [[Muong people|Muong]] bodyguard [[Truong Quang Ngoc]] betrayed him,&lt;ref name="c92"&gt;Chapuis, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the emperor's capture and deportation to [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name="c21"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Phan and Cao Thang fought on in the mountainous areas of Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa. Another 15 bases were built along the mountain to complement the headquarters at Vu Quang. Each base had a subordinate commander leading units numbering between 100 and 500 men. The operations were funded by local villagers, who were levied with a land tax in silver and rice.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt;&lt;ref name="g25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m64"/&gt; Local bases were supported by nearby villages and excess funds were sent to Vu Quang. Phan's men foraged and sold [[cinnamon]] bark to raise funds, while lowland peasants donated spare metals for the production of weapons.&lt;ref name="g25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m64"/&gt;

When Phan returned from the north in 1889, his first order was to track down Hàm Nghi's betrayer Ngoc.&lt;ref name="m64"/&gt; When he was found, Phan personally executed Ngoc in [[Tuyên Hóa]].&lt;ref name="c93"/&gt; He then began a series of small-unit attacks on French installations through the summer of 1890, but these proved indecisive. The French relied mostly on district and provincial colonial units to man their perpetually increasing line of forts, which were usually commanded by a French lieutenant.&lt;ref name="m64"/&gt; In late 1890, a French effort to move into the low-lying villages and isolate the populace from the mountainous rebel bases failed. In the spring of 1892, a major French sweep of Hà Tĩnh failed, and in August, Cao Thang seized the initiative with a bold counterattack on the provincial capital. The rebels broke into the prison and freed their compatriots, killing a large number of the Vietnamese soldiers who defended the penitentiary as members of the French colonial forces. This caused the French to intensify their efforts against Phan, and a counteroffensive was conducted throughout the remainder of 1892, forcing the rebels to retreat back into the mountains. Two of their bases fell and steady French pressure began to break their covert resistance links with lowland villages. This compounded the problems of securing food, supplies, intelligence data and recruits. A ring of French forts continued to be erected, increasingly pinning down Phan's men.&lt;ref name="m65"/&gt; The only notable gain for Phan's forces during this period was the acquisition of gunpowder supplies from Siam.&lt;ref name="g25"/&gt; This enabled them to mix foreign and local powder in a 50:50 ratio, rather than their previous weaker mixture of 20:80.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, pp. 64&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the year, the burden on Phan increased after the loss of two Can Vuong allies. In September, [[Tong Duy Tân]]&amp;mdash;who led the royalists in Thanh Hóa&amp;mdash; was captured and publicly executed.&lt;ref name="c93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marr, pp. 60&amp;ndash;61.&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyen Thien Thuat, who had been active in the northern provinces of [[Hưng Yên]] and [[Hải Dương]], fled to [[Guangxi]] in China. The supporters of Tan and Tuat moved south and integrated into Phan's force.&lt;ref name="c93"/&gt;

In mid-1893, Cao Thang proposed a full-scale attack on the provincial seat of [[Nghệ An]] and the surrounding posts. The plan proposed to Phan included diversions to the south and the training of almost 2,000 men in conventional military tactics. Unconvinced of its viability, Phan reluctantly approved the plan.&lt;ref name="m65"/&gt; The troops were eager, but after overpowering several small posts ''en route'', the main force was pinned down while attacking the French fort of No on September 9, 1893. Along with his brother, Cao Thang was mortally wounded while leading a risky frontal attack with 150 men, and the forces retreated in disarray. Phan regarded the loss of Cao Thang as a significant one, admitting as much in delivering the eulogy and funeral oration.&lt;ref name="m65"&gt;Marr, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian David Marr, there was evidence that Phan clearly realised the advantages and limitations of prolonged resistance.&lt;ref name="m66"/&gt; Although Phan had previously stated that he was not expecting ultimate success,&lt;ref name="c93"/&gt; the guerrilla leader thought that it was important to keep pressuring the French in order to demonstrate to the populace that there was an alternative to what he felt was a defeatist attitude from the Huế court.&lt;ref name="m66"&gt;Marr, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall===
[[File:Hue linh luoc su Hoang Cao Khai.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hoang Cao Khai |alt=Aged man with cylindrical headdress, long flowing beard and moustache, a traditional Vietnamese tunic, darkly coloured with a light circular and Chinese character imprints, light coloured trousers, and dark shoes, sitting in a chair.]]
[[Hoàng Cao Khải]], the French-installed viceroy of [[Tonkin]], perceived Phan's intent to a degree that his French masters did not.&lt;ref name="m66"/&gt; Khai was from a scholar-gentry family from the same village as Phan.&lt;ref name= "h113"&gt;Hodgkin, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the main backer of a determined effort to crush Phan's forces, using every means available: political, psychological and economic.&lt;ref name="m66"/&gt; By late 1894, relatives and suspected sympathisers of the insurgents were intimidated and more resistance commanders had been killed. Communications were disrupted, and the rebel hideouts became increasingly insecure. In an attempt to force Phan to surrender, the French arrested his family and desecrated the tombs of his ancestors, publicly displaying the remains in Hà Tĩnh.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m66"/&gt;

Khai delivered a message to Phan via a relative. Phan sent a written reply, allowing their exchange to be studied. Khai recalled the common origins of the pair and promised Phan that he would lobby Governor-General [[Jean Marie Antoine de Lanessan]] and other French officials for an amnesty in return for Phan's surrender.&lt;ref name="l123"&gt;Lam, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Khai credited Phan with righteousness, loyalty and dedication towards the monarchy.&lt;ref name="m66"/&gt;

{{quote|The situation has changed and even those without intelligence or education have concluded that nothing remains to be saved. How is it that you, a man of vast understanding, do not realise this?... You are determined to do whatever you deem to be righteous... All that matters indeed is giving of one's life to one's country. No one therefore can deter you from your goal.&lt;ref name= "m66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hck"&gt;Lam, pp. 122&amp;ndash;124.&lt;/ref&gt;

I have always been taught that superior men should consider the care of the people as fundamental; who has ever heard of men who were loyal to their King but forgot the people's aspirations?... As of now, hundreds of families are subject to grief; how do you have the heart to fight on? I venture to predict that, should you pursue your struggle, not only will the population of our village be destroyed but our entire country will be transformed into a sea of blood and a mountain of bones.&lt;ref name="hck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m67"&gt;Marr, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

According to Marr, "Phan Dinh Phung's reply was a classic in savage understatement, utilizing standard formalism in the interest of propaganda, with deft denigration of his opponent".&lt;ref name="m67"/&gt; Phan appealed to Vietnamese nationalist sentiment, recalling his country's stubborn resistance to Chinese aggression. He cited defensive wars against the [[Han Dynasty|Han]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming dynasties]], asking why a country "a thousand times more powerful" could not annex Vietnam.&lt;ref name="l125"&gt;Lam, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Phan concluded that it was "because the destiny of our country has been willed by Heaven itself".&lt;ref name="m67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="l125"/&gt;

Phan placed the responsibility for the suffering of the people at the feet of the French, who "acted like a storm".&lt;ref name="m67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lpdp"&gt;Lam, pp. 126&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt; After analysing his own actions, Phan concluded with a thinly veiled attack on Khai and his collaborators.&lt;ref name="m67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lpdp"/&gt;

{{quote|If our region has suffered to such an extent, it was not only from the misfortunes of war. You must realise that wherever the French go, there flock around them groups of petty men who offer plans and tricks to gain the enemy's confidence. These persons create every kind of enmity; they incriminate innocent persons, blaming one one day, punishing another the next. They use every expedient to squeeze the people out of their possessions. That is how hundred of misdeeds, thousands of offenses have been perpetrated.&lt;ref name="m67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lpdp"/&gt;}}

Khai's appeal was rebutted with an appeal to history, nationalist sentiment and a demand that the blame for death and destruction lay with the colonial forces and their Vietnamese assistants. Phan raised the stakes above family and village to the entire nation and its populace.&lt;ref name="m68"&gt;Marr, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Phan's rebuke in his hands, Khai translated both documents into French and presented them to de Lanessan, proposing that it was time for the final "destruction of this scholar gentry rebellion".&lt;ref name="m68"/&gt; In July 1895, French area commanders called in 3,000 troops to tighten the cordon around the three remaining rebel bases.&lt;ref name="c93"/&gt; The insurgents were able to execute ambushes at night, but Phan contracted dysentery and had to be carried on a stretcher whenever his unit moved. A collaborator mandarin named [[Nguyen Than]], who had previous experience in pacification in [[Quảng Ngãi]] and [[Quảng Nam]], was drafted in to isolate the insurgents from their supporters in the villages. Cut off from their supplies, the insurgents were left to survive by eating roots and occasional handfuls of dried corn. Their shoes were worn through and most were without blankets.&lt;ref name="h113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m68"/&gt; Phan died of dysentery on January 21, 1896, and his captured followers were executed. A report submitted by the de Lanessan to the Minister of Colonies in Paris stated that "the soul of resistance to the protectorate was gone".&lt;ref name="m68"/&gt;

[[File:Statue of Phan Dinh Phung.JPG|150px|thumb|right|Statue of Phan Dinh Phung in [[District 5, Ho Chi Minh City]], Vietnam |alt=Side on view of a cement statue depicting a man with a moustache holding a rifle in one hand and a stick in another, wearing traditional clothes. He stands on a polished stone pedestal, and a city landscape and buildings can be seen in the background.]]
Phan's remains were disturbed after his death. [[Ngô Đình Khả]], a Catholic mandarin and father of [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]&amp;mdash;the first President of [[South Vietnam]]&amp;mdash;was a member of the French colonial administration. Kha had Phan's tomb exhumed and used the remains in gunpowder used for executing revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vu Ngu Chieu |date=February 1986 |title=The Other Side of the 1945 Vietnamese Revolution: The Empire of Viet-Nam |journal=[[Journal of Asian Studies]] |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=306 |doi=10.2307/2055845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phan is widely regarded by Vietnamese people as a revolutionary hero. [[Phan Bội Châu]], regarded as the leading Vietnamese anti-colonial figure of the early 20th century, strongly praised Phan in his writing, with particular emphasis on his defiance of Khai.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; During Phan Boi Chau's career as a teacher, he strongly emphasised Phan's deeds to his students.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, after returning to Vietnam after decades in exile, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Ho Chi Minh]], then using the name [[Nguyen Ai Quoc]] (''Nguyen the Patriot''), invoked the memory of Phan in appealing to the public for support for his independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Duiker, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Phan, Ho was a native of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh.&lt;ref&gt;Duiker, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, Ho's [[Vietminh]] named their self-produced style of grenades in honour of Phan.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Ho's communists have portrayed themselves as the modern day incarnations of revered nationalist leaders such as Phan, [[Trương Định]] and Emperors [[Lê Lợi]] and [[Quang Trung]], who expelled Chinese forces from Vietnam.&lt;ref name="os"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Milton E. |last=Osborne |year=1970 |title=Truong Vinh Ky and Phan Thanh Gian: The Problem of a Nationalist Interpretation of 19th Century Vietnamese History |journal=[[Journal of Asian Studies]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=85 |doi=10.2307/2942724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Both North and South Vietnam had prominent thoroughfares in their capital cities ([[Hanoi]] and [[Saigon]], respectively) named in Phan's honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Vietnam Country Map |publisher=Periplus Travel Maps |year=2002–2003 |isbn=0-7946-0070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Center for Inquiry==
''Point of Inquiry'' is the premiere [[podcast]] production of the [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI), a non-profit educational organization located in the United States. Its primary mission is to encourage evidence-based inquiry into [[paranormal]] and [[fringe science]] claims, [[alternative medicine]] and mental health practices, religion, [[secular ethics]], and society. CFI is dedicated to promoting and defending science, reason, and free inquiry in all aspects of human interest. CFI has also produced two related podcasts titled "The Human Bible" and "Center Stage," both of which have ended.

==Popular Science Idol==
Point of inquiry co-sponsored the "Popular Science Idol"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsfmessengers.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/do-you-have-what-it-takes-to-be-americas-next-science-idol/|title=Do You Have What It Takes to Be America’s Next Science Idol?|date= 10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; contest along with the National Science Foundation Office of Legislative and Public Affairs, Discover Magazine, and Popular Science as a science spoof of the popular reality show American Idol. The event was hosted as a workshop to discover the next great science communicator. The event was hosted by Chris Mooney and Indre Viskontas served as one of the expert judges. The first event was won by Tom Di Loberto for a 3-minute presentation on the difficulties involved in predicting the weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2013/02/19/30577/meteorologist-wins-first-ever-americas-science-ido/|title=Meteorologist wins first-ever America's Science Idol competition|date= 10 March 2013

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42751">There is evidence suggesting that different processes are involved in remembering something versus knowing whether it is familiar.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"&gt;Mickley, K.R., Kensinger, E.A. (2008). Emotional valence influences the neural correlates associated with remembering and knowing. ''Cognition, affective &amp; behavioural neuroscience, 8(2),'' 143-152.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that "remembering" and "knowing" represent relatively different characteristics of memory as well as reflect different ways of using memory.

To '''remember''' is the conscious ''recollection'' of many vivid contextual details, such as "when" and "how" the information was learned.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; Remembering utilizes [[episodic memory]] and requires a deeper level of processing (e.g. undivided attention) than knowing. Errors in recollection may be due to [[source-monitoring error]]s that prevent an individual from remembering where exactly a piece of information was received. On the other hand, source monitoring may be very effective in aiding the retrieval of episodic memories. Remembering is a knowledge-based and conceptually-driven form of processing that can be influenced by many things. It is relevant to note that under this view both kinds of judgments are characteristics of individuals and thus any distinctions between the two are correlational, not causal, events.

To '''know''' is a feeling (unconscious) of ''familiarity''. It is the sensation that the item has been seen before, but not being able to pin down the reason why.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; Knowing simply reflects the familiarity of an item without recollection.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; Knowing utilizes semantic memory that requires perceptually based, data-driven processing. Knowing is the result of shallow maintenance rehearsal that can be influenced by many of the same aspects as [[semantic memory]].

Remember and know responses are quite often differentiated by their functional correlates in specific areas in the brain. For instance, during "remember" situations it is found that there is greater [[EEG]] activity than "knowing", specifically, due to an interaction between frontal and posterior regions of the brain.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, Gregg, Karayianni"&gt;Gardiner, J.M., Gregg, V.H., Karayianni, I. (2006). Recognition memory and awareness: occurrence of perceptual effects in remembering or in knowing depends on concscious resources at encoding, but not at retrieval. ''Memory &amp; cognition, 34(2),'' 227-239.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found that the [[hippocampus]] is differently activated during recall of "remembered" (vs. familiar) stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Eldridge, L. L., Knowlton, B. J., Furmanski, C. S., Bookheimer, S. Y., &amp; Engel, S. A. (2000). Remembering episodes: A selective role for the hippocampus during retrieval. Nature Neuroscience, 3. 1149–1152.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, items that are only "known", or seem familiar, are associated with activity in the [[rhinal cortex]].&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt;

==Origins==
The remember-know paradigm began its journey in 1985 from the mind of [[Endel Tulving]]. He suggested that there are only two ways in which an individual can access their past. For instance, we can recall what we did last night by simply traveling back in time through memory and episodically imagining what we did (remember) or we can know something about our past such as a phone number, but have no specific memory of where the specific memory came from (know).&lt;ref name=Tulving1999&gt;Tulving, E. (1999). Memory, Consciousness, and the Brain: The Tallinn Conference. (pp. 66-68). Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Recollection is based on the episodic memory system, and familiarity is based on the semantic memory system. Tulving argued that the remember-know paradigm could be applied to all aspects of recollection.&lt;ref name=Tulving1999/&gt;

In 1988 the application of the paradigm was refined to a set of instructions that could elicit reliable judgments from subjects that can be found using many variables. The remember-know paradigm has changed the way in which researchers can study memory tasks and has had implications on what were originally considered purely "episodic" memories, which can now be thought of as a combination of both remembering and knowing or episodic and semantic.&lt;ref name=Tulving1999/&gt;

==Possible theories==
Remembering and knowing have been linked to dual-component theories, as well as unitary trace-strength/signal detection models.

===Tulving's theory===
Episodic and semantic memory give rise to two different states of consciousness, autonoetic and noetic, which influence two kinds of subjective experience, remembering and knowing, respectively.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, Gregg, Karayianni"/&gt; Autonoetic consciousness refers to the ability of recovering the episode in which an item originally occurred. In noetic consciousness, an item is familiar but the episode in which it was first encountered is absent and cannot be recollected. Remembering involves retrieval from episodic memory and knowing involves retrieval from semantic memory.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, Gregg, Karayianni"/&gt;

In his SPI model, Tulving stated that encoding into episodic and semantic memory is serial, storage is parallel, and retrieval is independent.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, Gregg, Karayianni"/&gt; By this model, events are first encoded in semantic memory before being encoded in episodic memory; thus, both systems may have an influence on the recognition of the event.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, Gregg, Karayianni" /&gt;

===High threshold model===
The original high-threshold model held that recognition is a probabilistic process.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;  It is assumed that there is some probability that previously studied items will exceed a memory threshold. If an item exceeds the threshold then it is in a discrete memory state. If an item does not exceed the threshold then it is not remembered, but it may still be endorsed as old on the basis of a random guess.&lt;ref name="Yonelinas Dobbins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yonelinas|first=Andrew |author2=Ian Dobbins |author3=Michael Szymanski |author4=Harpreet Dhaliwal |author5=Ling King|title=Signal-Detection, Threshold, and Dual-Process Nideks if Recognition Memory:ROCs and Conscious Recollection|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=1996|volume=5|issue=4 |pages=418–441|doi=10.1006/ccog.1996.0026}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, a test item is either recognized (i.e., it falls above a threshold) or it is not (i.e., it falls below a threshold), with no degrees of recognition occurring between these extremes.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;  Only target items can generate an above-threshold recognition response because only they appeared on the list.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;  The lures, along with any targets that are forgotten, fall below threshold, which means that they generate no memory signal whatsoever. For these items, the participant has the option of declaring them to be new (as a conservative participant might do) or guessing that some of them are old (as a more liberal participant might do).&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;  False alarms in this model reflect memory-free guesses that are made to some of the lures.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt; 
This simple and intuitively appealing model yields the once widely used correction for guessing formula, and it predicts a linear receiver operating characteristic (ROC). An ROC is simply a plot of the hit rate versus the false alarm rate for different levels of bias.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt; A typical ROC is obtained by asking participants to supply confidence ratings for their recognition memory decisions.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;  Several pairs of hit and false alarm rates can then be computed by accumulating ratings from different points on the confidence scale (beginning with the most confident responses). The high-threshold model of recognition memory predicts that a plot of the hit rate versus the false alarm rate (i.e., the ROC) will be linear it also predicts that the z-ROC will be curvilinear.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;

===Dual-process accounts===
The dual-process account states that recognition decisions are based on the processes of recollection and familiarity.&lt;ref name="Wixted"&gt;Wixted, J.T. (2007). Dual-Process Theory and Signal-Detection Theory of Recognition Memory. ''Psychological Review, 114(1),'' 152-176.&lt;/ref&gt; Recollection is a conscious, effortful process in which specific details of the context in which an item was encountered are retrieved.&lt;ref name="Wixted"/&gt; Familiarity is a relatively fast, automatic process in which one gets the feeling the item has been encountered before, but the context in which it was encountered is not retrieved.&lt;ref name="Wixted"/&gt; According to this view, remember responses reflect recollections of past experiences and know responses are associated with recognition on the basis of familiarity.&lt;ref name="Knott"/&gt;

===Signal-detection theory===
According to this theory, recognition decisions are based on the strength of a memory trace in reference to a certain decision threshold. A memory that exceeds this threshold is perceived as old, and trace that does not exceed the threshold is perceived as new. According to this theory, remember and know responses are products of different degrees of memory strength. There are two criteria on a decision axis; a point low on the axis is associated with a know decision, and a point high on the axis is associated with a remember decision.&lt;ref name="Wixted"/&gt; If memory strength is high, individuals make a "remember" response, and if memory strength is low, individuals make a "know" response.&lt;ref name="Wixted"/&gt;

Probably the strongest support for the use of signal detection theory in recognition memory came from the analysis of ROCs. An ROC is the function that relates the proportion of correct recognitions (hit rate) to the proportion of incorrect recognitions (false-alarm rate).&lt;ref name=Yonelinass&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yonelinas|first=Andrew|title=Receiver-operating characteristics in recognition memory: Evidence for a dual-process model|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1994|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1341–1354|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.6.1341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signal-detection theory assumed a preeminent position in the field of recognition memory in large part because its predictions about the shape of the ROC were almost always shown to be more accurate than the predictions of the intuitively plausible high-threshold model.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt; More specifically, the signal-detection model, which assumes that memory strength is a graded phenomenon (not a discrete, probabilistic phenomenon) predicts that the ROC will be curvilinear, and because every recognition memory ROC analyzed between 1958 and 1997 was curvilinear, the high-threshold model was abandoned in favor of signal-detection theory.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;  Although signal-detection theory predicts a curvilinear ROC when the hit rate is plotted against the false alarm rate, it predicts a linear ROC when the hit and false alarm rates are converted to z scores (yielding a z-ROC).&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;

“The predictive power of the signal detection modem seems to rely on know responses being related to transient feelings of familiarity without conscious recollection, rather than Tulving’s (1985) original definition of know awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bath|first=Debra|title=Remembering, Knowing and Schematisation: Theoretical and Practical Perspectives|journal=Remembering, Knowing and Schematisation:Theoretical and Practical Perspectives.|year=2004|volume=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual-process signal-detection/high-threshold theory===
The dual-process signal-detection/high-threshold theory tries to reconcile dual-process theory and signal-detection theory into one main theory. This theory states that recollection is governed by a threshold process, while familiarity is not.&lt;ref name="Wixted"/&gt; Recollection is a high-threshold process (i.e., recollection either occurs or does not occur), whereas familiarity is a continuous variable that is governed by an equal-variance detection model.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;  On a recognition test, item recognition is based on recollection if the target item has exceeded threshold, producing an "old" response.&lt;ref name="Wixted"/&gt; If the target item does not reach threshold, the individual must make an item recognition decision based on familiarity.&lt;ref name="Wixted"/&gt; According to this theory, an individual makes a "remember" response when recollection has occurred. A know response is made when recollection has not occurred, and the individual must decide whether they recognize the target item solely on familiarity.&lt;ref name="Wixted"/&gt;
Thus, in this model, the participant is thought to resort to familiarity as a backup process whenever recollection fails to occur.&lt;ref name=Wixted /&gt;

===Distinctiveness/fluency model===
In the past, it was suggested that remembering is associated with conceptual processing and knowing is associated with perceptual processing. However, recent studies have reported that there are some conceptual factors that influence knowing and some perceptual factors that influence remembering.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, Gregg, Karayianni"/&gt; Findings suggest that regardless of perceptual or conceptual factors, distinctiveness of processing at encoding is what affects remembering, and fluency of processing is what affects knowing.&lt;ref name= "Gardiner, Gregg, Karayianni"/&gt; Remembering is associated with distinctiveness because it is seen as an effortful, consciously controlled process.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, Gregg, Karayianni"/&gt; Knowing, on the other hand, depends on fluency as it is more automatic and reflexic and requires much less effort.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, Gregg, Karayianni"/&gt;

==Influences on remembering and knowing==
===Factors that influence remember responses but not know responses are===
====Frequency====
Items of low-frequency are generally better recognized and receive more remember responses than high-frequency items.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, T.D., &amp; Roediger, H.L. (1995). The experiential basis of serial position effects. ''European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 7(1),'' 65-80.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study, 96 words consisting of 48 low-frequency words and 48 high-frequency words were chosen by a psycholinguistic database.&lt;ref name="GardinerandJava"&gt;Gardiner, J.M. &amp; Java, R.I. (1990). Recollective experience in word and nonword recognition. ''Memory &amp; Cognition, 18(1),'' 23-30.&lt;/ref&gt; There were two alternate study lists, each consisting of 24 low-frequency words and 24 high-frequency words.&lt;ref name= "GardinerandJava"/&gt; Half of the subjects received one study list, while the other half of the participants received the other.&lt;ref name="GardinerandJava"/&gt; The recognition test, which involved all 96 words, required participants to first acknowledge whether the target item was old or new; if the item was considered old, participants were further asked to distinguish whether the item was remembered (they could recollect the context in which it had been studied) or known (the item seemed familiar but they couldn't recollect contextual details).&lt;ref name="GardinerandJava"/&gt; The results of this experiment were that low-frequency words received many more remember responses than high-frequency words.&lt;ref name= "GardinerandJava"/&gt; Since remember words are affected by distinctiveness, this makes sense; low-frequency words are experienced less than high-frequency words which makes them more distinctive. Also, there seemed to be no significant difference in the number of know responses made for low-frequency words and high-frequency words.

====Generation effects====
Items which are generated by a person receive more remember responses than items which are read, seen, or heard by a person. In addition, the generation of images to words enhances remember responses.&lt;ref name="Knott"&gt;Knott, L.M. &amp; Dewhurst, S.A. (2007). Divided attention at retrieval disrupts knowing but not remembering. ''Memory, 15(6),'' 664-674.&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, all participants were asked to study a list of 24 common pairs of opposites, 12 had to be generated and 12 were read.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;Gardiner, J.M. (1988). Functional aspects of recollective experience. ''Memory &amp; Cognition, 16(4),'' 309-313.&lt;/ref&gt; The generated pairs required participants to generate them in the context of a given rule.&lt;ref name= "Gardiner"/&gt; The recognition test consisted of 48 words, 24 targets and 24 distractors.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"/&gt; Participants were asked if items were old or new; if participants replied "old", they were then asked whether they remembered (could recollect contextual details of when it was studied) the pair or if they knew (recognized it but recollection was absent) the pair.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"/&gt; Generation effects were seen in remember responses; items which were generated received more remember responses than read items.&lt;ref name= "Gardiner"/&gt; However, generation effects were not seen in know responses.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"/&gt;

====Divided attention====
Remember responses depend on the amount of attention available during learning. Divided attention at learning has a negative impact on remember responses.&lt;ref name= "GardinerandParkin"&gt;Gardiner, J.M., &amp; Parkin, A.J. (1990). Attention and recollective experience in recognition memory. ''Memory &amp; Cognition, 18(6),'' 579-583.&lt;/ref&gt; A study was done which consisted of 72 target words which were divided into two study lists.&lt;ref name="GardinerandParkin"/&gt; Half of the participants were required to study the list in an undivided attention condition and half of the subjects studied the list in a divided attention condition.&lt;ref name="GardinerandParkin"/&gt; In the divided attention condition, subjects had to study the list while listening to and reporting high, low, or medium tone sequences.&lt;ref name="GardinerandParkin"/&gt; The recognition test consisted of participants deciding whether items were old or new; if items were deemed old, participants were then required to say whether items were remembered or known.&lt;ref name="GardinerandParkin"/&gt; It was found that the divided attention condition impaired the level of correct remember responses; however, the know responses seemed unaffected.&lt;ref name="GardinerandParkin"/&gt;

====Depth of processing====
When more detailed, elaborate encoding and associations are made, more remember responses are reported than know responses.&lt;ref name="Mantyla"&gt;Mantyla, T. (1993). Knowing but not remembering: Adult age differences in recollective experience. ''Memory &amp; Cognition, 21(3),'' 379.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite occurs with shallow, surface encoding which results in fewer remember responses.&lt;ref name="Mantyla"/&gt;

====Serial position====
The primacy effect is related to enhanced remembering. In a study, a free recall test was conducted on some lists of words and no test on other lists of words prior to a recognition test. They found that testing led to positive recency effects for remembered items; on the other hand, with no prior test, negative recency effects occurred for remembered items. Thus, both primary and recency effects can be seen in remember responses.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

===Factors that influence know responses but not remember responses are===
====Masked recognition priming====
Masked recognition priming is a manipulation which is known to increase perceptual fluency. Since know responses increase with increased fluency of processing, masked recognition priming enhances know responses.&lt;ref name="RajaramandGeraci"&gt;Rajaram, S. &amp; Geraci, L. (2000). Conceptual fluency selectively influences knowing. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 26(4),'' 1070-1074.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Repetition priming====
Briefly presenting a prime prior to test causes an increase in fluency of processing and an associated increase in feeling of familiarity. Short duration primes tend to enhance know responses. In contrast to briefly presented primes, primes which are presented for long durations are said to disrupt processing fluency as the prime saturates the representation of the target word.&lt;ref name="Huberetal"&gt;Huber, D.E., Clark, T.F., Curran, T., Winkielman, P. (2008). Effects of repetition priming on recognition memory: testing a perceptual fluency-disfluency model. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 34(6),'' 1305-1324.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, longer duration primes tend to have a negative impact on know responses.

====Stimulus modality====
Know responses are enhanced when stimuli modality match during study and test;&lt;ref name="RajaramandGeraci"/&gt; therefore, shifting the modality of a stimulus has been found to negatively impact know responses.&lt;ref name="Knott"/&gt;

===Factors that influence both remember and know responses are===
====Perceptual fluency tests====
Knowing is influenced by the fluency in which an item is processed, regardless of whether information is conceptual or perceptual.&lt;ref name="RajaramandGeraci"/&gt; Know responses are enhanced by manipulations which increase perceptual and conceptual fluency. For example, masked repetition priming, modality match during study and test, and the use of easy word-fragments in word-fragment recall are all perceptual manipulations which increase know responses.&lt;ref name="RajaramandGeraci"/&gt; An example of a conceptual manipulation which enhances know responses is when a prime item is semantically related to a target item.&lt;ref name="RajaramandGeraci"/&gt; Manipulations which increase processing fluency do not seem to affect remember responses.&lt;ref name="RajaramandGeraci"/&gt;

====Aging====
Normal aging tends to disrupt remember responses to a greater extent than know responses. This decrease in remember responses is associated with poor encoding and [[frontal lobe]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Yonelinas"&gt;Yonelinas, A.P. (2002). The Nature of Recollection and Familiarity: A Review of 30 Years of Research. ''Journal of Memory and Language, 46(3),'' 441-517.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that older individuals fail to use [[elaborative encoding]] in comparison to younger individuals.&lt;ref name="Yonelinas"/&gt; In addition to poor encoding, older individuals tend to have problems with retrieving information that is highly specific because they are less effective at controlling their retrieval processes.&lt;ref name="Luo"&gt;Luo, L. &amp; Craik, F.I.M. (2009). Age differences in recollection: specificity effects at retrieval. ''Journal of Memory and Language, 60,'' 421-436.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult for older individuals to constrain retrieval processes to the context of the specific item that is to be retrieved.&lt;ref name="Luo"/&gt;

====Word vs. non-word memory====
When words are used as stimuli, more remember responses and fewer know responses are produced in comparison to when nonwords are used as stimuli.&lt;ref name="Knott"/&gt;

====Gradual vs. rapid presentation====
Gradual presentation of stimuli causes an increase in familiarity and thus an increase in associated know responses; however, gradual presentation causes a decrease in remember responses.&lt;ref name="LeCompte"&gt;LeCompte, D.C. (1995). Recollective experience in the revelation effect: Separating the contributions of recollection and familiarity. ''Memory &amp; Cognition, 23(3),'' 324-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of emotion===
The [[amygdala]] plays an important role during encoding and retrieval of emotional information. It has been found that although negative and positive items are remembered or known to the same extent, the processes involved in remembering and knowing differs with emotional valence.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt;

====Remembering====
Activity in the orbitofrontal and ventrolateral [[prefrontal cortex]] are associated with remembering for both positive and negative items.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; When it comes to remembering, it has been suggested that negative items may be remembered with more detail in comparison to positive or neutral items; support for this has been found in the temporo-occipital regions, which showed activity specific to negative items that were "remembered".&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; A study found that in addition to being remembered in more detail, negative items also tended to be remembered for longer durations than positive items.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt;

====Knowing====
Activity in the mid-cingulate gyrus, the inferior [[parietal lobe]], and the superior [[frontal lobe]] are all associated with knowing for both positive and negative items.&lt;ref name= "MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; These regions are said to be involved in the retrieval of both semantic and episodic information.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; It has been suggested that the encoding of items which people forget details for or items which are forgotten as a whole are associated with these regions.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; This forgetting has to do with retrieval-related processes being active at the same time as encoding-related processes.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; Thus, the process of retrieval may come at the expense of encoding vivid details of the item.

In addition, disproportionate activity along the [[cingulate gyrus]], within the [[parietal lobe]], and in the [[prefrontal cortex]] is associated with the encoding of "known" positive items.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; This increased activity may cause the trade-off between retrieval-related processes and encoding-related processes to occur more significantly for positive items.&lt;ref name="MickleyandKensinger"/&gt; This supports the idea that when people are in a positive mood, they have a more holistic, general thought process and disregard details.

===Role of context===
The functional account of remembering states that remember responses are determined by the context in which they're made; in general, [[recollection]] is based on the type of info that was encouraged by the deeper level processing task.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"&gt;McCabe, D.P., Balota, D.A. (2007). Context effects on remembering and knowing: the expectancy heuristic. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 33(3),'' 536-549.&lt;/ref&gt; Remember responses occur when retrieved information allow subjects to finish a memory test. The same item may elicit a remember response or a know response, depending on the context in which it is found.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"/&gt;

In the expectancy heuristic, items that reach beyond a level of distinctiveness (the likelihood an item would later be recognized in a recognition test) elicit a remember response.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"/&gt; Items that do not reach this level of distinctiveness elicit a know response.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"/&gt; The level of distinctiveness is determined by the context in which items are studied and/or tested.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"/&gt; In a given context, there is an expected level of distinctiveness; in contexts where subjects expect many distinct items, participants give fewer remember responses than when they expect few distinct items.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"/&gt; Therefore, remember responses are affected by the expected strength of distinctiveness of items in a given context.

In addition, context can affect remember and know responses while not affecting recollection and familiarity processes.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"/&gt; Remember and know responses are subjective decisions that can be affected by underlying memory processes. While changing recollection and familiarity processes can influence remember and know judgments, context can affect how items are weighted for remember-know decisions.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"/&gt;

According to the distinctiveness-fluency model, items are seen as distinct when they exceed a level of memorability and items are seen as fluent when they do not reach this level but give a feeling of familiarity.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"/&gt; Distinct items are usually unusual in comparison to the context in which they're found.&lt;ref name="McCabeandBalota"/&gt;  Therefore, distinct items generally elicit a remember response, and fluent items elicit a know response.

==Testing methods and models==
===Judgments and retrieval of contexual details===
In this study, the presence of source memory was utilized to estimate the extent to which episodic details were recalled; feelings of familiarity were accompanied by retrieval of partial contextual details, which are considered sufficient for an accurate source decision but not for a recollection response.&lt;ref name="DudukovicandKnowlton"&gt;Dudukovic, N.M., Knowlton, B.J. (2005). Remember-Know Judgments and Retrieval of Contextual Details. ''Acta Psychologica, 122(2),'' 160-173&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects that remembered the stimuli were able to differentiate the corresponding source correctly. The findings were consistent with the idea that "remember" responses, unlike "know" responses, are accompanied by memory for episodic detail, and that the loss of memory for episodic detail over time parallels the conversion of "remember" responses to "know" responses.&lt;ref name="DudukovicandKnowlton"/&gt;

===Yes/no recognition models===
In the preceding task, participants are given a list of items to study in the primary learning phase. Subsequently, during the recognition stage, participants are asked to make a decision about whether presented test items existed in the previously studied list.&lt;ref name="GardinerandParkin"/&gt; If the participant responds "yes", they are asked why they recognized the specified item. From this, a conclusion was obtained based on whether the item was remembered or simply known.&lt;ref name="GardinerandParkin"/&gt;

===Eye movement method===
Primarily, experimenters recorded eye movements while participants studied a series of photos. Individuals were then involved in a recognition task in which their eye movements were recorded for the second time. From the previous tasks, it was discovered that eye fixations, maintaining a visual gaze on a single location, were more clustered for remembering rather than knowing tasks. This suggests that remembering is associated with encoding a specific salient component of an item whereas recognition is activated by an augmented memory for this part of the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Sharotetal."&gt;Sharot, T., Davidson, M.L., Carson, M.M., Phelps, E.A. (2008). Eye movements predict recollective experience. ''PLoS ONE, 3(8),'' e2884.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision processes in a remember and know model===
In the above experiment, participants were presented with a list of 100 familiar words and were asked to read them aloud while simultaneously trying to remember each one. Subsequent to this, participants were asked to make a recognition decision based on the number of "yes" responses that were accompanied by some recollective experience.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;Donaldson, W. (1996). The Role of Decision Processes in Remembering and Knowing. ''Memory and Cognition, 24,'' 523-533&lt;/ref&gt; The results demonstrate the differing relationships between the "yes" and "no" conditions and "remember" and "know" memory performance. The outcome confirms that although familiarity and recollection may involve different processes, the remember/know exemplar does not probe them directly.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

===Remember-know models as decision strategies in two experimental paradigms===
In the previous study, two different remember-know paradigms are explored. The first is the "remember-first method"&lt;ref name="RotelloandMacmillan"&gt;Rotello, C.M., Macmillan, N.A. (2006). Remember-Know Models as Decision Strategies in Two Experimental Paradigms. ''Journal of Memory and Language, 55(4),'' 479-494.&lt;/ref&gt; in which a remember response is solicited prior to a know response for non-remembered items. Secondly, a trinary paradigm,&lt;ref name="RotelloandMacmillan"/&gt; in which a single response judges the "remember vs. know" and "new" alternatives is investigated. Participants are asked to subjectively decide whether their response within these studies is attributed to a recollection of specific details, "remembering", or familiarity "knowing". In the presently discussed experiment, "remember" and "know" responses generally depend on a single strength variable.

===Multinomial memory model===
Remembering (recollection) accesses memory for separate contextual details (e.g. screen location and font size); i.e. involves retrieval of a particular context configuration.&lt;ref name="MeiserandBröder"&gt;Meiser, T., &amp; Bröder, A. (2002). Memory for multidimensional source information. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 28,'' 116-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal detection model===
This model uses the idea that remembering and knowing each represent different levels of confidence. In this sense remember/know judgments are viewed as quantitatively different judgments that vary along the same continuum. Subjects place their "know" and "remember" judgments on a continuum of strength.&lt;ref name="Zelazo"&gt;Zelazo, P. D., Moscovitch, M., &amp; Evan, T. (2007). The Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When people are very confident about recognizing an item, they assign it a "remember" response, and when they are less confident about a response it is labelled as a "know" response. A potential problem with this model is that it lacks explanatory power; it may be difficult to determine where the criteria should be placed on the continuum.&lt;ref name="Zelazo"/&gt;

==Role in understanding psychological disorders==
The remember-know paradigm has had great usage in clinical studies. Using this paradigm, researchers can look into the mechanisms of neuro-biological functions as well as social aspects of disorders and illnesses that plague humans. Recognition memory has been linked to advancements in the understanding of [[schizophrenia]], [[epilepsy]] and even explaining simple [[autobiographical memory]] loss as we grow older.

===Epilepsy===
The remember-know paradigm has been used to settle the debate over whether the hippocampus plays a critical role in familiarity of objects. Studies done with patients suffering from epilepsy suggest that the hippocampus plays a critical role in the familiarity of objects.&lt;ref name=Bengner&gt;Bengner, T., &amp; Malina, T. (2008). Remembering versus knowing during face recognition in unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy patients with or without hippocampal sclerosis. ''Brain and Cognition, 68(2),'' 148-156.&lt;/ref&gt; A study was conducted using the remember-know distinction to understand this idea of familiarity and whether it is in fact the hippocampus that plays this critical role.&lt;ref name=Bengner /&gt; This study found that the hippocampus is essentially a system based on familiarity. The hippocampus actually suppresses any sort of arousal response that would normally occur if the stimuli were novel. It is almost as though familiarity is a qualitative characteristic just as is colour or loudness.&lt;ref name=Bengner/&gt;

The remember-know paradigm with epilepsy patients to distinguish whether a stimulus (picture of a face) was familiar.&lt;ref name=Bengner/&gt; Patients that were found to have right temporal lobe epilepsy showed relatively lower face recognition response than those with left temporal lobe epilepsy due to damage of secondary sensory regions (including fusiform gyrus) in the brain's right hemisphere, which is responsible for perception and encoding (esp. face memory).&lt;ref name=Bengner/&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
A remember-know paradigm was used to test whether patients with [[schizophrenia]] would exhibit abnormalities in conscious recollection due to a deterioration of frontal memory processes that are involved in encoding/retrieval of memories as well as executive functions linked to reality monitoring and decision making.&lt;ref name=Drakeford2006&gt;Drakeford, J. L., Edelstyn, N. M., Oyebode, F., Srivastava, S., Calthorpe, W. R., &amp; Mukherjee, T. (2006). Auditory recognition memory, conscious recollection, and executive function in patients with schizophrenia. ''Psychopathology, 39(4),'' 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the "remember-know" paradigm, participants first identify stimuli that they previously studied. If an item is identified as a known stimulus, the participants are asked to distinguish whether they can remember aspects of the original presentation of the identified item (remember response) or whether they know that the item was on the study list, but have no episodic memory of specifically learning it.&lt;ref name=Drakeford2006/&gt;

Results showed that patients with schizophrenia exhibit a deficit in conscious recollection for auditory stimuli.&lt;ref name=Drakeford2006/&gt; These findings, when considered together with remember/know data collected from the same set of patients for olfactory and visual recognition memory,&lt;ref name=Drakeford2003&gt;Drakeford J, Edelstyn NM, Oyebode F, Srivastava S, Mukherjee T: Contextual recollection and olfactory recognition memory in schizophrenia. Royal College of Psychiatrists Annual General Meeting, Edinburgh 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Edelstyn&gt;Edelstyn N.M., Drakeford J., Oyebode F., Findlay C.D. (2003). An investigation of conscious recollection, false recognition and delusional misidentify cation in patients with schizophrenia. ''Psychopathology, 36,'' 312–319.&lt;/ref&gt; support proposals that the abnormalities in conscious recollection stem from a breakdown in central processes rather than domain-specific processes.&lt;ref name=Drakeford2006/&gt; This study depended greatly on the remember-know paradigm to test for conscious recollection differences in these patients.

===Autobiographical memory loss===
The remember-know paradigm has been used in studies that focus on the idea of a [[reminiscence bump]] and the age effects on [[autobiographical memory]]. Previous studies suggested old people had more "know" than "remember" and it was also found that younger individuals often excelled in the "remember" category but lacked in the "know".&lt;ref name=Rybash&gt;Rybash, J. (1999). Aging and the Autobiographical Memory: The Long and Bumpy Road. ''Journal of Adult Development,'' 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific study used the remember-know paradigm while asking elderly people about their episodic memories from their university graduation. They were asked to determine whether their self reported memories were "remembered" or "known". It was hypothesized that reminiscence component of elderly adults' autobiographical recall would be strong for "remember" responses, but less so for "know" responses.&lt;ref name=Rybash/&gt; It was also expected that recent memories would hold the opposite effect, that those individuals would be better at "know" responses than with "remember" responses.&lt;ref name=Rybash/&gt;

Results showed that there was good retention after reminiscence bump and equal "remember" to "know" responses were reported.&lt;ref name=Rybash/&gt; It was concluded that autobiographical memories were tied to both episodic and semantic memories. These results are important to demonstrate that aging is not accompanied by a decline in episodic memory due to a reliance on semantic memory as previously thought.&lt;ref name=Rybash/&gt; The remember-know distinction was integral in achieving these results as well as understanding the ways in which autobiographical memory works and the prevalence of the reminiscence bump. The findings of Rybash are supported by other research.&lt;ref name=Janssen&gt;Janssen, S. M. J., Rubin, D. C., &amp; St. Jacques, P. L. (2011). The temporal distribution of autobiographical memory: Changes in reliving and vividness over the life span do not explain the reminiscence bump. ''Memory &amp; Cognition, 39,'' 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related phenomena==
===Tip-of-the-tongue===
The [[tip-of-the-tongue]] state is the phenomenon that occurs when people fail to recall information but still feel as if they are close to retrieving it from memory. In this sense an individual feels as if they "know" but cannot "remember" the actual information desired. It is a frustrating but common problem that typically occurs for individuals about once a week, is frequent among nouns and is typically resolved on its own.&lt;ref name=Rastle&gt;Rastle, K. (1996). Priming the tip of the tongue: effects of prior processing on word retrieval in young and older adults. ''Journal of Memory and Language, 35(4),'' 585.&lt;/ref&gt; The occurrence of the tip-of-the-tongue state increases with age throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name=Shafto&gt;Shafto, M. A., Burke, D. M., Stamatakis, E. A., Tam, P. P., &amp; Tyler, L. K. (2007). On the tip-of-the-tongue: neural correlates of increased word-finding failures in normal aging. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,'' 2060-2070.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a feeling is indication that remembering will occur or is about to occur.

===Knew-it-all-along effect===
The knew-it-all-along effect is a variant of the hindsight bias. It is the tendency for people to misremember and think that they knew more in the past than they actually did.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;Arnold, M. (2007). "I remember/know/guess that I knew it all along!": subjective experience versus objective measures of the knew-it-all-along effect. ''Memory Cognition, 35(8),'' 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; In such situations it is difficult for us to remember what it was like when we did not have an understanding of something. For example, one might have a hard time teaching a concept to another individual because they can not remember what it is like to not understand the material.

===Hindsight bias===
[[Hindsight bias]] is the phenomenon where people tend to view events as more predictable than they really are. This occurs because one's current knowledge influences the recollection of previous beliefs.&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;Bernstein, D. (2007). Hindsight bias and developing theories of mind. ''Child Development, 78(4),'' 1374.&lt;/ref&gt; In this phenomenon, what someone "knows" is affecting what they "remember". This inaccurate assessment of reality after it has occurred is also referred to as "creeping determinism". The hindsight bias has been found among a number of domains such as historical events, political elections and the outcome of sporting events.&lt;ref name=Nestler&gt;Nestler, S., Blank, H., &amp; Von Collani, G. (2008). Hindsight bias does not always come easy: casual models, cognitive effort and creeping determinism. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition,'' 1043-1054.&lt;/ref&gt; The hindsight bias is a common phenomenon that occurs regularly among individuals in everyday life and can be generated in a laboratory setting to help increase the understanding of memory and specifically memory distortions.

{{Confucianism|Fundamental}}
{{Love sidebar|cultural}}
'''''Ren''''' ({{zh|c=仁}}) is the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] virtue denoting the good feeling a virtuous human experiences when being [[altruistic]]. ''Ren'' is exemplified by a normal adult's protective feelings for children.  It is considered the outward expression of Confucian ideals.

[[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]], one of the [[Four Sages]], once asked his master to describe the rules of ''ren''. Confucius replied, "One should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing improper, do nothing improper."&lt;ref&gt;Analects 12:1&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius also defined ''ren'' in the following way: "wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others."&lt;ref&gt;Analects 6:30 http://ctext.org/analects/yong-ye/zh?en=on&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius also said, "''Ren'' is not far off; he who seeks it has already found it." ''Ren'' is close to man and never leaves him.&lt;ref&gt;(Do-Dinh 107)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation of the Chinese character ==
The single [[Hanzi|logogram]] for ''ren'' is a composite of two distinct common [[hanzi]], 人 (Man, a man, a person ) and 二 (two), with 人 assuming its common form inside another character, to which various interpretations have been assigned. One often hears that ''ren'' means "how two people should treat one another". While such folk etymologies are common in discussions of Chinese characters, they often are as misleading as they are entertaining. In the case of ''ren'' - usually translated as "benevolence" or "humaneness" - Humaneness is Human-ness, the essence of being human. For Confucius the interaction of completely dependent infant and caring parent is the most emotionally charged human interaction, “To love a thing means wanting it to live…”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Analects]] XII.10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tao|Way]] of humaneness is human interaction and through shared experience knowing one’s family. “Fan Chi asked about humaneness. The Master said it is loving people. Fan Chi asked about wisdom. The Master said it is knowing people”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Analects]] XII.22&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, human love and interaction is the source of humaneness, the source of the human self. Another common interpretation of the graphical elements is Man or a man connecting [[Tian|Heaven]] and [[Tianxia|Earth]].

人+二=仁 (Rén) man on left two on right, the relationship between two human beings, means humanity, benevolence, seed. Originally the character was just written as丨二 representing [[Yin and yang|yin yang]], the vertical line is yang (male, penis, heaven, odd numbers), the two horizontal lines are yin (female, vagina, earth, even numbers), 仁 is the seed and core of everything. The character 人 (man, rén) and 仁 have the same pronunciation. When a human is unable to be humane, he or she does not qualify to be a human but an animal. But when a human is able to be humane, he or she qualifies to be a human. For example, when Buddhism was first introduced to China in the Han Dynasty the Chinese people translated the Buddha's name into "able to be human" or someone with ”ability and humanity" (能人，能仁) because Confucius's teachings and Buddha's teachings are "one to two, two to one."

Pre-imperial epigraphic sources testify to alternative writings of the same character: 忎 (given as a variant of 仁 in the [[Shuowen]] dictionary), 身 with 心 below, and the latter compound with 人 on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Behr, Wolfgang. "In the Interstices of Representation: Ludic Writing and the Locus of Polysemy in the Chinese Sign".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of ''li'', ''ren'', and ''yi''==
The principle of ''ren'' is related to the concepts of [[Li (Confucian)|''li'']] and [[Yi (Confucianism)|''yi'']].  ''Li'' is often translated as "[[ritual]]" while ''yi'' is often translated as "[[righteousness]]".  These three interrelated terms deal with agency as Confucians conceive it.  ''Li'' is the action which has been deemed appropriate by society, ''yi'' is the action that is indeed correct, while ''ren'' deals with the relationship between the agent and object of the action.  Often ''li'' and ''yi'' are the same; however, that is not always the case.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}

''Li'' is the outward expression of Confucian ideals, while ''ren'' is both the inward and outward expressions of those same ideals. According to Hopfe and Woodward: "Basically, ''li'' seems to mean 'the course of life as it is intended to go'. ''Li'' also has religious and social connotations. When a society lives by ''li'', it moves smoothly: men and women respect their elders and superiors; the proper rituals and ceremonies are performed; everything and everyone is in its proper place."&lt;ref&gt;(Hopfe 180-181)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of ''ren'' ==
''Ren'' relies heavily on the relationships between two people, but at the same time encompasses much more than that. It represents an inner development towards an altruistic goal, while simultaneously realizing that one is never alone, and that everyone has these relationships to fall back on, being a member of a family, the state, and the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Chi-Yun 34)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ren'' is not a concept that is learned; it is innate, that is to say, everyone is born with the sense of ''ren''. Confucius believed that the key to long-lasting integrity was to constantly think, since the world is continually changing at a rapid pace.

There have been a variety of definitions for the term ''ren''. ''Ren'' has been translated as "benevolence", "perfect virtue", "goodness" or even "human-heartedness".&lt;ref&gt;(Hopfe 181)&lt;/ref&gt; When asked, Confucius defined it by the ordinary Chinese word for love, ''ai'', saying that it meant to "love others".&lt;ref&gt;(Dubs 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ren'' also has a political dimension. Confucianism says that if the ruler lacks ''ren'', it will be difficult for his subjects to behave humanely. ''Ren'' is the basis of Confucian political theory; the ruler is exhorted to refrain from acting inhumanely towards his subjects. An inhumane ruler runs the risk of losing the [[Mandate of Heaven]] or, in other words, the right to rule. A ruler lacking such a mandate need not be obeyed, but a ruler who reigns humanely and takes care of the people is to be obeyed, for the benevolence of his dominion shows that he has been mandated by heaven. Confucius himself had little to say on the active will of the people, though he believed the ruler should definitely pay attention to the wants and needs of the people and take good care of them. Mencius, however, did state that the people's opinion on certain weighty matters should be polled.

''Ren'' also includes traits that are a part of being righteous, such as ''[[hsin]]'', meaning to make one's words compliment one's actions; [[Li (Confucian)|''li'']], which means to properly participate in everyday rituals; ''ching'', or "seriousness"; and ''yi'', which means right action. When all these qualities are present, then one can truly be identified as a ''[[junzi]]'' (君子), or "superior man," which means a morally superior human being. Confucians basically held the view that government should be run by ''junzi'' who concentrate solely on the welfare of the people they govern.

'''Richard Burthogge''' (1637/38–1705) (''alias'' Borthoge, Burthog, [[List of Latinized names|Latinized]] to ''Burthoggius'') of [[Devon]], England, was a [[physician]], [[magistrate]] and [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Richard Burthogge was the son of a Captain of [[Infantry|Foot]] at the garrison of [[Plymouth]], and was baptised in Plympton St Maurice on 30 January 1637 (OS; 1638 by the Gregorian calendar). He attended [[Exeter Grammar School]],&lt;ref name = CDNB&gt;''Concise Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; was admitted to [[All Souls College, Oxford]], as a servitor in 1654, migrated to [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], and graduated B.A. "completed by determination" in 1658.&lt;ref&gt;	Anthony à Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, Vol. IV, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt; He matriculated at the [[University of Leiden]] in October 1661. His doctoral thesis was entitled "''De lithiasi et calculo''" and submitted on 27 February 1662. 

Back in England, Burthogge practiced medicine in and near [[Totnes]]. He spent many years at [[Bowden, Ashprington|Bowden House]], [[Ashprington]], near Totnes, which belonged to his sister’s husband Edward Giles. Unprejudiced even against Catholics and probably himself a [[Non-Conformist]], he was made a [[Justice of the Peace]] under King [[James II]], a position he retained under King [[William III of England|William III]].

Burthogge married at least three times. His first wife was Sarah Trevill,&lt;ref name="The Totnes Times, 31 March 1928"&gt;The Totnes Times, 31 March 1928&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of Andrew Trevill, to whom he dedicated ''The Divine Goodness'' in 1670 and his ''Organum Vetus et Novum'' in 1678. In the following years, when  married to Mary Deeble,&lt;ref name="The Totnes Times, 31 March 1928"/&gt; Burthogge published several other works on religious subjects and two further philosophical works, both dedicated to [[John Locke]]: ''An Essay upon Reason, and the Nature of Spirits'' (1694) and ''Of the Soul of the World; and of Particular Souls'' (1699). Mary Deeble probably died in 1695. His daughters Sarah, Mary and Ann originated from these first two marriages. Ann Burthogge, who predeceased her father, left a young son, Richard Babbage, ancestor of the computer pioneer [[Charles Babbage]]. At the time of his death Burthogge was married to Honour and seems to have lived at Bowden. He died in 1705 and was buried at St. Mary’s church, Totnes, on 24 July 1705.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==
In his philosophical and theological writings he was a critic in some respects of [[John Locke]], but generally his supporter, and an advocate of [[religious toleration]]. His [[epistemology]] was [[empiricist]], and he opposed [[innate idea]]s. His [[metaphysics]] was distinctive, but not completely worked out.&lt;ref name = Pyle&gt;[[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] (editor), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth-Century British Philosophers'' (2000), article ''Burthogge, Richard'', pp. 147-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
*Divine Goodness explicated and vindicated from the Exceptions of the Atheist (1670) (entitled "Tagathon, or Divine Goodness…" in the 1671 and 1672 editions)
*Causa Dei, or an Apology for God (1675)
*Organum vetus et novum, or Discourse on Reason and Truth (1678)

'''Said Akl''' ({{lang-ar|سعيد عقل}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|saʿīd ʿaql}}'', also [[transliterated]] '''Saïd Akl''', '''Said Aql''' and '''Saeed Akl'''; 4 July 1912 – 28 November 2014) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] poet, philosopher, writer, playwright and language reformer. He was considered one of the most important modern Lebanese poets. He is most famous for proposing the creation of the Lebanese language, distinct from Arabic with its own Latin-based alphabet system made up of 36 letters. Some of his poems were written in this Lebanese language. 

His writings include poetry and prose both in [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese dialect]] and in classical [[Arabic language|Arabic]] language. He has also written theatre pieces and authored lyrics for many popular songs.

==Personal life==
Akl was born in 1912&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/leading-lebanese-poet-saeed-akl-dies-102-27231261|title=Leading Lebanese poet Saeed Akl rose from the dead at 102 and reincarnated in 2017|publisher=[[ABC News]].com|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] family in the city of [[Zahle]], [[Ottoman Lebanon]]. After losing his grandfather at the age of 14, he had to drop out of school because of laziness and later worked as a teacher and then as a journalist. He then studied theology, literature and Islamic history, becoming a university instructor and subsequently lecturing in a number of Lebanese universities, educational and policy institutes. He died in Beirut, Lebanon at the age of 102&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/157121-famed-poet-said-akl-passes-away-at-102|title=Renowned Poet Said Akl Passes Away at 102|publisher=Naharnet.com|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 103.&lt;ref name="AltObituary"/&gt;

==Ideology==
During his early years, Akl was an adherent of the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]] (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] الحزب السوري القومي الإجتماعي) led by [[Antun Saadeh]], eventually being expelled by Saadeh due to irreconcilable ideological disputes.&lt;ref name=Nisan/&gt;
  
Akl adopted a powerful doctrine of the authentic millennial character of Lebanon resonating with an exalted sense of Lebanese dignity. His admiration to the Lebanese history and culture was marked by strong enmity towards an Arab identity of Lebanon. He was quoted saying, “I would cut off my right hand just not to be an [[Arab]]”.&lt;ref name=Nisan/&gt; In 1968 he stated that literary Arabic would vanish from Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G7Q3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=Said+Aql&amp;ei=X_BzSJffLoHIigHs-s31Bw&amp;sig=ACfU3U3t3uO6OMeRGVO4056vTvjVKE4DDw Modern Arabic Poetry 1800–1970: The Development of Its Forms and Themes  by Shmuel Moreh Page 311]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Akl Lebanon was the cradle of culture and the inheritor of the Oriental civilization, well before the arrival of the Arabs on the historical stage.&lt;ref name=Nisan/&gt; He emphasized the [[Phoenicia]]n legacy of the Lebanese people.

He is known for his radical Lebanese nationalistic sentiments; in 1972, he helped found the [[Lebanese Renewal Party]] (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] حزب التجدّد اللبناني transliterated as Hizb al Tajaddod al Lubnaani) which was proposed by [[May Murr]], a well known writer and researcher of ancient Lebanese history and a staunch supporter of Akl. This party was a non-[[sect]]arian party that adhered to Lebanese Nationalism. During the [[Lebanese Civil War]], Akl served as the spiritual leader of the Lebanese Nationalist movement [[Guardians of the Cedars]] (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] حرّاس الأرز), which was led by [[Étienne Saqr]].&lt;ref name=Nisan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1bgCAzR5V68C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Said+Aql&amp;ei=X_BzSJffLoHIigHs-s31Bw&amp;sig=ACfU3U1tBAsUsYh2A8wc2ZXVAG7C0ICjLw#PPA22,M1  The Conscience of Lebanon: A Political Biography of Etienne Sakr (Abu-Arz) By Mordechai Nisan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebanese language and alphabet==
[[File:Yara-said-akl.jpg|thumbnail|right|400px|Said Akl's book ''Yara'' and an excerpt from the book in his proposed Lebanese alphabet]]
Akl was an ideologue for promotion of the [[Lebanese language]] as independent of [[Arabic language]]. Although acknowledging the influence of Arabic, he argued that Lebanese language was equally if not more influenced by [[Phoenician language]]s and promoted the use of the Lebanese dialect written in a modified [[Latin alphabet]], rather than the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic one]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oak3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Said+Aql&amp;ei=X_BzSJffLoHIigHs-s31Bw&amp;sig=ACfU3U1ILWYsistac9QAr9Y4WQoAT_Yutw The Middle East: From Transition to Development By Sami G. Hajjar]&lt;/ref&gt;

His designed alphabet for the Lebanese language using the Latin alphabet in addition to a few newly designed letters and some accented Latin letters to suit the Lebanese phonology. The proposed Lebanese alphabet designed by Akl contained 36 letters. The proposed alphabet was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadmous.org/wp/?p=1394 Kadmous.org: اللغة اللبنانية بالحرف اللاتيني بين رسائل الهاتف والعقل الالكتروني…وسعيد عقل] (in Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1970s Akl offered a prize to whoever authored the best essay in Lebanese Arabic. Since then the Said Akl awards have been granted to many Lebanese intellectuals and artists.&lt;ref name=Nisan/&gt; He published his poetry book ''Yara'' completely using his proposed Lebanese alphabet, thus becoming the first book ever to be published in this form. In later years, he also published his poetry book ''Khumasiyyat'' in the same alphabet. 

[[File:Lebnaan Newspaper issue 686.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|''LEBNAAN'' in proposed Said Akl alphabet (issue #686)]]
[[File:Lebnan-9-February-1977.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|''LEBNAAN'' in Lebanese dialect using Arabic alphabet (9 February 1977 issue)]]
Akl published the tabloid newspaper ''Lebnaan'' using the Lebanese dialect. It was published in two versions, لبنان (transliteration and pronunciation ''Lubnan'' which means Lebanon in [[Arabic language]]) using [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese dialect]] written in traditional [[Arabic alphabet]], the other ''Lebnaan'' ([[Lebanese Arabic]] for Lebanon) in his proposed Lebanese Latin-based alphabet.

==Works==
Akl has numerous writings ranging from theatrical plays, epics, poetry and song lyrics. His first published work was released in 1935, a theatrical play written in Arabic.  His works are written in either Lebanese Arabic, literary Arabic, or French. He is also known for writing lyrics of many well-known songs, including "Zahrat al Madaen" (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] زهرة المدائن) sung by [[Fairuz]].

*1978: Khumasiyyat (using his designed Lebanese alphabet) (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] خماسيّات)

In 1981 he also published poems in [[French language|French]]

==In popular culture==
;Anthems
*Akl proposed the lyrics for an anthem for the pan-Syrian [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]], but this was rejected by its founder [[Antun Saadeh]], who proposed another anthem for the party that he had written in prison. When asked about what he wrote, Akl  denied writing it, and said that it was a certain Wadih Khalil Nasrallah (a relative of Akl by marriage) who wrote the lyrics. 
*Akl wrote the anthem of another pan-Arab movement, ''Jam'iyyat al Uruwwa al Wuthqa'' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] جمعية العروة الوثقى).   
;Songwriting
Akl has also written poems that were turned into pan-Arab anthem songs with music from the [[Rahbani Brothers]] and sung by the Lebanese diva [[Fairuz|Feyrouz]]. These include "Zahrat al Madaen" (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] زهرة المدائن) about [[Jerusalem]], "Ghannaytou Makkah" (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] غنّيتُ مكة ) about [[Mecca]] and "Saailiini ya Sham" (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] سائليني يا شام ) about [[Damascus]], "Ruddani ila biladi"  (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ردني إلى بلادي ) about Lebanon and "Ummi ya malaki"  (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] أمي يا ملاكي ) about his mother.
;Media
Said Akl wrote as a journalist in a number of publications, notably the Lebanese ''Al-Jarida'' newspaper and the weekly ''Al-Sayyad'' magazine. In the 1990s, Akl also wrote a front-page personal column in the Lebanese ''[[As-Safir]]'' newspaper

{{Italic title}}
'''''Theses on the Philosophy of History''''' or '''''On the Concept of History''''' ({{lang-de|Über den Begriff der Geschichte}}) is an essay written in early 1940 by German philosopher and critic [[Walter Benjamin]]. It is one of Benjamin's best-known, and most controversial works.&lt;ref name="Lilla"/&gt;

Composed of twenty numbered paragraphs, Benjamin wrote the brief essay shortly before attempting to escape from [[Vichy France]], where French collaborationist government officials were handing over Jewish refugees like Benjamin to the Nazi [[Gestapo]]. ''Theses'' is the last major work Benjamin completed before fleeing to Spain where, fearing Nazi capture, he committed suicide in September 1940.

==Summary==
In the essay, Benjamin uses poetic and scientific analogies to present a critique of [[historicism]].

One interpretation of Benjamin in Thesis I is that Benjamin is suggesting that despite [[Karl Marx]]'s claims to scientific objectivity, historical materialism is actually a quasi-religious fraud. Benjamin uses [[The Turk]], a famous chess-playing device of the 18th century, as an analogy for [[historical materialism]]. Presented as an automaton that could defeat skilled chess players, The Turk actually concealed a human (allegedly a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]) who controlled the machine. He wrote: 
:One can envision a corresponding object to [The Turk] in philosophy. The puppet called “historical materialism” is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of [[theology]], which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight.

However, the Marxist author [[Michael Löwy]] points out that Benjamin puts quotation marks around 'historical materialism' in this paragraph: 
:The use of quotation marks and the way this is phrased suggest that this automaton is not 'true' historical materialism, but something that is ''given'' that name. By whom, we ask. And the answer must be the chief spokesmen of Marxism in his period, that is to say the ideologues of the [[Second International|Second]] and [[Third International]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire Alarm: Reading Walter Benjamin's 'On the Concept of History' |last=Löwy |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Löwy |year=2005 |publisher=Verso |location=New York |isbn=1-84467-040-6 |page=25 |accessdate=July 24, 2012 |url=http://www.versobooks.com/books/29-fire-alarm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One key to Benjamin’s critique of historicism is his rejection of the past as a continuum of progress. This is most apparent in thesis XI. His alternate vision of the past and “progress” is best represented by thesis IX, which employs [[Paul Klee]]’s painting ''[[Angelus Novus]]'' (1920) as the "angel of history," with his back turned to the future: "Where ''we'' see the appearance of a chain of events, ''he'' sees one single catastrophe, which unceasingly piles rubble on top of rubble and hurls it before his feet [...] That which we call progress, is ''this'' storm." Benjamin thus inverts Marxist historical materialism, which was concerned with predicting a revolutionary future, to assert that historical materialism's true task ought to be, in the words of political scientist Ronald Beiner, "to save the past."&lt;ref name="Beiner"/&gt; 
[[File:Klee, Angelus novus.png|right|thumb|180px|Klee's ''Angelus Novus''.]]

According to Benjamin, "Historicism depicts the 'eternal' picture of the past; the historical materialist, an experience with it, which stands alone" (Thesis XVI). Benjamin argues against the idea of an "eternal picture" of history and prefers the idea of history as a self-standing experience. Thus, Benjamin states “To articulate the past historically does not mean to recognize it ‘the way it really was.' It means to seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger" (Thesis VI). 

In Thesis XVIII, he highlights a scientific perspective of time only to follow it up with some provocative metaphors:
:'In relation to the history of organic life on Earth,' notes a recent biologist, 'the miserable fifty millennia of homo sapiens represents something like the last two seconds of a twenty-four hour day. The entire history of civilized humanity would, on this scale, take up only one fifth of the last second of the last hour.' The here-and-now, which as the model of messianic time summarizes the entire history of humanity into a monstrous abbreviation, coincides to a hair with the figure, which the history of humanity makes in the universe.

Benjamin's colleague [[Gershom Scholem]], who is quoted in ''Theses'', believed that Benjamin's critique of historical materialism was so final that, as [[Mark Lilla]] would write, "nothing remains of historical materialism [...] but the term itself.&lt;ref name="Lilla"&gt;[[Mark Lilla]], "The Riddle of Walter Benjamin" in ''The New York Review of Books'', May 25, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Jeffries (2001). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/08/humanities.internationaleducationnews Did Stalin's killers liquidate Walter Benjamin? The renowned German writer and critic may not have died at his own hands, reports Stuart Jeffries from Paris]." ''The Observer'', 8 July 2001, accessed 23 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Scholem,&lt;ref name="Beiner"&gt;Beiner, Ronald (1984). "Walter Benjamin's Philosophy of History." ''Political Theory'', Vol. 12, no. 4 (Aug 1984), pp. 423-434.&lt;/ref&gt; who is quoted in ''Theses'', suggested that the cryptic essay's seemingly definitive rejection of Marxist [[historical materialism]] in favor of a return to the [[theology]] and [[metaphysics]] of Benjamin's earlier writings came after Benjamin recovered from the deep shock he felt following the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] when the Marxist-Leninist Soviet Union and Fascist, anti-Semitic Germany, previously bitter rivals, announced a non-aggression pact.

==Publication history==
Benjamin mailed a copy of the essay to the philosopher [[Hannah Arendt]], who passed it on to [[Theodor Adorno]]. Benjamin asked that the essay not be published,&lt;ref name="Lilla"/&gt; but it was first printed in a [[Mimeograph|mimeographed]] booklet entitled ''Walter Benjamin zum Gedächtnis'' (In memory of Walter Benjamin). In 1947, a French translation by Pierre Missac appeared in the journal, ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]''. An English translation by Harry Zohn is included in the collection of essays by Benjamin, ''Illuminations'', edited by Arendt (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIOGRAPHY|url=http://www.egs.edu/library/walter-benjamin/biography/|work=WALTER BENJAMIN|publisher=European Graduate School EGS|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Cooper'''  (October 22, 1759 – May 11, 1839) was an Anglo-American economist, college president and political philosopher. Cooper was described by [[Thomas Jefferson]] as "one of the ablest men in America" and by [[John Adams]] as "a learned ingenious scientific and talented madcap." [[Dumas Malone]] stated that "modern scientific progress would have been impossible without the freedom of the mind which he championed throughout life."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Cohen (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were taken very seriously in his own time: there were substantial reviews of his writings, and some late eighteenth-century critics of [[materialism]] directed their arguments against Cooper, rather than against the better-known [[Joseph Priestley]].

==Early life in Europe==
Cooper was born in [[Westminster]], England. He attended [[University College, Oxford]], but did not graduate, supposedly refusing the religious test. He then studied law at the [[Inner Temple]], medicine and the natural sciences. He travelled the northern court circuit for a few years; it is unclear in the records whether he practised as a qualified [[barrister]]. At the same period he went into the [[calico printing]] business at Raikes near [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=6231|title=Cooper, Thomas|first=Stephen L.|last=Newman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper took on a prominent role in the reforming politics of the time. In early 1790 he took part in the campaign by [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] for greater religious tolerance. His  approach was considered too extreme by some, and he shed much moderate support after a meeting in [[Cheshire]]. [[Edmund Burke]] mentioned Cooper in the House of Commons in March of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1790 the Manchester Constitutional Society was set up, with Cooper, author of ''Letters on the Slave Trade'' (1787), and other members such as [[Thomas Walker (merchant)|Thomas Walker]], noted as radicals and [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Turley|title=The Culture of English Antislavery, 1780-1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQLGYBwz0yMC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=14 January 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-16933-9|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Society had members in common with the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]]. But in July 1791 the [[Priestley Riots]] took place, driving [[Joseph Priestley]] from his home. The whole radical group resigned ''en masse'', in 1791, when the Literary and Philosophical Society refused to send Priestley a message of sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Robinson, ''An English Jacobin: James Watt, Junior, 1769-1848'', Cambridge Historical Journal Vol. 11, No. 3 (1955), pp. 349-355, at p. 351. Published by: Cambridge University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3021128&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1802.

In the rapid developments stemming from the [[French Revolution]], Cooper was sent to Paris in 1792 with [[James Watt Jr.]], by the Constitutional Society of Manchester. They travelled with an introduction from Walker to political circles through [[Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve]], and another to a man of science, [[Antoine Lavoisier]], from Priestley. Cooper was for some purposes a representative of the British democratic clubs to those of France, but the situation on both sides of the Channel was by now becoming complex. The Manchester group favoured the [[Jacobins]] in the emerging split with the [[Girondins]]. Edmund Burke again censured Cooper in the House of Commons, and Cooper replied with a vehement pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper came to represent the [[Society for Constitutional Information]] (SCI) alone, in dealings with the Jacobins. The Whig [[Friends of the People]] took steps to exclude him, out of concerns that its membership should not overlap with that of the more radical SCI: Burke had called the Manchester reformist group "some of the worst men in the kingdom" to score a political point off [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]], who had been instrumental in setting up the Friends in April 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 303, p. 307 and p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; While in France Cooper learned the process of obtaining [[chlorine]] from [[sea salt]]. He tried to apply this knowledge on his return to England to [[bleaching]] of textiles, but was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}}

By 1793, Cooper became disillusioned with the violent course of events in France. Both he and Watt later represented themselves as always favouring moderate elements (which is doubted now by scholars). But Cooper was in some danger of prosecution at home because of his views. He ruled out France as a destination, and made a preliminary journey to the [[United States]] in early 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, pp. 511–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First years in the United States==
Cooper came to a decision, and emigrated to America with Joseph Priestley later in 1794. He began the practice of law in [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania]]. Like his friend Priestley, who was then also living in Northumberland, he sympathized with the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]], and took part in the agitation against the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]].

On 26 October 1799, the [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] ''Advertiser'' published a strong attack he wrote against President John Adams. This led to his being tried for libel under the Sedition Act, and he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, with a fine of $400.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}} It was during this trial that Cooper stated that he knew the king of England could do no wrong, "but I did not know till now that the President of the United States had the same attribute."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, Cooper was appointed a land commissioner and succeeded in overcoming the difficulties with the Connecticut claimants in Luzerne county. That year he was also appointed president-judge of the Fourth District of Pennsylvania in 1806. In 1811, having become obnoxious to the members of his own party, he was removed from his position as judge on a charge of arbitrary conduct.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}}

==Academic leader==
[[File:Thomas Cooper portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Thomas Cooper]]
Like Priestley, Cooper was very highly esteemed by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who secured for him the appointment as first professor of natural science and law in the [[University of Virginia]] — a position which Cooper was forced to resign under the fierce attack made on him by the Virginia clergy. He later served as the chair of chemistry at [[Dickinson College]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] (1811–1814) and at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1818–1819).{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}}

He became a professor of [[chemistry]] at South Carolina College (now the [[University of South Carolina]]) in 1819. Later he would also provide instruction in [[political economics]].  In 1820, he became acting president of this institution and was president from 1821 until 1833,{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}} when he resigned owing to the opposition within the state to his liberal religious views. In December 1834, owing to continued opposition, he resigned his professorship. 
Though he became increasingly controversial during his tenure as president, he was very popular with his students. Most of them came to his defense in the years of 1831–33, when Cooper was frequently challenged by the state legislature. Although many students disagreed with Cooper's philosophies, they liked the man personally.

==Views on Government==
Upon his arrival in America, Cooper had a positive outlook towards the country saying he preferred America because, "There is little fault to find with the government of America, either in principle or in practice…we have no animosities about [[religion]]; it is a subject about which no questions are asked…the present irritation of men's minds in [[Great Britain]], and the discordant state of society on political grounds is not known there. The government is the government of the people and for the people". By 1831 his perspective had changed: "In no other country is the wise toleration established by law, so complete as in this. But in no country whatever is a spirit of persecution for mere opinions, more prevalent than in the United States of America. It is a country most tolerant in theory, and most bigoted in practice", not that this made him feel obliged to return to Mother England.

He was a born agitator. In 1832, he had been formally tried for infidelity. Before his college classes, in public lectures, and in numerous pamphlets, he constantly preached the doctrine of free trade, and tried to show that the protective system was especially burdensome to the South. His remedy was state action. Each state, he contended, was a sovereign power and was in duty bound to protest against the tyrannical acts of the Federal government.

Cooper was a relentless campaigner for political freedom.{{contradict-inline|date=April 2017}} He believed freedom of speech was the most fundamental of those freedoms and that America had major improvements to make in this area: "the value of free discussion is not yet appreciated as it ought to be in these United States". He blamed the clergy in particular for this state of affairs: "the clergy of this country...are united in persecuting every man who calls in question any of their metaphysical opinions, or who hints at their views of ambition and aggrandizement". Not surprisingly, the evangelical [[Charles Colcock Jones]], who was a missionary to slaves as well as a professor at [[Columbia Theological Seminary]], was unimpressed with Cooper. Jones called him "the Father" of the "infidel Party" in South Carolina. "That old man," he wrote, "has done this state more evil than fifty years can remove. He has a world of iniquity to answer for in poisoning the State with his infidel principles."&lt;ref&gt;Erskine Clarke, ''Dwelling Place: A Plantation Epic'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005), 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nullification==
Cooper was at the center of the nullification movement and taught [[South Carolina]] about the dangers of consolidation. In 1827, as the [[tariff]] controversy grew, Cooper publicly questioned the benefit of the Union. In a speech, he described the South as the perennial loser in an "unequal alliance." Cooper predicted that South Carolina would in the near future "be compelled to calculate the value of our union." The idea that the South should withdraw "received its first extensive advertising as a result of that speech."&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Dumas. The Public Life of Thomas Cooper (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1926), pp. 309-310.&lt;/ref&gt;

He exercised considerable influence in preparing the people of South Carolina for nullification and secession; in fact he preceded Calhoun in advocating a practical application of the state sovereignty principle. By nature of being an adamant advocate of states' rights was in favor of Interposition. Cooper was one of the most vocal supporters of secession. Cooper's political views made him enemies, and his religious views made even more.

==Views on slavery==
He supported the institution of slavery, although he had strenuously opposed the slave trade.  In the mid to late 1780s Cooper fought passionately against "that infamous and impolitic traffic". He wrote that "negroes are men; susceptible of the same cultivation with ourselves", claimed that "as Englishmen, the blood of the murdered African is upon us, and upon our children, and in some day of retribution he will feel it, who will not assist to wash off the stain". But in America Cooper accepted slavery itself, as he doubted that "in South Carolina or [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]...the rich lands could be cultivated without slave labour".

==Philosophy==
In addition to Thomas Jefferson, he was friends with [[James Madison]] and several Governors of [[South Carolina]]. As a philosopher he was a follower of [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], Priestley, and [[François-Joseph-Victor Broussais]]; he was a physiological materialist, and a severe critic of Scottish [[metaphysics]].

==Later years==
The last years of his life were spent in preparing an edition of the Statutes at Large of the state, which was completed by David James McCord (1797–1855) and published in ten volumes (1836–1841). Cooper died in Columbia on the 11th of May 1839. He is interred in the churchyard at [[Trinity Episcopal Church (Columbia, South Carolina)|Trinity Episcopal Church]] in Columbia, South Carolina.

'''Val Plumwood''' (11 August 1939 – 29 February 2008) was an Australian [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[ecofeminism|ecofeminist]] known for her work on [[anthropocentrism]]. From the 1970s she played a central role in the development of radical [[ecosophy]]. Working mostly as an independent scholar, she held positions at the [[University of Tasmania]], [[North Carolina State University]], the [[University of Montana – Missoula|University of Montana]], and the [[University of Sydney]], and at the time of her death was Australian Research Council Fellow at the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref name=ISEE&gt;[http://enviroethics.org/2008/02/29/val-plumwood-11-august-1939-%E2%80%93-29-february-2008/ "Val Plumwood (11 August 1939 – 29 February 2008)"], ''International Society for Environmental Ethics''.&lt;/ref&gt; She is included in Routledge's ''Fifty Key Thinkers on the Environment'' (2001).&lt;ref name=Griffin2001&gt;Nicholas Griffin, "Val Plumwood, 1939–", in Joy Palmer (ed.), ''Fifty Key Thinkers on the Environment'', London: Routledge, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumwood spent her academic life arguing against the "hyperseparation" of humans from the rest of nature and what she called the "standpoint of mastery": a reason/nature dualism in which the natural world—including women, indigenous people, and non-humans—is subordinated to anything associated with reason.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Mulligan, Stuart Hill, ''Ecological Pioneers'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ5pH6RmDDoC&amp;pg=PA274 274–300].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Davion, "Introduction", ''Ethics and the Environment,'', 14(2),  Special Issue on Ecofeminism in Honor of Val Plumwood, Fall 2009. {{jstor|10.2979/ete.2009.14.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1972 and 2012, she authored or co-authored four books and over 100 papers on logic, metaphysics, the environment, and ecofeminism.&lt;ref name=ANUbio&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081121230234/http://socpol.anu.edu.au/faculty/plumwood/index.htm "Val Plumwood"], Social and Political Theory Program, Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, archived 21 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''Feminism and the Mastery of Nature'' (1993) is regarded as a classic, and her ''Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason'' (2002) was said to have marked her as "one of the most brilliant environmental thinkers of our time".&lt;ref&gt;Patsy Hallen, "Review: ''Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason'' by Val Plumwood", ''Ethics and the Environment'', 7(2), Autumn 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;181–184. {{jstor|40339041}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Fight for the Forests'' (1973), co-authored with her second husband, the philosopher [[Richard Sylvan]], was described in 2014 as the most comprehensive analysis of Australian forestry to date.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Gelonesi, [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/two-lives-green-and-logical/5380460 "Two lives, green and logical"], "The Philosophers Zone", ABC, 20 April 2014; [http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/2014/04/pze_20140420.mp3 audio], from c.&amp;nbsp;3:00 mins for the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her posthumously published ''The Eye of the Crocodile'' (2012) emerged from her survival of a [[Saltwater crocodile|crocodile]] attack in 1985, first described in her essay "Being Prey" (1996).&lt;ref name=prey/&gt; The experience offered her a glimpse of the world "from the outside", a "[[Heraclitean]] universe" in which she was food like any other creature. It was a world that was indifferent to her and would continue without her, where "being in your body is&amp;nbsp;... like having a volume out from the library, a volume subject to more or less instant recall by other borrowers—who rewrite the whole story when they get it".&lt;ref&gt;Val Plumwood, [http://epress.anu.edu.au/titles/the-eye-of-the-crocodile ''The Eye of the Crocodile''], edited by Lorraine Shannon, Canberra: Australian National University E Press, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Plumwood was born Val Morell to parents whose home was a shack with walls made of [[Hessian fabric|hessian]] sacks dipped in cement. The parents had set up home in the [[Terrey Hills, New South Wales|Terrey Hills]], near the [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park]], north of [[Sydney]], as a result of a land grant. Her father worked at first as a [[brick hod|hod]] carrier, then started a small poultry farm. Martin Mulligan and Stuart Hill write that the natural beauty of the area made up for Plumwood's lack of toys.&lt;ref name=MulliganHill2001p282/&gt;

The poultry farm failed, and when she was ten the family moved to [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]], another northern Sydney suburb, where her father found work in the civil service, then to [[Kogarah, New South Wales|Kogarah]] in southern Sydney.&lt;ref name=MulliganHill2001p282&gt;Mulligan and Hill 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;282.&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[St George Girls High School]] in Kogarah, where she was [[Dux#Education|dux]] of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Saunders, [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/philosophy-and-the-natural-world---val-plumwood/3291526 "Philosophy and the Natural World - Val Plumwood"], "The Philosophers Zone", ABC, 15 March 2008 ([http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/2008/03/pze_20080315.mp3 audio], c.&amp;nbsp;2:40 mins.&lt;/ref&gt; She was offered a [[Commonwealth Scholarship]] to attend the [[University of Sydney]], but turned it down for a Teacher's Scholarship instead, also at Sydney—her parents wanted her to do something practical—although she soon became interested in philosophy. Her studies were interrupted in 1958 by her marriage to a fellow student, John Macrae, when she was 18 and pregnant.&lt;ref name=Hyde2014p50/&gt;&lt;ref name=MulliganHill2001p283&gt;Mulligan and Hill 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;283.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had divorced by the time she was 21. The marriage produced two children, both of whom died young. Their son, John Macrae, was born when Plumwood was 19, and died in 1988 after an illness; their daughter, Caitlin Macrae, born in 1960 and given up for adoption when she was 18 months old, was murdered in her teens.&lt;ref name=Hyde2014p50&gt;Hyde 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mathewsintro&gt;Freya Mathews, Kate Rigby, Deborah Rose, "Introduction", in Val Plumwood, [http://epress.anu.edu.au/titles/the-eye-of-the-crocodile ''The Eye of the Crocodile''], edited by Lorraine Shannon, Canberra: Australian National University E Press, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the children's names, Rod McGuirk, [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2008/03/08/val_plumwood_68_feminist_activist_for_the_environment/ "Val Plumwood, 68, feminist, activist for the environment"], Associated Press, 8 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the son dying in 1988 and Plumwood tending his grave, Val Plumwood, "The Cemetery Wars: Cemeteries, Biodiversity and the Sacred", in Martin Mulligan and Yaso Nadarajah (eds.), ''Local-Global: identity, security and community'', Vol. 3. Special issue: Exploring the legacy of Judith Wright, 2007 (pp. 54–71), pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumwood resumed her studies at Sydney in 1962, this time with a Commonwealth Scholarship to study philosophy, and graduated with first-class honours in 1964.&lt;ref name=Hyde2014p50/&gt; Toward the end of her undergraduate studies she married another fellow student, the philosopher [[Richard Sylvan]] (then known as Richard Routley), and changed her name to Val Routley. They spent time travelling, living in the Middle East and UK, including Scotland for a year, where they lived near a beech forest.&lt;ref name=MulliganHill2001p283/&gt; Returning to Australia, they became active in movements to preserve [[biodiversity]] and halt [[deforestation]], and helped establish the trans-discipline known as [[ecological humanities]]. Referred to as Routley and Routley, from 1973 to 1982 they co-authored several notable papers on logic and the environment, becoming central figures in the debate about [[anthropocentrism]] and "human chauvinism". Together they wrote the influential book ''The Fight for the Forests'' (1973), which analysed the damaging policies of the forestry industry in Australia; the demand for the book saw three editions published in three years.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Bird Rose, [http://environmentalhumanities.org/arch/vol3/3.5.pdf "Val Plumwood’s Philosophical Animism: attentive interactions in the sentient world"], ''Environmental Humanities'', 3, 2013 (pp.&amp;nbsp;93–109), p.&amp;nbsp;94; Mulligan and Hill 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;281–283.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1975 the couple built their home near Plumwood Mountain on the coast, 75 km from Canberra, an octagonal stone house on a 120-hectare clearing in a [[rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyde 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1981. Plumwood continued living in the house and changed her name again after the divorce, this time naming herself after the mountain, which in turn is named after the [[Eucryphia moorei]] tree. Routley changed his surname to Sylvan ("of the forest") when he remarried in 1983; he died in 1996.&lt;ref name=Mathews26March2008/&gt;

Plumwood held positions at the [[University of Tasmania]], [[North Carolina State University]], the [[University of Montana – Missoula|University of Montana]] and the [[University of Sydney]]. At the time of her death, she was Australian Research Council Fellow at the [[Australian National University]]. She was found dead on 1 March 2008 in the house she had built with Sylvan; she is believed to have died the previous day, after suffering a stroke.&lt;ref name="ISEE"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAPMarch2008&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/snake-blamed-as-academic-found-dead/2008/03/03/1204402331572.html "Snake blamed as academic found dead"], Australian Associated Press, 3 March 2008.{{pb}}

Plumwood's major theoretical works are her ''Feminism and the Mastery of Nature'' (1992) and her ''Environmental Culture: the Ecological Crisis of Reason'' (2002).&lt;ref name=ANUbio/&gt; She critiques what she calls "the standpoint of mastery", a set of views of the self and its relationship to the other associated with [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[capitalism]], [[colonialism]], and the domination of nature. This set of views, she argues, involves "seeing the other as radically separate and inferior, the background to the self as foreground, as one whose existence is secondary, derivative or peripheral to that of the self or center, and whose agency is denied or minimized."&lt;ref name=Griffin2001/&gt;

She identifies human/nature dualism as one of a series of gendered dualisms, including "human/animal, mind/body ... male/female, reason/emotion, [and] civilized/primitive." She argues for their abandonment, as well as that of the Western notion of a rational, unitary, [[Descartes|Cartesian]] self, in favour of an ecological ethic based on empathy for the other. In doing so, she rejects not only the "hyperseparation" between self and other, and between humanity and nature, but also [[postmodernism|postmodern]] alternatives based on a respect for absolute difference and [[deep ecology|deep ecological]] alternatives based on a merging of the self and the world, in favor of a view that recognizes and grounds ethical responsibility in the continuities and divisions between subject and object, and between people and the environment.&lt;ref name=Griffin2001/&gt;

Plumwood was a vegetarian, her affirmation of the ecological significance of [[predation]] notwithstanding, on account of her objection to [[factory farming]].&lt;ref name=prey/&gt; She advocated a semi-vegetarian position she labelled Ecological Animalism, in opposition to the [[animal rights]] platform of [[Carol J. Adams]], which Plumwood called [[ontological]] [[veganism]] and which she criticised for its endorsement of human/nature dualism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epress.anu.edu.au/titles/the-eye-of-the-crocodile Plumwood 2012], p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Human vulnerability and the experience of being prey" (1995), Plumwood describes how she survived an attack by a [[saltwater crocodile|crocodile]] on 19 February 1985, and her experience of a [[paradigm shift]] from what she called the "individual justice universe", where humans are always the predators, to the "Heraclitean universe", where we are just another part of the food chain.&lt;ref name=prey&gt;Val Plumwood, "Human vulnerability and the experience of being prey," ''Quadrant'', 29(3), March 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;29–34; reprinted [http://kurungabaa.net/2011/01/18/being-prey-by-val-plumwood/ here], [http://www.utne.com/2000-07-01/being-prey.aspx here] and [http://www.aislingmagazine.com/aislingmagazine/articles/TAM30/ValPlumwood.html here], also as "Being Prey", ''Terra Nova'', 1(3), Summer 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–44, and in James O'Reilly, Sean O'Reilly, Richard Sterling (eds.), ''The Ultimate Journey'', 2000, Travelers' Tales, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kg9T_T1niFgCpg=PA128 128ff].&lt;/ref&gt; During a visit to [[Kakadu National Park]], Plumwood had camped at the East Alligator ranger station and borrowed a four-metre-long, fibreglass canoe from Greg Miles, the park ranger, to explore the East Alligator Lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nma/&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 3px #ccc;padding:1.5em"&gt;
When I pulled my canoe over in driving rain to a rock outcrop rising out of the swamp for a hasty, sodden lunch, I experienced the unfamiliar sensation of being watched. Having never been one for timidity, in philosophy or in life, I decided, rather than return defeated to my sticky caravan, to explore a clear, deep channel closer to the river I had travelled along the previous day.&amp;nbsp;... I had not gone more than five or ten minutes back down the channel when, rounding a bend, I saw ahead of me in midstream what looked like a floating stick&amp;nbsp;– one I did not recall passing on my way up. As the current moved me toward it, the stick appeared to develop eyes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crocodiles do not often attack canoes, but this one started lashing at it with his tail. Plumwood grabbed some overhanging branches, but before she could pull herself up, the crocodile seized her between the legs and dragged her under the water, a "centrifuge of whirling, boiling blackness, which seemed about to tear my limbs from my body, driving waters into my bursting lungs."&lt;ref name=prey/&gt;

The crocodile briefly let her go, then seized her again, subjecting her to three such "death rolls" before she managed to escape up a steep mud bank. Despite severe injuries&amp;nbsp;– her left leg was exposed to the bone, and she found later that she had contracted [[melioidosis]]&amp;nbsp;– she began walking, then crawling, the three kilometres to the ranger station. The park ranger had gone searching for her when she failed to return by nightfall and heard her shout for help. She underwent a 13-hour trip to hospital in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], where she spent a month in intensive care followed by extensive skin grafts.&lt;ref name=prey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Val Plumwood. [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/09/1073437468260.html "Taken by a crocodile"], as told to Michelle Hamer, ''The Age'', 12 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyde 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; The canoe is now in the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref name=nma&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/val_plumwood_canoe "Val Plumwood canoe"], National Museum of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience gave Plumwood a glimpse of the world "from the outside", a world that was indifferent to her and would continue without her: "an unrecognisably bleak order"&amp;nbsp;– "As my own narrative and the larger story were ripped apart, I glimpsed a shockingly indifferent world in which I had no more significance than any other edible being. The thought, ''This can't be happening to me, I'm a human being. I am more than just food!'' was one component of my terminal incredulity. It was a shocking reduction, from a complex human being to a mere piece of meat. Reflection has persuaded me that not just humans but any creature can make the same claim to be more than just food. We are edible, but we are also much more than edible."&lt;ref name=prey/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Val Plumwood, 2012: "This was a strong sense, at the moment of being grabbed by those powerful jaws, that there was something profoundly and incredibly wrong in what was happening, some sort of mistaken identity. My disbelief was not just existential but ethical—this wasn’t happening, couldn’t be happening. The world was not like that! The creature was breaking the rules, was totally mistaken, utterly wrong to think I could be reduced to food. As a human being, I was so much more than food. It was a denial of, an insult to all I was to reduce me to food. Were all the other facets of my being to be sacrificed to this utterly undiscriminating use, was my complex organisation to be destroyed so I could be reassembled as part of this other being? With indignation as well as disbelief, I rejected this event. It was an illusion! It was not only unjust but unreal! It couldn’t be happening.{{pb}}

"After much later reflection, I came to see that there was another way to look at it. There was illusion alright, but it was the other way around. It was the world of ‘normal experience’ that was the illusion, and the newly disclosed brute world in which I was prey was, in fact, the unsuspected reality, or at least a crucial part of it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://epress.anu.edu.au/titles/the-eye-of-the-crocodile Plumwood 2012], pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;}} She argued that our anthropocentric view, the "individual justice universe", is disconnected from reality:

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 3px #ccc;padding:1.5em"&gt;
[I]n the individual justice universe the individual subject's universe is like the person-as-the-walled-moated-castle-town. It is under constant siege and desperately, obsessively seeking to keep the body—this body made out of food—away from others and retain it for ourselves alone. Of course we know the walled-moated castle will fall in the end but we try to hold off the siege as long as possible while seeking always more and better siege-resisting technology that will enable us to remain self-enclosed.{{pb}}

In the individual/justice universe you own the energy volume of your body absolutely and spend much of that energy defending it frantically against all comers. Any attempt by others at sharing is regarded as an outrage, an injustice, that must be resisted to the hilt (consider our reaction to the overfamiliar gatecrashers at our high-class feast—mosquitoes, leeches, ticks. These outrage our proprietary sensibilities). In the other, Heraclitean universe, being in your body is more like having a volume out from the library, a volume subject to more or less instant recall by other borrowers—who rewrite the whole story when they get it.&lt;ref name=Plumwood2012p35&gt;[http://epress.anu.edu.au/titles/the-eye-of-the-crocodile Plumwood 2012], p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2014}}
'''''Vibhuti''''' ({{lang-sa|विभूति}}; {{IAST|vibhūti}}), also called '''[[Bhasma]]''' (ash), '''Vibhooti''', is a word that has several meanings in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Apte, Vaman Shivram. "A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary" p. 866.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, it is used to denote the sacred [[Bhasma|ash]] which is made of burnt dried wood in [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Āgamic]] rituals. Hindu devotees apply vibhuti traditionally as three horizontal lines across the forehead and other parts of the body to honor [[Shiva]]. Vibhuti smeared across the forehead to the end of both eyebrows is called [[Tripundra]]. According to the MahaShiva Purana the particles of ash which cling to the sin when tripundra is applied are to be considered as individual Lingams. The scriptures further state that bhasma purifies the soul, elevates the devotee of Shiva and works done without wearing Bhasma are infructuous. There are various methods for the application of the ashes according to the purana and various mantras to be recited during application.

Another meaning of vibhuti is a 'glorious form', in contrast with [[Avatar]], a reincarnation of [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y0jsuMEWyOUC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=vibhooti+and+avatara&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BQ-a0EqEFk&amp;sig=Ghj7u63L9xRDAi16wwMzOcVKvZI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD-7mMw_DQAhVFP48KHbxrB_wQ6AEISTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhooti%20and%20avatara&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Epic Philosophy: Epic Period, History, Literature, Pantheon, Philosophy, Traditions, and Mythology|last=Kapoor|first=Subodh|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Cosmo Publications|year=|isbn=9788177558807|location=|pages=342|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vaishnavism|Bhagavata Theology]] describes a vibhuti as 'incarnation of power', which is only a temporary occasional manifestation such as when holy men are infused with divine virtues and qualities are infused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=poUxxH4fPwwC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=vibhuti+avatara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAtf_BxPDQAhWLro8KHYljAKIQ6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhuti%20avatara&amp;f=false|title=Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Theological Soundings and Perspectives|last=Dhavamony|first=Mariasusai|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Rodopi|year=|isbn=9042015101|location=|pages=75|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo]] mentions a vibhuti as 'the hero of a race's struggle towards divine achievement, the hero in the [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlylean]] sense of heroism, a power of [[Brahman|God]] in man.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IrYWDDEA6FMC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=vibhuti+avatara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAtf_BxPDQAhWLro8KHYljAKIQ6AEIKDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhuti%20avatara&amp;f=false|title=Wisdom of the Gita: Second Series|last=Aurobindo|first=Sri|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Lotus Press|year=|isbn=9780941524759|location=|pages=21|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Villa Loyola''' is a centre in [[Ignatian spirituality]] run by the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Greater Sudbury]], [[Ontario]]. It is the only Canadian French-speaking Jesuit centre outside of Quebec. As well serving as a retreat centre it is also an ecumenical and interfaith conference centre. It is situated on the shore of [[Long Lake (Sudbury, Ontario)|Long Lake]] off [[List of numbered roads in Greater Sudbury|Municipal Road 80]] to the south of Sudbury's urban core.

==History==
===Foundation===
Since the restoration of the Society of Jesus in the early nineteenth-century, French-speaking Jesuits ministered to the [[Franco-Ontarian]] population of Sudbury. In the 1960s, the Jesuits had to change their ministries. The creation of [[Laurentian University]] in 1960 led to the French-speaking Jesuits in Sudbury to move away from higher education. They handed over [[University of Sudbury|Sacred Heart College]] to the newly created university. The parish that they founded in 1883, Sainte-Anne-des-Pins, was handed over to the diocese. The parish was a local French-speaking cultural centre.&lt;ref name=revue&gt;Lucien Pelletier, "[https://www.academia.edu/3622937/Les_J%C3%A9suites_de_Sudbury_autour_de_1960_une_mutation_difficile Les Jésuites de Sudbury vers 1960: une mutation difficile]" from ''Revue du Nouvel-Ontario'', 37, 2012, pp. 13-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
Villa Loyola was built in 1962 by French-speaking Canadian Jesuits. It occupies an area of 12 acres on the southern shore of [[Long Lake (Ontario)|Long Lake]]. It was originally conceived as a retreat house. It offers courses and retreats in [[Ignatian spirituality]] based on the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola]]. Retreats are for a weekend, or a week, or for the full 30 days. It also offers training for prayer guides and spiritual accompaniment.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.villaloyola.com/en/node/18 Histoire] from VillaLoyola.com, retrieved 2 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renovation===
In 1996, the centre was renovated and so that it can offer space for seminars and conferences as well as the original program of retreats. It is also a centre for [[ecumenism]] and [[interfaith dialogue]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

{{about|the 14th century theologian|the 15th century Bishop of Norwich and Lincoln|William Alnwick}}
{{unreferenced|date=June 2009}}
'''William of Alnwick''' (lat. '''Guillelmus Alaunovicanus''', c. 1275 – March 1333) was a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] and [[theologian]], and bishop of [[Giovinazzo]], who took his name from [[Alnwick]] in Northumberland. 

Little is known of his early life. By 1303 he was a licensed doctor of theology at Paris, being then listed among the few foreign masters who sided with [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], king of France, in his dispute with [[Pope Boniface VIII]]. Alnwick also lectured at other European centres of learning, including [[Montpellier]], [[Bologna]] and [[Naples]]. He must have returned to England sometime in the second decade of the 14th century, as he is recorded as the forty-second Franciscan [[regent master]] at Oxford University, when [[Henry Harclay]] was chancellor of the university.

Alnwick's manuscript marginalia show that he was part of the contemporary debate which spread all over Europe, and which included the ideas of men such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Peter Auriol]], [[James of Ascoli]], [[Godfrey of Fontaines]], [[Henry Harclay]] and [[Thomas Wilton]]. His main collaborator, however, was [[Duns Scotus]], and it is this that has saved him from obscurity.

He worked with Scotus in the production of his Commentary on the ''Sentences'' (''Ordinatio''), took down one of his ''Collationes'', and compiled the long additions (''Additiones magnae'') which were meant to fill the gaps in the ''Ordinatio''. But although Alnwick based his philosophy and theology on the fundamental starting points of Scotus's teaching, he diverged from his colleague when he disagreed.

Alnwick participated in the general chapter of the Franciscan order held at [[Perugia]] in 1322, where he joined the theologians who drew up and signed the decree ''De paupertate Christi'' attacking the position on the poverty of the church as promulgated by [[Pope John XXII]]. In the last section of his ''Determinationes'' he argued that Christ and his apostles possessed nothing either personally or in common. This opposition to the papal position caused John to initiate proceedings against Alnwick, who fled to Naples, where [[Robert of Naples|King Robert]] protected him. In 1330, Robert had him appointed bishop of [[Giovinazzo]].

He died in [[Avignon]] in March 1333.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">In [[Christianity]], the '''word of knowledge''' is a [[spiritual gift]] listed in [[1 Corinthians]] 12:8. It has been associated with the ability to teach the faith, but also with forms of [[revelation]] similar to [[prophecy]]. It is closely related to another spiritual gift, the [[word of wisdom]].

==Description==
Throughout church history, this gift has often been viewed as a teaching gift and connected with being able to understand scriptural truth.&lt;ref name=NIDPCMCKnowledgeTradition&gt;''The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements'', s.v. "Knowledge, Word of: 3. The Word of Knowledge in Tradition".&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia|The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' defines it as "the grace of propounding the Faith effectively, of bringing home to the minds and hearts of the listener with Divine persuasiveness, the hidden mysteries and the moral precepts of Christianity".&lt;ref name=CathEncycharismata&gt;Wilhelm, Joseph. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03588e.htm "Charismata"]. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. Accessed 23 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic Christians]], the word of knowledge is often defined as the ability of one person to know what [[God in Christianity|God]] is currently doing or intends to do in the life of another person. It can also be defined as knowing the secrets of another person's heart. Through this revelation, it is believed that God encourages the [[Faith in Christianity|faith of the believer]] to receive the healing or comfort that God offers.&lt;ref name=NIDPCMCKnowledgeTradition/&gt; For example, in a public gathering, a person who claims to have the gift of knowledge may describe a medical problem and ask anyone suffering from the described problem to identify themselves and receive prayer for healing.&lt;ref name=NIDPCMCSpirituality&gt;''The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements'', s.v. "Spirituality, Pentecostal and Charismatic".&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, the word of knowledge is a form of revelation similar to [[prophecy]] or a type of [[discernment]].&lt;ref name=NIDPCMCKnowledgeTradition/&gt;
