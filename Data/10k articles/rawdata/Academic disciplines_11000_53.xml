[[File:Illustration of A weighting.ogv|thumb|400px|right|Video illustrating A-weighting by analyzing a sine sweep (contains audio)]]

'''A-weighting''' is the most commonly used of a family of curves defined in the International standard [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61672:2003 and various national standards relating to the measurement of [[sound pressure level]]. A-weighting is applied to instrument-measured sound levels in an effort to account for the relative [[loudness]] perceived by the human ear, as the ear is less sensitive to low audio frequencies.  It is employed by arithmetically adding a table of values, listed by [[octave band|octave]] or third-octave bands, to the measured sound pressure levels in [[Decibel|dB]]. The resulting octave band measurements are usually added (logarithmic method) to provide a single A-weighted value describing the sound; the units are written as dB(A).  Other weighting sets of values – B, C, D and now Z – are discussed below.

The curves were originally defined for use at different average sound levels, but A-weighting, though originally intended only for the measurement of low-level sounds (around 40 [[phon]]), is now commonly used for the measurement of [[environmental noise]] and [[industrial noise]], as well as when assessing potential [[Noise-induced hearing loss|hearing damage]] and other [[noise health effects]] at all sound levels; indeed, the use of A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for all these measurements, because decades of field experience have shown a very good correlation with occupational deafness in the frequency range of human speech. It is also used when measuring low-level noise in audio equipment, especially in the United States.{{Citation needed lead|date=July 2010}} In Britain, Europe and many other parts of the world, broadcasters and audio engineers{{Who|date=July 2010}} more often use the [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]], which was developed in the 1960s based on research by the [[BBC]] and other organizations.  This research showed that our ears respond differently to random noise, and the equal-loudness curves on which the A, B and C weightings were based are really only valid for pure single tones.{{citation needed lead|date=July 2012}}

== History ==

A-weighting began with work by [[Fletcher–Munson curves|Fletcher and Munson]] which resulted in their publication, in 1933, of a set of [[equal-loudness contours]]. Three years later these curves were used in the first American standard for [[sound level meter]]s.&lt;ref name=Pierre&gt;{{citation |url= http://storeycountywindfarms.org/ref3_Impact_Sound_Pressure.pdf |author=Richard L. St. Pierre, Jr. and Daniel J. Maguire |title=The Impact of A-weighting Sound Pressure Level Measurements during the Evaluation of Noise Exposure |date=July 2004 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[ANSI]] standard, later revised as ANSI S1.4-1981, incorporated B-weighting as well as the A-weighting curve, recognising the unsuitability of the latter for anything other than low-level measurements. But B-weighting has since fallen into disuse. Later work, first by Zwicker and then by Schomer, attempted to overcome the difficulty posed by different levels, and work by the BBC resulted in the CCIR-468 weighting, currently maintained as ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which gives more representative readings on noise as opposed to pure tones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Deficiencies ==
A-weighting is valid to represent the sensitivity of the human ear as a function of the frequency of pure tones, but only for relatively quiet levels of sound. In effect, the A-weighting is based on the 40-phon [[Fletcher–Munson curves]] which represented an early determination of the [[equal-loudness contour]] for human hearing. However, because decades of field experience have shown a very good correlation between the A scale and occupational deafness in the frequency range of human speech, this scale is employed in many juridictions to evaluate the risks of occupational deafness and other auditory problems related to signals or speech intelligibility in noisy environnements. 

Because of perceived discrepancies between early and more recent determinations, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) recently revised its standard curves as defined in ISO 226, in response to the recommendations of a study coordinated by the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies, by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and USA. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.) This has resulted in the recent acceptance of a new set of curves standardized as ISO 226:2003. The report comments on the surprisingly large differences, and the fact that the original Fletcher–Munson contours are in better agreement with recent results than the Robinson-Dadson, which appear to differ by as much as 10–15&amp;nbsp;dB especially in the low-frequency region, for reasons that are not explained. Fortuitously, the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curve is particularly close to the modern ISO 226:2003 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nedo.go.jp/itd/grant-e/report/00pdf/is-01e.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210848/http://www.nedo.go.jp/itd/grant-e/report/00pdf/is-01e.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |title=Precise and Full-range Determination of Two-dimensional Equal Loudness Contours}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it will be noted that A-weighting would be a better match to the loudness curve if it fell much more steeply above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz, and it is likely that this compromise came about because steep filters were difficult to construct in the early days of electronics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Nowadays, no such limitation need exist, as demonstrated by the ITU-R 468 curve. If A-weighting is used without further band-limiting it is possible to obtain different readings on different instruments when ultrasonic, or near ultrasonic noise is present. Accurate measurements therefore require a 20&amp;nbsp;kHz low-pass filter to be combined with the A-weighting curve in modern instruments. This is defined in IEC 61012 as AU weighting and while very desirable, is rarely fitted to commercial sound level meters.

{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

A-frequency-weighting is mandated by the international standard IEC 61672 to be fitted to all sound level meters. The old B- and D-frequency-weightings have fallen into disuse, but many sound level meters provide for C frequency-weighting and its fitting is mandated &amp;mdash; at least for testing purposes &amp;mdash; to precision (Class one) sound level meters. D-frequency-weighting was specifically designed for use when measuring high level aircraft noise in accordance with the [[IEC 537]] measurement standard. The large peak in the D-weighting curve is not a feature of the equal-loudness contours, but reflects the fact that humans hear random noise differently from pure tones, an effect that is particularly pronounced around 6&amp;nbsp;kHz. This is because individual neurons from different regions of the [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]] respond to narrow bands of frequencies, but the higher frequency neurons integrate a wider band and hence signal a louder sound when presented with noise containing many frequencies than for a single pure tone of the same pressure level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Following changes to the ISO standard, D-frequency-weighting should now only be used for non-bypass engines and as these are not fitted to commercial aircraft &amp;mdash; but only to military ones &amp;mdash; A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for light civilian aircraft measurements, while a more accurate loudness-corrected weighting [[EPNdB]] is required for certification of large transport aircraft&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icao.int/Meetings/EnvironmentalWorkshops/Documents/NoiseCertificationWorkshop-2004/BIP_2_2_jb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Z- or ZERO frequency-weighting was introduced in the International Standard IEC 61672 in 2003 and was intended to replace the "Flat" or "Linear" frequency weighting often fitted by manufacturers. This change was needed as each sound level meter manufacturer could choose their own low and high frequency cut-offs (&amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;dB) points, resulting in different readings, especially when peak sound level was being measured. As well, the C-frequency-weighting, with &amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;dB points at 31.5&amp;nbsp;Hz and 8&amp;nbsp;kHz did not have a sufficient bandpass to allow the sensibly correct measurement of true peak noise (Lpk)

B- and D-frequency-weightings are no longer described in the body of the standard IEC 61672 : 2003, but their frequency responses can be found in the older IEC 60651, although that has been formally withdrawn by the International Electro-technical Commission in favour of IEC 61672 : 2003. The frequency weighting tolerances in IEC 61672 have been tightened over those in the earlier standards IEC 179 and IEC 60651 and thus instruments complying with the earlier specifications should no longer be used for legally required measurements.

== Environmental and other noise measurements ==
[[File:Atlas Copco XAHS 347-pic7-Max. sound power level.jpg|thumb|100px|Label related to a portable air compressor]]
A-weighted [[decibel]]s are abbreviated '''dB(A)''' or '''dBA.''' When acoustic (calibrated microphone) measurements are being referred to, then the units used will be [[decibel|dB]] [[sound pressure level|SPL]] referenced to
20 micropascals = 0&amp;nbsp;dB SPL. '''[[dBrn]] adjusted''' is not a synonym for dBA, but for dBa (in telecommunications dBa denotes "decibels adjusted" i.e. weighted absolute noise power, which has nothing to do with A-weighting).

The A-weighting curve has been widely adopted for [[environmental noise]] measurement, and is standard in many sound level meters. The A-weighting system is used in any measurement of environmental noise (examples of which include [[roadway noise]], rail noise, [[aircraft noise]]). A-weighting is also in common use for assessing potential [[Hearing impairment|hearing damage]] caused by loud noise.

A-weighted SPL measurements of noise level are increasingly found on sales literature for domestic appliances such as refrigerators, freezers and computer fans. In Europe, the A-weighted noise level is used for instance for normalizing the noise of tires on cars.

The A-weighting is also used for [[Noise dosimeter|noise dose]] measurements at work. A noise level of more than 85 dB(A) each day increases the risk factor for [[hearing damage]]. 

Noise exposure for visitors of venues with loud music is usually also expressed in dB(A), although the presence of high levels of low frequency noise does not justify this.

== Audio reproduction and broadcasting equipment ==

Although the A-weighting curve, in widespread use for [[noise measurement]], is said to have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title=Researches in loudness measurement |doi=10.1109/TAU.1966.1161864}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of spectral content, each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by [[Human brain|the brain]] to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz and a downward tilt below 1&amp;nbsp;kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.

This enhanced sensitivity to noise in the region of 6&amp;nbsp;kHz became particularly apparent in the late 1960s with the introduction of [[compact cassette]] recorders and [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby-B noise reduction]]. A-weighted noise measurements were found to give misleading results because they did not give sufficient prominence to the 6&amp;nbsp;kHz region where the noise reduction was having greatest effect, and did not sufficiently attenuate noise around 10&amp;nbsp;kHz and above (a particular example is with the 19&amp;nbsp;kHz pilot tone on FM radio systems which, though usually inaudible is not sufficiently attenuated by A-weighting, so that sometimes one piece of equipment would even measure worse than another and yet sound better, because of differing spectral content.

[[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness of all types of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the [[BBC]] Research Department, and was standardised by the [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] and later adopted by many other standards bodies ([[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]], [[British Standards Institution|BSI]]) and, {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, is maintained by the ITU. It became widely used in Europe, especially in broadcasting, and was adopted by [[Dolby Laboratories]] who realised its superior validity for their purposes when measuring noise on film soundtracks and compact cassette systems. Its advantages over A-weighting are less accepted in the US, where the use of A-weighting still predominates.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It is used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.

== Function realisation of some common weightings ==
The standard&lt;ref name="IEC61672"&gt;{{cite book|title=IEC 61672-1:2013 Electroacoustics - Sound level meters - Part 1: Specifications|date=2013|publisher=IEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines weightings (&lt;math&gt;A(f),C(f)&lt;/math&gt;) in dB units by tables with tolerance limits (to allow a variety of implementations). Additionally the underlying weighting functions &lt;math&gt;R_X(f)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="IEC61672" /&gt; to calculate the weightings are described in the standard. The weighting function &lt;math&gt;R_X(f)&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the amplitude spectrum (not the intensity spectrum) of the unweighted sound level. Appropriate weighting functions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cross-spectrum.com/audio/weighting.html |title=Frequency weighting equations |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xZXWNqVh?url=http://www.cross-spectrum.com/audio/weighting.html |archivedate=2011-03-30 |publisher=Cross Spectrum |year=2004 |deadurl=no |df= }}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offsets (approximately −2.0, −0.17 and −0.06 for A, B and C, respectively) ensure the normalisation to 0&amp;nbsp;dB at 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz. Precisely, the respective offset values are 
&lt;math&gt;20\log_{10}\left(R_A(1000)\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;20\log_{10}\left(R_B(1000)\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;20\log_{10}\left(R_C(1000)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

They are not defined in this way though, being defined by tables of values with tolerances in the standards documents, thus allowing different realisations:{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===A===

:&lt;math&gt;H_A(s)= {k_A \cdot s^4\over(s+129.4)^2\quad(s+676.7)\quad (s+4636)\quad (s+76655)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

k&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 7.39705&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

===B===
:&lt;math&gt;H_B(s)= {k_B \cdot s^3\over(s+129.4)^2\quad (s+995.9)\quad (s+76655)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 5.99185&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

===C===
:&lt;math&gt;H_C(s)= {k_C \cdot s^2\over(s+129.4)^2\quad (s+76655)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

k&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 5.91797&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

===D===
:&lt;math&gt;H_D(s)= {k_D \cdot s \cdot (s^2 + 6532 s + 4.0975 \times 10^7)\over(s+1776.3)\quad (s+7288.5)\quad (s^2 + 21514 s + 3.8836 \times 10^8)}&lt;/math&gt;

k&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 91104.32

The ''k'' values are constants which are used to normalize the function to a gain of 1 (0&amp;nbsp;dB). The values listed above normalize the functions to 0&amp;nbsp;dB at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, as they are typically used. (This normalization is shown in the image.)

'''Apple University''' is a [[training]] facility of [[Apple Inc.]], located in [[Cupertino, California]]. This [[corporate university]] was designed to instruct personnel employed by Apple in the various aspects of Apple's technology and corporate culture.

==History==
[[Steve Jobs]] established Apple University in 2008 as a way to inculcate employees into Apple’s business culture and educate them about its history, particularly as the company grew. The program was devised by Joel Podolny, then the dean of Yale School of Management. Jobs selected him when the program was founded, and Podolny remains head of the program and effectively serves as dean of the university. He also is a vice president at Apple.&lt;ref name="peterburrows"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal-training-program-.html New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses are not required, only recommended. Employees sign up for courses tailored to their positions and backgrounds on an internal website available only to Apple staff members.

It is highly secretive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/11/apple-university-employees-staff-steve-jobs|title=Apple University: where employees are not born, but made|author=Samuel Gibbs|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely written about.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Employees are strongly discouraged from talking about the company in general, including Apple University. No pictures of the classrooms have surfaced publicly.

Apple has strenuously pursued the vision that function and beauty come from simplicity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-university-preaches-mantra-of-simplicity-to-employees/|title=Apple University preaches mantra of simplicity to employees|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teachers in its internal training program sometimes point to a collection of Picasso lithographs that illustrate the drive to boil down ideas to their most essential components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/10/5989837/at-apple-university-studying-picasso-helps-with-product-design|title=At Apple University, studying Picasso helps with product design|author=Sam Byford|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic staff and instructors==
The full-time members of the faculty design and teach the courses. Faculty members include professors from universities like [[Yale]]; [[Harvard]]; the [[University of California-Berkeley]]; [[Stanford]]; and [[M.I.T.]] Some of the faculty continue to hold positions at their universities while also working for Apple.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2013/02/13/apple-university-hires-another-high-profile-academic/|title=Apple University hires another high-profile academic|work=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instructors include:
*[[Tim Cook]], CEO.&lt;ref name="peterburrows"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-13/why-apple-university-matters-more-than-ever|title=Why Apple University Matters More Than Ever|author=Peter Burrows|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Joel Podolny]], formerly the dean of Yale School of Management &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stxavier.org/page.cfm?p=1&amp;newsid=2947|title=The Jesuit High School in Cincinnati: Keeper of the Apple Culture|work=stxavier.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Richard S. Tedlow|Richard Tedlow]], a Harvard University business historian.&lt;ref name="peterburrows"/&gt;
*Randy Nelson who came from the animation studios Pixar&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal-training-program-.html&lt;/ref&gt; and DreamWorks Animation
*[[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], a Stanford professor&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;
*Morten Hansen, of Berkeley &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Courses==
Some of the courses teach case studies about important business decisions that Apple made. These strategic decisions include the one to make the iPod and its iTunes software compatible with Microsoft’s Windows system. This was a topic of fierce debate internally at Apple with Steve Jobs strongly opposing the notion of sharing the iPod with Windows. Jobs eventually gave in to his lieutenants. It turned out that opening the iPod to Windows users led to explosive growth of the music player and the iTunes Store, and this in turn would later be critical to the success of the iPhone.

''' “Communicating at Apple.” ''' This course focuses on clear communication for making products intuitive, sharing ideas within Apple, and marketing products.

''' “Project Management.” ''' No information provided, Course is confidential

''' “Vendor Management.” '''

'''“What Makes Apple, Apple.”''' Focuses on one of Jobs's goals: to make complex computer technologies feel understandable and natural. In the course an instructor showed a slide of the remote control for the Google TV. The remote had 78 buttons. Then the instructor, Nelson, showed a photo of the Apple TV remote, a thin rod with three buttons.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Campus==
The classes are taught on Apple’s corporate campus in Cupertino, California. Apple University is in a section of buildings called City Center. The rooms are built in a trapezoid shape. Occasionally, classes are offered in Apple’s offices overseas, and the professors travel there to teach.

In 2014, Apple planned an expansion of Apple University to China, to include a Dean to run Apple University China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/03/apple-plans-apple-university-in-china-bringing-jobs-vision-to-asia/|title=Apple plans Apple University in China, bringing Jobs’ vision to Asia|work=9to5Mac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 6 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Two men argue at a political protest in [[New York City]].]]
Whereas formal arguments are static, such as one might find in a textbook or research article, '''argumentative dialogue''' is dynamic. It serves as a published record of justification for an [[logical assertion|assertion]].  Arguments can also be interactive, in which the proposer and the interlocutor have a more symmetrical relationship.  The [[premise]]s are discussed, as well the validity of the intermediate [[inference]]s.  For example, consider the following exchange, illustrated by the [[No true Scotsman]] fallacy:

: Argument: "No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge."
: Reply: "But my friend Angus likes sugar with his porridge." 
: Rebuttal: "Ah yes, but no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge." 

In this dialogue, the proposer first offers a premise, the premise is challenged by the interlocutor, and finally the proposer offers a modification of the premise. This exchange could be part of a larger discussion, for example a murder trial, in which the defendant is a Scotsman, and it had been established earlier that the murderer was eating sugared porridge when he or she committed the murder. 

In argumentative dialogue, the rules of interaction may be negotiated by the parties to the dialogue, although in many cases the rules are already determined by social [[mores]].  In the most symmetrical case, argumentative dialogue can be regarded as a process of discovery more than one of justification of a conclusion.  Ideally, the goal of argumentative dialogue is for participants to arrive jointly at a conclusion by mutually accepted inferences.  In some cases however, the validity of the conclusion is secondary. For example; emotional outlet, scoring points with an audience, wearing down an opponent or lowering the sale price of an item may instead be the actual goals of the dialogue. Walton distinguishes several types of argumentative dialogue which illustrate these various goals:
* Personal quarrel
* Forensic debate
* Persuasion dialogue
* Bargaining dialogue
* Action seeking dialogue
* Educational dialogue

Van Eemeren and Grootendorst identify various stages of argumentative dialogue. These stages can be regarded as an argument protocol. In a somewhat loose interpretation, the stages are as follows:

* Confrontation: Presentation of the problem, such as a debate question or a political disagreement
* Opening: Agreement on rules, such as for example, how evidence is to be presented, which sources of facts are to be used, how to handle divergent interpretations, determination of closing conditions.
* [[Argumentation]]: Application of logical principles according to the agreed-upon rules
* Closing: This occurs when the termination conditions are met. Among these could be for example, a time limitation or the determination of an arbiter.

Van Eemeren and Grootendorst provide a detailed list of rules that must be applied at each stage of the protocol.  Moreover, in the account of argumentation given by these authors, there are specified roles of protagonist and antagonist in the protocol which are determined by the conditions which set up the need for argument.

Many cases of argument are highly unsymmetrical, although in some sense they are dialogues. A particularly important case of this is [[political argument]].

Much of the recent work on argument theory has considered argumentation as an integral part of language and perhaps the most important function of language ([[Paul Grice|Grice]], [[John Searle|Searle]], [[J. L. Austin|Austin]], [[Karl Popper|Popper]]). This tendency has moved [[argumentation theory]] away from the realm of pure formal logic.

One of the original contributors to this trend is the philosopher [[Chaim Perelman]], who together with [[Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca]] introduced the French term ''La nouvelle rhetorique'' in 1958 to describe an approach to argument which is not reduced to application of formal rules of inference.  Perelman's view of argumentation is much closer to a [[juridical]] one, in which rules for presenting evidence and rebuttals play an important role.  Though this would apparently invalidate [[semantic]] concepts of truth, this approach seems useful in situations in which the possibility of reasoning within some commonly accepted model does not exist or this possibility has broken down because of ideological conflict.  Retaining the notion enunciated in the introduction to this article that ''logic'' usually refers to the structure of argument, we can regard the logic of rhetoric as a set of protocols for argumentation.

{{About|the scale for measuring shoreline exposure|other uses of Ballantine|Ballantine (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Seepocken&amp;Miesmuscheln Galicien2005.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Semibalanus balanoides]], a species of [[Sessilia|acorn barnacle]], Ballantine's main indicator of a medium exposure in the mid-[[littoral]] zone.]]

The '''Ballantine scale''' is a biologically defined scale for measuring the degree of exposure level of wave action on a [[rocky shore]]. Devised in 1961 by W. J. Ballantine, then at the zoology department of [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]], [[London]], the scale is based on the observation that where shoreline species are concerned "Different species growing on rocky shores require different degrees of protection from certain aspects of the physical environment, of which wave action is often the most important." The species present in the [[littoral zone]] therefore indicate the degree of the shore's exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Ballantine (1961), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
An abbreviated summary of the scale is given below. The scale runs from 1) an "extremely exposed" shore, to 8) an "extremely sheltered" shore. The [[littoral zone]] generally is the zone between low and high tides. The supra-littoral is above the [[barnacle]] line.

== Modifications to the scale ==
A modified exposure scale of five stages applying to the shores of the British Isles is given by Lewis (1964):&lt;ref name="Lewis 64"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=J R|date=1964|title=The Ecology of Rocky Shores|publisher=The English Universities Press|location=London|isbn=0-340-21360-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Very exposed shores" have a wide Verrucaria zone entirely above the upper tide level, a Porphyra zone above the barnacle level and [[Lichina pygmaea]] is locally abundant. The eu-littoral zone is dominated by [[barnacle]]s and [[limpet]]s with a coralline belt in the very low littoral along with other Rhodophyta and Alaria in the upper sub-littoral.
#"Exposed shores" show a Verrucaria belt mainly above the high tide, with [[Porphyra]] and Lichina pygmaea. The mid shore is dominated by barnacles, limpets and some [[Fucus]]. Some [[Rhodophyta]]. Himanthalia and some Rhodophyta such as [[Mastocarpus]] and [[Corallina]] are found in the low littoral with Himanthalia, Alari and Laminaria digitata dominant in the upper sub-littoral.
#"Semi-exposed shores" show a Verrucaria belt just above high tide with clear [[Pelvetia]] in the upper-littoral and [[Fucus serratus]] in the lower-littoral. Limpets, barnacles and short [[Fucus vesiculosus]] mid-shore. Fucus serratus with Rhodophyta, ([[Laurencia]], [[Mastocarpus stellatus]], [[Rhodymenia]] and [[Lomentaria]]). Laminaria  and [[Saccorhiza polyschides]] and small algae common in the sub-littoral.
#"Sheltered shores" show a narrow Verrucaria zone at high water and a full sequence of fucoids: Pelvetia, [[Fucus spiralis]], Fucus vesiculosus, Fucus serratus, [[Ascophyllum nodosum]]. Laminaria digitata is dominant the upper sublittoral.
#"Very sheltered shores" show a very narrow zone of Verrucaria, the dominance of the littoral by a full sequence of the fucoids and Ascophyllum covering the rocks. [[Laminaria saccharina]], [[Halidrys]], [[Chondrus]] and or [[Furcellaria]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">In [[music]] of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras, a '''bicinium''' (pl. '''bicinia''') was a composition for only two parts, especially one for the purpose of teaching [[counterpoint]] or singing.

The term has had two usages in music history:

# Recently, the term has come to mean any composition at all from the Renaissance or early Baroque period for two vocal or instrumental parts.
# Historically, a bicinium referred specifically to a two-part composition used as a teaching tool, most often in [[Protestant]], [[German language|German]]-speaking areas.

The term was first used in [[Poland]], by [[Jan z Lublina]] in a treatise of 1540.  Volumes of bicinia were published in the next several decades in [[Germany]], the [[Low Countries]], and even in [[Italy]], as the usefulness of bicinia as teaching aids became apparent.  In addition, [[Martin Luther]] had strongly expressed that children should learn both music, and the [[psalm]]s: bicinia with German texts from the Psalms fulfilled his purpose.

Students could be expected to master singing a single part in a [[duet (music)|duet]] more easily than a part in a larger ensemble.  Usually a bicinium was designed to be sung or played by students of the same age and ability, rather than for a single student and a teacher.

This model of moving from two-part study, writing, and singing to three parts and then more was adopted by [[Heinrich Glarean]] in his ''Dodecachordon'' (1547), one of the most influential [[music theory]] and pedagogy treatises of the Renaissance.

In a similar manner, present-day music students typically learn [[counterpoint]] first by writing in two parts, and then later in three, only moving to four or more parts after mastering the earlier stages.

A similar pedagogical composition for three voices is known as a '''tricinium''' (pl. '''tricinia''').

'''Bohemian glass''', chiefly referred to as '''Bohemia crystal''', is [[glass]] produced in the regions of [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], now parts of the [[Czech Republic]]. It has a centuries long history of being internationally recognised for its high quality, craftsmanship, beauty and often innovative designs. Hand-cut, engraved, blown and painted decorative glassware ranging from champagne flutes to enormous chandeliers, ornaments, figurines and other glass items are among the best known Czech exports and immensely popular as tourist souvenirs. The Czech Republic is home to numerous glass studios and schools attended by local and foreign students.

Oldest archaeological excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the [[Lusatian Mountains]] of Northern Bohemia. Most notable Czech sites of glass-making throughout the ages are [[Skalice u České Lípy|Skalice]] ({{lang-de|Langenau}}), [[Jablonec nad Nisou]], [[Železný Brod]], [[Poděbrady]], [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Kamenický Šenov]] ({{lang-de|Steinschönau}}) and [[Nový Bor]] ({{lang-de|Haida}}). Several of these towns have their own glass museums with many items dating since around 1600. Jablonec nad Nisou in particular is famous for the local tradition of manufacturing glass costume jewellery. Its long history is documented by large collections in the Museum of Glass and Jewellery in Jablonec nad Nisou.

==Crystal vs. glass==
The meaning of crystal versus glass changes according to the country. The word "crystal" means, in most of the western world, the presence of [[lead]]. In the [[European Union]], labeling of "crystal" products is regulated by Council Directive 69/493/EEC, which defines four categories, depending on the chemical composition and properties of the material. Only glass products containing at least 24% of lead oxide may be referred to as "lead crystal". Products with less lead oxide, or glass products with other metal oxides used in place of lead oxide, must be labeled "crystallin" or "crystal glass".&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/;ELX_SESSIONID=l2btJx1QfVjGS26hd7RQHJT2pC6jtyHh219TZXbGQ3pPJZrSf8dP!-2071614142?uri=CELEX:31969L0493&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States it is the opposite - glass is defined as "crystal" if it contains only 1% lead. In the Czech Republic, the term "crystal" is used for any exquisite, high quality glass. Leaded crystal means crystal containing more than 24% lead oxide.

The presence of lead in crystal softens the glass and makes it more accessible for cutting and engraving. Lead increases the weight of the glass and causes the glass to diffract light. Glass can contain up to 40% lead, if maximum hardness is desired. On the other hand, crystal can contain less than 24% lead if it has a high proportion of barium oxide, which ensures high quality light diffraction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecrystal.cz/en/czech-crystal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Bohemia]], a part of the Czech Republic (formerly part of [[Czechoslovakia]], formerly part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], originally part of [[Czech Kingdom]] or [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]), became famous for its beautiful and colourful glass during the [[Renaissance]]. The history of Bohemian glass started with the abundant natural resources found in the countryside.

Bohemian glass-workers discovered [[potash]] combined with chalk created a clear colourless glass that was more stable than glass from Italy. In the 16th century the term Bohemian crystal was used for the first time to distinguish its qualities from glass made elsewhere. This glass contained no lead as is commonly suspected. This Czech glass could be cut with a wheel. In addition, resources such as wood for firing the kilns and for burning down to ashes were used to create [[potash]]. There were also copious amounts of [[limestone]] and [[silica]]. In the 17th century, [[Caspar Lehmann]], [[Gemstone|gem]] cutter to [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with [[copper]] and [[bronze]] wheels. During the era, the Czech lands became the dominant producer of decorative glassware and the local manufacture of glass earned international reputation in high [[Baroque]] style from 1685 to 1750.

Czech glassware became as prestigious as jewellery and was sought-after by the wealthy and the aristocracy of the time. Czech crystal chandeliers could be found in the palaces of the French king [[Louis XV]], [[Maria Theresa]], Empress of Austria, and  [[Elizabeth of Russia]].

Bohemia turned out expert craftsmen who artfully worked with crystal. Bohemian crystal became famous for its excellent cut and engraving. They became skilled teachers of glass-making in neighbouring and distant countries. By the middle of the 19th century, a technical glass-making school system was created that encouraged traditional and innovative techniques as well as thorough technical preparation.

In the second half of the 19th century, Bohemia looked to the export trade and mass-produced coloured glass that was exported all over the world. Pairs of vases were produced either in a single colour of opaque glass or in two-colour cased glass. These were decorated in thickly enamelled flower subjects that were painted with great speed. Others were decorated with coloured lithographic prints copying famous paintings. These glass objects were made in huge quantities in large factories and were available by mail order throughout Europe and America. Many of them were not fine art but provided inexpensive decorative objects to brighten up ordinary homes. [[Reverse glass painting]] was also a Czech specialty. The image is carefully painted by hand on the back of a pane of glass, using a variety of techniques and materials, after which the painting is mounted in a bevelled wooden frame.

Glass [[artisan]]ship remained at a high level even under the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Communists]] because it was considered ideologically innocuous and it helped promote the good name of the country. Czech glass designers and manufacturers enjoyed international recognition and Czech glassware including art works such as sculptures was displayed and awarded in many international exhibitions, most notably in [[Expo 58]] world fair in [[Brussels]] and in [[Expo 67]] in [[Montréal]].

Today, Czech crystal chandeliers hang, for example, in [[Milan]]'s [[La Scala]], in [[Rome]]'s [[Teatro dell'Opera]], in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]] or in the royal palace in [[Riyadh]]. Various sorts of glassware, art glass, ornaments, figurines, costume jewellery, beads and others also remain internationally valued.

One of the glass items for which the Czech nation is still well known is the production of "druk" beads. Druks are small (3mm-18mm) round glass beads with small threading holes produced in a wide variety of colors and finishes and used mainly as spacers among beaded jewellery makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Carl J. Hudecek''' (born December 3, 1934) is an American, internationally known expert on [[glass-to-metal seal|sealing glasses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Techneglas maintains cutting edge in glass technology |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5333/is_199811/ai_n21433307/ |work=Toledo Business Journal |date=November 1, 1998 |accessdate=July 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[expansion joint|metal expansion and contraction]], and [[oxidation state|metal oxidation]] processes for glass sealing. Hudecek holds or co-holds many U.S. and international patents in sealing glasses, television picture [[vacuum tube|tube]] materials and processing, and sealing [[alloy]]s.

Hudecek was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} He is from [[Perrysburg, Ohio]] and graduated from the [[University of Toledo]].&lt;ref name=ACBL&gt;{{cite book |author=[[American Contract Bridge League]]|title=The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge (5th Edition)|page=651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of his working career was spent at [[Owens-Illinois]] Glass Company in Toledo, where he was chief physicist and laboratory manager. Hudecek was one of the U.S. pioneers in designing and installing [[turnkey]] [[manufacturing operations]] for sealing glasses in Russia and Germany. Through his consulting company, [[Perrysburg, Ohio|Perrysburg]], Ohio-based Bridgecon Services, Hudecek consults in the area of sealing glasses. He has also taught courses on sealing and joining at [[Rutgers University]] and [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|Missouri School of Mines]].

In addition, Hudecek is an expert at the game of [[contract bridge]]. He won the national [[American Contract Bridge League]] [[Nail Life Master Open Pairs|Life Master Open Pairs]] championship in 1966, partnered by Ray Zoller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bridge:; Ohio Partnership Wins Life Master Men's Pairs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/11/24/archives/bridge-ohio-partnership-wins-life-master-mens-pairs.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 24, 1966 |accessdate=July 31, 2009 | first=Alan | last=Truscott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudecek has been a member of the panel of experts for ''[[The Bridge World]]'' magazine for more than 45 years and has written many bridge articles and commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d%3Dtbw_extra%26f%3Darchive_edition008.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019001632/http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d=tbw_extra&amp;f=archive_edition008.html |archivedate=2007-10-19 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;!--served as file archive_edition008.html but appears to be current; e.g. the current bidding contest--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In [[developmental biology]], '''cellular  differentiation''' is the process where a [[cell (biology)|cell]] changes from one [[cell type]] to another.&lt;ref&gt;Slack, J.M.W. (2013) Essential Developmental Biology. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slack | first1 = J.M.W. | year = 2007 | title = Metaplasia and transdifferentiation: from pure biology to the clinic | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 369–378 | doi=10.1038/nrm2146 | pmid=17377526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly the cell changes to a more specialized type. Differentiation occurs numerous times during the development of a [[multicellular organism]] as it changes from a simple [[zygote]] to a complex system of [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and cell types.  Differentiation continues in adulthood as [[adult stem cell]]s divide and create fully differentiated [[Cell division|daughter cells]] during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover.  Some differentiation occurs in response to [[antigen]] exposure. Differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, [[membrane potential]], [[metabolism|metabolic activity]], and responsiveness to signals.  These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in [[gene expression]] and are the study of [[epigenetics]].  With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the [[DNA]] sequence itself.  Thus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same [[genome]].

A specialized type of differentiation, known as 'terminal differentiation', is of importance in some tissues, for example vertebrate nervous system, striated muscle, epidermis and gut. During terminal differentiation a precursor cell formerly capable of cell division, permanently leaves the cell cycle, dismantles the cell cycle machinery and often expresses a range of genes characteristic of the cell's final function (e.g. myosin and actin for a muscle cell).  Differentiation may continue to occur after terminal differentiation if the capacity and functions of the cell undergo further changes.

Among dividing cells, there are multiple levels of [[cell potency]], the cell's ability to differentiate into other cell types. A greater potency indicates a larger number of cell types that can be derived. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types, including the placental tissue, is known as ''[[totipotent]]''.  In mammals, only the zygote and subsequent [[blastomere]]s are totipotent, while in plants many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory techniques. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types of the adult organism is known as ''[[pluripotent]]''.  Such cells are called [[meristem|meristematic cells]] in higher plants and [[embryonic stem cell]]s in animals, though some groups report the presence of adult pluripotent cells. Virally induced expression of four transcription factors [[Oct4]], [[Sox2]], [[c-Myc]], and [[KIF4]] ([[Yamanaka factors]]) is sufficient to create pluripotent (iPS) cells from adult fibroblasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 16904174|year= 2006|author1= Takahashi|first1= K|title= Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors|journal= Cell|volume= 126|issue= 4|pages= 663–76|last2= Yamanaka|first2= S|doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[multipotent]] cell is one that can differentiate into multiple different, but closely related cell types.&lt;ref name=Schoeler&gt;{{cite book |title=Humanbiotechnology as Social Challenge |editor1=Nikolaus Knoepffler |editor2=Dagmar Schipanski |editor3=Stefan Lorenz Sorgner |page=28 |chapter=The Potential of Stem Cells: An Inventory |author=Schöler, Hans R. |publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7546-5755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cell potency#Oligopotent|Oligopotent cells]] are more restricted than multipotent, but can still differentiate into a few closely related cell types.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt; Finally, [[unipotent]] cells can differentiate into only one cell type, but are capable of self-renewal.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt;  In [[cytopathology]], the level of cellular differentiation is used as a measure of [[cancer]] progression.  "[[Grading (tumors)|Grade]]" is a marker of how differentiated a cell in a tumor is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=46445|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mammalian cell types==
{{see also|List of distinct cell types in the adult human body}}

Three basic categories of cells make up the mammalian body: [[germ cell]]s, [[somatic cell]]s, and [[stem cell]]s. Each of the approximately 37.2 trillion (3.72x10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;) cells in an adult human has its own copy or copies of the [[genome]] except certain cell types, such as [[red blood cell]]s, that lack nuclei in their fully differentiated state. Most cells are [[diploid]]; they have two copies of each [[chromosome]]. Such cells, called somatic cells, make up most of the human body, such as skin and muscle cells. Cells differentiate to specialize for different functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Molecular Cell Biology|last = Lodish|first = Harvey|publisher = New York: W. H. Freeman|year = 2000|isbn = 0-7167-3136-3|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21618/|edition = 4th|at = Section 14.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germ line cells are any line of cells that give rise to [[gametes]]&amp;mdash;eggs and sperm&amp;mdash;and thus are continuous through the generations. Stem cells, on the other hand, have the ability to divide for indefinite periods and to give rise to specialized cells. They are best described in the context of normal human development.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} 
            
Development begins when a [[sperm]] fertilizes an [[egg (biology)|egg]] and creates a single cell that has the potential to form an entire organism. In the first hours after fertilization, this cell divides into identical cells. In humans, approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles of cell division, these cells begin to specialize, forming a hollow sphere of cells, called a [[blastocyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blastocyst has an outer layer of cells, and inside this hollow sphere, there is a cluster of cells called the [[inner cell mass]]. The cells of the inner cell mass go on to form virtually all of the tissues of the human body. Although the cells of the inner cell mass can form virtually every type of cell found in the human body, they cannot form an organism. These cells are referred to as [[pluripotent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Neuroscience|last = D.

The ectoderm ends up forming the skin and the nervous system, the mesoderm forms the bones and muscular tissue, and the endoderm forms the internal organ tissues.

==Dedifferentiation==

Dedifferentiation, or integration is a cellular process often seen in more [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] life forms such as [[worm]]s and [[amphibian]]s in which a partially or terminally differentiated cell reverts to an earlier developmental stage, usually as part of a [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] process.&lt;ref name="dediff1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stocum DL |title=Amphibian regeneration and stem cells |journal=Curr.

==Mechanisms==
[[Image:Cell Differentiation.jpg|400px|thumbnail|Mechanisms of cellular differentiation.]]
Each specialized [[cell type]] in an organism [[Gene expression|expresses]] a [[subset]] of all the [[gene]]s that constitute the [[genome]] of that [[species]]. Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of [[regulation of gene expression|regulated gene expression]]. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a [[gene regulatory network]].  A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network.&lt;ref name=DeLeon&gt;{{cite journal

In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause.

[[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|thumb|left|240px|An overview of major signal transduction pathways.]] 
A few [[evolution]]arily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve [[cell signaling]]. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called [[growth factor]]s. Although the details of specific [[signal transduction]] pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps.  A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor.  The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity.  The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them.  A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book |author=Knisely, Karen |author2=Gilbert, Scott F. |title=Developmental Biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2009 |page=147 |isbn=0-87893-371-9 |edition=8th }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cells and tissues can vary in competence, their ability to respond to external signals.&lt;ref name=Rudel&gt;Rudel and Sommer; The evolution of developmental mechanisms.

Other important mechanisms fall under the category of [[asymmetric cell division]]s, divisions that give rise to daughter cells with distinct developmental fates. Asymmetric cell divisions can occur because of asymmetrically expressed maternal '''cytoplasmic determinants''' or because of signaling.&lt;ref name=Rudel/&gt; In the former mechanism, distinct daughter cells are created during [[cytokinesis]] because of an uneven distribution of regulatory molecules in the parent cell; the distinct cytoplasm that each daughter cell inherits results in a distinct pattern of differentiation for each daughter cell. A well-studied example of pattern formation by asymmetric divisions is [[Drosophila embryogenesis#Anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila|body axis patterning in Drosophila]]. [[RNA]] molecules are an important type of intracellular differentiation control signal.

===Epigenetic control===
{{Main|Epigenetics in stem cell differentiation}}

Since each cell, regardless of cell type, possesses the same [[genome]], determination of cell type must occur at the level of [[gene]] expression. While the [[regulation of gene expression]] can occur through [[Cis-regulatory element|cis-]] and [[trans-regulatory element]]s including a gene's [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], the problem arises as to how this expression pattern is maintained over numerous generations of [[cell division]]. As it turns out, [[epigenetic]] processes play a crucial role in regulating the decision to adopt a stem, progenitor, or mature cell fate. This section will focus primarily on [[mammalian]] [[stem cells]].

In systems biology and mathematical modeling of gene regulatory networks, cell-fate determination is predicted to exhibit certain dynamics, such as attractor-convergence (the attractor can be an equilibrium point, limit cycle or [[strange attractor]]) or oscillatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Rabajante JF, Babierra AL | title=Branching and oscillations in the epigenetic landscape of cell-fate determination | journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume=117 | issue=2–3 | pages=240–9 | date=January 30, 2015 | pmid=25641423 | doi =10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.01.006 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610715000073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of epigenetic control====

The first question that can be asked is the extent and complexity of the role of epigenetic processes in the determination of cell fate. A clear answer to this question can be seen in the 2011 paper by Lister R, ''et al.'' &lt;ref name = "Lister"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21289626 |doi=10.1038/nature09798 |author=Lister R |title=Hotspots of aberrant epigenomic reprogramming in human induced pluripotent stem cells |journal=Nature |year=2011 |volume= 471 |issue=7336 |pages=68–73 |pmc=3100360|bibcode = 2011Natur.471...68L |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; on aberrant epigenomic programming in [[human]] [[induced pluripotent stem cells]]. As induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are thought to mimic [[embryonic stem cells]] in their pluripotent properties, few epigenetic differences should exist between them. To test this prediction, the authors conducted whole-genome profiling of [[DNA methylation]] patterns in several human embryonic stem cell (ESC), iPSC, and progenitor cell lines.

Female [[adipose]] cells, [[lung]] [[fibroblasts]], and foreskin fibroblasts were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent state with the [[OCT4]], [[SOX2]], [[KLF4]], and [[MYC]] genes. Patterns of DNA methylation in ESCs, iPSCs, somatic cells were compared. Lister R, ''et al.'' observed significant resemblance in methylation levels between embryonic and induced pluripotent cells. Around 80% of [[CpG site|CG dinucleotides]] in ESCs and iPSCs were methylated, the same was true of only 60% of CG dinucleotides in somatic cells. In addition, somatic cells possessed minimal levels of cytosine methylation in non-CG dinucleotides, while induced pluripotent cells possessed similar levels of methylation as embryonic stem cells, between 0.5 and 1.5%. Thus, consistent with their respective transcriptional activities,&lt;ref name= "Lister"/&gt; DNA methylation patterns, at least on the genomic level, are similar between ESCs and iPSCs.

However, upon examining methylation patterns more closely, the authors discovered 1175 regions of differential CG dinucleotide methylation between at least one ES or iPS cell line. By comparing these regions of differential methylation with regions of cytosine methylation in the original somatic cells, 44-49% of differentially methylated regions reflected methylation patterns of the respective progenitor somatic cells, while 51-56% of these regions were dissimilar to both the progenitor and embryonic cell lines. [[In vitro]]-induced differentiation of iPSC lines saw transmission of 88% and 46% of hyper and hypo-methylated differentially methylated regions, respectively.

Two conclusions are readily apparent from this study. First, epigenetic processes are heavily involved in cell fate determination, as seen from the similar levels of cytosine methylation between induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cells, consistent with their respective patterns of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Second, the mechanisms of de-differentiation (and by extension, differentiation) are very complex and cannot be easily duplicated, as seen by the significant number of differentially methylated regions between ES and iPS cell lines. Now that these two points have been established, we can examine some of the epigenetic mechanisms that are thought to regulate cellular differentiation.

====Mechanisms of epigenetic regulation====

=====[[Pioneer factor|Pioneering factors]] (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog)=====
Three transcription factors, OCT4, SOX2, and [[Homeobox protein NANOG|NANOG]] – the first two of which are used in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming, along with [[Klf4]] and [[c-Myc]] – are highly expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and are necessary for the maintenance of their [[pluripotency]].&lt;ref name = "Christophersen"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 20975044 |doi=10.1084/jem.20101438 |vauthors=Christophersen NS, Helin K |title=Epigenetic control of embryonic stem cell fate |journal=J Exp Med |year=2010 |volume=207 |issue=11 |pages=2287–95 |pmc= 2964577}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that they achieve this through alterations in [[chromatin]] structure, such as [[histone modification]] and DNA methylation, to restrict or permit the transcription of target genes. While highly expressed, their levels require a precise balance to maintain pluripotency, perturbation of which will promote differentiation towards different lineages based on how the gene expression levels change. Differential regulation of [[Oct-4]] and [[SOX2]] levels have been shown to precede germ layer fate selection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 21663792|year= 2011|author1= Thomson|first1= M|title= Pluripotency factors in embryonic stem cells regulate differentiation into germ layers|journal= Cell|volume= 145|issue= 6|pages= 875–89|last2= Liu|first2= S.

N.|last4= Smith|first4= Z|last5= Meissner|first5= A|last6= Ramanathan|first6= S|doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2011.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased levels of Oct4 and decreased levels of Sox2 promote a [[Gastrulation|mesendodermal]] fate, with Oct4 actively suppressing genes associated with a neural [[neurulation|ectodermal]] fate. Similarly, Increased levels of Sox2 and decreased levels of Oct4 promote differentiation towards a neural ectodermal fate, with Sox2 inhibiting differentiation towards a mesendodermal fate. Regardless of the lineage cells differentiate down, suppression of [[Homeobox protein NANOG|NANOG]] has been identified as a necessary prerequisite for differentiation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Polycomb repressive complex (PRC2)=====
In the realm of [[gene silencing]], [[PRC2|Polycomb repressive complex 2]], one of two classes of the [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb group]] (PcG) family of proteins, catalyzes the di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2/me3).&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Zhu, J.  |title=Genome-wide chromatin state transitions associated with developmental and environmental cues |journal=Cell |volume=152|issue= 3|pages=642–654 |year=2013 |pmid=23333102 |pmc=3563935 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.12.033|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guenther"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20616255 |doi=10.1126/science.1193995 |vauthors=Guenther MG, Young RA |title=Repressive Transcription |journal=Science |year=2010 |volume=329 |issue=5988 |pages=150–1 |pmc=3006433|bibcode = 2010Sci...329..150G |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/81257/1/Young_Repressive%20transcription.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; By binding to the H3K27me2/3-tagged nucleosome, PRC1 (also a complex of PcG family proteins) catalyzes the mono-ubiquitinylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub1), blocking [[RNA polymerase II]] activity and resulting in transcriptional suppression.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt; PcG knockout ES cells do not differentiate efficiently into the three germ layers, and deletion of the PRC1 and PRC2 genes leads to increased expression of lineage-affiliated genes and unscheduled differentiation.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt; Presumably, PcG complexes are responsible for transcriptionally repressing differentiation and development-promoting genes.

=====Trithorax group proteins (TrxG)=====
Alternately, upon receiving differentiation signals, PcG proteins are recruited to promoters of pluripotency transcription factors. PcG-deficient ES cells can begin differentiation but cannot maintain the differentiated phenotype.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt; Simultaneously, differentiation and development-promoting genes are activated by Trithorax group (TrxG) chromatin regulators and lose their repression.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guenther"/&gt; TrxG proteins are recruited at regions of high transcriptional activity, where they catalyze the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 ([[H3K4me3]]) and promote gene activation through histone acetylation.&lt;ref name = "Guenther"/&gt; PcG and TrxG complexes engage in direct competition and are thought to be functionally antagonistic, creating at differentiation and development-promoting loci what is termed a "bivalent domain" and rendering these genes sensitive to rapid induction or repression.&lt;ref name = "Meissner"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20944600 |doi=10.1038/nbt.1684 |author=Meissner A |title=Epigenetic modifications in pluripotent and differentiated cells |journal=Nat Biotechnol |year= 2010 |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=1079–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====DNA methylation=====
Regulation of gene expression is further achieved through DNA methylation, in which the [[DNA methyltransferase]]-mediated methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides maintains heritable repression by controlling DNA accessibility.&lt;ref name = "Meissner"/&gt; The majority of CpG sites in embryonic stem cells are unmethylated and appear to be associated with H3K4me3-carrying nucleosomes.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt; Upon differentiation, a small number of genes, including OCT4 and NANOG,&lt;ref name = "Meissner"/&gt; are methylated and their promoters repressed to prevent their further expression. Consistently, DNA methylation-deficient embryonic stem cells rapidly enter [[apoptosis]] upon in vitro differentiation.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt;

=====Nucleosome positioning=====
While the [[nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]] of most cells of an organism is the same, the binding patterns of transcription factors and the corresponding gene expression patterns are different. To a large extent, differences in transcription factor binding are determined by the chromatin accessibility of their binding sites through [[histone modification]] and/or [[pioneer factor]]s. In particular, it is important to know whether a [[nucleosome]] is covering a given genomic binding site or not. This can be determined using a [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) assay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/haberlab/jehsite/chIP.html ChIP Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

======Histone acetylation and methylation======
DNA-nucleosome interactions are characterized by two states: either tightly bound by nucleosomes and transcriptionally inactive, called [[heterochromatin]], or loosely bound and usually, but not always, transcriptionally active, called [[euchromatin]]. The epigenetic processes of histone methylation and acetylation, and their inverses demethylation and deacetylation primarily account for these changes. The effects of acetylation and deacetylation are more predictable. An acetyl group is either added to or removed from the positively charged Lysine residues in histones by enzymes called [[histone acetyltransferase]]s or [[histone deacteylase]]s, respectively. The acetyl group prevents Lysine's association with the negatively charged DNA backbone. Methylation is not as straightforward, as neither methylation nor demethylation consistently correlate with either gene activation or repression. However, certain methylations have been repeatedly shown to either activate or repress genes. The trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4Me3) is associated with gene activation, whereas trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 represses genes&lt;ref name="pmid12667454"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krogan NJ, Dover J, Wood A, Schneider J, Heidt J, Boateng MA, Dean K, Ryan OW, Golshani A, Johnston M, Greenblatt JF, Shilatifard A | title = The Paf1 complex is required for histone H3 methylation by COMPASS and Dot1p: linking transcriptional elongation to histone methylation | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 721–9 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12667454 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00091-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12667453"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ng HH, Robert F, Young RA, Struhl K | title = Targeted recruitment of Set1 histone methylase by elongating Pol II provides a localized mark and memory of recent transcriptional activity | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 709–19 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12667453 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00092-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15680324"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein BE, Kamal M, Lindblad-Toh K, Bekiranov S, Bailey DK, Huebert DJ, McMahon S, Karlsson EK, Kulbokas EJ, Gingeras TR, Schreiber SL, Lander ES | title = Genomic maps and comparative analysis of histone modifications in human and mouse | journal = Cell | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–81 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15680324 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

======In stem cells======
During differentiation, [[stem cell]]s change their gene expression profiles. Recent studies have implicated a role for nucleosome positioning and histone modifications during this process.&lt;ref name = "Teif_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23085715 | doi=10.1038/nsmb.2419 |vauthors=Teif VB, Vainshtein Y, Caudron-Herger M, Mallm JP, Marth C, Höfer T, Rippe K |title= Genome-wide nucleosome positioning during embryonic stem cell development |journal=Nat Struct Mol Biol  |year= 2012 | volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=1185–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two components of this process: turning off the expression of embryonic stem cell (ESC) genes, and the activation of cell fate genes.

====Role of signaling in epigenetic control====

A final question to ask concerns the role of [[cell signaling]] in influencing the epigenetic processes governing differentiation. Such a role should exist, as it would be reasonable to think that extrinsic signaling can lead to epigenetic remodeling, just as it can lead to changes in gene expression through the activation or repression of different transcription factors. Little direct data is available concerning the specific signals that influence the [[epigenome]], and the majority of current knowledge about the subject consists of speculations on plausible candidate regulators of epigenetic remodeling.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20944593 |doi=10.1038/nbt1010-1033 |vauthors=Mohammad HP, Baylin SB |title=Linking cell signaling and the epigenetic machinery |journal=Nat Biotechnol |year=2010 |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=1033–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; We will first discuss several major candidates thought to be involved in the induction and maintenance of both embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny, and then turn to one example of specific signaling pathways in which more direct evidence exists for its role in epigenetic change.

The first major candidate is [[Wnt signaling pathway]]. The Wnt pathway is involved in all stages of differentiation, and the ligand Wnt3a can substitute for the overexpression of c-Myc in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt; On the other hand, disruption of [[Beta-catenin|ß-catenin]], a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, leads to decreased proliferation of neural progenitors.

[[Growth factors]] comprise the second major set of candidates of epigenetic regulators of cellular differentiation. These morphogens are crucial for development, and include [[bone morphogenetic proteins]], [[transforming growth factors]] (TGFs), and [[fibroblast growth factors]] (FGFs). TGFs and FGFs have been shown to sustain expression of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG by downstream signaling to [[SMAD (protein)|Smad]] proteins.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt; Depletion of growth factors promotes the differentiation of ESCs, while genes with bivalent chromatin can become either more restrictive or permissive in their transcription.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt;

Several other signaling pathways are also considered to be primary candidates. Cytokine [[leukemia inhibitory factor]]s are associated with the maintenance of mouse ESCs in an undifferentiated state. This is achieved through its activation of the Jak-STAT3 pathway, which has been shown to be necessary and sufficient towards maintaining mouse ESC pluripotency.&lt;ref name = "Niwa"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9649508 |doi=10.1101/gad.12.13.2048 |vauthors=Niwa H, Burdon T, Chambers I, Smith A |title=Self-renewal of pluripotent embryonic stem cells is mediated via activation of STAT3 |journal=Genes Dev |year=1998 |volume=12 |issue=13 |pages=2048–60 |pmc=316954}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Retinoic acid]] can induce differentiation of human and mouse ESCs,&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt; and [[Notch signaling]] is involved in the proliferation and self-renewal of stem cells. Finally, [[Sonic hedgehog]], in addition to its role as a morphogen, promotes embryonic stem cell differentiation and the self-renewal of somatic stem cells.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt;

The problem, of course, is that the candidacy of these signaling pathways was inferred primarily on the basis of their role in development and cellular differentiation. While epigenetic regulation is necessary for driving cellular differentiation, they are certainly not sufficient for this process. Direct modulation of gene expression through modification of transcription factors plays a key role that must be distinguished from heritable epigenetic changes that can persist even in the absence of the original environmental signals. Only a few examples of signaling pathways leading to epigenetic changes that alter cell fate currently exist, and we will focus on one of them.

Expression of Shh (Sonic hedgehog) upregulates the production of [[BMI1]], a component of the PcG complex that recognizes H3K27me3. This occurs in a Gli-dependent manner, as [[Gli1]] and [[Gli2]] are downstream effectors of the [[Hedgehog signaling pathway]]. In culture, Bmi1 mediates the Hedgehog pathway's ability to promote human mammary stem cell self-renewal.&lt;ref name = "Liu"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16778178 |pmc=4386278 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0054 |author=Liu S |title=Hedgehog Signaling and Bmi-1 Regulate Self-renewal of Normal and Malignant Human Mammary Stem Cells |journal=Cancer Res |year=2006 |volume=66 |issue=12 |pages=6063–71|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both humans and mice, researchers showed Bmi1 to be highly expressed in proliferating immature cerebellar granule cell precursors. When Bmi1 was knocked out in mice, impaired cerebellar development resulted, leading to significant reductions in postnatal brain mass along with abnormalities in motor control and behavior.&lt;ref name = "Leung"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15029199 |doi=10.1038/nature02385 |author=Leung C |title=Bmi1 is essential for cerebellar development and is overexpressed in human medulloblastomas |journal=Nature |year=2004 |volume=428 |issue=6980 |pages=337–41|bibcode = 2004Natur.428..337L |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate study showed a significant decrease in neural stem cell proliferation along with increased astrocyte proliferation in Bmi null mice.&lt;ref name = "Zencak"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15958744 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3452-04.2005 |author=Zencak D |title=Bmi1 loss produces an increase in astroglial cells and a decrease in neural stem cell population and proliferation |journal=J Neurosci |year=2005 |volume=25 |issue=24 |pages=5774–83|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A alternative model of cellular differentiation during embryogenesis is that positional information is based on mechanical signalling by the cytoskeleton using [[Embryonic differentiation waves]]. The mechanical signal is then epigenetically transduced via signal transduction systems (of which specific molecules such as Wnt are part) to result in differential gene expression.

In summary, the role of signaling in the epigenetic control of cell fate in mammals is largely unknown, but distinct examples exist that indicate the likely existence of further such mechanisms.

=== Effect of matrix elasticity ===
In order to fulfill the purpose of regenerating a variety of tissues, adult stems are known to migrate from their niches, adhere to new extracellular matrices (ECM) and differentiate. The ductility of these microenvironments are unique to different tissue types. The ECM surrounding brain, muscle and bone tissues range from soft to stiff. The transduction of the stem cells into these cells types is not directed solely by chemokine cues and cell to cell signaling. The elasticity of the microenvironment can also affect the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs which originate in bone marrow.) When MSCs are placed on substrates of the same stiffness as brain, muscle and bone ECM, the MSCs take on properties of those respective cell types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867406009615|title=Matrix Elasticity Directs Stem Cell Lineage Specification|access-date=2016-04-22|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044|volume=126|issue=4|pages=677–689|journal=Cell|pmid=16923388|date=August 2006 | last1 = Engler | first1 = AJ | last2 = Sen | first2 = S | last3 = Sweeney | first3 = HL | last4 = Discher | first4 = DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Matrix sensing requires the cell to pull against the matrix at focal adhesions, which triggers a cellular mechano-transducer to generate a signal to be informed what force is needed to deform the matrix.  To determine the key players in matrix-elasticity-driven lineage specification in MSCs, different matrix microenvironments were mimicked. From these experiments, it was concluded that focal adhesions of the MSCs were the cellular mechano-transducer sensing the differences of the matrix elasticity. The non-muscle myosin IIa-c isoforms generates the forces in the cell that lead to signaling of early commitment markers. Nonmuscle myosin IIa generates the least force increasing to non-muscle myosin IIc. There are also factors in the cell that inhibit non-muscle myosin II, such as blebbistatin. This makes the cell effectively blind to the surrounding matrix.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Researchers have obtained some success in inducing stem cell-like properties in HEK 239 cells by providing a soft matrix without the use of diffusing factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Jun|last2=Wang|first2=Yuexiu|last3=Sachs|first3=Frederick|last4=Meng|first4=Fanjie|date=2014-12-09|title=Actin stress in cell reprogramming|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/49/E5252|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=49|pages=E5252–E5261|doi=10.1073/pnas.1411683111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4267376|pmid=25422450|bibcode=2014PNAS..111E5252G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stem-cell properties appear to be linked to tension in the cells' actin network. One identified mechanism for matrix-induced differentiation is tension-induced proteins, which remodel chromatin in response to mechanical stretch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guilak|first=Farshid|last2=Cohen|first2=Daniel M.|last3=Estes|first3=Bradley T.|last4=Gimble|first4=Jeffrey M.|last5=Liedtke|first5=Wolfgang|last6=Chen|first6=Christopher S.|date=2009-07-02|title=Control of Stem Cell Fate by Physical Interactions with the Extracellular Matrix|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590909002938|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=5|issue=1|pages=17–26|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.016|pmc=2768283|pmid=19570510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RhoA pathway is also implicated in this process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">'''Cognized environment''' is a concept first introduced by the late anthropologist, [[Roy Rappaport]] (1968), in contrast to what he called the ''operational environment'' (see Rappaport 1979:97-144, 1984:337-352).  Rappaport was an ecological anthropologist, like [[Andrew P. Vayda]], and wished to contrast the actual reality and adaptations (the operational environment) within a people's ecological niche  – say, the existence of tsetse flies and their role in causing sleeping sickness among humans – with how the people’s culture understands nature (the cognized environment) – say, the belief that witches live in those areas that science knows is the habitat of the tsetse.  Rappaport’s principal concern was the role of ritual in mediating the cognized and operational environments.

Another group of anthropologists later took up the use of Rappaport’s concepts and applied them toward developing a school of [[neuroanthropology]] called [[Biogenetic Structuralism]] (see Laughlin and Brady 1978: 6, d'Aquili, Laughlin and McManus 1979: 12ff, Rubinstein, Laughlin and McManus 1984: 21ff, and Laughlin, McManus and d'Aquili 1990:82-90).  According to this group, all properties and qualities of experience are mediated by our body’s neuroendocrine systems.  These systems function individually and collectively to model reality.  The sum total of these models in the brain is the cognized environment.  The operational environment refers to the actual niche in which the human or other animal with a brain dwells and adapts.  The operational environment is the real world that is modelled by our cognized environment.

'''Corpus Córporum''' (Lat. "the collection of collections") or in full, ''Corpus Córporum: repositorium operum latinorum apud universitatem Turicensem'', is a digital [[Medieval Latin]] library developed by the [[University of Zurich]], Institute for Greek and Latin Philology. As of May 2016, the repository contains a total of 137,982,350 words, including the entire [[Patrologia Latina]], the [[Vulgate]], Corpus Thomisticum and numerous other medieval and [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] collections of religious, literary and scientific texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/index.php?lang=0 Link to home page] of the project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The non-commercial site, still under development (''in statu nascendi'') at mlat.uzh.ch, is conceived as a text (meta-)repository with a set of research tools. It is being developed under the direction of Phillip Roelli, and it uses only free and open software.

The project aims to provide a platform for standardised (TEI) xml-files of copyright-free Latin texts; to make the texts searchable in complex manners; and to function as an online platform for the publication of Latin texts (e.g. the [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall|Richard Rufus]] Project's corpus at Stanford University).

Texts are divided into searchable corpora on specific topics, e.g. one corpus consists of ten Latin translations of Aristotle's ''Physica''.&lt;ref&gt;Project's [http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/index.php?lang=0 About page].&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Base pair#Length measurements|1 kb]] [[DNA ladder|marker]] (middle) and [[Scientific control|control]] DNA (right) are included.]]
'''DNA laddering''' is a feature that can be observed when [[DNA]] fragments, resulting from [[apoptotic DNA fragmentation]], are visualized after separation by [[gel electrophoresis]]. It was first described in 1980 by [[Andrew Wyllie]] at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;

==DNA degradation==
DNA laddering is a distinctive feature of DNA degraded by [[caspase-activated DNase]] (CAD), which is a key event during [[apoptosis]]. CAD cleaves genomic DNA at [[internucleosomal linker]] regions, resulting in DNA fragments that are multiples of 180–185 [[base-pair]]s in length.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elmore|first=Susan|date=2007-01-01|title=Apoptosis: A Review of Programmed Cell Death|journal=Toxicologic pathology|volume=35|issue=4|pages=495–516|doi=10.1080/01926230701320337|issn=0192-6233|pmc=2117903|pmid=17562483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separation of the fragments by [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] and subsequent visualization, for example by [[ethidium bromide]] staining, results in a characteristic "ladder" pattern. A simple method of selective extraction of fragmented DNA from apoptotic cells without the presence of high molecular weight DNA sections, generating the laddering pattern, utilizes pretreatment of cells in [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;Gong JP, Traganos F, Darzynkiewicz Z. (1994) A selective procedure for DNA extraction from apoptotic cells applicable for [[gel electrophoresis]] and [[flow cytometry]]. Anal Biochem 218:314-319. {{PMID|8074286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apoptosis and necrosis==
While most of the [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] features of apoptotic cells are short-lived, DNA laddering can be used as final state read-out method and has therefore become a reliable method to distinguish [[apoptosis]] from [[necrosis]].&lt;ref name=Iwata1994&gt;

DNA laddering can only be used to detect apoptosis during the later stages of apoptosis. This is due to DNA fragmentation taking place in a later stage of the apoptosis process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; DNA laddering is used to test for apoptosis of many cells, and is not accurate at testing for only a few cells that committed apoptosis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To enhance the accuracy in testing for apoptosis, other assays are used along with DNA laddering such as TEM and TUNEL.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With recent improvements to DNA laddering, DNA laddering has become a more reliable, and reasonable technique to use when detecting apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahbar Saadat|first=Yalda|last2=Saeidi|first2=Nazli|last3=Zununi Vahed|first3=Sepideh|last4=Barzegari|first4=Abolfazl|last5=Barar|first5=Jaleh|date=2015-01-01|title=An update to DNA ladder assay for apoptosis detection|journal=BioImpacts : BI|volume=5|issue=1|pages=25–28|doi=10.15171/bi.2015.01|issn=2228-5652|pmc=4401164|pmid=25901294}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to note that DNA laddering occurs differently depending on the type of cell, so there may be slight changes in the process of DNA laddering depending on the cell that is being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Ai-Liang|last2=Cheng|first2=Yanwei|last3=Li|first3=Jianyou|last4=Zhang|first4=Wei|date=2008-07-31|title=A zinc-dependent nuclear endonuclease is responsible for DNA laddering during salt-induced programmed cell death in root tip cells of rice|journal=Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=165|issue=11|pages=1134–1141|doi=10.1016/j.jplph.2007.12.008|issn=1618-1328|pmid=18295371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7739">'''Dark septate endophytes''' (DSE) are a group of [[endophytic]] [[fungi]] characterized by their morphology of melanized, [[septate]], [[hyphae]]. This group is likely [[paraphyletic]], and contain [[conidium|conidial]] as well as sterile fungi that colonize roots intracellularly or intercellularly.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen2001"&gt;Jumpponen, A. 2001. Dark-Septate Endophytes – are they mycorrhizal? Mycorrhiza 11:207–211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"&gt;Mandyam, K. and Jumpponen, A. 2005. Seeking the elusive function of the root-colonising dark septate endophytic fungi. Studies in Mycology. 53: 173–189.&lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known about the number of fungal taxa within this group, but all are in the [[Ascomycota]]. They are found in over 600 plant species and across 114 families  of [[angiosperms]] and [[gymnosperms]] and co-occur with other types of [[mycorrhizal fungi]].&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jumpponen|first1=Ari|last2=Trappe|first2=James M.|title=Dark septate endophytes: a review of facultative biotrophic root-colonizing fungi|journal=New Phytologist|volume=140|issue=2|year=1998|pages=295–310|issn=0028-646X|doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00265.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a wide global distribution and can be more abundant in stressed environments.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt; Much of their taxonomy, physiology, and ecology are unknown.

==Taxonomy==
Based on analysis of sequences with the small subunit of the nuclear [[ribosomal RNA]] gene (18S), all DSE are within ascomycetes and include taxa in the orders Pleoporales, [[Microascales]], [[Xylariales]], [[Pezizales]], [[Dothideales]], [[Leotiales]], [[Chaetothyriales]], Elaphomycetales, [[Eurotiales]], [[Onygenales]], [[Saccharomycetales]], [[Neolectales]], [[Taphrinales]], [[Mitosporic]], and nonsporulating cultures.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt;

==Natural history==

===Geographical distribution===
Dark septate endophytes have been found in the subantarctic, [[boreal climate|boreal]] coniferous forests in Canada, temperate and boreal forests in Northern and Central Europe, exotic pine plantations in New Zealand,&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt; [[temperate grasslands]], ephiphytic plants in [[tropical rain forests]], [[alpine climate|alpine]] environments, and semi-arid environments. Studies in alpine and semi-arid ecosystems have shown that dark septate endophytes are more prevalent than [[arbuscular mycorrhizae]] in these environments.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

===Physiology and function===
Different species and strains of DSE have been found to have [[enzymes]] including laccases, [[lipases]], [[amylases]], and polyphenol oxidases.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt; They are capable of breaking down many organic compounds including [[starch]], [[cellulose]], laminari, [[xylan]], [[gelatin]], and [[RNA]] &lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, B.A., Jumpponen, A., Trappe, J.M. 2000. Utilization of Major Detrital Substrates by Dark-Septate, Root Endophytes. Mycologia 92: 230–232.&lt;/ref&gt; from detrital nutrient pools. Their nitrogen sources are varied, and dark septate endophytes are able to use [[amino acids]] (e.g. alanine, glycine, and arginine) equally as efficiently as [[ammonium]], as well as other sources like [[guanine]] and [[uric acid]]. Some DSE are also able to hydrolyse organic sulphate.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

A key characteristic of DSE is that they show high melanin content and appear darkened in morphology. This is hypothesized to protect hyphae from extremes in temperatures and drought and improve their persistence in the soil.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

===Plant hosts===
Dark septate endophytes have been observed across the plant kingdom in [[Dicotyledoneae]] and  [[Monocotyledonae]] (Angiospermae), and [[Equisetopsida]], [[Lycopsida]], [[Polypodiopsida]], and [[Psilotopsida]] (Gymnospermae). Their diversity of hosts suggests little or no host-specificity in this group.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt; They are found on plants that are non-mycorrhizal as well as plants with known arbuscular, [[ericoid]], orchid, and [[ectomycorrhizal]] associations.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

===Colonization of host plant===
Dark septate endophytes are plant root-colonizing fungi that are often darkly-pigmented, with septate hyphae, and form structures inside plant root cells such as [[microsclerotia]]. However, there is great variation in morphology within this group. Dark septate endophytes are observed more frequently in mature parts of the root system.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt;

There are four main physiological structures of DSE colonization in plant roots. The ''runner hyphae'' are individual, superficial fungal strands following the depressions between epidermal cells. The ''appressorium'' is the swollen structure preceding penetration through a host cell wall. The ''penetration tube'' is the thin structure penetrating through the cell wall. The ''microsclerotia'' are the intracellular groups of hyphae with rounded, thick-walled cells.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen1998"/&gt; The frequent inter- and intracellular structures suggest that DSE gain nutrition from the plant host.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen2001"/&gt;

==Ecology==

===Interaction with other root-associated fungi===
Dark septate endophytes frequently co-occur with mycorrhizal fungi such as arbuscular, ericoid, orchid, and ectomycorrhiza.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt; There is some evidence that the different root-associated fungi interact. For example, [[ectomycorrhiza]] and DSE strains together increase plant biomass more than either alone.&lt;ref&gt;Reininger, V. and Sieber, T.N. 2013. Mitigation of antagonistic effects on plant growth due to root co-colonization by dark septate endophytes and ectomycorrhiza. Environmental Microbiology Reports 5(6), 892–898&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on host plants===
Effects of DSE on host plants range from [[pathogenic]] to [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], depending on environmental factors as well as both host and fungus genotypes.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen2001"/&gt; However, the majority of DSE studied showed that inoculation of DSE increased total, root, and shoot biomass by up to 80%.&lt;ref name="Newsham2011"&gt;Newsham, K.K. 2011. A meta-analysis of plant responses to dark septate root endophytes. New Phytologist 190: 783–793.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark septate endophyte hyphae are much smaller in diameter compared to plant roots which allows them to access soil micropores unavailable to plants to forage for water and nutrients. Therefore, association with DSE can increase nitrogen and phosphorus content in host plant tissue.&lt;ref name="Jumpponen2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsham2011"/&gt; In arid ecosystems, DSE in the order Pleosporales are commonly found in both rhizosphere soils and surface biological soil crust communities, which suggests that they may aid in nutrient absorption by plants by linking plant roots and biological soil crusts that fix carbon and nitrogen in [[hyphal networks]], which forms the basis of the [[Fungal Loop Hypothesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Porras-Alfaro, A., Herrera, J., Natvig, D.O., Lipinski, K., Sinsabaugh, R.L. 2011. Diversity and distribution of soil fungal communities in a semiarid grassland. Mycologia 103: 10–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The melanized cell walls of DSE may affect heat dissipation or form complexes with oxygen radicals in plant hosts, which can alter host thermal tolerance. Similar to other mycorrhizal fungi, DSE can protect hosts from pathogens or [[herbivores]] through the production of inhibitory metabolites, physical exclusion of other mycroorganisms, or melanized hyphae. Some fungi in the same genus as known DSE are known to produce [[antibacterial]] or [[Fungicide|antifungal]] compounds.&lt;ref name="Mandyam2005"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">The '''Erasmus Research Institute of Management''' (ERIM) is the joint research institute of the [[Rotterdam School of Management]] and the [[Erasmus School of Economics]], both at [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]. It aims to bring together top researchers in [[business]] and [[management]] from each of these schools. Alongside its research program ERIM also has a [[graduate program]] in management designed to attract and train young scholars from around the world.&lt;ref name="erim.eur.nl"&gt;[https://www.erim.eur.nl/about-erim/ About ERIM], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ERIM seeks to contribute to "scientific research that enables organisations to assess and improve their [[business processes]] in order to perform in a profitable and responsible way."&lt;ref name="erim.eur.nl"/&gt;

== History ==
ERIM was founded in 1999. It modeled itself on the top American and European [[business schools]] such as [[Wharton Business School]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]], [[London Business School]], and [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.rsm.nl/publications/rsmoutlook/id/7fb9c140-7a5f-11e1-a14c-8737be83186e/format/pdf RSM Outlook Summer 2010], page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, ERIM has become one of the top three schools in business research in Europe, and is among the top 25 in the world.&lt;ref name="Outlook_Summer_2010-FINAL page 22"&gt;[http://api.rsm.nl/publications/rsmoutlook/id/7fb9c140-7a5f-11e1-a14c-8737be83186e/format/pdf RSM Outlook Summer 2010], page 22&lt;/ref&gt; It has achieved a top ranking at the [[Social Science Research Network|Social Science Research Network (SSRN)]], periodically ranking first outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsm.nl/about-rsm/news/detail/1350-erim-research-tops-ssrn-ranking-again/ ERIM RESEARCH TOPS SSRN RANKING AGAIN] at ''rsm.nl/about-rsm/news''. Thursday, June 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next decade, ERIM will additionally focus on impacting business practice and the views of business professionals and the general public.&lt;ref name="rsm.nl"&gt;[http://api.rsm.nl/publications/rsmoutlook/id/7fb9c140-7a5f-11e1-a14c-8737be83186e/format/pdf RSM Outlook Summer 2010], page 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Within ERIM, research in management is divided into five broad streams: [[marketing]]; [[finance]] and [[accounting]]; [[strategy]]; [[organization]] and [[business processes]]; [[logistics]] and [[information systems]].&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010" &gt;erim.eur.nl/portal/page/portal/... Accessed November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, more than 200 researchers are engaged in ERIM’s research programs.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;  They are an international collection of researchers with backgrounds in [[business administration]] as well as other disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[econometrics]] and technical sciences.&lt;ref name="Outlook_Summer_2010-FINAL page 22"/&gt;

Also under ERIM’s umbrella are more than 20 specialist research centers, focusing on topics as diverse as customer value chains, [[Mutual fund|mutual]] and [[hedge fund]]s, [[neuroeconomics]], [[entrepreneurship]], closed loop supply chains, [[sustainability]], [[climate change]], and business in China.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;

== Doctoral program ==
As a graduate school, ERIM offers a five-year doctoral program, broken down into two years of course work (following which the candidate receives a [[Master's degree|Master]] title) with three years applied to [[dissertation]]. The [[PhD degree]] is awarded following a successful defense of the dissertation. Candidates must have a [[Bachelor degree]] to enter the program. Candidates who already have an [[MSc]] degree may enter the program as second-year students, while those who have already received a relevant [[MPhil]] degree may enter as third-year students. The main goal of the program is to train promising students with academic ambitions to build competitive research profiles, so that they can attain faculty positions at top business schools around the world and become “[[thought leader]]s”.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;

=== PhD in Management ===
The ERIM PhD Program in Management is part of the doctoral program. To enter the program, an [[MPhil]], [[MSc]] or [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree is mandatory. In 2010, around 100 students from around 30 countries were enrolled in the PhD program.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;

ERIM offers two types of PhD Projects:

* '''ERIM Predefined PhD Projects''' train future researchers in or across five key disciplines of management: [[business processes]], [[logistics]] &amp; [[information systems]], [[organization]], [[marketing]], [[finance]], and [[strategy]]. These projects are initiated each year.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;
* '''ERIM Open PhD Projects''' are designed to give PhD candidates much freedom in choosing their own research topic. These open projects are financed with an endowment of 800,000 euros from the [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research|Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)]]. ERIM was one of nine Dutch academic institutions who were awarded the grant in 2009, which was intended to give future doctoral students more say in the research to be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/... Accessed November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;academictransfer.com/... Accessed November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A limited number of open projects was initiated in 2010.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;

=== Research Master in Business Research ===
The ERIM [[Master of Philosophy]] in Business Research is part of the doctoral programme. This Research Master is designed for academically talented and motivated students who wish to combine education in a specialization area of their choice with conducting research in that field.&lt;ref&gt;eur.nl/master/masteropleidingen/...

The term was coined by British biologist [[Julian Huxley]], to contrast with [[clade]], a strictly [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1959. Clades and grades. In Cain A.J. (ed) ''Function and taxonomic importance''. Systematics Association, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
An evolutionary grade is a group of species united by [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] or [[physiology|physiological]] traits, that has given rise to another group that has major differences from the ancestral condition, and is thus not considered part of the ancestral group, while still having enough similarities that we can group them under the same clade. The ancestral group will not be phylogenetically complete (i.e. will not form a [[clade]]), so will represent a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] taxon.

In order to fully understand evolutionary grades, one must first get a better understanding of [[Phylogenetics]], defined as "''In [[biology]], is the study of the [[evolution]]ary history and relationships among individuals or groups of [[organism]]s (e.g. [[species]], or [[population]]s). These relationships are discovered through [[Computational phylogenetics|phylogenetic inference]] methods that evaluate observed [[heritable]] traits, such as [[DNA]] sequences or [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] under a model of evolution of these traits"''

The most commonly cited example is that of [[reptiles]]. In the early 19th century, the French naturalist [[Pierre André Latreille|Latreille]] was the first to divide [[tetrapod]]s into the four familiar classes of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Latreille, P.A. (1804). ''Nouveau Dictionnaire à Histoire Naturelle'', xxiv; cited in Latreille, P.A. (1825).''Familles naturelles du règne animal, exposés succinctement et dans un ordre analytique''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, reptiles are characterized by traits such as laying membranous or shelled eggs, having skin covered in [[scale (zoology)|scales]] or [[scutes]], and having a '[[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]' metabolism. However, the ancestors of mammals and birds also had these traits and so birds and mammals can be said to "have evolved from reptiles", making the reptiles, when defined by these traits, a grade rather than a clade.&lt;ref name="tudge"/&gt; In [[microbiology]], taxa that are thus seen as excluded from their evolutionary grade parent group are called [[Taxon in disguise|taxa in disguise]].&lt;ref name="shigella"&gt;{{Cite journal

Paraphyletic taxa will often, but not always, represent evolutionary grades. In some cases paraphyletic taxa are united simply by not being part of any other groups, and give rise to so-called [[Wastebasket taxon|wastebasket taxa]] which may even be [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]].

==Grades in systematics==
[[File:Australopithecus sediba.JPG|thumb|right|The genus ''[[Australopithecus]]'' is ancestral to ''[[Homo]]'', yet actively in use in [[palaeoanthropology]].]]
The traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] way of defining taxa is through the use of anatomical traits. When the actual phylogenetic relationship is unknown, well defined groups sometimes turn out to be defined by traits that are primitive rather than derived. In Linnaean [[systematics]], evolutionary grades are accepted in higher [[taxonomic rank]]s, though generally avoided at [[family (biology)|family]] level and below. In [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] evolutionary grades (or any other form of paraphyly) are not accepted.&lt;ref name="grant1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2446408 | title = Primary Classification and Phylogeny of the Polemoniaceae, with Comments on Molecular Cladistics | year = 1998 | author = Grant, Verne | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 85 | pages = 741–752 | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/85/6/741 | jstor = 2446408 | issue = 6 | publisher = Botanical Society of America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where information about phylogenetic relationships is available, organisms are preferentially grouped into [[clades]]. Where data is lacking, or groups of uncertain relationship are to be compared, the cladistic method is limited and grade provides a useful tool for comparing organisms. This is particularly common in [[palaeontology]], where [[fossil]]s are often fragmentary and difficult to interpret. Thus, traditional palaeontological works are often using evolutionary grades as formal or informal taxa, including examples such as [[Labyrinthodontia|labyrinthodonts]], [[anapsid]]s, [[synapsid]]s, [[dinosaur]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonites]], [[eurypterid]]s, [[lobopodia]]ns and many of the more well known taxa of [[human evolution]]. Organizing organisms into grades rather than strict clades can also be very useful to understand the evolutionary sequence behind major diversification of both animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperling|first=E.

Evolutionary grades, being united by gross morphological traits, are often eminently recognizable in the field. While [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] seeks to eliminate paraphyletic taxa, such grades are sometimes kept as formal or informal groups on the basis of their usefulness for laymen and field researchers.&lt;ref name="grant1998"/&gt; In [[bacteriology]], the renaming of species or groups that turn out to be evolutionary grades is kept to a minimum to avoid misunderstanding, which in the case of [[pathogen]]s could have fatal consequences. When referring to a group of organisms, the term "grade" is usually enclosed in quotation marks to denote its status as a paraphyletic term.

==Grades and phylogenetic nomenclature==
With the rise of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], the use of evolutionary grades as formal [[taxon|taxa]] has come under debate. Under a strict phylogenetic approach, only [[monophyletic]] taxa are recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kevin de Queiroz &amp; Jacques Gauthier |year=1990 |title=Phylogeny as a central principle in taxonomy: phylogenetic definitions of taxon names |journal=Syst. Zool. |volume=39 |pages=307–322 |doi=10.2307/2992353 |jstor=2992353 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from the more traditional approach of [[evolutionary taxonomy]].&lt;ref name="Mayr_Bock_2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |author-link=Ernst W. Mayr |last2=Bock |first2=W.J. |year=2002 |title=Classifications and other ordering systems |journal=J. Zool. Syst. Evol.

J.|year=2000|title=Stems, nodes, crown clades, and rank-free lists: is Linnaeus dead?|url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Essays/phylocode/biolrev.html|journal=Biological Reviews|issn=0006-3231|volume=75|issue=4|pages=633–648|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2000.tb00055.x|pmid=11117201|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605090428/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Essays/phylocode/biolrev.html|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the statement "B is part of A" (phylogenetic approach) and "B has evolved from A" (evolutionary approach) is, however, one of [[semantics]] rather than of phylogeny. Both express the same phylogeny, but the former emphasizes the phylogenetic continuum while the latter emphasizes a distinct shift in anatomy or ecology in B relative to A.


==Examples==

* [[Fish]] represent a grade, inasmuch as they have given rise to the [[tetrapod|land vertebrates]]. In fact, the three traditional [[class (biology)|classes]] of fish ([[Agnatha]], [[Chondrichthyes]] and [[Osteichthyes]]) all represent evolutionary grades.&lt;ref name="Romer"&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S]]. &amp; T.S. Parsons. 1977. ''The Vertebrate Body.'' 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amphibians]] in the biological sense (including the extinct [[Labyrinthodontia|Labyrinthodonts]]) represent a grade, in that they are also the ancestors of the [[amniote]]s.&lt;ref name="Romer"/&gt;
* [[Reptiles]] are composed of the cold-blooded [[amniotes]], this excludes [[birds]] and [[mammals]].&lt;ref name="tudge"&gt;{{RefTudgeVariety}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dinosaur]]s were proposed to be the ancestors of birds as early as the 1860s.&lt;ref name=huxley1870&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=Thomas H. |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |year=1870 |title= {{ws | [[s: Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London/Volume 26/Further Evidence of the Affinity between the Dinosaurian Reptiles and Birds|Further evidence of the affinity between the dinosaurian reptiles and birds]]|ps=no}} |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London |volume=26 |pages=12–31 |doi=10.1144/GSL.JGS.1870.026.01-02.08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the term sees popular use as an evolutionary grade excluding birds, though most scientists use a monophyletic Dinosauria.
* [[Lizard]]s as a unit represent an evolutionary grade, defined by their retention of limbs relative to [[snake]]s and [[Amphisbaenia|Amphisbaenans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Gibbons | first =J. Whitfield | last2 =Gibbons | first2 =Whit | title =Their Blood Runs Cold: Adventures With Reptiles and Amphibians | publisher =[[University of Alabama]] Press | year =1983 | location =[[Alabama]] | pages =164 |isbn=978-0-8173-0135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, defining lizards by the presence of limbs is incorrect, as there are many species of [[legless lizards]], which are considered true lizards.
* [[Green algae]], represent a grade, in that they are the ancestors of [[land plants]].
* [[Prokaryote]]s, which include cellular organisms lacking a nucleus, represent a grade, in that they are the ancestors of [[eukaryote]]s, which includes [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], and [[protist]]s, which itself also represents a grade, especially since it excludes the first three aforementioned groups.
*[[Crustacean]]s, represent a grade, in that they are the ancestors of [[Hexapoda|hexapod]]s, which includes [[insect]]s and related taxa.

'''Gender democracy''' is a [[normative]] idea related to [[gender mainstreaming]]. Its aim is to achieve democratic conditions between men and women within society as a whole, as well as specifically within companies, bureaucracies, and other organizations. Among other things, this is realized by means of [[gender training]]s that raise awareness of existing inequalities and develop methods to [[democratization|democratize]] relations between genders. The term gender democracy was first coined and developed by German [[sociology|sociologist]] Halina Bedkowski.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oi9aL8iX8NoC&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;ots=vm6Apettti&amp;dq=halina%20bendkowski&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=halina%20bendkowski&amp;f=false Jeffrey J. Anderson, Eric Langenbacher, From the Bonn to the Berlin Republic] {{ISBN|978-0-85745-221-4}} - see p. 228 (footnote 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==

[[File:GuentherZ 2012-06-05 0068 Wien06 Johanna-Dohnal-Platz Strassentafel enthuellt.jpg|thumb|Street sign marking Vienna's Johanna-Dohnal-Platz. In 1993, the term "Geschlechterdemokratie" (gender democracy) appeared on the title of a publication edited by Johanna Dohnal - a first]]
According to Halina Bendkowski she developed the term and concept of gender democracy in the early 1990s during a "research trip to the US, which had been commissioned by Austria's Minister for Women, [[Johanna Dohal]], with the aim of identifying innovative projects against domestic violence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146. The original German quotation reads: "...im Auftrag der österreichischen Frauenministerin Johanna Dohnal in den USA nach innovativen Projekten gegen häusliche Gewalt recherchierte"&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 1993, the term appeared on the title of a publication edited by the [[Austrian Federal Ministry of Education and Women's Affairs]], "Test the West: Geschlechterdemokratie und Gewalt" (Test the West: Gender Democracy and Violence).&lt;ref&gt;Test the West: Geschlechterdemokratie und Gewalt (vol. 1 of "Gewalt gegen Frauen, Frauen gegen Gewalt"), ed. by Johanna Dohnal, Bundesministerin für Frauenangelegenheiten, Wien 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The pioneers of gender democracy refused to provide a fixed and static definition of the term. Bedkowski stated: "As soon as a term has been defined in a dictionary and recycled by other theorists, it will have lost most of its vitality. It is true, terms are alive - and this is especially true for terms that have been developed in the course of actual political conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146. The original German quotation reads: "Sobald Begriffe lexikalisch erfasst und theorierecycelt sind, haben sie ihr vitales Leben schon meist hinter sich. Ja, auch Begriffe leben, besonders die, die für und in politischen Realauseinandersetzungen gewonnen worden sind."&lt;/ref&gt; Gunda Werner, who in 1999 outlined the basic tenets of gender democracy for the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], explained: "Gender democracy has no ready-made theoretical or practical precepts. It is an exploratory movement in search of new outlooks and models."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/sites/default/files/uploads/2014/04/zehn_thesen_von_gunda_werner_zu_geschlechterdemokratie_1999.pdf Gunda Werner: Geschlechterdemokratie 2000. Zehn Thesen zur Diskussion], PDF, October 1999The original German quotation reads: "Die Geschlechterdemokratie hat weder fertige praktische noch theoretische Konzepte. Sie ist eine Suchbewegung nach neuen Orientierungen und Modellen."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some of the fundamentals of gender democracy can be defined:

* Gender democracy is a normative precept, that is, an absolute moral and ethical [[axiom|postulate]].
* Gender democracy posits that the principles of democracy should not be limited to the sphere of politics but equally apply to the workplace and to personal life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/en/2012/01/10/gender-democracy-goal-and-organisational-principle Gender democracy as a goal and an organisational principle], Gunda Werner Institute, January 2012. See the following statement: "Gender democracy must be realised on all levels of society: on a political, social and organisational level as well as on the level of everyday interactions. On a social and personal level this also means leaving behind structural patterns of hegemonic masculinity which continue to shape career paths and hierarchies in many companies and institutions."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and methods ==

Gender democracy aims to achieve the equal participation of women and men in politics, the corporate world, and in all parts of society by reforming and abolishing undemocratic structures and all forms of power that are based on oppression and violence. This approach is based on a broad definition of democracy - one that demands equal rights and opportunities for people in all their diversity. As there is a large number of [[gender identity|gender identities]], gender democracy rejects the male // female [[dichotomy]], arguing instead that each human being - female, male, or otherwise - must have the right and the ability to self-determine their lifestyles, type of relationships in ways that go beyond stereotypical notions and any type of [[essentialism]] about men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/en/2012/01/10/gender-democracy-goal-and-organisational-principle Gender democracy as a goal and an organisational principle], Gunda Werner Institute, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender democracy investigates and questions structures and contents of democratic systems that were developed by men in order to transform them in ways that provide for gender equality. A key tool for implementing gender democracy are the so-called "gender traings" that aim to question traditional gender roles, analyze the social framework, and develop methods that provide for greater gender equality within organizations.

== Gender democracy within organizations ==

The following are some examples for organizations that have made gender democracy part of their institutional structures:

* The statutes of the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] define gender democracy as a "joint task"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/de/1989/index-309.html Satzung der Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung] § 2(3) states: "Ein besonderes Anliegen ist ihr die Verwirklichung von Geschlechterdemokratie als ein von Abhängigkeit und Dominanz freies Verhältnis der Geschlechter. Diese Gemeinschaftsaufgabe ist sowohl für die interne Zusammenarbeit als auch für die öffentliche Tätigkeit aller Bereiche ein maßgebliches Leitbild." ('A prime objective is to make gender democracy a reality, that is, relations between the genders that are free of dependency and dominance. This joint task guides all aspects of our organizational development as well as our public activities.')&lt;/ref&gt;
* The German trade union [[ver.di]] has defined the "realization of gender democracy" as one of its aims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.verdi.de/++file++5073a207deb5011af9001810/download/ver.di-Satzung.pdf Satzung ver.di - Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft] PDF, September 2015. § 5.3(f) states: "Zur Erreichung dieser Ziele dienen insbesondere: Verwirklichung der Geschlechterdemokratie und der gleichberechtigten Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern in Betrieb, Wirtschaft, Gesellschaft und Politik, auch unter Anwendung des Gender Mainstreaming." ('To achieve these aims, gender democracy and the equitable participation of women and men in the workplace, the business world, society, and politics has to be put into practice, including through the use of gender mainstreaming.'&lt;/ref&gt;
* The statutes of the German political party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] contain a paragraph titled "gender democracy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.die-linke.de/partei/dokumente/bundessatzung-der-partei-die-linke/2-die-basis-der-partei/10-geschlechterdemokratie/ Bundessatzung der Partei Die Linke. § 10 Geschlechterdemokratie]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">The term '''hermit kingdom''' can be used to refer to any country, organization or society which willfully walls itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world - The country of [[North Korea]] is a prime example of a hermit kingdom.

Korea in the age of [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]] was the subject of the first use of the term, in [[William Elliot Griffis]]' 1882 book ''Corea: The Hermit Nation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David H.|title=Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Myoung Chung|title=Korean Government Publications: An Introductory Guide. Lantham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Korea was frequently described as a hermit kingdom until 1905 when it became a protectorate of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/07/28/104992374.pdf The Obliteration of the Kingdom of Korea] by [[Stephen Bonsal]], ''The New York Times'', July 28, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still commonplace throughout Korea and it is often used by [[Koreans]] themselves to describe pre-modern Korea. Today, the term is often applied to North Korea in news and social media, and in 2009 it was used by United States former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=World&amp;ArticleID=news/capfeed/world/w022017A.xml{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--
Several other countries reluctant to engage in dialogue with the outside world have also been described as hermit kingdoms, including: [[Bhutan]],{{cn}} the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]],{{cn}} and the early African civilization of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axum]].{{cn}}

'''[[Attachment theory]]''', originating in the work of [[John Bowlby]], is a [[psychological]], [[Adaptation|evolutionary]] and [[Ethology|ethological]] theory that provides a descriptive and explanatory framework for understanding [[interpersonal relationship]]s between human beings.

In order to formulate a comprehensive theory of the nature of early attachments, Bowlby explored a range of fields including [[evolution]] by natural selection, [[object relations theory]] ([[psychoanalysis]]), [[systems theory|control systems theory]], [[evolutionary biology]] and the fields of [[ethology]] and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name="simpson"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=Simpson JA|title=Attachment Theory in Modern Evolutionary Perspective|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year = 1999|pages=115–140|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-57230-087-6|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were some preliminary papers from 1958 onwards but the full theory is published in the trilogy ''Attachment and Loss'', 1969-&amp;nbsp;82. Although in the early days Bowlby was criticised by academic psychologists and ostracised by the psychoanalytic community,&lt;ref name="Rutter 95"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Rutter M|year=1995|title=Clinical Implications of attachment Concepts: Retrospect and Prospect|journal=Journal of Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|volume=36|pages=549–571 |pmid=7650083|issue = 4|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb02314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; attachment theory has become the dominant approach to understanding early social development and given rise to a great surge of empirical research into the formation of children's close relationships.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaffer R|year=2007|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher= Blackwell|isbn=0-631-21628-6 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief description of theory==
In infants, behavior associated with attachment is primarily a process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure in situations of perceived distress or alarm, for the purpose of survival. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a ''secure base'' to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref name="Bretherton/Mul"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Bretherton I, Munholland KA |title= Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=1999|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |publisher= Guilford press|isbn= 1-57230-087-6|pages=89–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant.

The human infant is considered by attachment theorists to have a need for a secure relationship with adult caregivers, without which normal social and emotional development will not occur. However, different relationship experiences can lead to different developmental outcomes. [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed a theory of a number of [[Attachment in children|attachment patterns]] or "styles" in infants in which distinct characteristics were identified; these were secure attachment, avoidant attachment, anxious attachment and, later, disorganized attachment. In addition to care-seeking by children, peer relationships of all ages, romantic and sexual attraction, and responses to the care needs of infants or sick or elderly adults may be construed as including some components of attachment behavior.

===Earlier theories===
A theory of attachment is a framework of ideas that attempt to explain attachment, the almost universal human tendency to prefer certain familiar companions over other people, especially when ill, injured, or distressed.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, certain social preferences, like those of parents for their children, were explained by reference to instinct, or the moral worth of the individual.&lt;ref name="fildes"&gt;{{cite book|author= Fildes V| year=1988|title=Wet nursing|location= New York|publisher= Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Aboriginer.gif|thumb|left|Father and child]] The concept of infants' emotional attachment to caregivers has been known anecdotally for hundreds of years. Most early observers focused on the anxiety displayed by infants and toddlers when threatened with separation from a familiar caregiver.&lt;ref name="fildes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deS"&gt;{{cite journal|author= de Saussure RA|year=1940|title= JB Felix Descuret|journal=Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume=2|pages=417–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories about attachment were suggested from the late nineteenth century onward.&lt;ref name="Bretherton"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|page=759|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freud]]ian theory attempted a systematic consideration of infant attachment and attributed the infant's attempts to stay near the familiar person to motivation learned through feeding experiences and gratification of [[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|libidinal drives]]. In the 1930s, the British developmentalist [[Ian Dishart Suttie|Ian Suttie]] put forward the suggestion that the child's need for affection was a primary one, not based on hunger or other physical gratifications.&lt;ref name="Suttie"&gt;{{cite book|author= Suttie I |year=1935 |title= The origins of love and hate |location= London |isbn=978-0-415-21042-3|publisher= Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third theory prevalent at the time of Bowlby's development of attachment theory was "dependency". This approach posited that infants were dependent on adult caregivers but that dependency was, or should be outgrown as the individual matured. Such an approach perceived attachment behaviour in older children as [[Regression (psychology)|regressive]] whereas within attachment theory older children and adults remain attached and indeed a secure attachment is associated with independent exploratory behaviour rather than dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Prior and Glaser p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Blatz]], a Canadian psychologist and teacher of Bowlby's colleague Mary Ainsworth, was among the first to stress the need for security as a normal part of personality at all ages, as well as normality of the use of others as a secure base and the importance of social relationships for other aspects of development.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Wright M |year=1996|title= William Emet Blatz|editors=Kimble GA, Wertheimer M, Boneau CA|encyclopedia= Portraits of pioneers in psychology|volume= II|pages=199–212|location= Mahwah, NJ|publisher= Erlbaum|isbn=978-0-8058-2198-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current attachment theory focuses on social experiences in early childhood as the source of attachment in childhood and in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory was developed by Bowlby as a consequence of his dissatisfaction with existing theories of early relationships.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Cassidy J|title=The Nature of a Childs Ties|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year = 1999|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-57230-087-6|location=New York|pages=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early developments===
{{see also|Maternal deprivation}}
Bowlby was influenced by the beginnings of the [[Object relations theory|object relations school]] of [[psychoanalysis]] and in particular, [[Melanie Klein]], although he profoundly disagreed with the psychoanalytic belief then prevalent that saw infants' responses as relating to their internal fantasy life rather than to real life events. As Bowlby began to formulate his concept of attachment, he was influenced by case studies by Levy, Powdermaker, Lowrey, Bender and Goldfarb.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 51 quote"&gt;{{cite book|title= Maternal Care and Mental Health|year=1951|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organisation|quote=With monotonous regularity each put his finger on the child's inability to make relationships as being the central feature from which all other disturbances sprang, and on the history of institutionalisation or, as in the case quoted, of the child's being shifted about from one foster-mother to another as being its cause|author=Bowlby J|isbn= 1-56821-757-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the one by David Levy that associated an adopted child's lack of social emotion to her early emotional deprivation.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Levy, D| year=1935|title= American Journal of Psychiatry|volume= 94|pages=643–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby himself was interested in the role played in delinquency by poor early relationships, and explored this in a study of young thieves.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 44"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bowlby J|year=1944|title=Forty-four juvenile thieves: Their characters and home life|journal= [[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]|volume=25 |issue=19–52 |pages=107–127|quote= sometimes referred to by Bowlby's colleagues as "Ali Bowlby and the Forty Thieves"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby's contemporary [[René Spitz]] proposed that "psychotoxic" results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care.&lt;ref name="spitz"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Spitz RA|year=1951|title=The psychogenic diseases in infancy|journal= Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume= 6|pages= 255–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong influence was the work of [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film ''A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital'' illustrating the impact of loss and suffering experienced by young children separated from their primary caretakers. This film was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visiting by parents.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book | author= Schwartz J | title= Cassandra's Daughter: A History of Psychoanalysis | year=1999 | page=225 |publisher= Viking/Allen Lane |isbn= 0-670-88623-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1951 monograph for the [[World Health Organization]], [[Maternal deprivation|''Maternal Care and Mental Health'']], Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that "the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment" and that not to do so may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This proposition was both influential in terms of the effect on the institutional care of children, and highly controversial.&lt;ref name="WHO 62"&gt;{{cite book|contribution= Preface|title=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects|location=Geneva|publisher= World Health Organization|series= Public Health Papers|issue= No. 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was limited empirical data at the time and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby (1988) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{main article|Attachment theory}}
Following the publication of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health'', Bowlby sought new understanding from such fields as evolutionary biology, ethology, developmental psychology, cognitive science and control systems theory and drew upon them to formulate the innovative proposition that the mechanisms underlying an infants tie emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"/&gt; He realised that he had to develop a new theory of motivation and behaviour control, built on up-to-date science rather than the outdated psychic energy model espoused by Freud.&lt;ref name="Bretherton"/&gt; Bowlby expressed himself as having made good the "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" in "Maternal Care and Mental Health" in his later work "Attachment and Loss" published between 1969 and 1980.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 86"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bowlby J|date=December 1986 |title= Citation Classic, ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''|url= http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1986/A1986F063100001.pdf|volume=50|issue= 18|publisher=Current Contents|series=Citation Classics|accessdate = 2008-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby's first official representations were carried out for the relationship theory in three very controversial lectures in 1957 by the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton, Inge: Developmental Psychology (1992), 28, S. 759-775&lt;/ref&gt; The formal origin of attachment theory can be traced to the publication of two 1958 papers, one being Bowlby's ''The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother'', in which the precursory concepts of "attachment" were introduced, and [[Harry Harlow]]'s ''The Nature of Love'', based on the results of experiments which showed, approximately, that infant [[rhesus monkeys]] spent more time with soft mother-like dummies that offered no food than they did with dummies that provided a food source but were less pleasant to the touch.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 58"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowlby J | title = The nature of the child's tie to his mother | journal = Int J Psychoanal | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 350–73 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13610508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby 05"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bowlby J | title= The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds| publisher=Routledge Classics | year=2005 | isbn= 0-415-35481-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HH"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Harlow/love.htm|title= The Nature of Love| year=1958|author=Harlow H|journal=American Psychologist|volume= 13|pages= 573–685|doi=10.1037/h0047884|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VderH"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Van der Horst FC, LeRoy HA, Van der Veer R | year = 2008 | title = "When strangers meet": John Bowlby and Harry Harlow on attachment behavior | journal = Integrative Psychological &amp; Behavioral Science | issn = 1936-3567 | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–388 | doi = 10.1007/s12124-008-9079-2 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/47012q360531r664/fulltext.pdf | accessdate = 2008-09-11| pmid = 18766423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby followed this up with two more papers, ''Separation Anxiety'' (1960a), and ''Grief and Mourning in Infancy and Early Childhood'' (1960b).&lt;ref name="Bowlby 60"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowlby J | title = Separation anxiety | journal = Int J Psychoanal | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 89–113 | year = 1960 | pmid = 13803480 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby 60b"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1960|author=Bowlby J |title=Grief and mourning in infancy and early childhood |journal= The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child |volume=15 |pages=9–52|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, Bowlby's former colleague, [[Mary Ainsworth]] was completing extensive observational studies on the nature of infant attachments in [[Uganda]] with Bowlby's ethological theories in mind. Mary Ainsworth's innovative methodology and comprehensive observational studies informed much of the theory, expanded its concepts and enabled some of its tenets to be empirically tested.&lt;ref name="Bretherton2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=28|pages= 759–775|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory was finally presented in 1969 in ''Attachment'' the first volume of the ''Attachment and Loss'' trilogy.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bowlby J|year=1969|title=Attachment|series=Attachment and loss.

====Ethology====
Bowlby's attention was first drawn to ethology when he read [[Konrad Lorenz|Lorenz]]'s 1952 publication in draft form although Lorenz had published much earlier work.&lt;ref name="lorenz 37"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lorenz KZ | year = 1937 | title = The companion in the bird's world | journal = The Auk | volume = 54 | pages = 245–273 | doi=10.2307/4078077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this he encountered the work of [[Tinbergen]],&lt;ref name="tinbergen"&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen N | title=The study of instinct |isbn=978-0-19-857722-5| year=1951 | publisher=Oxford University Press|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to collaborate with [[Robert Hinde]].&lt;ref name="3 vans"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van der Horst FC, Van der Veer R, Van IJzendoorn MH | year = 2007 | title = John Bowlby and ethology: An annotated interview with Robert Hinde | journal = Attachment &amp; Human Development | issn = 1469-2988 | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–335 | doi = 10.1080/14616730601149809 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a773405215 | accessdate = 2007-11-30 | pmid = 17852051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he stated "the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests".&lt;ref name="bowlby 53"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bowlby J |title=Critical phases in the development of social responses in man and other animals |year=1953 |series=New Biology|location=London|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Lorenz and Tinbergen1.jpg|thumb|right|Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen]]

Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of "[[imprinting (psychology)#Filial imprinting|imprinting]]" and felt that it might have some parallels to human attachment. Imprinting, a behavior characteristic of some birds and a very few mammals, involves rapid learning of recognition by a young bird or animal exposed to a conspecific or an object or organism that behaves suitably. The learning is possible only within a limited age period, known as a critical period. This rapid learning and development of familiarity with an animate or inanimate object is accompanied by a tendency to stay close to the object and to follow when it moves; the young creature is said to have been imprinted on the object when this occurs. As the imprinted bird or animal reaches reproductive maturity, its courtship behavior is directed toward objects that resemble the imprinting object. Bowlby's attachment concepts later included the ideas that attachment involves learning from experience during a limited age period, and that the learning that occurs during that time influences adult behavior. However, he did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment, nor assume that human development was as simple as that of birds. He did, however, consider that attachment behavior was best explained as instinctive in nature, an approach that does not rule out the effect of experience, but that stresses the readiness the young child brings to social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby (1969) 2nd ed. pp. 220–223&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Lorenz's work had been done years before Bowlby formulated his ideas, and indeed some ideas characteristic of ethology were already discussed among psychoanalysts some time before the presentation of attachment theory.&lt;ref name="hartman"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Hartmann H |year=1950 |title= Psychoanalysis and developmental psychology|journal= Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume= 5|pages= 7–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoanalysis====
Bowlby's view of attachment was also influenced by psychoanalytical concepts and the earlier work of psychoanalysts. In particular he was influenced by observations of young children separated from familiar caregivers, as provided during World War II by [[Anna Freud]] and her colleague Dorothy Burlingham.&lt;ref name="anna"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Freud A, Burlingham DT | title=War and children | year=1943 |isbn=978-0-8371-6942-2 | publisher=Medical War Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Es sci 1937 spainish-civil-war 02 Evacuation.jpg|thumb|left|Evacuee children in 1937]] Observations of separated children's grief by [[René Spitz]] were another important factor in the development of attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Spitz R | year=1945 | title=Hospitalism: An Inquiry into the Genesis of Psychiatric Conditions in Early Childhood}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds. He rejected both Freudian "[[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|drive-theory]]", which he called the [[Cupboard Love]] theory of relationships, and early object-relations theory as both in his view failed to see the attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes pp. 62–3&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking in terms of primary attachment and neo-darwinism, Bowlby identified as what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis, namely the overemphasis of internal dangers at the expense of external threat, and the picture of the development of personality via linear "phases" with "[[regression (psychology)|regression]]" to fixed points accounting for psychological illness. Instead he posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes pp. 64–5&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internal working model====
The important concept of the internal working model of social relationships was adopted by Bowlby from the work of the philosopher [[Kenneth Craik]],&lt;ref name="Craik"&gt;{{cite book|author= Craik K |year=1943|title= The Nature of Explanation|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-09445-0|publisher= Cambridge University Press |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had noted the adaptiveness of the ability of thought to predict events, and stressed the survival value of and natural selection for this ability. According to Craik, prediction occurs when a "small-scale model" consisting of brain events is used to represent not only the external environment, but the individual's own possible actions. This model allows a person to mentally try out alternatives and to use knowledge of the past in responding to the present and future. At about the same time that Bowlby was applying Craik's ideas to the study of attachment, other psychologists were using these concepts in discussion of adult perception and cognition.&lt;ref name="JLaird"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnson-Laird PN |year=1983|isbn=0-674-56881-8 
|title= Mental models|location= Cambridge, MA |publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cybernetics====
The theory of control systems (cybernetics), developing during the 1930s and '40s, influenced Bowlby's thinking.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robbins P, Zacks JM | title = Attachment theory and cognitive science: commentary on Fonagy and Target | journal = J Am Psychoanal Assoc | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 457–67; discussion 493–501 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17601100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The young child's need for proximity to the attachment figure was seen as balancing [[wikt:homeostasis|homeostatically]] with the need for exploration. The actual distance maintained would be greater or less as the balance of needs changed; for example, the approach of a stranger, or an injury, would cause the child to seek proximity when a moment before he had been exploring at a distance.

===Behavioural development and attachment===
[[Behavior analysis of child development|Behaviour analysts]] have constructed models of attachment. Such models are based on the importance of contingent relationships. Behaviour analytic models have received support from research.&lt;ref name="kassow"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kassow DZ, Dunst CJ |year=2004|title= Relationship between parental contingent-responsiveness and attachment outcomes|journal= Bridges|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meta-analytic reviews.&lt;ref name="dunst"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dunst CJ, Kassow DZ|year=2008|title=Caregiver Sensitivity, Contingent Social Responsiveness, and Secure Infant Attachment|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention|volume=5|issue=1|pages=40–56|url=http://www.behavior-analyst-online.org BAO|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309131808/http://www.behavior-analyst-online.org/|archivedate=2008-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments===
Although research on attachment behaviors continued after Bowlby's death in 1990, there was a period of time when attachment theory was considered to have run its course. Some authors argued that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organizing principle with varying behaviors resulting from contextual factors.&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sroufe LA, Waters E |year=1977|title= Attachment as an organizational construct|journal= Child Development|volume= 48 |pages=1184–1199|doi=10.2307/1128475|jstor=1128475|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption  that attachment is expressed identically in all humans.&lt;ref name="Tronick"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tronick EZ, Morelli GA, Ivey PK |year=1992|title=The Efe forager infant and toddler's pattern of social relationships: Multiple and simultaneous|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|pages=568–577|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.4.568|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study conducted in [[Sapporo]], Behrens, et al., 2007 found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main &amp; Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Behrens"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behrens KY, Hesse E, Main M | title = Mothers' attachment status as determined by the Adult Attachment Interview predicts their 6-year-olds' reunion responses: a study conducted in Japan | journal = Dev Psychol | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1553–67 |date=November 2007 | pmid = 18020832 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1553 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/43/6/1553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MainCass"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Main M, Cassidy J |year=1988|title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period|journal=  Developmental Psychology|volume= 24|pages= 415–426|doi= 10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in attachment theory continued, and the theory was later extended to adult romantic relationships by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver.&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1987"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR | title = Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 511–24 |date=March 1987 | pmid = 3572722 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511| url = http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/52/3/511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1990"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1990|title= Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 59|pages= 270–280|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1994"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1994|title= Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships|journal= Psychological Inquiry|volume= 5|pages= 1–22|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Fonagy]] and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship by way of such aspects of cognitive science as mentalization, the ability to estimate what the beliefs or intentions of another person may be.&lt;ref name="Robbins"/&gt; A "natural experiment" has permitted extensive study of attachment issues, as researchers have followed the thousands of Romanian orphans who were adopted into Western families after the end of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by [[Michael Rutter]], has followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption and new relationships, and the physical and medical problems associated with their early lives. Studies on the Romanian adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, have in fact yielded reason for optimism. Many of the children have developed quite well, and the researchers have noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rutter M|date=Jan–Feb 2002| title = Nature, nurture, and development: From evangelism through science toward policy and practice| journal = Child Development| issn = 0009-3920| volume = 73| issue = 1| pages = 1–21| pmid = 14717240
| doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroscientific studies are examining the physiological underpinnings of observable attachment style, such as vagal tone which influences capacities for intimacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Porges S|date=2011| title = The polyvagal theory: Neurophysiological foundations of emotions, attachment, communication, self-regulation|publisher = Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt; stress response which influences threat reactivity (Lupien, McEwan, Gunnar &amp; Heim, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Lupien SJ, McEwan BS, Gunnar MR, Heim C|date=2009| title = Effects of stress throughout the lifespan on the brain, behaviour and cognition| journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 10| issue = 6| pages = 434–445| doi = 10.1038/nrn2639}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as neuroendocrinology such as oxytocin,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Carter CS |date=1998| title = Neuroendocrine perspectives on social attachment and love| journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 23| issue = 8| pages = 779–818| doi=10.1016/s0306-4530(98)00055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Uvnas-Moberg K |date=1996| title = Neuroendocrinology of the mother-child interaction| journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism| volume = 7|  pages = 126–131| doi=10.1016/1043-2760(96)00036-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of studies underscore the fact that attachment is an embodied capacity not only a cognitive one.

===Effects of changing times and approaches===
Some authors have noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. The implication of this connection is that attachment-related experiences (and perhaps attachment itself) may alter as young children's experience of care change historically. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers and being cared for outside the home while the mothers work.[[File:The trinity of life.png|Parents and baby|thumb|right]] This social change, in addition to increasing abortion rates, has also made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries, and has increased the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and even gained some legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp. 152–56&lt;/ref&gt;

One focus of attachment research has been on the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called "day care wars" of the late 20th century, during which the deleterious effects of day care were stressed.&lt;ref name="belsky"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belsky J, Rovine MJ | title = Nonmaternal care in the first year of life and the security of infant-parent attachment | journal = Child Dev | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 157–67 |date=February 1988 | pmid = 3342709 | doi = 10.2307/1130397 | jstor = 1130397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a beneficial result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues and the need for relationship-building through techniques such as assignment of a child to a specific care provider. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to follow through on these considerations, nevertheless a larger number of infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than was the case in the past, and emotional development of children in nonparental care may be different today than it was in the 1980s or in Bowlby's time.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp. 160–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, any critique of attachment theory needs to consider how the theory has connected with changes in other psychological theories. Research on attachment issues has begun to include concepts related to [[behaviour genetics]] and to the study of [[temperament]] (constitutional factors in personality), but it is unusual for popular presentations of attachment theory to include these. Importantly, some researchers and theorists have begun to connect attachment with the study of [[mentalization]] or [[Theory of Mind]], the capacity that allows human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions, and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression or eye movement.&lt;ref name="Fonagy et al."&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Fonagy P, Gergely G, Jurist EL, Target M |year=2002 |title=Affect regulation, mentalization, and the development of the self|location= New York|publisher=Other Press|isbn=1-59051-161-1 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection of theory of mind with the internal working model of social relationships may open a new area of study and lead to alterations in attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp. 165–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===1950s to the 1970s===
The [[maternal deprivation]] hypothesis, attachment theory's precursor, was enormously controversial. Ten years after the publication of the hypothesis, Ainsworth listed nine concerns that she felt were the chief points of controversy.&lt;ref name="WHO 62quote"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Ainsworth MD|year=1962|title= The effects of maternal deprivation: A review of findings and controversy in the context of research strategy|encyclopedia=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects|location=Geneva|publisher= World Health Organization|quote=1) The vagueness of the term "maternal deprivation" used in the description of a child's history of attachment experiences. 2) The lack of clarity of the theory's implications for experiences with multiple caregivers. 3) The implications for the theory of the degree of variability following "deprivation". 4) The question of what specific effects result from "deprivation". 5) The question of individual differences in children's reactions to separation or loss. 6) The question of the degree of permanence of specific effects of "deprivation". 7) The question of delinquency as an infrequent outcome of separation and loss. 8) The question of specifics of deprivation and whether these have to do with the caregiver or the more general environment. 9) Controversies having to do with the effects of genetic defects or of brain damage on the developmental outcome.|series= Public Health Papers|issue= No. 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ainsworth separated the three dimensions of maternal deprivation into lack of maternal care, distortion of maternal care and discontinuity of maternal care. She analysed the dozens of studies undertaken in the field and concluded that the basic assertions of the maternal deprivation hypothesis were sound although the controversy continued.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 123–24&lt;/ref&gt; As the formulation of attachment theory progressed, critics commented on empirical support for the theory and for the possible alternative explanations for results of empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 115–18&lt;/ref&gt; Wootton questioned the suggestion that early attachment history (as it would now be called) had a lifelong impact.&lt;ref name="Wootton"&gt;{{cite book|author= Wootton B|isbn=978-0-313-20339-8 
|year=1959|title=Social science and social pathology|location= London|publisher= Allen and Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 found the young relationship theory in the DDR ([[East Germany]]) by an essay of [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] in the ''Zeitschrift für ärztliche Fortbildung'' (magazine for a medical further education) and [[Eva Schmidt-Kolmer]] carried out some journal extracts from Bowlby's essay ''Maternal Care and mental Health'' for WHO.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, J.: ''Über den Verlust mütterlicher Fürsorge in früher Kindheit.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für ärztliche Fortbildung'' 1957, 21/22&lt;/ref&gt; In the following period it came to extensive comparative development psychological in the DDR at the end of the fifties. Examinations between family-bound babies and small children, day and week hayracks-as well as Institution children. The findings could do with regard to the morbidity for the family-bound children, the physical and emotional development as well as adaption disturbances at change of environment. After the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] 1961 it didn't come to any additional publications in the DDR Relationship theory and comparative investigations with family-bound children. The previous ones Research results weren't published further and got like the relationship theory into oblivion in the DDR in the subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fhpotsdam/frontdoor/index/index/docId/226 Plückhahn, Jens: ''Dauerheime für Säuglinge und Kleinkinder in der DDR aus dem Blickwinkel der Bindungstheorie''.

In the 1970s, problems with the emphasis on attachment as a trait (a stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with important organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to consider that "attachment (as implying anything but infant-adult interaction) [may be said to have] outlived its usefulness as a developmental construct..." and that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"/&gt; Children may achieve a given function, such as a sense of security, in many different ways and the various but functionally comparable behaviours should be categorized as related to each other. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept (the organisation of exploration of an unfamiliar situation around returns to a familiar person) as "central to the logic and coherence of attachment theory and to its status as an organizational construct."&lt;ref name="WatCum"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters E, Cummings EM | title = A secure base from which to explore close relationships | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 164–72 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10836570 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00130| url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0009-3920&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=71&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Thompson pointed out that "other features of early parent-child relationships that develop concurrently with attachment security, including negotiating conflict and establishing cooperation, also must be considered in understanding the legacy of early attachments."&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thompson RA | title = The legacy of early attachments | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 145–52 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10836568 |url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0009-3920&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=71&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=145 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific disciplines===

====Psychoanalysis====
From an early point in the development of attachment theory, there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with the various branches of psychoanalysis. Like other members of the [[Object relations theory|British object-relations]] group, Bowlby rejected [[Melanie Klein]]'s views that considered the infant to have certain mental capacities at birth and to continue to develop emotionally on the basis of fantasy rather than of real experiences. But Bowlby also withdrew from the object-relations approach (exemplified, for example, by Anna Freud), as he abandoned the "drive theory" assumptions in favor of a set of automatic, instinctual behaviour systems that included attachment. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on problems similar to those he addressed.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year=1998|title= Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 92–119|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cass 98"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cassidy J|year=1998|title=Commentary on Steele and Steele: Attachment and object relations theories and the concept of independent behavioral systems|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 120–26|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele 98"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year= 1998|title= Debate: Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages=92–119 |doi=10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby was effectively ostracized from the psychoanalytic community.&lt;ref name="Rutter 95"/&gt; More recently some psychoanalysts have sought to reconcile the two theories in the form of [[attachment-based psychotherapy]], a therapeutic approach.

====Ethology====
Ethologists expressed concern about the adequacy of some of the research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalisation to humans from animal studies.&lt;ref name="crnic"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Crnic LS, Reite ML, Shucard DW |year=1982|title= Animal models of human behavior: Their application to the study of attachment|veditors=Emde RN, Harmon RJ |isbn=978-0-306-40849-6 |encyclopedia= The development of attachment and affiliative systems|pages=31–42|location= New york|publisher= Plenum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brann"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Brannigan CR, Humphries DA |year=1972|title= Human non-verbal behaviour: A means of communication|editor=Blurton-Jones N|isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |encyclopedia= Ethological studies of child behaviour|pages= 37–64|publisher= Cambridge University Press|quote=...it must be emphasized that data derived from species other than man can be used only to ''suggest'' hypotheses that may be worth applying to man for testing by critical observations. In the absence of critical evidence derived from observing man such hypotheses are no more than intelligent guesses. There is a danger in human ethology... that interesting, but untested, hypotheses may gain the status of accepted theory. [One author] has coined the term 'ethologism' as a label for the present vogue [in 1970]... for uncritically invoking the findings from ethological studies of other species as necessary and sufficient explanations... Theory based on superficial analogies between species has always impeded biological understanding... We conclude that a valid ethology of man must be based primarily on data derived from man, and not on data obtained from fish, birds, or other primates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schur, discussing Bowlby's use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that these concepts as used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in ethology itself.&lt;ref name="schur"&gt;{{cite journal |quote=Bowlby...assumes the fully innate, unlearned character of most complex behavior patterns...(whereas recent animal studies showed)...both the early impact of learning and the great intricacy of the interaction between mother and litter"...(and applies)..."to human behavior an instinct concept which neglects the factor of development and learning far beyond even the position taken by Lorenz [the ethological theorist] in his early propositions| author = Schur M | title = Discussion of Dr. John Bowlby's paper | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 15 |pages = 63–84 | year = 1960 | pmid = 13749000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Szymon i Krystian 003.JPG|thumb|right|Ready to explore]]
Ethologists and others writing in the 1960s and 1970s questioned the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment, and offered alternative approaches. For example, crying on separation from a familiar person was suggested as an index of attachment.&lt;ref name="SchafEm"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schaffer HR, Emerson PE |year=1964|title= The development of social attachment in infancy|journal= Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, serial no. 94|volume=29|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observational studies of young children in natural settings also provided behaviours that might be considered to indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects and bringing them to the mother, but usually not other adults.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Anderson JW|year=1972|title= Attachment behaviour out of doors|editor= Blurton-Jones N|isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |encyclopedia= Ethological studies of child behaviour|pages=199–216|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ethological work tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, work like that just described led to the conclusion that "[w]e appear to disagree with Bowlby and Ainsworth on some of the details of the child's interactions with its mother and other people". Some ethologists pressed for further observational data, arguing that psychologists "are still writing as if there is a real entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures."&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Jones NB, Leach GM |year=1972|title= Behaviour of children and their mothers at separation and greeting|isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |editor=Blurton-Jones N |encyclopedia= Ethological studies of child behaviour|pages= 217–48|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hinde]] expressed concern with the use of the word "attachment" to imply that it was an intervening variable or a hypothesised internal mechanism rather than a data term. He suggested that confusion about the meaning of attachment theory terms "could lead to the 'instinct fallacy' of postulating a mechanism [[Wikt:isomorphisms|isomorphous]] with the behaviours, and then using that as an explanation for the behaviour". However, Hinde considered "attachment behaviour system" to be an appropriate term of theory language which did not offer the same problems "because it refers to postulated control systems that determine the relations between different kinds of behaviour."&lt;ref name="Hinde 82"&gt;{{cite book|author= Hinde R|year=1982|isbn=978-0-00-686034-1|title= Ethology|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive development====
Bowlby's reliance on [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s theory of cognitive development gave rise to questions about object permanence (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) and its connection to early attachment behaviours, and about the fact that the infant's ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother's absence seems to occur some months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible.&lt;ref name="fraiberg"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fraiberg S | title = Libidinal object constancy and mental representation | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 24 |pages = 9–47 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5353377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby's day that present views can be far more specific than those of Bowlby's time.&lt;ref name="waters2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters HS, Waters E | title = The attachment working models concept: among other things, we build script-like representations of secure base experiences | journal = Attachment &amp; Human Development | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 185–97 |date=September 2006 | pmid = 16938702 | doi = 10.1080/14616730600856016 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;doi=10.1080/14616730600856016&amp;magic=pubmed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Behaviourism====
In 1969, Gerwitz discussed how mother and child could provide each other with [[positive reinforcement]] experiences through their mutual attention and therefore learn to stay close together; this explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment.&lt;ref name="Gewirtz"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Gewirtz N|year=1969|title=Potency of a social reinforcer as a function of satiation and recovery|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 1|pages= 2–13|doi= 10.1037/h0026802}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behaviourism|Learning theory]] saw attachment as a remnant of dependency and the quality of attachment as merely a response to the caregivers cues. [[Behaviourism|Behaviourists]] saw behaviours such as crying as a random activity that meant nothing until reinforced by a caregivers response therefore frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behaviour to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth's research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists view.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 166–73&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decade, [[Behavior analysis of child development|behaviour analysts]] have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of contingent relationships. These behaviour analytic models have received some support from research&lt;ref name="kassow"/&gt; and meta-analytic reviews.&lt;ref name="dunst"/&gt;

===Methodology===
There has been critical discussion of conclusions drawn from clinical and observational work, and whether or not they actually support tenets of attachment theory. For example, Skuse based criticism of a basic tenet of attachment theory on the work of Anna Freud with children from Theresienstadt, who apparently developed relatively normally in spite of serious deprivation during their early years. This discussion concluded from Freud's case and from some other studies of extreme deprivation that there is an excellent prognosis for children with this background, unless there are biological or genetic risk factors.&lt;ref name="Skuse"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Skuse D | title = Extreme deprivation in early childhood--II.

Some of Bowlby's interpretations of the data reported by James Robertson were eventually rejected by the researcher, who reported data from 13 young children who were cared for in ideal circumstances during separation from their mothers. Robertson noted, "...Bowlby acknowledges that he draws mainly upon James Robertson's institutional data. But in developing his grief and mourning theory, Bowlby, without adducing non-institutional data, has generalized Robertson's concept of protest, despair and denial beyond the context from which it was derived. He asserts that these are the usual responses of young children to separation from the mother regardless of circumstance..."; however, of the 13 separated children who received good care, none showed protest and despair, but "coped with separation from the mother when cared for in conditions from which the adverse factors which complicate institutional studies were absent".&lt;ref name="robertson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson J, Robertson J | title = Young children in brief separation. A fresh look | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 264–315 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5163230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second volume of the trilogy, ''Separation'', published two years later, Bowlby acknowledged that Robertsons foster study had caused him to modify his views on the traumatic consequences of separation in which insufficient weight was given to the influence of skilled care from a familiar substitute.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have questioned the idea of attachment patterns, thought to be measured by techniques like the Strange Situation Protocol. Such techniques yield a taxonomy of categories considered to represent qualitative difference in attachment relationships (for example, secure attachment versus avoidant). However, a categorical model is not necessarily the best representation of individual difference in attachment. An examination of data from 1139 15-month-olds showed that variation was continuous rather than falling into natural groupings.&lt;ref name="FraSpe2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraley RC, Spieker SJ | title = Are infant attachment patterns continuously or categorically distributed?

===1980s on===
Following the argument made in the 1970s that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organising principle with varying behaviours resulting from contextual factors,&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"/&gt; later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption  that attachment is expressed identically in all humans.&lt;ref name="Tronick"/&gt; Various studies appeared to show cultural differences but a 2007 study conducted in [[Sapporo]] in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main &amp; Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Behrens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MainCass"/&gt;

Recent critics such as [[Judith Rich Harris|J. R. Harris]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Jerome Kagan]] are generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism ([[Nature versus nurture]]) and stress the possible effects of later experience on personality.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Nurture Assumption]]: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do|isbn=978-0-684-84409-1 |author=Harris JR|year=1998|location=New York|publisher=Free press |authorlink=Judith Rich Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-14-027605-3

The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 248–64&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has not bourne out  Kagan's argument and broadly demonstrates that it is the caregivers' behaviours that form the child's attachment style although how this style is expressed may differ with temperament.&lt;ref name="Pearce,2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pearce R|year=2009|title= Attachment Theory Predicts the Formation of Romantic Relationships|journal= Griffith University Undergraduate Psychology Journal|url= http://www104.griffith.edu.au/index.php/psyche/article/viewFile/137/286|format=PDF|volume= 1|pages= 25–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris and Pinker have put forward the notion that the influence of parents has been much exaggerated and that socialisation takes place primarily in peer groups, although H. Rudolph Schaffer concludes that parents and peers fulfill different functions and have distinctive roles in children's development.&lt;ref name="schaffer"&gt;{{cite book|author =Schaffer HR|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher=Blackwell|year = 2004|isbn=978-0-631-21627-8|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Concern about attachment theory has been raised with regard to the fact that infants often have multiple relationships, within the family as well as in child care settings, and that the [[wikt:dyadic|dyadic]] model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences.&lt;ref name="McHale"&gt;{{cite journal|author= McHale JP|year=2007|title=When infants grow up in multiperson relationship systems|journal= Infant Mental Health Journal|volume= 28|pages= 370–92|doi= 10.1002/imhj.20142|issue= 4|pmc= 3079566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">In computer science, '''hub labels''' or the '''hub-labelling algorithm''' is a method that consumes much fewer resources than the [[lookup table]] but is still extremely fast for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.&lt;ref&gt;Ittai Abraham, Daniel Delling, Andrew V. Goldberg, Renato F. Werneck, [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/HL-TR.pdf « A Hub-Based Labeling Algorithm for Shortest Paths on Road Networks »], Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, 1065 La Avenida, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ittai Abraham, Daniel Delling, Andrew V. Goldberg, Renato F. Werneck, [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/HL-TR.pdf « Hierarchical Hub Labelings for Shortest Paths »], Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, 1065 La Avenida, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method allows at the most with two SELECT statements and the analysis of two strings to compute the shortest path between two vertices of a graph.
For a graph that is oriented like a road graph, this technique requires the prior computation of two tables from structures constructed using the method of the [[contraction hierarchies]]. 
In the end, these two computed tables will have as many rows as nodes present within the graph. For each row (each node), a label will be calculated.

A label is a string containing the distance information between the current node (the node of the row) and all the other nodes that can be reached with an ascending search on the relative multi-level structure. The advantage of these distances is that they all represent the shortest paths. 

So, for future queries, the search of a shortest path will start from the source on the first table and the destination on the second table, from which it will be search within the labels for the common nodes with the associated distance information. Only the smallest sum of distances will be kept as the shortest path result.

[[File:HubbleDeepField.800px.jpg|thumb|300px|The Hubble Deep Field]]

The '''Hubble Deep Field''' ('''HDF''') is an image of a small region in the [[constellation]] [[Ursa Major]], constructed from a series of observations by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. It covers an area about 2.6 [[arcminute]]s on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in angular size to a [[tennis ball]] at a distance of 100&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Big Questions The Universe |first1=Stuart |last1=Clark |publisher=Hachette UK |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84916-609-6 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVhBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] over ten consecutive days between December 18 and December 28, 1995.&lt;ref name="Ferguson1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hubble_image" /&gt;

The field is so small that only a few foreground [[star]]s in the [[Milky Way]] lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are [[galaxy|galaxies]], some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image in the [[physical cosmology|study of the early universe]].

Three years after the HDF observations were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named the [[Hubble Deep Field South]]. The similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the [[universe]] is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the [[cosmological principle]]). A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]]. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]] (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive [[astronomy|astronomical]] image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the [[Hubble eXtreme Deep Field]] (XDF) was released in 2012.

==Conception==
[[File:Improvement in Hubble images after SMM1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The dramatic improvement in Hubble's imaging capabilities after corrective [[optics]] were installed encouraged attempts to obtain very deep images of distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]].]]

One of the key aims of the astronomers who designed the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high [[optical resolution]] to study distant galaxies to a level of detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the [[atmosphere]], Hubble avoids atmospheric [[airglow]] allowing it to take more sensitive [[Visible light|visible]] and [[ultraviolet light]] images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good [[adaptive optics]] correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10&amp;nbsp;m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from [[spherical aberration]] when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because [[Speed of light|light takes billions of years]] to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows a better understanding of how they evolve.&lt;ref name=Ferguson1998&gt;Ferguson et al. (1999), p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

After the spherical aberration was corrected during [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-61]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="Trauger1994"&gt;Trauger et al. (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; the improved imaging capabilities of the telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The [[Hubble Medium Deep Survey|Medium Deep Survey]] (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham et al. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 10% of the HST's observation time is designated as Director's Discretionary (DD) Time, and is typically awarded to astronomers who wish to study unexpected transient phenomena, such as [[supernova]]e. Once Hubble's corrective optics were shown to be performing well, [[Robert Williams (astronomer)|Robert Williams]], the then-director of the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]], decided to devote a substantial fraction of his DD time during 1995 to the study of distant galaxies. A special Institute Advisory Committee recommended that the WFPC2 be used to image a "typical" patch of sky at a high [[galactic latitude]], using several [[optical filter]]s. A [[working group]] was set up to develop and implement the project.&lt;ref name="Williams1996"&gt;Williams et al. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Target selection==
[[File:Hubble Deep Field location.gif|thumb|300px|The HDF is at the centre of this image of one [[degree (angle)|degree]] of sky. The Moon as seen from Earth would fill roughly one quarter of this image.]]
[[File:Hubble Ultra Deep Field diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram illustrating comparative sampling distance of the HDF and the 2004 Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]]

The field selected for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It had to be at a high galactic latitude, because [[interstellar dust|dust]] and obscuring matter in the plane of the [[Milky Way]]'s disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of [[visible light]] (such as foreground stars), and [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] and [[X-ray]] emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background [[infrared cirrus|infrared 'cirrus']], the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of [[hydrogen]] gas ([[H I region]]s).&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

These criteria restricted the field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble's 'continuous viewing zones' (CVZs)—the areas of sky which are not [[occultation|occulted]] by the Earth or the [[moon]] during Hubble's orbit.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt; The working group decided to concentrate on the northern CVZ, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the [[Keck telescopes]], the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] telescopes and the [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.&lt;ref name="north_cvz"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty fields satisfying these criteria were initially identified, from which three optimal candidate fields were selected, all within the constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. [[Radio]] snapshot observations with the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] ruled out one of these fields because it contained a bright radio source, and the final decision between the other two was made on the basis of the availability of guide stars near the field: Hubble observations normally require a pair of nearby stars on which the telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors can lock during an exposure, but given the importance of the HDF observations, the working group required a second set of back-up guide stars. The field that was eventually selected is located at a [[right ascension]] of {{RA|12|36|49.4}} and a [[declination]] of {{DEC|+62|12|58}};&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="north_cvz" /&gt; it is approximately 2.6 [[arcminute]]s in width,&lt;ref name="Ferguson1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000a"&gt;Ferguson (2000a)&lt;/ref&gt; or 1/12 the width of the Moon. The area is approximately 1/28,000,000 of the total area of the sky.&lt;ref name=Curious&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/98-the-universe/galaxies/observing-galaxies/535-how-big-is-the-hubble-ultra-deep-field-image-intermediate|title=How big is the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image|date=April 2016|publisher=Curious about astronomy?

==Observations==
[[File:Hubble Deep Field observing geometry.svg|thumb|200px|left|The HDF was in Hubble's northern Continuous Viewing Zone, as shown by this diagram.]]

Once a field had been selected, an observing strategy had to be developed. An important decision was to determine which [[filter (optics)|filter]]s the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including [[narrowband]] filters isolating particular [[emission line]]s of [[astrophysical]] interest, and [[broadband]] filters useful for the study of the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the '[[throughput]]' of each filter—the total proportion of light that it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with [[bandpass]]es overlapping as little as possible were desirable.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

In the end, four broadband filters were chosen, centred at [[wavelength]]s of 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (near-[[ultraviolet]]), 450&amp;nbsp;nm (blue light), 606&amp;nbsp;nm (red light) and 814&amp;nbsp;nm (near-[[infrared]]). Because the [[quantum efficiency]] of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300&amp;nbsp;nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is primarily due to [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

Between December 18 and December 28, 1995—during which time Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times—342 images of the target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total exposure times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300&amp;nbsp;nm), 33.5 hours (450&amp;nbsp;nm), 30.3 hours (606&amp;nbsp;nm) and 34.3 hours (814&amp;nbsp;nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by [[cosmic ray]]s, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

==Data processing==
[[File:Galaxy in each of the four wavelengths comprising the HDF.jpg|thumb|300px|A section of the HDF about 14 [[arcseconds]] across in each of the four [[wavelength]]s used to construct the final version: 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (top left), 450 nm (top right), 606 nm (bottom left) and 814 nm (bottom right)]]
The production of a final combined image at each [[wavelength]] was a complex process. Bright [[pixel]]s caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by [[cosmic ray]]s in one exposure but not the other. Trails of [[space debris]] and [[artificial satellite]]s were present in the original images, and were carefully removed.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

Scattered light from the Earth was evident in about a quarter of the data frames, creating a visible "X" pattern on the images. This was removed by taking an image affected by scattered light, aligning it with an unaffected image, and subtracting the unaffected image from the affected one. The resulting image was smoothed, and could then be subtracted from the bright frame. This procedure removed almost all of the scattered light from the affected images.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

Once the 342 individual images were cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, they had to be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called '[[Drizzle (image processing)|drizzling]]', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 [[arcsecond]]s across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.&lt;ref name="Williams1996" /&gt;

The data processing yielded four [[monochrome]] images (at 300&amp;nbsp;nm, 450&amp;nbsp;nm, 606&amp;nbsp;nm and 814&amp;nbsp;nm), one at each wavelength.&lt;ref name=Ferguson1/&gt; One image was designated as red (814&amp;nbsp;nm), the second as green (606&amp;nbsp;nm) and the third as blue (450&amp;nbsp;nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image.&lt;ref name=Hubble_image&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA|date=1995|title=Hubble's Deepest View of the Universe Unveils Bewildering Galaxies across Billions of Years|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/01/image/a/|accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the [[human eye]] would actually perceive.&lt;ref name=Ferguson1&gt;Ferguson et al. (1999), p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

About 3,000 distinct galaxies could be identified in the images,&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000b"&gt;Ferguson et al. (2000b)&lt;/ref&gt; with both [[irregular galaxy|irregular]] and [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]] clearly visible, although some galaxies in the field are only a few pixels across. In all, the HDF is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars; by far the majority of objects in the field are distant galaxies.&lt;ref name="Flynn1996" /&gt;

There are about fifty blue point-like objects in the HDF. Many seem to be associated with nearby galaxies, which together form chains and arcs: these are likely to be regions of intense [[star formation]]. Others may be distant [[quasar]]s. Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are [[white dwarf]]s, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.&lt;ref name="Hansen1998"&gt;Hansen (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific results==
[[File:HDF extracts showing many galaxies.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Details from the HDF illustrate the wide variety of galaxy shapes, sizes and colours found in the distant universe.]]
The HDF data provided extremely rich material for cosmologists to analyse and by late 2014 the associated scientific paper for the image had received over 900 citations.&lt;ref name="nasa_ads"&gt;&lt;!-- Referencing the _citation count_, not the article --&gt;{{cite journal | title=NASA ADS entry for Williams et al. (1996) | publisher=The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System | bibcode=1996AJ....112.1335W |author1=Williams, Robert E. |author2=Blacker, Brett |author3=Dickinson, Mark |author4=Dixon, W.

As the Universe expands, more distant objects recede from the Earth faster, in what is called the [[Hubble Flow]]. The light from very distant galaxies is significantly affected by the [[Redshift#Expansion of space|cosmological redshift]]. While [[quasar]]s with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced.&lt;ref name="key_findings" /&gt; The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion [[light-year]]s. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF ([[Lyman-break galaxy|Lyman-break galaxies]]) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.&lt;ref name=Ferguson2&gt;Ferguson et al. (1999), p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

The HDF galaxies contained a considerably larger proportion of disturbed and irregular galaxies than the local universe;&lt;ref name="key_findings" /&gt; galaxy collisions and mergers were more common in the young universe as it was much smaller than today. It is believed that giant [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] form when spirals and irregular galaxies collide.

The wealth of galaxies at different stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of [[star formation]] over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies are somewhat crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8–10 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.&lt;ref name="Connolly1997"&gt;Connolly et al. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important result from the HDF was the very small number of foreground stars present.  For years astronomers had been puzzling over the nature of [[dark matter]], mass which seems to be undetectable but which observations implied made up about 90% of the mass of the Universe.&lt;ref name="Trimble1987"&gt;Trimble (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; One theory was that dark matter might consist of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects ([[MACHO]]s)—faint but massive objects such as [[red dwarf]]s and [[planet]]s in the outer regions of galaxies.&lt;ref name="Alcock1992"&gt;Alcock et al. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The HDF showed, however, that there were not significant numbers of red dwarfs in the outer parts of our galaxy.&lt;ref name="key_findings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flynn1996"&gt;Flynn et al. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multifrequency followup==
[[File:Hubble Deep Field by Spitzer.jpg|thumb|The HDF imaged by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. The top segment shows the foreground objects in the field; the bottom shows the background with the foreground objects removed.]]

Very-high redshift objects (Lyman-break galaxies) cannot be seen in visible light and generally are detected in [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] or [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimetre]] wavelength surveys of the HDF instead.&lt;ref name=Ferguson2/&gt; Observations with the [[Infrared Space Observatory]] (ISO) indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation.&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1997"&gt;Rowan-Robinson et al. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Infrared observations have also been made with the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submillimeter observations of the field have been made with [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope#Continuum detectors|SCUBA]] on the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]], initially detecting 5 sources, although with very low resolution.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000b" /&gt; Observations have also been made with the [[Subaru (telescope)|Subaru]] telescope in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="hdf_clearinghouse"&gt;

X-ray observations by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] revealed six sources in the HDF, which were found to correspond to three elliptical galaxies: one spiral galaxy, one [[active galactic nucleus]] and one extremely red object, thought to be a distant galaxy containing a large amount of [[dust]] absorbing its blue light emissions.&lt;ref name="Hornschemeier2000"&gt;Hornschemeier et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground-based radio images taken using the VLA revealed seven radio sources in the HDF, all of which correspond to galaxies visible in the optical images.&lt;ref name="Kellerman1998"&gt;Kellerman et al. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The field has also been surveyed with the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] and the [[MERLIN]] array of radio telescopes at 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz;&lt;ref name="wsrt"&gt;Garratt et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merlin"&gt;

}}&lt;!-- DEADLINK --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20&amp;nbsp;cm have located 16 radio sources in the HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000b" /&gt; Radio images of some individual sources in the field have been made with the [[European VLBI Network]] at 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.&lt;ref name="evn"&gt;Garrett et al. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent HST observations==

&lt;/div&gt;

An HDF counterpart in the southern celestial hemisphere was created in 1998: the [[Hubble Deep Field South|HDF-South]].&lt;ref name="Williams2000"&gt;Williams et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Created using a similar observing strategy,&lt;ref name="Williams2000" /&gt; the HDF-S was very similar in appearance to the original HDF.&lt;ref name="Casertano2000"&gt;Casertano et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the [[cosmological principle]] that at its largest scale the Universe is [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]]. The HDF-S survey used the [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] (STIS) and the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the Hubble Deep Field has since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, as well as by the NICMOS and STIS instruments.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000b" /&gt; Several [[supernova]] events were detected by comparing the first and second epoch observations of the HDF-N.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2000b" /&gt;

A wider survey, but less sensitive, was carried out as part of the [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]]; a section of this was then observed for longer to create the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]], which was the most sensitive optical deep field image for years&lt;ref name="Beckwith2006"&gt;Beckwith et al. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; until the [[Hubble eXtreme Deep Field]] was completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hubble goes to the eXtreme to assemble the deepest ever view of the Universe|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1214/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Hubble press release}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images from the Extreme Deep Field, or XDF, were released on 26 September 2012 to a number of media agencies. Images released in the XDF show galaxies which are now believed to have formed in the first 500 million years following the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/37/image/a/ Hubble Site News Center]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/26/hubble-astronomers-deepest-view-night-sky|Hubble Astronomers Release Deepest View of the Night Sky]&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM supplies two cryptographic-system implementations:

* The [[PKCS11|PKCS#11]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/|title=Cryptsoft|website=www.cryptsoft.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; implementation creates a high-security solution for application programs developed for this industry-standard API.
* The IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) implementation provides many functions of special interest in the finance industry, extensive support for distributed key management, and a base on which custom processing and cryptographic functions can be added.

Toolkits for custom application development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc2/custom_program.shtml|title=IBM Systems cryptographic hardware products - United States|date=2018-03-13|website=www.ibm.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also available.

Applications may include financial PIN transactions, bank-to-clearing-house transactions, EMV transactions for integrated circuit (chip) based credit cards, and general-purpose cryptographic applications using [[symmetric key]] algorithms, [[Cryptographic hash function|hashing]] algorithms, and [[public key algorithm]]s.

The operational keys (symmetric or RSA private) are generated in the coprocessor and are then saved either in a keystore file or in application memory, encrypted under the master key of that coprocessor. Any coprocessor with an identical master key can use those keys. Performance benefits include the incorporation of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and format preserving encryption (FPE) in the hardware.

== Supported Systems ==
IBM supports the 4767 on certain [[IBM Z]], [[IBM Power Systems|IBM POWER]] Systems, and x86 servers ([[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]]).

* IBM Z: Crypto Express5S (CEX5S) - feature code 0890
* IBM POWER systems: feature codes EJ32 and EJ33
* x86: Machine type-model 4767-002

== History ==
As of April 2016, the IBM 4767 superseded the [[IBM 4765]] that was discontinued.

The IBM 4767 is supported on all platforms listed above. The successor to the 4767, the IBM 4768, was introduced on IBM Z, where it is called the Crypto Express6S (CEX6S)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc3/overview.shtml|title=IBM CryptoCards - PCleCC3 Overview - United States|date=2018-03-20|website=www.ibm.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is available as feature code 0893.

An '''[[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] audio effects controller''' is an electronic device that senses changes in acceleration, angular velocity and/or a magnetic field,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://howtomechatronics.com/how-it-works/electrical-engineering/mems-accelerometer-gyrocope-magnetometer-arduino/|title=MEMS Accelerometer Gyroscope Magnetometer &amp; Arduino|date=2015-11-19|work=HowToMechatronics|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relays those changes to an effects controller. Transmitting the sensed data can be done via wired or wireless methods. To be of use the effects controller must be connected to an [[Effects unit|effect unit]] so that an effect can be modulated, or connected to a [[MIDI controller]] or [[musical keyboard]]. The [[Wah-wah pedal|Wah-Wah]] effect is a classic example of effect modulation.

An inertial audio effects controller can be compared with a traditional [[expression pedal]] to explain what it does. An inertial effects controller uses an inertial sensor to detect user directed changes, whereas a traditional expression pedal uses an electrically resistive element to detect changes.There are some advantages and disadvantages between the two. The main advantages of inertial control versus a traditional foot pedal, are an increased range of dynamic motion, remote control, finer modulation precision and software enabled features such as motion triggered [[ADSR envelope]]s and bi-directional motion control. The main disadvantages are the requirement for a power source and a more complicated setup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressionpedals.com/inertial-expression&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their functional similarity with traditional expression pedals, they have been given the informal name, 'Expression box'.

==Availability==

Conceivably any or all of the inertial sensors ([[Accelerometer|accelerometer,]] [[gyroscope]], [[magnetometer]]), could be used for effect modulation. However, currently the only commercially available products use acceleration sensing only&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehx.com/products/expression-pedal|title=EHX.com {{!}} Expression Pedal - Real-Time Variable Control {{!}} Electro-Harmonix|website=Electro-Harmonix|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sourceaudio.net/products/hothand/hothand3.php|title=Hot Hand® 3|website=www.sourceaudio.net|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or acceleration combined with angular velocity &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ozinventions.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, as sensed by a gyroscope.

==Future==

Inertial control of an audio device, wired or wireless, is a relatively recent and growing trend as technology advances have reduced pricing and size as well as improved usability and performance of the core components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.electronicproducts.com/Software/EDA_Software_and_Hardware/Thinking_outside_the_chip_for_MEMS_design_success.aspx|title=Thinking outside the chip for MEMS design success - Electronic Products|website=www.electronicproducts.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutmems.com/memsapplications-wireless.html|title=allaboutmems.com - What is MEMS &gt; MEMS Applications &gt; MEMS in Wireless|website=www.allaboutmems.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically the core components are an inertial device called a Mirco- Electro-Mechanical-System ([[MEMs]]), a [[microcontroller]], and for wireless systems, a [[Transmitter|radio frequency transmitter]]/receiver.

On Wednesday 5 September 2007, the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Environment and Heritage Committee presented, to the [[Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives | Speaker]], its report on the inquiry into a sustainability charter entitled ''Sustainability for survival: creating a climate for change''.

A key recommendation within this report was to restate the need for a [[Australian sustainability commission | national Sustainability Commission]] headed by a Sustainability Commissioner that was previously recommended in the [[Sustainable Cities Report]] published in 2005.

The '''International Conference on Physics of Light–Matter Coupling in Nanostructures''' (PLMCN) is a yearly [[academic conference]] on various topics of [[semiconductor]] science and [[nanophotonic]]s.

== Topic ==
The conferences are devoted to the fundamental and technological issues relevant to the realization of a new generation of [[optoelectronic]] devices based on advanced low-dimensional and [[photonics|photonic]] structures, such as low threshold [[polariton]] [[lasers]], new [[optical]] switches, [[single photon emitters]], [[photonic crystal|photonic band-gap structures]], etc. They review the most recent achievements in the fundamental understanding of strong light–matter coupling, and follow the progress in the development of [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] and processing technologies of [[wide bandgap semiconductors]] and [[organic semiconductor|organic nanostructures]] and [[Microphotonics|microcavities]] providing the basis for advanced optical studies. The conferences are open to new emerging fields such as [[carbon nanotubes]] and [[quantum information]].

The scope of these conferences covers both [[physics]] and application of a variety of phenomena related to light–matter coupling in [[solids]] such as:

* Light–matter coupling in microcavities and [[photonic crystal]]s
* Basic [[exciton]]–[[polariton]] physics
* [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s and [[polariton superfluid]]
* [[Spin (physics)|Spin]]-related phenomena
* Physics and application of [[quantum dot]]s
* [[Plasmon]]s and [[near-field optics]] in light matter coupling
* Growth and characterization of advanced [[wide bandgap semiconductors]] ([[GaN]], [[ZnSe]], [[ZnO]], [[organic semiconductor|organic materials]])
* Novel optical devices (polariton lasers, single-photon emitters, [[quantum eraser experiment|entangled-photon pair]] generators, optical switches...)
* [[Quantum information science]]

== Editions ==

The International Conference on Physics of Light–Matter Coupling in Nanostructures started in 2000 in [[Saint-Nectaire, Puy-de-Dôme|Saint-Nectaire]], [[France]]. The 14th edition was held as PLMCN14 instead of PLMCN13. The next issue in 2015 was held as PLMCN2014 instead of PLMCN15. The next issue after that was, confusingly, labelled as both PLMCN2015 and PLMCN16. The next conference, PLMCN17, reverted to the traditional labelling but now in sync with the edition number.

'''Julian day''' is the continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period and is used primarily by [[Astronomy|astronomers]], and in [[software]] for easily calculating elapsed days between two events (e.g. food production date and sell by date)&lt;ref&gt;"Julian date" n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Julian Day Number '''('''JDN''') is the integer assigned to a whole solar day in the Julian day count starting from noon [[Universal time]], with Julian day number 0 assigned to the day starting at noon on Monday, January 1, [[4713 BC|4713&amp;nbsp;BC]], [[proleptic Julian calendar]] (November 24, 4714&amp;nbsp;BC, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]),&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz &amp; Reingold 2008, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidelman 2013, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Astronomical Almanac Online" 2016, Glossary, s.v. Julian date. Various timescales may be used with Julian date, such as [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT) or Universal Time (UT); in precise work the timescale should be specified.&lt;/ref&gt;  a date at which three multi-year cycles started (which are: [[Indiction]], [[Solar cycle (calendar)|Solar]], and [[Metonic cycle|Lunar]] cycles) and which preceded any dates in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;Both of these dates are years of the Christian or [[Common Era]] (which has no year 0 between 1 BC and AD 1). Astronomical calculations generally include a year 0, so these dates should be adjusted accordingly (i.e. the year 4713 BC becomes [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical year number]] &amp;minus;4712, etc.). In this article, dates before October 15, 1582 are in the (possibly proleptic) Julian calendar and dates on or after October 15, 1582 are in the Gregorian calendar, unless otherwise labelled.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Julian day number for the day starting at 12:00 [[Universal Time|UT]] on January 1, 2000, was 2&amp;nbsp;451&amp;nbsp;545.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Guinot 2013, 91–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Julian date''' ('''JD''') of any instant is the Julian day number plus the fraction of a day since the preceding noon in Universal Time. Julian dates are expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction added.&lt;ref name="IAU"&gt;"Resolution B1" 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Julian Date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1, 2013, is 2&amp;nbsp;456&amp;nbsp;293.520&amp;nbsp;833.&lt;ref&gt;US Naval Observatory 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Julian Period''' is a [[Chronology|chronological]] interval of 7980 years; year 1 of the Julian Period was 4713&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomical Almanac for the year 2017'' p. B4, which states 2017 is year 6730 of the Julian Period.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by [[History|historians]] since its introduction in 1583 to convert between different [[calendar]]s. The Julian calendar year {{CURRENTYEAR}} is year {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} + 4713 }} of the  current Julian Period. The next Julian Period begins in the year AD&amp;nbsp;3268.

== Terminology ==
The term ''Julian date'' may also refer, outside of astronomy, to the day-of-year number (more properly, the [[ordinal date]]) in the [[Gregorian calendar]], especially in computer programming, the military and the food industry,&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;USDA c. 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; or it may refer to dates in the [[Julian calendar]]. For example, if a given "Julian date" is "October 5, 1582", this means that date in the Julian calendar (which was October 15, 1582, in the Gregorian calendar—the date it was first established).  Without an astronomical or historical context, a "Julian date" given as "36" most likely means the 36th day of a given Gregorian year, namely February 5.  Other possible meanings of a "Julian date" of "36" include an astronomical Julian Day Number, or the year AD&amp;nbsp;36 in the Julian calendar, or a duration of 36&amp;nbsp;astronomical [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian years]]).  This is why the terms "ordinal date" or "day-of-year" are preferred.  In contexts where a "Julian date" means simply an ordinal date, calendars of a Gregorian year with formatting for ordinal dates are often called ''"Julian calendars"'',&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt; but this could also mean that the calendars are of years in the Julian calendar system.

Historical Julian dates were recorded relative to GMT or [[Ephemeris Time]], but the [[International Astronomical Union]] now recommends that Julian dates be specified in [[Terrestrial Time]], and that when necessary to specify Julian dates using a different time scale, that the time scale used be indicated when required, such as JD(UT1). The fraction of the day is found by converting the number of hours, minutes, and seconds after noon into the equivalent decimal fraction.  Time intervals calculated from differences of Julian Dates specified in non-uniform time scales, such as [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), may need to be corrected for changes in time scales (e.g. [[leap second]]s).&lt;ref name="IAU" /&gt;

== Variants ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Epoch (reference date)]] --&gt;
Because the starting point or [[Epoch (reference date)|reference epoch]] is so long ago, numbers in the Julian day can be quite large and cumbersome. A more recent starting point is sometimes used, for instance by dropping the leading digits, in order to fit into limited computer memory with an adequate amount of precision. In the following table, times are given in 24-hour notation.

In the table below, ''Epoch'' refers to the point in time used to set the origin (usually zero, but (1) where explicitly indicated) of the alternative convention being discussed in that row. The date given is a Gregorian calendar date if it is October 15, 1582, or later, but a Julian calendar date if it is earlier.  JD stands for Julian Date. 0h is 00:00 midnight, 12h is 12:00 noon, UT unless otherwise specified. Current value is as of {{CURRENTDATE}} and may be cached.

* The '''Modified Julian Date''' (MJD) was introduced by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in 1957 to record the orbit of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] via an [[IBM 704]] (36-bit machine) and using only 18 bits until August 7, 2576. MJD is the epoch of VAX/VMS and its successor [[OpenVMS#Timekeeping|OpenVMS]], using 63-bit date/time, which allows times to be stored up to July 31, 31086, 02:48:05.47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vms.tuwien.ac.at/info/humour/vms-base-time-origin.txt|title=Wayback Machine|date=June 6, 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606064704/http://vms.tuwien.ac.at/info/humour/vms-base-time-origin.txt|archivedate=June 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MJD has a starting point of midnight on November 17, 1858 and is computed by MJD = JD - 2400000.5 &lt;ref&gt;Winkler n. d.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Truncated Julian Day''' (TJD) was introduced by [[NASA]]/[[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard]] in 1979 as part of a parallel grouped binary time code (PB-5) "designed specifically, although not exclusively, for spacecraft applications." TJD was a 4-digit day count from MJD 40000, which was May 24, 1968, represented as a 14-bit binary number.  Since this code was limited to four digits, TJD recycled to zero on MJD 50000, or October 10, 1995, "which gives a long ambiguity period of 27.4 years". (NASA codes PB-1—PB-4 used a 3-digit day-of-year count.) Only whole days are represented.  Time of day is expressed by a count of seconds of a day, plus optional milliseconds, microseconds and nanoseconds in separate fields.  Later PB-5J was introduced which increased the TJD field to 16 bits, allowing values up to 65535, which will occur in the year 2147.  There are five digits recorded after TJD 9999.&lt;ref&gt;Chi 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SPD Toolkit Time Notes 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Dublin Julian Date''' (DJD) is the number of days that has elapsed since the epoch of the solar and lunar [[ephemerides]] used from 1900 through 1983, [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun]] and [[Ernest W. Brown]]'s ''Tables of the Motion of the Moon'' (1919). This epoch was noon UT on [[:January 0]], 1900, which is the same as noon UT on December 31, 1899. The DJD was defined by the International Astronomical Union at their meeting in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Ransom c. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heliocentric Julian Day]] (HJD) is the same as the Julian day, but adjusted to the frame of reference of the [[Sun]], and thus can differ from the Julian day by as much as 8.3 minutes (498 seconds), that being the time it takes the Sun's light to reach [[Earth]].

To illustrate the ambiguity that could arise, consider the two separate astronomical measurements of an astronomical object from the earth: Assume that three objects—the Earth, the Sun, and the astronomical object targeted, that is whose distance is to be measured—happen to be in a straight line for both measures. However, for the first measurement, the Earth is between the Sun and the targeted object, and for the second, the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun from that object. Then, the two measurements would differ by about 1000 light-seconds: For the first measurement, the Earth is roughly 500 light seconds closer to the target than the Sun, and roughly 500 light seconds further from the target astronomical object than the Sun for the second measure.

An error of about 1000 light-seconds is over 1% of a light-day, which can be a significant error when measuring temporal phenomena for short period astronomical objects over long time intervals. To clarify this issue, the ordinary Julian day is sometimes referred to as the '''Geocentric Julian Day''' (GJD) in order to distinguish it from HJD.

== History ==
The ''Julian day number'' is based on the ''Julian Period'' proposed by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Joseph Scaliger]], a classical scholar, in 1583, at the time of the Gregorian calendar reform, as it is the [[least common multiple]] of three calendar cycles used with the Julian calendar:

: 15 ([[indiction|indiction cycle]]) × 19 ([[Metonic cycle]]) × 28 ([[Solar cycle (calendar)|Solar cycle]]) = 7980 years

Its epoch falls at the last time when all three cycles (if they are continued backward far enough) were in their first year together &amp;mdash; Scaliger chose this because it preceded all historical dates. Years of the Julian Period are counted from this year, 4713 BC, which was chosen to be before any historical record.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 591-592.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since it is now certain that every possible combination of the three cyclic numbers finds its place in the Julian Period, it is evident that the first year of the Christian era, which was the 10th year of a Solar Cycle, the 2nd of a Lunar Cycle, and the 4th of a Cycle of Indiction, finds its place within this artificial era, and must answer to that particular year of the period which is characterized by the same cyclic numbers.   Hence, to refer the Christian era to the Julian Period is the same thing as to find out what year of that period it is which, when divided by 28 will leave a remainder 10, divided by 19 will leave a remainder 2, and divided by 15 will leave a remainder 4.   The solution of this problem belongs to the higher mathematics, by which it is found that the year required is the 4714th of the period in question.   Hence Jul. Per. 4714=A.D.1, and consequently Julian Period 4713=B.C.1.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Smith &amp; ben Uziel 1853, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In point of fact, finding the year is a very straightforward arithmetical  procedure.   See "Calculation" below.

Although many references say that the ''Julian'' in "Julian Period" refers to Scaliger's father, [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Julius Scaliger]], in the introduction to Book V of his ''{{lang|la|Opus de Emendatione Temporum}}'' ("Work on the Emendation of Time") he states, "''{{lang|la|Iulianam vocauimus: quia ad annum Iulianum dumtaxat accomodata est}}''", which translates more or less as "We have called it Julian merely because it is accommodated to the Julian year." Thus ''Julian'' refers to [[Julius Caesar]], who introduced the Julian calendar in 46 BC.

Originally the Julian Period was used only to count years, and the Julian calendar was used to express historical dates within years.  In his book ''Outlines of Astronomy'', first published in 1849, the astronomer [[John Herschel]] added the counting of days elapsed from the beginning of the Julian Period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The period thus arising of 7980 Julian years, is called the Julian period, and it has been found so useful, that the most competent authorities have not hesitated to declare that, through its employment, light and order were first introduced into chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Ideler 1825, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;   We owe its invention or revival to Joseph Scaliger, who is said to have received it from the Greeks of Constantinople. The first year of the current Julian period, or that of which the number in each of the three subordinate cycles is 1, was the year 4713 BC, and the noon of the 1st of January of that year, for the meridian of Alexandria, is the chronological epoch, to which all historical eras are most readily and intelligibly referred, by computing the number of integer days intervening between that epoch and the noon (for Alexandria) of the day, which is reckoned to be the first of the particular era in question. The meridian of Alexandria is chosen as that to which Ptolemy refers the commencement of the era of Nabonassar, the basis of all his calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Herschel 1858, p. 678&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Astronomer]]s adopted Herschel's "days of the Julian period" in the late nineteenth century, but used the meridian of Greenwich instead of Alexandria, after the former was adopted as the [[Prime Meridian]] after the [[International Meridian Conference]] in Washington in 1884. This has now become the standard system of Julian days numbers.

The French mathematician and astronomer [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first expressed the time of day as a decimal fraction added to calendar dates in his book, ''{{lang|fr|Traité de Mécanique Céleste}}'', in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QjEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 Laplace] 1799, p.349&lt;/ref&gt; Other astronomers added fractions of the day to the Julian day number to create Julian Dates, which are typically used by astronomers to date [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations, thus eliminating the complications resulting from using standard calendar periods like eras, years, or months. They were first introduced into [[variable star]] work by [[Edward Charles Pickering]], of the [[Harvard College Observatory]], in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5jQJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=toc#PPA206,M1 Furness] 1988, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian days begin at noon because when Herschel recommended them, the [[astronomical day]] began at noon. The astronomical day had begun at noon ever since [[Ptolemy]] chose to begin the days in his astronomical periods at noon. He chose noon because the transit of the Sun across the observer's meridian occurs at the same apparent time every day of the year, unlike sunrise or sunset, which vary by several hours. Midnight was not even considered because it could not be accurately determined using [[water clock]]s. Nevertheless, he double-dated most nighttime observations with both [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] days beginning at sunrise and [[Babylonia]]n days beginning at sunset. This would seem to imply that his choice of noon was ''not'', as is sometimes stated, made in order to allow all observations from a given night to be recorded with the same date. When this practice ended in 1925, it was decided to keep Julian days continuous with previous practice.

== Julian day number calculation ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gregorian calendar]] --&gt;
The Julian day number can be calculated using the following formulas ('''[[integer division]] is used exclusively''', that is, the remainders of all divisions are '''dropped'''):

''The months January to December are numbered 1 to 12. For the year, [[astronomical year numbering]] is used, thus 1 BC is 0, 2 BC is −1, and 4713 BC is −4712. ''JDN'' is the Julian Day Number. Use the previous day of the month if trying to find the JDN of an instant before midday UT.''

===Converting Gregorian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, Ch. 12, "Calendars", p. 604, in Seidelmann 1992&lt;/ref&gt; is valid for all (possibly [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic]]) Gregorian calendar dates after November 23, &amp;minus;4713.

JDN = (1461 × (Y + 4800 + (M − 14)/12))/4 +(367 × (M − 2 − 12 × ((M − 14)/12)))/12 − (3 × ((Y + 4900 + (M - 14)/12)/100))/4 + D − 32075

===Converting Julian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, Ch. 12, "Calendars", p. 606, in Seidelmann 1992&lt;/ref&gt; is valid for all (possibly [[Proleptic Julian calendar|proleptic]]) Julian calendar years ≥ −4712, that is, for all JDN ≥ 0.

JDN = 367 × Y − (7 × (Y + 5001 + (M − 9)/7))/4 + (275 × M)/9 + D + 1729777

=== Finding Julian date given Julian day number and time of day ===
For the full Julian Date of a moment after 12:00 UT one can use the following (divisions are real numbers):

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}J\!D &amp; = &amp; J\!D\!N + \frac{\text{hour} - 12}{24} + \frac{\text{minute}}{1440} + \frac{\text{second}}{86400}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So, for example, January 1, 2000, at 18:00:00 UT corresponds to ''JD'' = 2451545.25

For a point in time in a given Julian day after midnight UT and before 12:00 UT, add 1 or use the JDN of the next afternoon.

=== Finding day of week given Julian day number ===
The US day of the [[week]] '''W1''' (for an afternoon or evening UT) can be determined from the Julian Day Number '''J''' with the expression:
: '''W1''' = [[Modular arithmetic|mod]](''J'' + 1, 7)&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 592, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

{|border="1" class="wikitable"

!'''W1'''
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6
|-
!'''Day of the week'''
|Sun||Mon||Tue||Wed||Thu||Fri||Sat
|}

If the moment in time is after midnight UT (and before 12:00 UT), then one is already in the next day of the week.

The ISO day of the week '''W0''' can be determined from the Julian Day Number '''J''' with the expression:
: '''W0''' = mod (''J'', 7) + 1

{|border="1" class="wikitable"

=== Julian or Gregorian calendar from Julian day number ===
This is an algorithm by Richards to convert a Julian Day Number, '''J''',  to a date in the Gregorian calendar (proleptic, when applicable). Richards states the algorithm is valid for Julian day numbers greater than or equal to 0.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, 617–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards 1998, 316&lt;/ref&gt; All variables are integer values, and the notation "''a''&amp;nbsp;div&amp;nbsp;''b''" indicates [[integer division]], and "mod(''a'',''b'')" denotes the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus operator]].

For Julian calendar:
:1. ''f'' =  '''J''' + ''j''
For Gregorian calendar:
:1. ''f'' =  '''J''' + ''j'' + (((4 × '''J''' + ''B'') div 146097) × 3) div 4 + ''C''
For Julian or Gregorian, continue:
:2. ''e'' = ''r'' × ''f'' + ''v''
:3. ''g'' = mod(''e'', ''p'') div ''r''
:4. ''h'' = ''u'' × ''g'' + ''w''
:5. '''D''' = (mod(''h, s'')) div ''u'' + 1
:6. '''M''' = mod(''h'' div ''s'' + ''m'', ''n'') + 1
:7. '''Y''' = (''e'' div ''p'') - ''y'' + (''n'' + ''m'' - '''M''') div ''n''

'''D''', '''M''', and '''Y''' are the numbers of the day, month, and year respectively for the afternoon at the beginning of the given Julian day.

=== Julian Period from indiction, Metonic and solar cycles ===

Let Y be the year BC or AD and i, m and s respectively its positions in the indiction, Metonic and solar cycles.
Divide 6916i + 4200m + 4845s by 7980 and call the remainder r.
:If r&gt;4713, Y = (r − 4713) and is a year AD.
:If r&lt;4714, Y = (4714 − r) and is a year BC.

'''Example'''

i = 8, m = 2, s = 8.   What is the year?

:(6916 × 8) = 55328; (4200 × 2) = 8400: (4845 × 8) = 38760.   55328 + 8400 + 38760 = 102488.
:102488/7980 = 12 remainder 6728.
:Y = (6728 − 4713) = AD 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1760, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Julian date calculation==
As stated above, the Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number for the preceding noon in Universal Time plus the fraction of the day since that instant. Ordinarily calculating the fractional portion of the JD is straightforward; the number of seconds that have elapsed in the day divided by the number of seconds in a day, 86,400. But if the UTC timescale is being used, a day containing a positive leap second contains 86,401 seconds (or in the unlikely event of a negative leap second, 86,399 seconds). One authoritative source, the [[SOFA (astronomy)|Standards of Fundamental Astronomy]] (SOFA), deals with this issue by treating days containing a leap second as having a different length (86,401 or 86,399 seconds, as required). SOFA refers to the result of such a calculation as "quasi-JD".&lt;ref&gt;"SOFA Time Scale and Calendar Tools" 2016, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4892">In [[conservation biology]], '''latent extinction risk''' is a measure of the potential for a species to become threatened.

Latent risk can most easily be described as the difference, or discrepancy, between the current observed extinction risk of a species (typically as quantified by the [[IUCN Red List]]) and the theoretical extinction risk of a species predicted by its biological or [[Biological life cycle|life history]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0510541103"&gt;{{citation|last=Cardillo|first=M.|last2=Mace|first2=G. M.|last3=Gittleman|first3=J. L.|last4=Purvis|first4=A.|title=Latent extinction risk and the future battlegrounds of mammal conservation|year=2006|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=103|issue=11|pages=4157–61|doi=10.1073/pnas.0510541103|pmid=16537501|pmc=1449663}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
Because latent risk is the discrepancy between current and predicted risks, estimates of both of these values are required (See [[population modeling]] and [[population dynamics]]). Once these values are known, the latent extinction risk can be calculated as ''Predicted Risk - Current Risk = Latent Extinction Risk.''

When the latent extinction risk is a positive value, it indicates that a species is currently less threatened than its biology would suggest it ought to be. For example, a species may have several of the characteristics often found in threatened species, such as large body size, small geographic distribution, or low reproductive rate, but still be rated as "least concern" in the IUCN Red List. This may be because it has not yet been exposed to serious threatening processes such as [[Habitat conservation|habitat degradation]].

Conversely, negative values of latent risk indicate that a species is already more threatened than its biology would indicate, probably because it inhabits a part of the world where it has been exposed to extreme endangering processes.  Species with severely low negative values are usually listed as an [[endangered species]] and have associated recovery and conservation plans.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0510541103" /&gt;

==Limits==
One of the issues associated with latent extinction risk is its difficulty to calculate because of the limited availability of data for predicting extinction risk across large numbers of species.  Hence, the only study of latent risk to date &lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0510541103" /&gt; has focused on mammals, which are one of the best-studied groups of organisms.

==Effects on conservation==
A study of latent extinction risk in mammals identified a number of "hotspots" where the average value of latent risk for mammal species was unusually high.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0510541103" /&gt; This study suggested that these areas represented an opportunity for proactive conservation efforts, because these could become the "future battlegrounds of mammal conservation" if levels of human impact increase. Unexpectedly, the hotspots of mammal latent risk include large areas of Arctic America, where overall mammal diversity is not high, but where many species have the kind of biological traits (such as large body size and slow reproductive rate) that could render them extinction-prone. Another notable region of high latent risk for mammals is the island chain of Indonesia and Melanesia, where there are large numbers of restricted-range endemic species.

Because it is much more cost-effective to prevent species declines before they happen than to attempt to rescue species from the brink of extinction, latent risk hotspots could form part of a global scheme to prioritize areas for conservation effort, together with other kinds of priority areas such as biodiversity hotspots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3604">'''Media archaeology''' or archeology is a field that attempts to understand new and emerging media through close examination of the past, and especially through critical scrutiny of dominant progressivist narratives of popular commercial media such as [[film]] and [[television]].&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Media archaeologists often evince strong interest in so-called [[Dead Media Project|dead media]], noting that new media often revive and recirculate material and techniques of communication that had been lost, neglected, or obscured.&lt;ref name=gh/&gt; Some media archaeologists are also concerned with the relationship between media fantasies and technological development, especially the ways in which ideas about imaginary or speculative media affect the media that actually emerge.&lt;ref name=sn/&gt;

The theories and concepts of media archaeology have been primarily elaborated by the scholars and cultural critics [[Thomas Elsaesser]], [[Erkki Huhtamo]], [[Siegfried Zielinski]], and Wolfgang Ernst, taking off from earlier work by [[Michel Foucault]] on the archaeology of knowledge, [[Walter Benjamin]] on the culture of mass media, and film scholars such as [[C.W. Ceram]] on the archaeology of cinema.&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sn" /&gt; Other writers who have contributed to the discipline's emergence include Eric Kluitenberg, [[Anne Friedberg]], [[Friedrich Kittler]], and [[Jonathan Crary]].&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; New media theorist [[Jussi Parikka]] defines media archaeology as follows:

:Media archaeology exists somewhere between materialist media theories and the insistence on the value of the obsolete and forgotten through new cultural histories that have emerged since the 1980s. I see media archaeology as a theoretically refined analysis of the historical layers of media in their singularity—a conceptual and practical exercise in carving out the aesthetic, cultural, and political singularities of media. And it's much more than paying theoretical attention to the intensive relations between new and old media mediated through concrete and conceptual archives; increasingly, media archaeology is a method for doing media design and art.&lt;ref name=gh/&gt;

'''Modular design''', or "[[modularity]] in design", is a design approach that subdivides a system into smaller parts called modules or [[modular process skid|skids]], that can be independently created and then used in different systems. A modular system can be characterized by functional partitioning into discrete scalable, reusable modules; rigorous use of well-defined modular interfaces; and making use of industry standards for interfaces.

Besides reduction in cost (due to less customization, and shorter learning time), and flexibility in design, modularity offers other benefits such as augmentation (adding new solution by merely plugging in a new module), and exclusion. Examples of modular systems are [[car]]s, [[computers]], [[Modular process skid|process systems]], [[solar panel]]s and [[wind turbine]]s, [[elevator]]s and modular buildings. Earlier examples include [[furniture]], [[loom]]s, [[railroad signal]]ing systems, [[telephone exchanges]], [[pipe organ]]s, [[Modular synthesizer|synthesizers]] and [[electric power distribution]] systems. Evolution also results in the modular design of species in that homologous modules sharing approximately the same form or function appear in different organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, M.A. (2002) Modularity in multiple disciplines. In Garud, R., Langlois, R., &amp; Kumaraswamy, A. (eds) Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks and Organizations. Oxford, England: Blackwell Publishers, pg. 203-214 {{ISBN|0631233164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computers use modularity to overcome changing customer demands and to make the manufacturing process more adaptive to change (see [[modular programming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin and Clark, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Modular design is an attempt to combine the advantages of [[standardization]] (high volume normally equals low manufacturing costs) with those of [[Personalization|customization]]. A downside to modularity (and this depends on the extent of modularity) is that low quality modular systems are not optimized for performance. This is usually due to the cost of putting up interfaces between modules.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich K (1995) The role of product architecture in the manufacturing firm.

==In vehicles==
{{See also|Electric vehicle|Wikispeed}}
[[File:2010-04-07 Unimog at Arthur Ibbetts machinery dealership.jpg|thumb|The modular design of the [[Unimog]] offers attachment capabilities for various different [[List of agricultural machinery|implements]].]]

Aspects of modular design can be seen in cars or other [[vehicles]] to the extent of there being certain parts to the car that can be added or removed without altering the rest of the car.

A simple example of modular design in cars is the fact that, while many cars come as a basic model, paying extra will allow for "snap in" upgrades such as a more powerful engine or seasonal tires; these do not require any change to other units of the car such as the chassis, steering, electric motor or battery systems.

==In machines and architecture==
{{main article|Modular building}}
Modular design can be seen in certain buildings. Modular buildings (and also modular homes) generally consist of universal parts (or modules) that are manufactured in a [[factory]] and then shipped to a build site where they are assembled into a variety of arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.about.com/cs/buildyourhouse/g/modular.htm|title=Modular home definition|accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular buildings can be added to or reduced in size by adding or removing certain components. This can be done without altering larger portions of the building. Modular buildings can also undergo changes in functionality using the same process of adding or removing components.

[[File:Flexible Workplace Variability.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Modular workstations]]

For example, an [[office]] building can be built using modular parts such as walls, frames, doors, ceilings, and windows. The interior can then be partitioned (or divided) with more walls and furnished with desks, computers, and whatever else is needed for a functioning workspace. If the office needs to be expanded or redivided to accommodate employees, modular components such as wall panels can be added or relocated to make the necessary changes without altering the whole building. Later, this same office can be broken down and rearranged to form a [[retail]] space, [[conference hall]] or another type of building, using the same modular components that originally formed the office building. The new building can then be refurnished with whatever items are needed to carry out its desired functions.

Other types of modular buildings that are offered from a company like Allied Modular include a [[guardhouse]], machine enclosure, [[press box]], [[conference room]], two-story building, [[clean room]] and many more applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliedmodular.com/products Allied Modular Products] Allied Modular. Retrieved March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Many misconceptions are held regarding modular buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icon-construction.com/2014/08/top-5-myths-modular-construction/|title=modular building|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140917142328/http://icon-construction.com/2014/08/top-5-myths-modular-construction/|archivedate=2014-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality modular construction is a viable method of construction for quick turnaround and fast growing companies. Industries that would benefit from this include healthcare, commercial, retail, military, and multi-family/student housing.

==In televisions==

In 1963 [[Motorola]] introduced the first rectangular color picture tube, and in 1967 introduced the modular [[Quasar (brand)|Quasar]] brand. In 1964 it opened its first research and development branch outside of the United States, in Israel under the management of Moses Basin. In 1974 Motorola sold its television business to the Japan-based Matsushita, the parent company of Panasonic.

==In computer hardware==
[[File:Xi3 modular computer 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Modular computer design]] 
Modular design in computer hardware is the same as in other things (e.g. cars, refrigerators, and furniture). The idea is to build computers with easily replaceable parts that use standardized interfaces. This technique allows a user to upgrade certain aspects of the computer easily without having to buy another computer altogether. This idea was also being implemented in [[Project Ara]], which provided a platform for manufactures to create modules for a smartphone which could then be customised by the end user.

A computer is one of the best examples of modular design. Typical modules include [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supply units]], [[Central processing unit|processors]], [[mainboard]]s, [[graphics card]]s, [[hard drive]]s, and [[optical drive]]s. All of these parts should be easily interchangeable as long as the user uses parts that support the same standard interface. Similar to the computer's modularity, other tools have been developed to leverage modular design, such as [[LittleBits|littleBits Electronics]], which snap together with interoperable modules to create circuits.&lt;ref name="PSFK 5.15"&gt;{{cite web|title=How One Entrepreneur Is Bringing Fringe Maker Knowledge Mainstream|url=http://www.psfk.com/2014/08/one-entrepreneur-bringing-fringe-maker-knowledge-mainstream.html|website=PSFK|publisher=PSFK|accessdate=27 May 2015|ref=PSFK|date=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product development 2, 71-84 &lt;/ref&gt; launched inside the modular design contest the initial idea of "Conceptual ideal for PLM", that introduces: real space, virtual space, the link for data flow from real space to virtual space, the link for information flow from virtual space to real space and virtual sub-spaces.
Egan &lt;ref&gt;Egan, M. (2004). “Implementing A Successful Modular Design-PTC´s Approach.” In Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Product Structuring - Product Platform Development, Chalmers University, Göteborg, Sweden, 24.-25.03. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;([[PTC Inc]]) disclosed the strategy for an implementation of modular design in a PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) contest through a process that starts with a cross-functional input to the definition of the product architecture, and includes an architecture development program that keeps the integrity of the product during its lifecycle.  
Grieves &lt;ref&gt;Grieves, M. (2006), “[[Product Lifecycle Management]], Driving the Next Generation of Lean Thinking”, New York, McGraw-Hill &lt;/ref&gt;has produced an effective definition of [[digital twin]]: “A strategic business approach that applies a consistent set of business solutions in support of the collaborative creation, management, dissemination, and use of product definition information across the extended enterprise from concept to end of life –integrating people, processes, business systems, and information”.

==Integrating Lifecycle and Energy assessments into modular design ==
Some authors observe that modular design has generated in the vehicle industry a constant increase of weight over time. Trancossi &lt;ref&gt;Trancossi, M. A response to industrial maturity and energetic issues: a possible solution based on constructal law. Eur. Transp. Res. Rev. (2015) 7: 2. doi:10.1007/s12544-014-0150-4&lt;/ref&gt; advanced the hypothesis that modular design can be coupled by some optimization criteria derived from the [[constructal law]]. In fact, the constructal law is modular for his nature and can apply with interesting results in engineering simple systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bejan A., and Lorente S., “Constructal theory of generation of configuration in nature and engineering”, J. Appl. Phys., 100, 2006, doi:10.1063/1.2221896&lt;/ref&gt; It applies with a typical bottom-up optimization schema: 
* a system can be divided into subsystems (elemental parts) using tree models;
* any complex system can be represented in a modular way and it is possible to describe how different physical magnitudes flow through the system; 
* analysing the different flowpaths it is possible to identify the critical components that affect the performance of the system; 
* by optimizing those components and substituting them with more performing ones, it is possible to improve the performances of the system.

{{Science with neutrons}}
'''Neutron capture therapy''' ('''NCT''') is a noninvasive therapeutic modality for treating locally invasive malignant tumors such as primary [[brain tumor]]s and recurrent [[head and neck cancer]]. Briefly summarized, it is a two-step procedure: ''first'', the patient is injected with a tumor-localizing drug containing the [[Stable isotope|non-radioactive isotope]] boron-10 (&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B) that has a high propensity or [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] (σ) to [[Neutron capture|capture]] slow [[neutrons]]. The cross section of the &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is many times greater than that of the other elements present in tissues such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. In the ''second'' step, the patient is radiated with [[epithermal neutron]]s, the source of which is either a nuclear reactor or, more recently, an accelerator. After losing energy as they penetrate tissue, the neutrons are absorbed by the capture agent, which subsequently emits high-energy charged particles that can selectively kill tumor cells that have taken up sufficient quantities of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B (Fig.1).

All of the clinical experience to date with NCT is with the non-radioactive isotope [[boron-10]], and this is known as '''boron neutron capture therapy''' ('''BNCT''').&lt;ref name="Barth et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1748-717X-7-146 |title=Current status of boron neutron capture therapy of high grade gliomas and recurrent head and neck cancer |year=2012 |last1=Barth |first1=R.F. |last2=Vicente |first2=M.G.H. |last3=Harling |first3=O.K. |last4=Kiger |first4=W.S. |last5=Riley |first5=K.J. |last6=Binns |first6=P.J. |last7=Wagner |first7=F.M. |last8=Suzuki |first8=M. |last9=Aihara |first9=T. |last10=Kato |first10=I. |last11=Kawabata |first11=S. |journal=Radiation Oncology |volume=7 |page=146 |pmid=22929110 |pmc=3583064}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the use of other non-radioactive isotopes, such as [[gadolinium]], has been limited, and to date, it has not been used clinically. BNCT has been evaluated clinically as an alternative to conventional radiation therapy for the treatment of malignant brain tumors ([[gliomas]]), and recurrent, locally advanced [[head and neck cancer]] and cutaneous and extracutaneous melanomas.&lt;ref name="Barth et al 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moss|first1=R.L.|title=Critical review with an optimistic outlook on boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT)|journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes|date=2014|volume=88|pages=2–11|doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2013.11.109|pmid=24355301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boron neutron capture therapy==

=== History ===
After the initial discovery of the neutron in 1932 by Sir James Chadwick, H. J. Taylor in 1935 showed that boron-10 nuclei had a propensity to capture thermal neutrons. This resulted in nuclear fission of the boron-11 nuclei into helium-4 (alpha particles) and lithium-7 ions. In 1936, G.L. Locher, a scientist at the Franklin Institute in Pennsylvania, recognized the therapeutic potential of this discovery and suggested that neutron capture could be used to treat cancer. W. H. Sweet, from Massachusetts General Hospital, first suggested the technique for treating malignant brain tumors and a trial of BNCT against the most malignant of all brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme, using borax as the delivery agent in 1951.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1951|title=The uses of nuclear disintegration in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=245|issue=23|pages=875–8|doi=10.1056/NEJM195112062452301|pmid=14882442|last1=Sweet|first1=W.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clinical trial was initiated in a collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory&lt;ref name="Farr" /&gt; in Long Island, U.S.A. and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in 1954.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A number of research groups throughout the world have continued the early groundbreaking work of William Sweet and Ralph Fairchild, and in particular, the pioneering clinical studies of Hiroshi Hatanaka (畠中洋) in Japan. This was followed by clinical trials in a number of other countries including the United States, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic, Argentina, European Union (centered in the Netherlands) and Japan. Currently, the program in Japan has transitioned from a reactor neutron source to accelerators, and now a Phase I/II trial is underway to evaluate the safety of the accelerator neutron sources.

==Basic principles==
Neutron capture therapy is a binary system that consists of two separate components to achieve its therapeutic effect. Each component in itself is non-tumoricidal, but when combined together they are highly lethal to cancer cells.  [[File:Boron neutron capture therapy (bnct) illustration.jpg|thumb|1) Boron compound (b) is selectively absorbed by cancer cell(s). 2) Neutron beam (n) is aimed at cancer site. 3) Boron absorbs neutron. 4) Boron disintegrates emitting cancer-killing radiation.]]
BNCT is based on the nuclear capture and fission reactions that occur when non-radioactive [[boron-10]], which makes up approximately 20% of natural elemental boron, is irradiated with neutrons of the appropriate energy to yield excited boron-11 (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B*). This undergoes instantaneous nuclear fission to produce high energy [[alpha particles]] (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He nuclei) and high energy [[Lithium|lithium-7]] (&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li) nuclei. The nuclear reaction is:

:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B + n&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; → [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B] *→ α + &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li + 2.31 [[MeV]]

Both the alpha particles and the lithium ions produce closely spaced ionizations in the immediate vicinity of the reaction, with a range of 5–9&amp;nbsp;[[µm]], which is approximately the diameter of the target cell. The lethality of the capture reaction is limited to boron containing cells. BNCT, therefore, can be regarded as both a biologically and a physically targeted type of radiation therapy. The success of BNCT is dependent upon the selective delivery of sufficient amounts of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B to the tumor with only small amounts localized in the surrounding normal tissues.&lt;ref name="Boron Neutron"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0035 |title=Boron neutron capture therapy of cancer: Current status and future prospects |year=2005 |last1=Barth |first1=R.F. |journal=Clinical Cancer Research |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=3987–4002 |pmid=15930333 |last2=Coderre |first2=J.A. |last3=Vicente |first3=M.G.H. |last4=Blue |first4=T.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, normal tissues, if they have not taken up sufficient amounts of boron-10, can be spared from the nuclear capture and fission reactions. Normal tissue tolerance is determined by the nuclear capture reactions that occur with normal tissue hydrogen and nitrogen.

A wide variety of boron delivery agents have been synthesized,&lt;ref name="Vicente MGH"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/187152006776119162 |title=Boron in medicinal chemistry |year=2006 |last1=Vicente |first1=M.G.H. |journal=Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry |volume=6 |issue=2 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only two of these currently are being used in clinical trials. The first, which has been used primarily in Japan, is a polyhedral borane anion, [[sodium borocaptate]] or BSH (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;SH), and the second is a dihydroxyboryl derivative of [[phenylalanine]], referred to as [[boronophenylalanine]] or BPA. The latter has been used in clinical trials in the United States, Finland, Japan and more recently, Argentina and Taiwan. Following administration of either BPA or BSH by intravenous infusion, the tumor site is irradiated with neutrons, the source of which up until now has been specially designed nuclear reactors. Until 1994, low-energy (&lt; 0.5 [[Electronvolt|eV]]) thermal neutron beams were used in Japan&lt;ref name="Nakagawa et al 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Pooh|first2=K.|last3=Kobayashi|first3=T.|last4=Kageji|first4=T.|last5=Uyama|first5=S.|last6=Matsumura|first6=A.|last7=Kumada|first7=H.|year=2003|title=Clinical review of the Japanese experience with boron neutron capture therapy and a proposed strategy using epithermal neutron beams|journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology|volume=62|issue=1–2|pages=87–99|doi=10.1023/A:1023234902479|pmid=12749705|last1=Nakagawa|first1=Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farr" /&gt; but since they have a limited depth of penetration in tissues, higher energy (&gt;.5eV&lt;10 [[keV]]) epithermal neutron beams, which have a greater depth of penetration, have been used in clinical trials in the United States,&lt;ref name="Diaz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1023245123455 |year=2003 |last1=Diaz |first1=A.Z. |journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology |volume=62 |pages=101–9 |pmid=12749706 |title=Assessment of the results from the phase I/II boron neutron capture therapy trials at the Brookhaven National Laboratory from a clinician's point of view |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Busse"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02699938 |title=A critical examination of the results from the Harvard-MIT NCT program phase I clinical trial of neutron capture therapy for intracranial disease |year=2003 |last1=Busse |first1=P.M. |last2=Harling |first2=O.K. |last3=Palmer |first3=M.R. |last4=Kiger |first4=W.S. |last5=Kaplan |first5=J. |last6=Kaplan |first6=I. |last7=Chuang |first7=C.F. |last8=Goorley |first8=J.T. |last9=Riley |first9=K.J. |last10=Newton |first10=T.H. |last11=Cruz |first11=G.A.S. |last12=Lu |first12=X.-Q. |last13=Zamenhof |first13=R.G. |journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology |volume=62 |pages=111–21 |pmid=12749707 |issue=1–2|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina, Taiwan, and China. In theory BNCT is a highly selective type of [[radiation therapy]] that can target tumor cells without causing radiation damage to the adjacent normal cells and tissues. Doses up to 60–70&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Grays (Gy)]] can be delivered to the tumor cells in one or two applications compared to 6–7 weeks for conventional fractionated external beam photon irradiation. However, the effectiveness of BNCT is dependent upon a relatively homogeneous cellular distribution of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B within the tumor, and this is still one of the main unsolved problems that have limited its success.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Radiobiological considerations ==
The radiation doses delivered to tumor and normal tissues during BNCT are due to energy deposition from three types of directly ionizing radiation that differ in their [[linear energy transfer]] (LET), which is the rate of energy loss along the path of an ionizing particle:

1. low LET [[gamma ray]]s, resulting primarily from the capture of thermal neutrons by normal tissue hydrogen atoms [&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H(n,γ)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H];

2. high LET [[proton]]s, produced by the scattering of fast neutrons and from the capture of thermal neutrons by nitrogen atoms [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N(n,p)&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]; and

3. high LET, heavier charged [[alpha particles]] (stripped down helium [&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He] nuclei) and [[Lithium|lithium-7]] ions, released as products of the thermal neutron capture and fission reactions with &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B [&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B(n,α)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li].

Since both tumor and surrounding normal tissues are present in the radiation field, even with an ideal epithermal neutron beam, there will be an unavoidable, nonspecific background dose, consisting of both high and low LET radiation. However, a higher concentration of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B in the tumor will result in it receiving a higher total dose than that of adjacent normal tissues, which is the basis for the therapeutic gain in BNCT.&lt;ref name="Coderre"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9973079 |year=1999 |last1=Coderre |first1=J.A. |last2=Morris |first2=G.M. |title=The radiation biology of boron neutron capture therapy |volume=151 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |journal=Radiation Research |doi=10.2307/3579742|bibcode=1999RadR..151....1C |jstor=3579742 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total radiation dose in Gy delivered to any tissue can be expressed in photon-equivalent units as the sum of each of the high LET dose components multiplied by weighting factors (Gy&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;), which depend on the increased radiobiological effectiveness of each of these components.

== Clinical dosimetry ==
Biological weighting factors have been used in all of the recent clinical trials in patients with high grade gliomas, using boronophenylalanine (BPA) in combination with an epithermal neutron beam. The &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B(n,α)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li component of the radiation dose to the scalp has been based on the measured boron concentration in the blood at the time of BNCT, assuming a blood: scalp boron concentration ratio of 1.5:1 and a compound biological effectiveness (CBE) factor for BPA in skin of 2.5. A [[relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE) factor of 3.2 has been used in all tissues for the high LET components of the beam, such as alpha particles. The RBE factor is used to compare the biologic effectiveness of different types of ionizing radiation. The high LET components include protons resulting from the capture reaction with normal tissue nitrogen, and recoil protons resulting from the collision of fast neutrons with hydrogen.&lt;ref name="Coderre"/&gt; It must be emphasized that the tissue distribution of the boron delivery agent in humans should be similar to that in the experimental animal model in order to use the experimentally derived values for estimation of the [[radiation]] doses for clinical radiations.&lt;ref name="Coderre"/&gt; For more detailed information relating to computational dosimetry and [[treatment planning]], interested readers are referred to a comprehensive review on this subject.&lt;ref name="Nigg"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1023241022546 |year=2003 |last1=Nigg |first1=D.W. |journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology |volume=62 |pages=75–86 |pmid=12749704 |title=Computational dosimetry and treatment planning considerations for neutron capture therapy |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boron delivery agents ==
The development of boron delivery agents for BNCT began approximately 50 years ago{{when|date=April 2016}} and is an ongoing and difficult task of high priority. A number of [[boron-10]] containing delivery agents have been prepared for potential use in BNCT.&lt;ref name="Vicente MGH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soloway, A.H., Tjarks, W., Barnum, B.A., Rong, F-G., Barth, R.F., Codogni, I.M., and Wilson, J.G.: The chemistry of neutron capture therapy. Chemical Rev 98: 1515-1562, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important requirements for a successful boron delivery agent are: 
* low systemic toxicity and normal tissue uptake with high tumor uptake and concomitantly high tumor: to brain (T:Br) and tumor: to blood (T:Bl) concentration ratios (&gt; 3–4:1); 
* tumor concentrations in the range of ~20&amp;nbsp;µg &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B/g tumor; 
* rapid clearance from blood and normal tissues and persistence in tumor during BNCT. 
However, it should be noted that at this time{{when|date=April 2016}} no single boron delivery agent fulfills all of these criteria. With the development of new chemical synthetic techniques and increased knowledge of the biological and biochemical requirements needed for an effective agent and their modes of delivery, a wide variety of new boron agents has emerged (see examples in Table 1), but only two of these, boronophenylalanine (BPA) and sodium borocaptate (BSH) have been used clinically.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The major challenge in the development of boron delivery agents has been the requirement for selective tumor targeting in order to achieve boron concentrations sufficient to produce therapeutic doses of radiation at the site of the tumor with minimal radiation delivered to normal tissues. The selective destruction of brain tumor (glioma) cells in the presence of normal cells represents an even greater challenge compared to malignancies at other sites in the body, since malignant gliomas are highly infiltrative of normal brain, histologically diverse and heterogeneous in their genomic profile. In principle, NCT is a radiation therapy that could selectively deliver lethal doses of radiation to tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Gadolinium neutron capture therapy (Gd NCT) ==
There also has been interest in the possible use of [[Gadolinium|gadolinium-157 (&lt;sup&gt;157&lt;/sup&gt;Gd)]] as a capture agent for NCT for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="Cerullo"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2009.03.109 |title=Progress in the use of gadolinium for NCT |year=2009 |last1=Cerullo |first1=N. |last2=Bufalino |first2=D. |last3=Daquino |first3=G. |journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes |volume=67 |issue=7–8 |pages=S157–60 |pmid=19410468}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''First'', and foremost, has been its very high neutron capture cross section of 254,000 [[Barn (unit)|barns]]. ''Second'', gadolinium compounds, such as Gd-DTPA (gadopentetate dimeglumine Magnevist®), have been used routinely as contrast agents for [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of brain tumors and have shown high uptake by brain tumor cells in tissue culture (''in vitro'').&lt;ref name="Yasui"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09553000802538092 |title=Gadolinium neutron capture in glioblastoma multiforme cells |year=2008 |last1=Yasui |first1=L.S. |last2=Andorf |first2=C. |last3=Schneider |first3=L. |last4=Kroc |first4=T. |last5=Lennox |first5=A. |last6=Saroja |first6=K.R. |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=84 |issue=12 |pages=1130–9 |pmid=19061138}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Third'', gamma rays and internal conversion and Auger electrons are products of the &lt;sup&gt;157&lt;/sup&gt;Gd (n,γ)&lt;sup&gt;158&lt;/sup&gt;Gd capture reaction (&lt;sup&gt;157&lt;/sup&gt;Gd + n&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; (0.025eV) → [&lt;sup&gt;158&lt;/sup&gt;Gd] → &lt;sup&gt;158&lt;/sup&gt;Gd + γ + 7.94 MeV). Although the gamma rays have longer pathlengths, orders of magnitude greater depths of penetration compared with alpha particles, the other radiation products (internal conversion and [[Auger electrons]]) have pathlengths of approximately one cell diameter and can directly damage [[DNA]]. Therefore, it would be highly advantageous for the production of DNA damage if the &lt;sup&gt;157&lt;/sup&gt;Gd were localized within the cell nucleus. However, the possibility of incorporating gadolinium into biologically active molecules is very limited and only a small number of potential delivery agents for Gd NCT have been evaluated.&lt;ref name="Nemoto"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-328X(99)00049-2 |title=The synthesis of a carborane gadolinium–DTPA complex for boron neutron capture therapy |year=1999 |last1=Nemoto |first1=H. |last2=Cai |first2=J. |last3=Nakamura |first3=H. |last4=Fujiwara |first4=M. |last5=Yamamoto |first5=Y. |journal=Journal of Organometallic Chemistry |volume=581 |pages=170–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tokumitsu"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-3835(99)00388-2 |title=Gadolinium neutron-capture therapy using novel gadopentetic acid–chitosan complex nanoparticles: In vivo growth suppression of experimental melanoma solid tumor |year=2000 |last1=Tokumitsu |first1=H. |last2=Hiratsuka |first2=J. |last3=Sakurai |first3=Y. |last4=Kobayashi |first4=T. |last5=Ichikawa |first5=H. |last6=Fukumori |first6=Y. |journal=Cancer Letters |volume=150 |issue=2 |pages=177–82 |pmid=10704740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively few studies with Gd have been carried out in experimental animals compared to the large number with boron containing compounds (Table 1), which have been synthesized and evaluated in experimental animals (''in vivo'').

== Neutron sources ==

=== Nuclear reactors ===
Until recently neutron sources for NCT have been limited to [[nuclear reactors]] and in the present section we only will summarize information that is described in more detail in a recently published review.&lt;ref name="Harling"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2009.03.095 |title=Fission reactor based epithermal neutron irradiation facilities for routine clinical application in BNCT—Hatanaka memorial lecture |year=2009 |last1=Harling |first1=O.K. |journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes |volume=67 |issue=7–8 |pages=S7–11 |pmid=19428265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactor derived neutrons are classified according to their energies as thermal (E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;0.5 eV), epithermal (0.5 eV &lt;E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;10 keV) or fast (E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;10 keV). Thermal neutrons are the most important for BNCT since they usually initiate the &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B(n,α)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li capture reaction. However, because they have a limited depth of penetration, epithermal neutrons, which lose energy and fall into the thermal range as they penetrate tissues, are not used for clinical therapy other than for skin tumors such as melanoma.

A number of nuclear reactors with very good neutron beam quality have been developed and used clinically. These include: 
#Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURRI) in Kumatori, Japan;
#the [[MIT Nuclear Research Reactor|Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Reactor (MITR)]]; 
#the FiR1 (Triga Mk II) research reactor at VTT Technical Research Centre, Espoo, Finland;   
#the RA-6 CNEA reactor in Bariloche, Argentina;
#the High Flux Reactor (HFR) at Petten in the Netherlands; and
#Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor (THOR) at the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

However, as of April 2018, only the RA-6 reactor in Argentina and the THOR reactor in Taiwan currently are being used for clinical studies.

Although not currently being used for BNCT, the neutron irradiation facility at the MITR represented the state of the art in epithermal beams for NCT with the capability of completing a radiation field in 10–15 minutes with close to the theoretically maximum ratio of tumor to normal tissue dose. Unfortunately, however, no clinical studies currently are being carried out at the HFR and the MITR. The operation of the BNCT facility at the Finnish FiR1 research reactor (Triga Mk II), treating patients since 1999, was terminated in 2012 due to a variety of reasons, one of which was financial. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} It is anticipated that future clinical studies in Finland will utilize an accelerator neutron source designed and fabricated in the United States by Neutron Therapeutics. Finally, a low power "in-hospital" compact nuclear reactor has been designed and built in Beijing, China, and at this time has only been used to treat a small number of patients with cutaneous melanomas.&lt;ref name="Yiguo"&gt;{{cite conference|vauthors=Yiguo L, Pu X, Xiao W |title=Start-up of the first in-hospital neutron irradiator (IHNI-1) &amp; Presentation of the BNCT development status in China |conference=New Challenges in Neutron Capture Therapy 2010: Proceedings of the 14th International Congress on Neutron Capture Therapy |pages=371–4 |url=http://www.14icnct.com.ar/proceedings/06_RE_01_Yiguo.pdf |location=Buenos Aires |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232958/http://www.14icnct.com.ar/proceedings/06_RE_01_Yiguo.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accelerators ===
{{Further|Neutron source}}
Accelerators also can be used to produce epithermal neutrons and accelerator-based neutron sources (ABNS) are being developed in a number of countries. Interested readers are referred to the recently published Proceedings of the 16th and abstracts of the 17th International Congresses&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Koivunoro, H., Green, S., Auterinen, I., and Kulvik, M.: The 16th International Congress on Neutron Capture Therapy (ICNCT-16). Appl Radiat Isotopes 106: 1-264, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; on Neutron Capture Therapy for more information on this subject. For ABNSs, one of the more promising nuclear reactions involves bombarding a &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li target with high energy protons. An experimental BNCT facility, using a thick lithium solid target, has been in use since the early 1990s at the University of Birmingham in the UK, but to date no clinical studies have been carried out at this facility, which makes use of a high current [[Dynamitron]] accelerator originally supplied by Radiation Dynamics.

Recently, a cyclotron-based neutron source (C-BENS) has been developed by Sumitomo Heavy Industries (SHI) in Japan.&lt;ref name="Mitsumoto"&gt;{{cite conference|vauthors=Mitsumoto T, Yajima S, Tsutsui H |title=Cyclotron-based neutron source for BNCT |conference=New Challenges in Neutron Capture Therapy 2010: Proceedings of the 14th International Congress on Neutron Capture Therapy |pages=519–22 |url=http://www.14icnct.com.ar/proceedings/07_AC_24_Mitsumoto.pdf |location=Buenos Aires |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201910/http://www.14icnct.com.ar/proceedings/07_AC_24_Mitsumoto.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been installed at the Particle Radiation Oncology Research Center of Kyoto University in Kumatori, Japan. It now is being used in a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate its safety for treating patients with high grade gliomas. A second one has been constructed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for use at Tsukuba University in Japan, but due to technical problems it is unlikely that it will ever be used for clinical studies. A third one is being built by Hitachi for use in Tokyo. A fourth accelerator, manufactured by SHI, is located at the Southern Tohoku BNCT Research Center in Fukushima prefecture in Japan and is being used in a Phase II clinical trial for BNCT of recurrent brain tumors and head and neck cancer. Finally, a fifth one, which as of Spring 2018 is being installed at Helsinki University Hospital in Finland.&lt;ref name="Neutron Therapeutics"&gt;{{cite article|title=Novel Accelerator-Based BNCT Suite to be Delivered to a Top European Cancer Hospital | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novel-accelerator-based-bnct-suite-to-be-delivered-to-a-top-european-cancer-hospital-593683851.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accelerator was designed and fabricated by Neutron Therapeutics in Danvers, Massachusetts. It will be important to determine how these ABNS compare to BNCT that has been carried out in the past using nuclear reactors as the neutron source.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Clinical studies of BNCT for brain tumors ==

=== Early studies in the US and Japan ===
It was not until the 1950s that the first clinical trials were initiated by Farr at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in New York&lt;ref name="Farr"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=13124616 |year=1954 |last1=Farr |first1=L.E. |last2=Sweet |first2=W.H. |last3=Robertson |first3=J.S. |last4=Foster |first4=C.G. |last5=Locksley |first5=H.B. |last6=Sutherland |first6=D.L. |last7=Mendelsohn |first7=M.L. |last8=Stickley |first8=E.E. |title=Neutron capture therapy with boron in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=279–93 |journal=The American Journal of Roentgenology, Radium Therapy, and Nuclear Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Sweet and Brownell at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) nuclear reactor (MITR)&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;{{cite conference |author=Sweet WH |title=Practical problems in the past in the use of boron-slow neutron capture therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme |conference=Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Neutron Capture Therapy |year=1983 |pages=376–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several different low molecular weight boron compounds as the boron delivery agent. However, the results of these studies were disappointing, and no further clinical trials were carried out in the United States until the 1990s.

Following a two-year Fulbright fellowship in Sweet's laboratory at the MGH, clinical studies were initiated by Hiroshi Hatanaka in Japan in 1967. He used a low energy thermal neutron beam, which had low tissue penetrating properties, and sodium borocaptate (BSH) as the boron delivery agent, which had been evaluated as a boron delivery agent by Albert Soloway at the MGH.&lt;ref name="Barth 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2015.06.016 |pmid=26149807 |title=From the laboratory to the clinic: How translational studies in animals have lead ''[sic]'' to clinical advances in boron neutron capture therapy. |year=2015 |last1=Barth |first1=R.F. |journal=Appl Radiat Isotopes |volume=106 |pages=22–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hatanaka's procedure,&lt;ref name="Hatanaka"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0360-3016(94)90479-0 |title=Clinical results of long-surviving brain tumor patients who underwent boron neutron capture therapy |year=1994 |last1=Hatanaka |first1=H. |last2=Nakagawa |first2=Y. |journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=1061–6 |pmid=8175390}}&lt;/ref&gt; as much as possible of the tumor was surgically resected ("debulking"), and at some time thereafter, BSH was administered by a slow infusion, usually intra-arterially, but later intravenously. Twelve to 14 hours later, BNCT was carried out at one or another of several different nuclear reactors using low energy thermal neutron beams. The less tissue-penetrating properties of the thermal neutron beams necessitated reflecting the skin and raising a bone flap in order to directly irradiate the exposed brain, a procedure first used by Sweet and his collaborators.

Approximately 200+ patients were treated by Hatanaka, and subsequently by his associate, Nakagawa.&lt;ref name="Nakagawa et al 2003"/&gt; Due to the heterogeneity of the patient population, in terms of the microscopic diagnosis of the tumor and its [[Grading (tumors)|grade]], size, and the ability of the patients to carry out normal daily activities (Karnofsky [[performance status]]), it was not possible to come up with definitive conclusions about therapeutic efficacy. However, the survival data were no worse than those obtained by standard therapy at the time, and there were several patients who were long-term survivors, and most probably they were cured of their brain tumors.&lt;ref name="Nakagawa et al 2003"/&gt;

=== More recent clinical studies in the US and Japan ===
BNCT of patients with brain tumors was resumed in the United States in the mid-1990s by Chanana, Diaz, and Coderre&lt;ref name="Diaz" /&gt; and their co-workers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) and at Harvard/Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) using the [[MIT Nuclear Research Reactor|MIT Research Reactor (MITR)]].&lt;ref name="Busse" /&gt; For the first time, BPA was used as the boron delivery agent, and patients were irradiated with a collimated beam of higher energy epithermal neutrons, which had greater tissue-penetrating properties than thermal neutrons. A research group headed up by Zamenhof at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School and MIT was the first to use an epithermal neutron beam for clinical trials. Initially patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated and this was expanded to include patients with brain tumors, specifically melanoma metastatic to the brain and primary glioblastomas (GBMs). Included in the research team were Otto Harling at MIT and the Radiation Oncologist Paul Busse at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. A total of 22 patients were treated by the Harvard-MIT research group. Five patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated using an epithermal neutron beam at the MIT research reactor (MITR-II) and subsequently patients with brain tumors were treated using a redesigned beam at the MIT reactor which possessed far superior characteristics to the original MITR-II beam, and BPA as the capture agent. The clinical outcome of the cases treated at Harvard-MIT has been summarized by Busse.&lt;ref name="Busse" /&gt; Although the treatment was well tolerated, there were no significant differences in the mean survival times of patients that had received BNCT compared to those who received  conventional external beam X-irradiation.&lt;ref name="Busse"/&gt;

Miyatake and Kawabata at Osaka Medical College in Japan&lt;ref name="Kawabata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miyatake"/&gt; have carried out extensive clinical studies employing the combination of BPA (500&amp;nbsp;mg/kg) and BSH (100&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), infused intravenously (i.v.) over 2&amp;nbsp;h, followed by neutron irradiation at Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute (KURRI).

The overall median survival time (MeST) was 27.1 months, and the 1 year and 2-year survival rates were 87.5 and 62.5%, respectively. Based on the reports of Miyatake, Kawabata, and Yamamoto, it appears that combining BNCT with an X-ray boost can produce a significant therapeutic gain. However, further studies are needed to optimize this combined therapy alone or in combination with other approaches including chemo- and immunotherapy, and to evaluate it using a larger patient population.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== Clinical studies in Finland ===
A team of clinicians led by Heikki Joensuu and Leena Kankaanranta and nuclear engineers led by Iro Auterinen at the Helsinki University Central Hospital and VTT Technical Research Center of Finland have treated approximately 200+ patients with recurrent malignant gliomas ([[Glioblastoma multiforme|glioblastomas]]) and head and neck cancer who had undergone standard therapy, recurred, and subsequently received BNCT at the time of their recurrence using BPA as the boron delivery agent.&lt;ref name="Kankaanarant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanakaanranta Boron Neutron"/&gt; The median time to progression in patients with gliomas was 3 months, and the overall MeST was 7 months. It is difficult to compare these results with other reported results in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas, but they are a starting point for future studies using BNCT as salvage therapy in patients with recurrent tumors. Due to a variety of reasons, including financial,&lt;ref name="Kulvik"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2015.08.021 |pmid=26365901 |title=An economic model to assess the cost-benefit of BNCT |year=2015 |last1=Kulvik |first1=M. |last2=Hermans |first2=R. |last3=Linnosmaa |first3=I. |last4=Shalowitz |first4=J. |journal=Appl Radiat Isotopes |volume=106 |pages=3–9  }}&lt;/ref&gt; no further studies have been carried out at this facility, which is scheduled for decommissioning. However, a new facility for BNCT treatment will be opened at [[Meilahti Tower Hospital]] in 2018 using an accelerator designed and fabricated by Neutron Therapeutics, Danvers, MA. The hospital will house the first BNCT accelerator ever designed to be used in a hospital, and the BNCT treatment and clinical studies will be continued there.

=== Clinical studies in Sweden ===
Finally, to conclude this section, the following is a brief summary of a clinical trial that was carried out by Stenstam, Sköld, Capala and their co-workers in Sweden using BPA and an epithermal neutron beam at the Studsvik nuclear reactor, which had greater tissue penetration properties than the thermal beams originally used in Japan. This study differed significantly from all previous clinical trials in that the total amount of BPA administered was increased (900&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), and it was infused i.v. over 6 hours.  This was based on experimental animal studies in glioma bearing rats demonstrating enhanced uptake of BPA by infiltrating tumor cells following a 6-hour infusion.&lt;ref name="Barth 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henriksson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.radonc.2006.04.015 |title=Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for glioblastoma multiforme: A phase II study evaluating a prolonged high-dose of boronophenylalanine (BPA) |year=2008 |last1=Henriksson |first1=R. |last2=Capala |first2=J. |last3=Michanek |first3=A. |last4=Lindahl |first4=S.-Å. |last5=Salford |first5=L.G. |last6=Franzén |first6=L. |last7=Blomquist |first7=E. |last8=Westlin |first8=J.-E. |last9=Bergenheim |first9=A.T. |journal=Radiotherapy and Oncology |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=183–91 |pmid=18336940|display-authors=8 |author10=Swedish Brain Tumour Study Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skold"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1259/bjr/56953620 |title=Boron neutron capture therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: An assessment of clinical potential |year=2010 |last1=Sköld |first1=K. |last2=Gorlia |first2=T. |last3=Pellettieri |first3=L. |last4=Giusti |first4=V. |last5=H-Stenstam |first5=B. |last6=Hopewell |first6=J.W. |journal=British Journal of Radiology |volume=83 |issue=991 |pages=596–603 |pmid=20603410 |pmc=3473677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith et al 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quantitative imaging and microlocalization of boron-10 in brain tumors and infiltrating tumor cells by SIMS ion microscopy: Relevance to neutron capture therapy |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/61/22/8179.full.pdf |date=15 November 2001 |last1=Smith |first1=D.R. |last2=Chandra |first2=S. |last3=Barth |first3=R.F. |last4=Yang |first4=W. |last5=Joel |first5=D.D. |last6=Coderre |first6=J. |journal=Cancer Research |volume=61 |pages=8179–8187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer infusion time of the BPA was well tolerated by the 30 patients who were enrolled in this study. All were treated with 2 fields, and the average whole brain dose was 3.2–6.1&amp;nbsp;Gy (weighted), and the minimum dose to the tumor ranged from 15.4 to 54.3&amp;nbsp;Gy (w). There has been some disagreement among the Swedish investigators regarding the evaluation of the results. Based on incomplete survival data, the MeST was reported as 14.2 months and the time to tumor progression was 5.8 months.&lt;ref name="Henriksson"/&gt; However, more careful examination &lt;ref name="Skold"/&gt; of the complete survival data revealed that the MeST was 17.7 months compared to 15.5 months that has been reported for patients who received standard therapy of surgery, followed by radiotherapy (RT) and the drug [[temozolomide]] (TMZ).&lt;ref name="Stupp"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70025-7 |title=Effects of radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus radiotherapy alone on survival in glioblastoma in a randomised phase III study: 5-year analysis of the EORTC-NCIC trial |year=2009 |last1=Stupp |first1=R. |last2=Hegi |first2=M.E. |last3=Mason |first3=W.P. |last4=Van Den Bent |first4=M.J. |last5=Taphoorn |first5=M.J.B. |last6=Janzer |first6=R.C. |last7=Ludwin |first7=S.K. |last8=Allgeier |first8=A. |last9=Fisher |first9=B. |last10=Belanger |first10=K. |last11=Hau |first11=P. |last12=Brandes |first12=A.A. |last13=Gijtenbeek |first13=J. |last14=Marosi |first14=C. |last15=Vecht |first15=C.J. |last16=Mokhtari |first16=K. |last17=Wesseling |first17=P. |last18=Villa |first18=S. |last19=Eisenhauer |first19=E. |last20=Gorlia |first20=T. |last21=Weller |first21=M. |last22=Lacombe |first22=D. |last23=Cairncross |first23=J.G. |last24=Mirimanoff |first24=R.-O. |journal=The Lancet Oncology |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=459–66 |pmid=19269895|display-authors=8 |author25=European Organisation for Research Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumour Radiation Oncology Groups |author26=National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the frequency of adverse events was lower after BNCT (14%) than after radiation therapy (RT) alone (21%) and both of these were lower than those seen following RT in combination with TMZ. If this improved survival data, obtained using the higher dose of BPA and a 6-hour infusion time, can be confirmed by others, preferably in a [[randomized clinical trial]], it could represent a significant step forward in BNCT of brain tumors, especially if combined with a photon boost.

== Clinical Studies of BNCT for extracranial tumors ==

=== Head and neck cancers ===
The single most important clinical advance over the past 13 years&lt;ref name="Kato"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2009.03.103 |title=Effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy for recurrent head and neck malignancies |year=2009 |last1=Kato |first1=I. |last2=Fujita |first2=Y. |last3=Maruhashi |first3=A. |last4=Kumada |first4=H. |last5=Ohmae |first5=M. |last6=Kirihata |first6=M. |last7=Imahori |first7=Y. |last8=Suzuki |first8=M. |last9=Sakrai |first9=Y. |last10=Sumi |first10=T. |last11=Iwai |first11=S. |last12=Nakazawa |first12=M. |last13=Murata |first13=I. |last14=Miyamaru |first14=H. |last15=Ono |first15=K. |journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes |volume=67 |issue=7–8 |pages=S37–42 |pmid=19409799|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been the application of BNCT to treat patients with recurrent tumors of the head and neck region who had failed all other therapy. These studies were first initiated by Kato et al. in Japan&lt;ref name="Kato"/&gt; and subsequently followed by several other Japanese groups and by Kankaanranta, Joensuu, Auterinen, Koivunoro and their co-workers in Finland.&lt;ref name="Kanakaanranta Boron Neutron"/&gt; All of these studies employed BPA as the boron delivery agent, either alone or in combination with BSH. A very heterogeneous group of patients with a variety of histopathologic types of tumors have been treated, the largest number of which had recurrent squamous cell carcinomas. Kato et al. have reported on a series of 26 patients with far-advanced cancer for whom there were no further treatment options.&lt;ref name="Kato"/&gt; Either BPA + BSH or BPA alone were administered by a 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;h i.v. infusion, and this was followed by BNCT using an epithermal beam. In this series, there were complete regressions in 12 cases, 10 partial regressions, and progression in 3 cases. The MST was 13.6 months, and the 6-year survival was 24%. Significant treatment related complications ("adverse" events) included transient mucositis, alopecia and, rarely, brain necrosis and osteomyelitis.

Kankaanranta et al. have reported their results in a prospective Phase I/II study of 30 patients with inoperable, locally recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region.&lt;ref name="Kanakaanranta Boron Neutron"/&gt; Patients received either two or, in a few instances, one BNCT treatment using BPA (400&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), administered i.v. over 2 hours, followed by neutron irradiation. Of 29 evaluated patients, there were 13 complete and 9 partial remissions, with an overall response rate of 76%. The most common adverse event was oral mucositis, oral pain, and fatigue. Based on the clinical results, it was concluded that BNCT was effective for the treatment of inoperable, previously irradiated patients with head and neck cancer. Some responses were durable but progression was common, usually at the site of the previously recurrent tumor. As previously indicated in the section on neutron sources, all clinical studies have ended in Finland, based on a variety of reasons including economic difficulties of the two companies directly involved, VTT and Boneca. However, there are plans to resume clinical studies using an accelerator neutron source designed and fabricated by Neutron Therapeutics. Finally, a group in [[Taiwan]], led by Ling-Wei Wang and his co-workers at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, have treated 17 patients with locally recurrent head and neck cancers at the Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor (THOR) of the [[National Tsing Hua University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2011.03.008 |title=BNCT for locally recurrent head and neck cancer: Preliminary clinical experience from a phase I/II trial at Tsing Hua Open-Pool Reactor |year=2011 |last1=Wang |first1=L.W. |last2=Wang |first2=S.J. |last3=Chu |first3=P.Y. |last4=Ho |first4=C.Y. |last5=Jiang |first5=S.H. |last6=Liu |first6=Y.W.H. |last7=Liu |first7=Y.H. |last8=Liu |first8=H.M. |last9=Peir |first9=J.J. |last10=Chou |first10=F.I. |last11=Yen |first11=S.H. |last12=Lee |first12=Y.L. |last13=Chang |first13=C.W. |last14=Liu |first14=C.S. |last15=Chen |first15=Y.W. |last16=Ono |first16=K. |journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes |volume=69 |issue=12 |pages=1803–6 |pmid=21478023|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-year overall survival was 47% and two-year loco-regional control was 28%. Further studies are in progress to further optimize their treatment regimen.

=== Other types of tumors ===

====Melanoma====
Other extracranial tumors that have been treated include malignant [[melanomas]], which originally was carried out in Japan by the late Yutaka Mishima and his clinical team in the Department of Dermatology at Kobe University&lt;ref name="Mishima"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-9567-7_1 |chapter=Selective thermal neutron capture therapy of cancer cells using their specific metabolic activities—melanoma as prototype |title=Cancer neutron capture therapy |year=1996 |last1=Mishima |first1=Y. |isbn=978-1-4757-9569-1 |pages=1–26 |editor1-first=Y. |editor1-last=Mishima}}&lt;/ref&gt; using BPA and a thermal neutron beam. It is important to point out that it was Mishima who first used BPA as a boron delivery agent and this subsequently was extended to other types of tumors based on the experimental studies of Coderre et al. at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coderre|first=Jeffrey A.|last2=Joel|first2=Darrel D.|last3=Micca|first3=Peggy L.|last4=Nawrocky|first4=Marta M.|last5=Slatkin|first5=Daniel N.|date=1992-01-01|title=Control of Intracerebral Gliosarcomas in Rats by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with p-Boronophenylalanine|jstor=3578028|journal=Radiation Research|volume=129|issue=3|pages=290–296|doi=10.2307/3578028|bibcode=1992RadR..129..290C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local control was achieved in almost all patients, and some were cured of their melanomas. More recently, Junichi Hiratsuka and his colleagues at Kawasaki Medical School Hospital have treated patients with melanoma of the head and neck region, vulva, and extramammary Paget's disease of the genital region with impressive clinical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Boron neutron capture therapy for vulvar melanoma and genital extramammary Paget's disease, with curative responses |year=2018 |last1=Hiratsuka |first1=J. |last2=Kamitani |first2=N. |last3=Tanaka |first3=R. |last4=Yoden |first4=E. |last5=Tokiya |first5=R. |last6=Suzuki |first6=M. |last7=Barth |first7=R.F. |last8=Ono |first8=K. |journal=Cancer Communications |volume=(in press) |issue= 1|pages= 38|pmid= 29914570|pmc=6006671 |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1186/s40880-018-0297-9 }}{{verification needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first clinical trial of BNCT in Argentina for the treatment of melanomas was performed in October 2003&lt;ref name="cnea.gov.ar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnea.gov.ar/xxi/bnct/eng/e-proyecto-cnea.asp |title=The BNCT Project at the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) |publisher=Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323100804/http://www.cnea.gov.ar/xxi/bnct/eng/e-proyecto-cnea.asp |archivedate=23 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then several patients with cutaneous melanomas have been treated as part of a Phase II clinical trial at the RA-6 nuclear reactor in Bariloche. The neutron beam has a mixed thermal-hyperthermal neutron spectrum that can be use to treat superficial tumors.&lt;ref name="cnea.gov.ar"/&gt; Finally, as recently reported,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yong|first=Z. |last2=Song|first2=Z. |last3=Zhou|first3=Y. |last4=Liu|first4=T. |last5=Zhang|first5=Z. |last6=Zhao|first6=Y. |last7=Chen|first7=Y. |last8=Jin|first8=C. |display-authors=etal |year=2016 |title=Boron neutron capture therapy for malignant melanoma: first clinical case report in China |journal=Chin.

The ultimate aim of the group in Beijing is to initiate a multi-institutional randomized clinical trial to evaluate BNCT of melanomas.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Colorectal cancer====
Two patients with colon cancer, which had spread to the liver, have been treated by Zonta and his co-workers at the University of Pavia in Italy.&lt;ref name="Zonta"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2009.03.087 |title=Extra-corporeal liver BNCT for the treatment of diffuse metastases: What was learned and what is still to be learned |year=2009 |last1=Zonta |first1=A. |last2=Pinelli |first2=T. |last3=Prati |first3=U. |last4=Roveda |first4=L. |last5=Ferrari |first5=C. |last6=Clerici |first6=A.M. |last7=Zonta |first7=C. |last8=Mazzini |first8=G. |last9=Dionigi |first9=P. |last10=Altieri |first10=S. |last11=Bortolussi |first11=S. |last12=Bruschi |first12=P. |last13=Fossati |first13=F. |journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes |volume=67 |issue=7–8 |pages=S67–75 |pmid=19394837|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was treated in 2001 and the second in mid-2003. The patients received an i.v. infusion of BPA, followed by removal of the liver (hepatectomy), which was irradiated outside of the body (extracorporeal BNCT) and then re-transplanted into the patient. The first patient did remarkably well and survived for over 4 years after treatment, but the second died within a month of cardiac complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/41/1/054 |title=Clinical lessons from the first applications of BNCT on unresectable liver metastases |year=2006 |last1=Zonta |first1=A. |last2=Prati |first2=U. |last3=Roveda |first3=L. |last4=Ferrari |first4=C. |last5=Zonta |first5=S. |last6=Clerici |first6=A.M. |last7=Zonta |first7=C. |last8=Pinelli |first8=T. |last9=Fossati |first9=F. |last10=Altieri |first10=S. |last11=Bortolussi |first11=S. |last12=Bruschi |first12=P. |last13=Nano |first13=R. |last14=Barni |first14=S. |last15=Chiari |first15=P. |last16=Mazzini |first16=G. |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=484–95 |bibcode=2006JPhCS..41..484Z|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, this is a very challenging approach for the treatment of hepatic metastases, and it is unlikely that it will ever be widely used. Nevertheless, the good clinical results in the first patient established ''proof of principle''. Finally, Yanagie and his colleagues at Meiji Pharmaceutical University in Japan have treated several patients with recurrent rectal cancer using BNCT. Although no long-term results have been reported, there was evidence of short-term clinical responses.&lt;ref&gt;Yanagie, H., Oyama, K., Hatae, R. et al. Clinical experiences of boron neutron capture therapy to recurrenced rectal cancers. Abstracts 16th Intl' Congress on Neutron Capture Therapy. Helsinki, Finland, June 14–19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusions ==
BNCT represents a joining together of nuclear technology, chemistry, biology, and medicine to treat brain tumors, recurrent head and neck cancers, and cutaneous and extracutaneous melanomas. Sadly, the lack of progress in developing more effective treatments for these tumors has been part of the driving force that continues to propel research in this field. BNCT may be best suited as an adjunctive treatment, used in combination with other modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy for those malignancies, whether primary or recurrent, for which there are no effective therapies. Clinical studies have demonstrated the safety of BNCT. The challenge facing clinicians and researchers is how to move forward. A significant advantage of BNCT is the potential ability to selectively deliver a radiation dose to the tumor with a much lower dose to surrounding normal tissues. This is an important feature that makes BNCT particularly attractive for salvage therapy of patients with a variety of malignancies who already have been heavily irradiated. Although it may be only palliative, BNCT can produce striking clinical responses, as evidenced by the experiences of several groups treating patients with recurrent, therapeutically refractory head and neck cancers.

Challenges that need to be addressed include:
#Optimizing the dosing paradigms and administration of BPA and BSH.
#The development of more tumor-selective boron delivery agents for BNCT.
#Accurate, real time dosimetry to better estimate the radiation doses delivered to the tumor and normal tissues.
#Evaluation of recently constructed accelerator-based neutron sources as an alternative to nuclear reactors.

For a more detailed discussion of these challenges and their solutions in BNCT, readers are referred to the published abstracts of the 17th International Congresses on Neutron Capture Therapy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icnct17.org/AbstractBook.html#p=14|title=ICNCT-17 Abstract Book|last=|first=|date=|editor-last=Jalisatgi|editor-first=S.|website=www.icnct17.org|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, two reviews on the current status of BNCT&lt;ref name="Barth et al 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt;, and a recent Commentary that provides a realistic appraisal of the fugure of BNCT.

'''Pacific Science Center''' is an independent, [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[science]] center in [[Seattle, Washington]] with a mission to ignite [[curiosity]] and fuel a passion for [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]], [[Experiment|experimentation]], and [[critical thinking]].  Pacific Science Center serves more than 1 million people each year at its campus adjacent to [[Seattle Center]], at the Mercer Slough Environmental Education Center in [[Bellevue, Washington]], and in communities and classrooms across the state of Washington.

==Organization==
Pacific Science Center sits on {{convert|7.1|acre|m2}} of land at the southwest corner of [[Seattle Center]].  A satellite campus, the Mercer Slough Environmental Education Center, is a collaboration between Pacific Science Center and the City of [[Bellevue, Washington]] with educational programming for all ages about environmental stewardship, [[wetland]] ecology and nature awareness. Pacific Science Center also offers year-round youth, teen, family and adult programs, including summer camps in various Puget Sound locations, science-themed 21+ events and research weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/Education/Programs/education |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162121/http://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/Education/Programs/education |archivedate=2015-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacific Science Center's outreach program, Science On Wheels, has a fleet of vans that bring hands-on science education to schools throughout the Pacific Northwest.  The center also has a division of staff whose purpose is to assist teachers in teaching science to their students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/Science-on-Wheels/science-on-wheels&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ford E-Series of the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, WA.jpg|thumb|right|A Science Center van]]
The center's original buildings were the United States Science Pavilion designed by [[Minoru Yamasaki]] for the 1962 [[Century 21 Exposition|World’s Fair in Seattle]]. Eventually becoming Pacific Science Center, the World of Science, along with the Worlds of Art, Entertainment, Commerce and Industry, and Tomorrow were the five main theme areas that were intended for the masses at the World's Fair. Located at the southernmost end of the fairgrounds and west of the Space Needle, the World of Science was located under the arches, an easily identifiable landmark. In recent years, Pacific Science Center has become a nonprofit, instead of being leased from the city of Seattle.

The fountains located at the entrance of the center appeared in the movie ''[[It Happened at the World's Fair]]'' with [[Elvis Presley]]. After the World's Fair closed, the U.S. Science Pavilion was re-opened as Pacific Science Center.  The land and buildings were leased for $1.00 a year until 2004 when the title deed was signed over and the Pacific Science Center Foundation officially took ownership.

===1960s===
During the 1960s, many of the center's exhibits were carried over from the original [[World's Fair]] exhibition, though only a few of these original exhibits remain.  Currently, exhibits remaining from the World's Fair are the Lens and Mirror Machine and a suspended model of the Earth's moon.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/67034_fairmemories19.shtml Recalling the time of their lives]", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, April 19, 2002 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606124318/http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/67034_fairmemories19.shtml |date=June 6, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more notable science exhibits during the World's Fair was a ramp where the buildings were built at a tilt (the "illusion ramp");  this exhibit was reproduced in the late 1990s. The domed Spacerium, now known as the Seattle Laser Dome and used for [[laser show|laser light show]], was designed for a wide-angle movie journey through space. Before [[IMAX]], a previous movie theater there showed films such as NASA's [[Apollo 8]] (to the soundtrack of Yellow Submarine) and The 21st Century with Walter Cronkite.  Before being elected governor of the state of Washington, [[Dixy Lee Ray]], Ph.D. served as Science Center director for many years.  Ray helped promote the Science Center among school children by hosting a school-age geared science program televised on Seattle [[PBS]] station [[KCTS-TV|KCTS-9]].

===1970s===
In the mid-1970s, the lower-level math area was dominated by the [[Charles Eames|IBM Mathematica]] exhibit where demonstrators in orange jackets (known as "OJ"s) made [[soap bubble]]s and showed audiences how the stylish new [[Chevrolet Chevette]] was paving the way for the quick adoption of the [[Metric system]]. Upstairs, a giant apparatus known as the probability machine would ring an alarm before emptying out a bin of balls. This machine was originally designed as an exhibit for the IBM Pavilion at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nywf64.com/ibm06.shtml |title=Pavilions &amp;amp; Attractions - IBM - Page Six |accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An aerospace building contained a full-sized [[lunar module]] mockup from which suited [[astronaut]]s would climb out. The Life Building contained the [[Sea monster house]], a replica of a [[First Nations]] [[longhouse]],&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a working hydraulic model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exhibits.pacsci.org/puget_sound/PSSummary.html |accessdate=22 December 2011 |title=Pacific Science Center Exhibits}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Puget Sound]] and the [[Mount Baker]] volcanic exhibit. With the physical sciences, the physics [[witch]] on [[Halloween]] would ask "Would you like to boil ''blood'' in a paper cup?" or [[Groucho Marx]] would dump [[liquid nitrogen]] on the ponds after a demo. The presenters in question here were Janie Mann, who did dynamic combustion shows dressed as a witch circa 1977-78, and Dan Cox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlcox.wordpress.com |title=Daniel Cox Homepage |accessdate=22 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026001739/http://dlcox.wordpress.com/ |archivedate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who did physics demos as Groucho Marx in the same era.  Cox would later go on to become a professor of physics.  These staff were part of the "OJ" program (short for "Orange Jacket," the uniform of the time for Science Center tour guides and visitor assistants). The program consisted of 24 work study students, whose leader in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Carl Linde, set a format for the program that would last into the late 1990s.  The [[Charles Eames|Eames]] theater was originally created for a special multi-screen [[IBM]] movie for the World Fair. It was later converted into an [[IMAX]] screen in 1979, the first of two IMAX theaters at the center.

===1980s===
Pacific Science Center grew dramatically in the 1980s.  A key step in its evolution was the hiring of George Moynihan as Executive Director in 1980.  Moynihan, from the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, would run the center for the next two decades.  His leadership team in the 1980s included Diane Carlson in public programs, Dennis Schatz in education and exhibits, and Dave Taylor in exhibits.  In 1984 the science center took a gamble on hosting the exhibit "China: 7000 Years of Discovery."  The success of the exhibit helped put PSC on the map as a leading science center.  Other notable successes later in the decade were several iterations of a traveling robotic dinosaur exhibit, which led to the center eventually installing a permanent dinosaur display in the 1990s.  Pacific Science Center hosted the annual Association of Science and Technology Centers conference in October 1987 and opened several major exhibits in the same period, including Kids Works, Body Works, an animal area and a tide pool.

==Design and architecture==
The Pacific Science Center complex was designed by [[Minoru Yamasaki]].  Yamasaki was later the architect of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]]. The walls of each building, composed of many pre-cast concrete slabs, form an arch motif used by Yamasaki in a number of other buildings he has designed.

In 2013 Pacific Science Center put out a call for public art which would demonstrate the use of solar energy.  The resulting installation was designed by Seattle artist [[Dan Corson]] and involves five 10 meter (33&amp;nbsp;ft) tall sculptures of flowers, inspired by the [[Stenocarpus sinuatus|Australian firewheel tree]].  The work is titled ''Sonic Bloom'' and generates electricity using solar panels mounted in the flower heads.  The flowers hum when people approach them and light up at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/sonic-bloom-a-new-solar-powered-sculpture-8992622/?no-ist Smithsonian Magazine: Sonic Bloom! A New Solar-Powered Sculpture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==IMAX and permanent exhibits==
{{For|more background regarding the IMAX format|IMAX}}
Today Pacific Science Center is composed of eight buildings, including two [[IMAX]] theaters (one of only a few places in the world with more than one IMAX theater), one of the world's largest Laser Dome theaters, a tropical [[butterfly]] house, a [[planetarium]], and hundreds of hands-on science exhibits. Puzzle Palooza, a puzzle- and strategy-game based exhibit focusing on mathematical and logical reasoning that was at the Science Center for a few months, has been removed to create space for a new permanent exhibit, "Professor Wellbody's Academy of Health and Wellness", which opened December 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;

A plot twist may be [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]], to prepare the audience to accept it. There are a variety of methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience or misleading them with ambiguous or false information.

Revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a "[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]", since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience not expecting it. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lehrer, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don’t Spoil Anything], '' Wired Science Blogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early examples==
An early example of the romance genre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale "[[The Three Apples]]". It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator's own slave.

==Mechanics==
{{section refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
''[[Anagnorisis]]'', or discovery, is the protagonist's sudden recognition of their own or another character's true identity or nature.&lt;ref name="Baldick2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'': [[Oedipus]] kills his father and marries his mother in ignorance, learning the truth only toward the climax of the play.&lt;ref&gt;John MacFarlane, "Aristotle's Definition of Anagnorisis." ''American Journal of Philology'' - Volume 121, Number 3 (Whole Number 483), Fall 2000, pp. 367-383.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a [[crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.&lt;ref name=Pinault&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marzolph&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he didn't survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled "[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]", the viewer discovers at the climax that the characters are discarded toys in a [[clothing bin|donation bin]].&lt;!-- This fact is self evident by watching the episode.--&gt; In ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', [[Edward Norton]]'s character realizes that Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]) is his own [[multiple personality]]. A mental patient in the horror film ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is, in fact, unknown, as in ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' or the eponymous assassins in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Flashback===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]], or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain's past victims, as [[Sergio Leone]] did with [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' or [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Odessa File]]''. The TV series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' and manga (twice made into a movie) ''[[Old Boy (manga)|Old Boy]]'' uses similar twists.

===Unreliable narrator===
An [[unreliable narrator]] twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Motif (literature)|motif]] is often used within [[noir fiction]] and [[Film noir|films]], notably in the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', a novel that generated much controversy due to critics' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224193140/http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-12-24 |title=The ubiquitous unreliable narrator |publisher=My.en.com |date=1996-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (and [[David Fincher]]'s [[Fight Club|film adaptation]]), [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Book of the New Sun]]'', the second episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', [[Iain Pears]]'s ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]''.

===Peripeteia===
''[[Peripeteia]]'' is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character's circumstances.&lt;ref name="PayneBarbera2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Payne|author2=Jessica Rae Barbera|title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjSl5y_i8TEC&amp;pg=PA689|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=31 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2346-7|page=689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''deus ex machina'' device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode "[[Time Enough at Last]]" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.

===Deus ex machina===
''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning "god out of the machine." It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.&lt;ref name="Shipley1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the "deus ex machina" ('ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. In its modern, figurative sense, the "deus ex machina" brings about an ending to a narrative through unexpected (generally happy) resolution to what appears to be a problem that cannot be overcome (see [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]''). This device is often used to end a bleak story on a more positive note.

===Poetic justice===
[[Poetic justice]] is a literary device in which [[virtue]] is ultimately rewarded or [[vice]] punished in such a way that the reward or punishment has a logical connection to the deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA439|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=439|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern literature, this device is often used to create an [[Irony|ironic]] twist of fate in which the villain gets caught up in his/her own trap. For example, in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'', Prince Rabadash climbs upon a mounting block during the battle in Archenland. Upon jumping down while shouting "The bolt of [[Tash (Narnia)|Tash]] falls from above," his [[hauberk]] catches on a hook and leaves him hanging there, humiliated and trapped. Another example of poetic justice can be found in [[John Boyne]]'s ''[[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas]]'', in which a [[concentration camp]] commander's son is mistakenly caught up with inmates rounded up for gassing, or in [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s picture book, ''[[The Sweetest Fig]]'', where a cold-hearted dentist is cruel to his dog, and ends up getting his comeuppance.

===Chekhov's gun===
[[Chekhov's gun]] refers to a seemingly minor character or plot element introduced early in the narrative that suddenly acquires great importance to the narrative. One example of this is the beggar woman in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]''. At the end of the musical, she is revealed to be the main character's wife.&lt;ref name="BergmanLambert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory Bergman|author2=Josh Lambert|title=Geektionary: From Anime to Zettabyte, An A to Z Guide to All Things Geek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbYLQfZrUPcC&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=18 December 2010|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-1188-2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mechanism is the "plant", a preparatory device that repeats throughout the story. During the resolution, the true significance of the plant is revealed.

===Red herring===
A [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.&lt;ref name="Asong2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named "Bishop Aringarosa" draw attention away from the true master villain ("Aringarosa" literally translates as "pink herring"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel [[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]] (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].

=== False protagonist ===
A [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins.

===In medias res===
''[[In medias res]]'' ([[Latin]] for "into the middle of things") is a literary technique in which narrative proceeds from the middle of the story rather than its beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Clifford|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information such as characterization, setting, and motive is revealed through a series of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s. This technique creates a twist when the cause for the inciting incident is not revealed until the climax. This technique is used within the film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' in which the opening scenes show one of the main characters drowning and the other being imprisoned. Subsequent scenes reveal the events leading up to these situations through a series of flashbacks. In ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'', a similar beginning proves to be a flashforward as it is the linear conclusion of the events that then follow; this is not apparent until the end. ''In medias res'' is often used to provide a [[narrative hook]].

===Non-linear narrative===
A [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.&lt;ref name="Steiff2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc. Productions |publisher=Plotsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse chronology===
[[Reverse chronology]] works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event.&lt;ref name="Philips2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Edward Philips|title=Writing African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq5wGaae5qkC&amp;pg=PA507|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-256-3|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a "twist ending". Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]] and the [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

'''Robert Tavernor''' (born 1954) is an [[English people|English]] Emeritus Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at the [[London School of Economics]] and Political Science (LSE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/sociology/whoswho/academic/tavernor.aspx |title=Professor Robert Tavernor - Academic staff - Who's who - Department of Sociology - Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and founding director of the Tavernor Consultancy in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavernorconsultancy.co.uk/ |title=Home &amp;#124; Tavernor Consultancy Architecture + Heritage |work=Tavernorconsultancy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an [[architecture]] [[historian]] and [[urbanist]], who has published widely on architecture and urban design, including the impact of tall buildings on historic cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/482/48244.htm |title=House of Commons - Transport, Local Government and the Regions - Memoranda |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2002-01-22 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a long academic career, having been appointed to the Forbes Chair in Architecture at the University of Edinburgh at age 36.

== Biography ==

Tavernor was born in England and studied architecture in London (BA and Dip. Arch with Distinction, 1973–79), Rome ([[British Prix de Rome]] in Architecture at the [[British School at Rome]], 1979–80&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsr.ac.uk/awards/architecture-awards-ii/rome-prize-in-architecture-2 |title=Rome Prize in Architecture « The British School at Rome |publisher=Bsr.ac.uk |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and at the [[University of Cambridge]] (St John's College, 1980–83, doctorate awarded 1985), where his PhD thesis, ''Concinnitas in the Architectural Theory and Practice of Leon Battista Alberti'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/239042 |title=Concinnitas in the architectural theory and practice of Leon Battista Alberti |publisher=Dspace.cam.ac.uk |date=1985-11-12 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supervised by [[Joseph Rykwert]]. He is a registered architect and a member of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (since 1985).

He has held multiple academic posts in the UK. He was formerly Forbes Professor of Architecture at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1992–95), Professor of Architecture and Head of the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering at the [[University of Bath]] (1995–2005), LSE Professor of Architecture and Urban Design (2005–2011) and Director of the [[LSE Cities]] Programme (2005–08). He held various visiting academic posts internationally, including Visiting Professor at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA, 1998), European Union Visiting Scholar in planning and conservation at the [[University of Texas A&amp;M]] (2002); and Visiting Professor in Architecture and Urbanism at the University of São Paulo, Brazil (2004), and the University of Bath (since 2009).

He founded the Centre for Advanced Studies in Architecture (CASA) at Bath, and with [[Vaughan Hart]], established a focus on Classical and Italian Renaissance architectural treatises; between them they have translated and written about the leading classical architectural theorists – including, [[Vitruvius]], [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]]. He has been a national assessor for the Architecture and the Built Environment sub-panel of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE2008) for the UK Higher Education Funding Council for Education (HEFCE), and a member of the Faculty of the Fine Arts of the British School at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsr.ac.uk/about/governance |title=Governance « The British School at Rome |publisher=Bsr.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tavernor initiated (with co-authors) a series of modern translations of the principal classical architectural treatise writers – Vitruvius, Alberti and Palladio – and is the sole author of parallel monographs on these subjects published by (Yale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300124927 |title=Smoot's Ear - Tavernor, Robert - Yale University Press |work=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103083921/http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300124927 |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/robert-tavernor |title=Robert Tavernor &amp;#124; The MIT Press |publisher=Mitpress.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book on Alberti was described as "the last and the best of the books on Alberti on this scale in the twentieth century" (Chronique).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300076158 |title=On Alberti and the Art of Building |work=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=1999-01-11 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pioneered the use of the computer to visualise urban forms in architectural exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1578928 |title=Cambridge Journals Online - arq: Architectural Research Quarterly - Abstract - Architectural history and computing |work=Journals.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-curating with Rykwert in 1994 the international exhibition of Alberti's work at [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]] for the computer firm [[Olivetti]]. As a consultant architect and urbanist he applies his knowledge of architectural history, design and the visual representation of buildings in advising planners and architects on the form, character, scale and massing of tall buildings in the [[City of London]] and along the south bank of the [[Thames]]. His advice on several large urban masterplan projects in London (including Battersea Power Station) led to him being invited in 2007, by former Russian Senator Gordeev, to assemble and to contribute his expertise to an international masterplanning team to re-configure the city of [[Perm]] (population of 1 million) in the southern [[Urals]]. The published masterplan led by KCAP was awarded the Grand Prix at the Moscow Architecture Biennale in May 2010.

== Works ==

As an architectural historian and theorist, he is an expert in the foundations of [[Italian Renaissance architecture]] and the transmission of associated ideas and forms to England and America. He is the author of ''Palladio and Palladianism'' (1991 – subsequently translated into Italian, Chinese and Korean) and ''On Alberti and the Art of Building'' (1998). He is co-translator of two English translations of architectural treatises: Leon Battista Alberti’s 16th century ''De re aedificatoria'', as ''On the Art of Building in Ten Books'' (1988); and Andrea Palladio’s 17th century ''I quattro libri dell’architettura'', as ''The Four Books on Architecture'' (1997), and co-edited and provided the introduction to Vitruvius' ''On Architecture'' (2009).

Tavernor's translation works have become the standard texts in art historical scholarship, used by students and scholars throughout the world. His book ''Smoot’s Ear: The Measure of Humanity'' (2007 and 2008) pulls together much of his earlier writings and sets measures and measuring in a cultural context and shows how deeply they are connected to human experience and history.

He was co-editor of ''Body and Building: Essays on the changing relation of Body to Architecture'' (2002 and 2005), a collection of essays on art and architecture dedicated to Rykwert. He founded the Alberti Group with Rykwert, which led to the 1994 international exhibition on Alberti for Olivetti. [[Photogrammetry|Photogrammetric drawings]] relating to research for the exhibition can be found on the CASA website at Bath University. Tavernor was subsequently commissioned by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] to produce computer animated urban and architectural reconstructions through CASA for exhibitions in London and internationally, for the Sir John Soane Exhibition (1999), Aztecs Exhibition (2003), and by [[Tate Britain]] for the Sir [[Stanley Spencer]] Exhibition (2001).&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-7769421"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/stanley-spencer-virtual-church-house |title=Stanley Spencer - Virtual Church-House |work=tate.org.uk |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520044649/http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/stanley-spencer-virtual-church-house |archivedate=20 May 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Tavernor is currently an architectural and urban design consultant in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67280">{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of law''' (or '''legal sociology''') is often described as a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] or an interdisciplinary approach within [[jurisprudence|legal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For various definitions of the sociology of law,see Ehrlich 1936 (orig 1912); Timasheff 1939; Pound 1943; Selznick 1965, Aubert 1969 and 1980, Black 1972, Stjernquist 1983, Hydén 1986, Tomasic 1987, Ferrari 1989, Podgorecki 1991, Cotterrell 1992, Banakar 2003 and 2011; Mathiesen 2005, Deflem 2008, Travers 2009, Nelken 2009, Scuro 2010, Banakar and Travers 2013, Banakar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see sociology of law as belonging "necessarily" to the field of sociology,&lt;ref&gt;See Deflem 2008:3.&lt;/ref&gt; but others tend to consider it a field of research caught up between the disciplines of [[law]] and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003 and 2009, Banakar and Travers 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others regard it neither a subdiscipline of sociology nor a branch of legal studies but as a field of research on its own right within the broader social science tradition. Accordingly, it may be described without reference to mainstream sociology as "the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as a set of social practices or as an aspect or field of social experience".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as treating law and justice as fundamental institutions of the basic structure of society mediating "between political and economic interests, between culture and the normative order of society, establishing and maintaining interdependence, and constituting themselves as sources of consensus, coercion and social control".&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrespective of whether sociology of law is defined as a sub-discipline of sociology, an approach within legal studies or a field of research in its own right, it remains intellectually dependent mainly on the traditions, methods and theories of mainstream [[sociology]] and, to a lesser extent, on other [[social sciences]] such as [[social anthropology]], [[political science]], [[social policy]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. As such, it reflects social theories and employs social scientific methods to study [[law]], [[legal institutions]] and legal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Travers 2005, pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, sociology of law consists of various approaches to the study of law in society, which empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976; Cotterrell 1992; Hunt 1993; Santos 2002; Banakar 2003; Banakar and Travers 2002; Ferrari 1989; Luhmann 1985; Trevino 2008; Travers 2009, Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of socio-legal inquiry include the social development of legal institutions, forms of [[social control]], legal [[regulation]], the interaction between [[legal culture]]s, the social construction of legal issues, [[legal profession]] and the relation between law and [[social change]].

Sociology of law also benefits from and occasionally draws on research conducted within other fields such as [[comparative law]], [[critical legal studies]], [[jurisprudence]], [[legal theory]], [[law and economics]] and [[law and literature]]. Its object encompasses the historical movement of law and justice and their relentless contemporary construction such as in the field of jurisprudence focused on institutional questions conditioned by social and political situations, in interdisciplinary dominions such as criminology and through analysis of the economic efficiency and the social impact of legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual origins==
[[File:Veber.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Max Weber]]]]
The roots of the sociology of law can be traced back to the works of sociologists and jurists of the turn of the previous century. The relationship between law and society was sociologically explored in the seminal works of both [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]]. The writings on law by these classical sociologists are foundational to the entire sociology of law today.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other scholars, mainly jurists, also employed social scientific theories and methods in an attempt to develop sociological theories of law. Notably among these were [[Leon Petrazycki]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]].

For [[Max Weber]], a so-called "legal rational form" as a type of domination within society, is not attributable to people but to abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a [[rational-legal authority]]. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the legal sciences and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on Weber's typology see Kronman 1983: 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
[[Émile Durkheim]] wrote in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with [[restitution]] and [[damages|compensation]] grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies in which there is a high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of [[Durkheim|Durkheim's]] sociology of law see Cotterrell 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law'', [[Eugen Ehrlich]] developed a sociological approach to the study of law by focusing on how social networks and groups organized social life.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich 1936 (orig. 1912).&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the relationship between law and general social norms and distinguished between "positive law," consisting of the compulsive norms of state requiring official enforcement, and "living law," consisting of the rules of conduct that people in fact obeyed and which dominated social life. The latter emerged spontaneously as people interacted with each other to form social associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegert 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The centre of gravity of legal development therefore from time immemorial has not lain in the activity of the state, but in society itself, and must be sought there at the present time".|Eugen Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, 1936: 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was subjected to criticism by the advocates of legal positivism such as the jurist [[Hans Kelsen]] for its distinction between "law created by the state and law produced by the organisational imperatives of non-state social associations".&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelsen, Ehrlich had confused ''Sein'' ("is") and ''Sollen'' ("ought").&lt;ref&gt;For a presentation of this debate and references to the original sources of the debate see van Klink 2006. For an analysis of the debate between Kelsen and Ehrlich see Banakar 2008. Banakar argues that Kelsen could not help but miss the point that Ehrlich was making by his distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argued that Ehrlich was distinguishing between positive (or state) law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law', what Ehrlich called "living law", that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109&lt;br&gt;* Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Leon Petrazycki]]]]
[[Leon Petrazycki]] distinguished between forms of "official law," supported by the state, and "intuitive law," consisting of legal experiences that, in turn, consist of a complex of psychic processes in the mind of the individual with no reference to outside authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrazycki1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrazycki's work addressed sociological problems and his method was empirical, since he maintained that one could gain knowledge of objects or relationships only by observation. However, he couched his theory in the language of cognitive psychology and moral philosophy rather than sociology. Consequently, his contribution to the development of sociology of law remains largely unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2006; also see Podgórecki 1980; Kurczewski 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Petrazycki's "intuitive law" influenced not only the development of Georges Gurvitch's concept of "social law" (see below), which in turn has left its mark on socio-legal theorising, but also the work of later socio-legal scholars. Among those who were directly inspired by Petrazycki's work is the Polish legal sociologist [[Adam Podgórecki]].&lt;ref&gt;See Podgórecki 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Geiger]] developed a close-knit analysis of the Marxist theory of law. He highlighted how law becomes a "factor in social transformation in democratic societies of the kind that are governed by the consent expressed by universal suffrage of the population practised at regular intervals".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiger went on to develop the salient characteristics of his antimetaphysical thinking, until he exceeded it with practical [[nihilism]]. Geiger's nihilism of values paved the way for a form of [[legal nihilism]], which encourages the construction of a sober democracy "that is capable of raising conflict to the intellectual level and of anaesthetising feelings, as it is aware of its own inability to make any proclamation of value, ethics or policy about the nature of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Gurvitch]] was interested in the fusion of simultaneous manifestation of law in various forms and at various levels of social interaction. His aim was to devise the concept of "social law" as a law of integration and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;see Gurvitch, Georges, ''L'idée du droit social'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Gurvitch's social law was an integral part of his general sociology. "It is also one of the early sociological contributions to the theory of legal pluralism, since it challenged all conceptions of law based on a single source of legal, political, or moral authority".&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the sociology of law had an early reception in Argentina. As a local movement of legal scholars steeming from the work of Carlos Cossio, South American researchers have focused on comparative law and sociological insights, constitutional law and society, human rights, and psycho-social approaches to the legal practices.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Lista, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological approaches to the study of law==

===Modern sociology of law===
The sociology of law became clearly established as an academic field of learning and empirical research after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the emergence of the "sociological movement" in law after World War II see Deflem 2009: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the study of law was not central in sociology, although some well-known sociologists did write about the role of law in society. In the work of [[Talcott Parsons]], for instance, law is conceived as an essential mechanism of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticisms that were developed against functionalism, other sociological perspectives of law emerged. Critical sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Cotterrell 1992: 122-3&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a perspective of law as an instrument of power. However, other theorists in the sociology of law, such as [[Philip Selznick]], argued that modern law became increasingly responsive to a society's needs and had to be approached morally as well.&lt;ref&gt;Selznik, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholars, most notably the American sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]], developed a resolutely scientific theory of law on the basis of a paradigm of [[pure sociology]]. Equally broad in orientation, but again different, is the [[autopoietic system]]s theory of the German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]], who presents law or "the legal system" as one of the ten ''function systems'' (see [[Differentiation (sociology)|functional differentiation]]) of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Luhmann 2004 and 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth and Schutz 2015"&gt;[[Steffen Roth]] and Anton Schutz: ''Ten systems. Toward a canon of function systems.'' In: ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing'', Vol. 22, No. 4., 2015. Vorversion verfügbar (englisch; [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508950 online] auf ssrn.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|All collective human life is directly or indirectly shaped by law. Law is like knowledge, an essential and all-pervasive fact of the social condition.|Niklas Luhmann, ''A Sociological Theory of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann, 1985: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] disagrees with Luhmann and argues that the law can do a better job as a 'system' institution' by representing more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital and in so doing develop the reproductive professional ''habitus'' of the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his associates (often influenced by [[Petrazycki]]'s ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by [[Per Stjernquist]], and in Norway by [[Vilhelm Aubert]].

In more recent years, a very wide range of theories has emerged in the sociology of law as a result of the proliferation of theories in sociology at large. Among the recent influences can be mentioned the work of the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], the German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]], [[neo-Marxism]], and [[behaviorism]]. The variety of theoretical influences in the sociology of law has also marked the broader law and society field. The multi-disciplinary law and society field remains very popular, while the disciplinary speciality field of the sociology of law is also "better organized than ever in institutional and professional respects".&lt;ref&gt;Deflem 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and Society===
Law and Society is an American movement, which was established after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had a vested interest in the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by [[Lawrence Friedman]]: "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It is too important to be left to lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986:780.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders believed that the "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods".&lt;ref&gt;Austin et al, 1998:2.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Law and Society Association]] in 1964 and of the ''Law and Society Review'' in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.&lt;ref&gt;See Munger 1998 and Simon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one view, the main difference between the sociology of law and Law and Society is that the latter does not limit itself theoretically or methodologically to sociology and tries instead to accommodate insights from all social science disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an example see Friedman 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; "Not only does it provides a home for sociologists and social anthropologists and political scientists with an interest in law, it also tries to incorporate psychologists and economists who study law."&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From another point of view, both sociology of law and Law and Society should be seen as multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary enterprises although sociology of law has special ties to the methods, theories and traditions of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s a number of original empirical studies were conducted by Law and Society scholars on conflict and dispute resolution. In his early work, [[Bill Felstiner|William Felstiner]], for example, focused on alternative ways to solve conflicts (avoidance, mediation, litigation etc.). Together with [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]] and [[Austin Sarat]], Felstiner developed the idea of a disputes pyramid and the formula "naming, blaming, claiming", which refers to different stages of conflict resolution and levels of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;"See, Felstiner, Abel and Sarat 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological jurisprudence===
The sociology of law is often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages with some of the debates within jurisprudence and legal theory. Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike legal theory, is concerned with the mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faigman|first=David L.|title=Laboratory of Justice: The Supreme Court's 200-Year Struggle to Integrate Science and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsMjpPS5AXoC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2005|publisher=Henry Holt |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Roscoe. "Scope and Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence." ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 24 (1910): 591. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid E. Rumble, Jr., "Legal Realism, Sociological Jurisprudence and Mr. Justice Holmes," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1965) 26#4 pp. 547-566 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708499 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and the Russian-French sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although distinguishing between different branches of the social scientific studies of law allows us to explain and analyse the development of the sociology of law in relation to mainstream sociology and legal studies, such potentially artificial distinctions are not necessarily fruitful for the development of the field as whole. For the social scientific studies of law to transcend the theoretical and empirical limits, which currently define their scope, they need to go beyond such artificial distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-legal studies==
'Socio-legal studies' in the UK has grown mainly out of the interest of law schools in promoting interdisciplinary studies of law.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whether regarded as an emerging discipline, sub-discipline or a methodological approach, it is often viewed in light of its relationship to, and oppositional role within, law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not, therefore, be confused with the legal sociology of many West European countries or the Law and Society scholarship in the US, which foster much stronger disciplinary ties with social sciences. In the past, it has been presented as the applied branch of the sociology of law and criticised for being empiricist and atheoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Max Travers, for example, regards socio-legal studies as a subfield of social policy, 'mainly concerned with influencing or serving government policy in the provision of legal services'&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and adds that it "has given up any aspirations it once had to develop general theories about the policy process".&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001: 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of socio-legal studies include [[Carol Smart|Professor Carol Smart]], co-director of the [[Arthur Lewis Building#External links|Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life]], (named after the sociologist, [[David Morgan (sociologist)|David Morgan]]), as well as [[Mavis Maclean|Professor Mavis Maclean]] and [[John Eekelaar]] who are joint directors of the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy (OXFLAP).

'''Socio-legal methods of investigation'''

The sociology of law has no methods of investigation which have been developed specifically for conducting socio-legal research. Instead, it employs a wide variety of social scientific methods, including qualitative and quantitative research techniques, to explore law and legal phenomena. Positivistic&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interpretive (such as discourse analysis) and ethnographic&lt;ref&gt;See Travers 1997, Flood 2005 and 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; approaches to data collection and analysis is used within the socio-legal field.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of various methods see Banakar and Travers 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of law in Britain==
Sociology of law was a small, but developing, sub-field of British sociology and legal scholarship at the time when Campbell and Wiles wrote their review of law and society research in 1976. Unfortunately, despite its initial promise, it has remained a small field. Very few empirical sociological studies are published each year. Nevertheless, there have been some excellent studies, representing a variety of sociological traditions as well as some major theoretical contributions. The two most popular approaches during the 1960s and 1970s were interactionism and Marxism.

'''Symbolic interactionism and Marxism'''

[[Symbolic interactionism|Interactionism]] had become popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a politically radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing society as a system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Becker 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused on the process of law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paterson 1982; Flood 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential sociological approach during this period was, however, Marxism—which claimed to offer a scientific and comprehensive understanding of society as a whole in the same way as structural-functionalism, although with the emphasis on the struggle between different groups for material advantage, rather than value-consensus. This approach caught the imagination of many people with left-wing political views in law schools, but it also generated some interesting empirical studies. These included historical studies about how particular
statutes were used to advance the interests of dominant economic groups, and also Pat Carlen's memorable ethnography,&lt;ref&gt;Pat Carlen 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; which combined analytic resources from Marxism and interactionism, especially the sociology of Erving Goffman, in writing about magistrates' courts.

'''The Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal Studies'''

The 1980s were also a fruitful time for empirical sociology of law in Britain, mainly
because Donald Harris deliberately set out to create the conditions for a fruitful
exchange between lawyers and sociologists at the [[University of Oxford]] Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was fortunate enough to recruit a number of young and
talented social scientists, including J. Maxwell Atkinson and Robert Dingwall who were interested in ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociology
of the professions, and Doreen McBarnet who became something of a cult figure on the left after publishing her doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Doreen McBarnet 1981&lt;/ref&gt; which advanced a particularly clear and vigorous Marxist analysis of the criminal justice system. Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches have a lot in common when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, a sociologist at the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson and Drew, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest developed at Oxford during this period was the sociology of the professions. Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; edited what remains an interesting and theoretically diverse collection, bringing together specialists from the sociology of law and medicine. The best known study to date has, however, been published by the American scholar [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]]&lt;ref&gt;Abel 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who employed ideas and concepts from functionalist, Marxist, and Weberian
sociology to explain the high incomes and status that British lawyers enjoyed for most of the twentieth century.

'''Recent developments'''

Since the 1980s, relatively few empirical studies of law and legal institutions have been conducted by British sociologists, i.e. studies which are empirical and at the same time engage with the theoretical concerns of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some exceptions. To begin with, sociology of law, along with so many areas of academic work, has been enlivened and renewed through engagement with feminism. There has been a great deal of
interest in the implications of Foucault's ideas on governmentality for understanding
law,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt and Wickham 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and also in continental thinkers such as Niklas Luhmann and Pierre Bourdieu. Again, one can argue that rather fewer empirical studies have been produced than one might have hoped, but a great deal of interesting work has been published.

A second exception is to be found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 1997; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.

Despite the relatively limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law have been important in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from [[David Nelken]] exploring the problems of a comparative sociology of law and the potential of the idea of legal cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2004; 2007; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Cotterrell]] seeking to develop a new view of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms,&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars, such as [[David Schiff]] and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory and the extent to which law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social.&lt;ref&gt;Nobles and Schiff 2006; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.

==Devising a sociological concept of law==
In contrast to the traditional understanding of law (see the separate entry on [[law]]), the sociology of law does not normally view and define the law only as a system of rules, doctrine and decisions, which exist independently of the society out of which it has emerged. The rule-based aspect of law is, admittedly, important, but provides an inadequate basis for describing, analysing and understanding law in its societal context.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009; Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, legal sociology regards law as a set of institutional practices which have evolved over time and developed in relation to, and through interaction with, cultural, economic and socio-political structures and institutions. As a modern social system, law does strive to gain and retain its autonomy to function independently of other social institutions and systems such as religion, polity and economy. Yet, it remains historically and functionally linked to these other institutions. Thus, one of the objectives of the sociology of law remains to devise empirical methodologies capable of describing and explaining modern law's interdependence with other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar and Travers 2005 and Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some influential approaches within the sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example [[Eugen Ehrlich]]'s concept of "living law" and [[Georges Gurvitch]]'s "social law"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions of the legal system interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and "communities", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This approach is developed further under the section on legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;For studies of legal pluralism see Dalberg-Larsen 2000; Merry 1988; Chiba 1989; John Griffiths 1986; Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western sociology of law==

The interest in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Deva, 2005; Baxi, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but we find only a limited amount of socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;For an earlier overview of the field, see Ferrari, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the disparity between Western and non-Western sociology of law see Banakar 2011 at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary perspectives==

===Legal pluralism===
[[Legal pluralism]] is a concept developed by legal sociologists and social anthropologists "to describe multiple layers of law, usually with different sources of legitimacy, that exist within a single state or society".&lt;ref&gt;Olgiati 2007; also see Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also defined "as a situation in which two or more legal systems coexist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Sally Engle Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralists define law broadly to include not only the system of courts and judges backed by the coercive power of the state, but also the "non-legal forms of normative ordering".&lt;ref&gt;Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralism consists of many different methodological approaches and as a concept, it embraces "diverse and often contested perspectives on law, ranging from the recognition of different legal orders within the nation-state, to a more far reaching and open-ended concept of law that does not necessarily depend on state recognition for validity. This latter concept of law may come into being whenever two or more legal systems exist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The ideology of legal positivism has had such a powerful hold on the imagination of lawyers and social scientists that its picture of the legal world has been able successfully to masquerade as fact and has formed the foundation stone of social and legal theory.|John Griffiths, "What is Legal Pluralism"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths, 1986:5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Legal pluralism has occupied a central position in socio-legal theorising from the very beginning of the sociology of law. The sociological theories of [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]] were early sociological contributions to legal pluralism. It has, moreover, provided the most enduring topic of socio-legal debate over many decades within both the sociology of law and legal anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and has received more than its share of criticism from the proponents of the various schools of [[legal positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Tamanaha 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The critics often ask: "How is law distinguished in a pluralist view from other normative systems? What makes a social rule system legal?".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy arises mainly "from the claim that the only true law is the law made and enforced by the modern state".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This standpoint is also known as "legal centralism". From a legal centralist standpoint, John Griffiths writes, "law is and should be the law of the state, uniform for all persons, exclusive of all other law, and administrated by a single set of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to legal centralism, "customary laws and religious laws are not properly called 'law' except in so far as state has chosen to adopt and treat any such normative order as part of its own law".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between the "weak" and the "strong" versions of legal pluralism. The "weak" version does not necessarily question the main assumptions of "legal centralism", but only recognises that within the domain of the Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths, 2002: 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "weak" version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law is something else, something that we isolate out and call law…".&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha 1993: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong" version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion,"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".&lt;ref&gt;Galanter 1981: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism directed at legal pluralism often uses the basic assumptions of legal positivism to question the validity of theories of legal pluralism which aim at criticising those very (positivistic) assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roger Cotterrell]] explains, the pluralist conception should be understood as part of "the legal sociologist's effort to broaden perspectives on law. A legal sociologist's specification of law might be different from that presupposed by a lawyer in practice, but it will relate (indeed, in some way incorporate) the latter because it must (if it is to reflect legal experience) take account of lawyers' perspectives on law. Thus a pluralist approach in legal theory is likely to recognise what lawyers typically recognize as law, but may see this law as one species of a larger genus, or treat lawyers' conception of law as reflecting particular perspectives determined by particular objectives".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopoiesis===
[[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] originally coined the concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by [[Niklas Luhmann]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ziegert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising a solution to the problem of the humanised 'subject'.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Perhaps the most challenging idea incorporated in the theory of autopoiesis is that social systems should not be defined in terms of human agency or norms, but of communications. Communication is in turn the unity of utterance, information and understanding and constitutes social systems by recursively reproducing communication. This sociologically radical thesis, which raises the fear of a dehumanised theory of law and society, attempts to highlight the fact that social systems are constituted by communicative."&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Max Travers 2005: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Cotterrell]], "Luhmann... treats the theory as the basis for all general sociological analysis of social systems and their mutual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But its theoretical claims about law's autonomy are very powerful postulates, presented in advance of (and even, perhaps, in place of) the kind of detailed empirical study of social and legal change that comparatists and most legal sociologists are likely to favour. The postulates of autopoiesis theory do not so much guide empirical research as explain conclusively how to interpret whatever this research may discover."&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cultures===
[[Legal culture]] is one of the central concepts of the sociology of law. The study of legal cultures may, at the same time, be regarded as one of the general approaches within the sociology of law.

As a concept, it refers to "relatively stable patterns of legally-oriented social behaviour and attitudes," and as such is regarded as a subcategory of the concept of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nelken, 2004: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new concept which, according to [[David Nelken]], can be traced to "terms like legal tradition or legal style, which have a much longer history in comparative law or in early political science. It presupposes and invites us to explore the existence of systematic variations in patterns in 'law in the books' and 'law in action,' and, above all, in the relation between them".&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an approach, it focuses on the cultural aspects of law, legal behaviour and legal institutions and, thus, has affinity with [[cultural anthropology]], legal pluralism, and [[comparative law]].

[[Lawrence M. Friedman]] is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 193. But for criticism of the vagueness of this and other formulations of the concept of legal culture in sociology of law, see Cotterrell, 2006, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.

===Feminism===
Law has always been regarded as one of the important sites of engagement for feminism. As pointed out by Ruth Fletcher feminist engagement with the law has taken many forms through the years, which also indicates their successful merging of theory and practice: "Through litigation, campaigns for reform and legal education, feminists have engaged explicitly with law and the legal profession. In taking on the provisions of specialist advice services, women's groups have played a role in making law accessible to those in need. By subjecting legal concepts and methods to critical analysis, feminists have questioned the terms of legal debate."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
[[Globalization]] is often defined in terms of economic processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth&lt;ref&gt;Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Volkmar Gessner&lt;ref&gt;Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology of globalization and remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.&lt;ref&gt;For one of the relatively early empirical studies see Dezalay and Garth 1996. For a collection of empirical studies of law and globalization see Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pointed out by Halliday and Osinsky, "[[Economic globalization]] cannot be understood apart from global business regulation and the legal construction of the markets on which it increasingly depends. Cultural globalization cannot be explained without attention to intellectual property rights institutionalized in law and global governance regimes. The globalization of protections for vulnerable populations cannot be comprehended without tracing the impact of international criminal and humanitarian law or international tribunals. Global contestation over the institutions of democracy and state building cannot be meaningful unless considered in relation to constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday and Osinsk 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socio-legal approaches to the study of globalization and global society often overlap with, or make use of, studies of legal cultures and legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;See Teubner 1996; Feest and Nelken 2007, Friedman and Perez-Perdomo 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Act of the Twenty-sixth General Assembly of Illinois, approved March 9, 1869, created '''Southern Illinois Normal College,''' the second state-supported [[normal school]] in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Howard, ''Illinois: A History of the Prairie State'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1972), 341.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbondale held the ceremony of cornerstone laying, May 17, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, Eli G. (1955). ''Seventy-Five Years in Retrospect'', Carbondale, IL.: Southern Illinois University. pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; The first historic session of Southern Illinois Normal University was a summer institute, with a first faculty of eight members and an enrollment of 53 students.&lt;ref&gt;"Southern Illinois University: the First Seventy-Five Years." ( Jan 1949). [http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=ua_docs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university continued primarily as a teacher's college until [[Delyte W. Morris]] took office as president of the university in 1948. Morris was SIU's longest-serving president (1948–1970).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19991010060656/http://www.dailyegyptian.com/fall98/delytemorris/]&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Morris transformed SIU, adding Colleges of Law, Medicine and Dentistry. Since World War II, higher education has been emphasized as a goal for more students. Southern Illinois University grew rapidly in size from 3,500 to over 24,800 students between 1950 and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328072315/http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/|date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, a second campus of SIU was established at Edwardsville.  This school, now known as [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]], is an independent university within the SIU system.

== Leadership ==
[[Randy Dunn]] was the eighth president of the Southern Illinois University System. Dr. Dunn served as president at two other state institutions and was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education. His career in education includes classroom teaching, serving as principal at two school districts, serving as superintendent for two Illinois school systems, and holding the rank of professor at two universities including SIUC. Dr. Dunn has served on a number of committees, councils and task forces, and he contributes to a variety of scholarly publications. 
Dunn received his doctorate in educational administration from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1991.  He graduated from Illinois State University with a master's in administration and foundations in 1983, and the B.S. in education in 1980.
Before coming to Southern Illinois, he served as president at two other state institutions — Murray State University in Kentucky (2006-2013) and Youngstown State University in Ohio (2013-2014).  Before that, Dunn was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education.  He is not a stranger to the SIU System, having held the rank of professor in the Department of Educational Administration and Higher Education at SIUC.  Dunn started at the Carbondale campus as an associate professor in 1995 and was named department chair in 2000, before leaving to assume the state superintendency.  During his term as chair, he also taught in the joint doctoral program in educational leadership at SIU Edwardsville.  Dunn began his academic career as an assistant professor in the Department of Leadership at The University of Memphis for two years before taking his faculty post at Southern Illinois University.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siusystem.edu/president/index.shtml |title=SIU President |publisher=Siusystem.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018 Randy Dunn stepped down as SIU system president, and was replaced by J. Kevin Dorsey, as interim president. Dorsey was the former dean of the SIU school of medicine.

Carlo Montemagno, a professor of engineering, became chancellor of SIU Carbondale on August 15, 2017. His appointment was approved by the university's Board of Trustees July 13, 2017, at the recommendation of SIU System President Randy Dunn.Dr. Montemagno is an internationally recognized expert in nanotechnology and biomedical engineering, focusing his work on linking multiple disciplines to solve problems in areas of health, energy and the environment. Prior to his appointment at SIU, he founded the interdisciplinary Ingenuity Lab based at the University of Alberta in Canada. In addition to leading the lab, which connects organizations and researchers from across the Province of Alberta, he served as director of the biomaterials program for the Canadian Research Council's National Institute for Nanotechnology as well as research chair in intelligent nanosystems for the Canadian National Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chancellor.siu.edu/|title=Chancellor {{!}} Southern Illinois University|website=Chancellor|language=en|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Southern Illinois Salukis}}
The '''Southern Illinois Salukis''' are the athletic teams representing Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The university first sponsored athletic teams during the 1913–14 school year, when they were known as the "Maroons." Students and faculty began lobbying for a new mascot during the late 1940s. On March 19, 1951, the student body voted to change the official nickname to the Salukis. The [[saluki]], the royal dog of ancient Egypt, was chosen as the mascot due to its reputation as a fast and tenacious hunter and because the southern Illinois region is known as "[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |title=Southern Illinois Official Athletic Site – Athletics |publisher=Siusalukis.cstv.com |date=March 19, 1951 |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212123/http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salukis sponsor 16 varsity teams. Most compete in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] (MVC), specifically in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, softball, women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track and field, and volleyball. The football program competes in the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]] (MVFC). Men's swimming is part of the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC).

=== Athletic highlights ===

=== Cardboard Boat Regatta ===
[[File:Siucampus lake.JPG|thumb|Sunset over Southern Illinois University's Campus Lake.]]
The Cardboard Boat Regatta is an event held every spring semester at Campus Lake. Participants include university students and community members both young and old. The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats. There are three different categories for entries: canoes or kayaks, experimental boats and instant boats (boats created on-site the day of the event).

The idea for a Cardboard Regatta first originated in 1974 at Southern Illinois University. Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, dreamed up a final examination for students in his freshman design class. [[Buckminster Fuller]], then a Distinguished Professor at SIU, had espoused the principle of "doing the most with the least," and faculty members found it intriguing to apply these principles in their classes. Archer felt it would be a real test of students' creativity and three-dimensional design skills to build human-sized boats made only of cardboard, and more than 40 years later, it is still happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|title=The Great Cardboard Boat Regatta FAQs|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160211185621/http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|archivedate=2016-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many communities, organizations and other universities around the country have joined in on the fun and now organize their own Cardboard Boat Regattas.

&lt;/score&gt;|width=120|caption=Three notes with staccato dots}}'''Staccato''' ({{IPA-it|stakˈkaːto|}}; Italian for "detached") is a form of [[Articulation (music)|musical articulation]]. In modern notation, it signifies a note of shortened duration,&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1960), p. 708.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kennedy, ed., {{Full|date=June 2015}}&lt;!--The page citation is nice, but it is customary to cite dictionary entries by title.--&gt;''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'', third edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1980), p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt; separated from the note that may follow by silence.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chew, "Staccato", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described by theorists and has appeared in music since at least 1676.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Bachmann, Robert E. Seletsky, [[David D. Boyden]], Jaak Liivoja-Lorius, Peter Walls, and Peter Cooke, "Bow", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 20th-century music, a dot placed above or below a note indicates that it should be played staccato, and a wedge is used for the more emphatic [[staccatissimo]]. However, before 1850, dots, dashes, and wedges were all likely to have the same meaning, even though some theorists from as early as the 1750s distinguished different degrees of staccato through the use of dots and dashes, with the dash indicating a shorter, sharper note, and the dot a longer, lighter one.  

A number of signs came to be used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to discriminate more subtle nuances of staccato. These signs involve various combinations of dots, vertical and horizontal dashes, vertical and horizontal wedges, and the like, but attempts to standardize these signs have not generally been successful.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chew, "Staccato", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The example below illustrates the scope of the staccato dot:

:&lt;score&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    &lt;&lt; \clef treble
        \relative c' {
            \stemNeutral &lt;e c'&gt;-. &lt;g d'&gt;-. &lt;g e'&gt;-. &lt;c, c'&gt;-.
            \stemUp a'-. c-. c-. d-.
        } \\ {
            s1
            f'4 f' g' g'
        }
    &gt;&gt;

}
&lt;/score&gt;

In the first measure, the pairs of notes are in the same musical [[Part (music)|part]] (or voice) since they are on a common stem. The staccato applies to both notes of the pairs. In the second measure, the pairs of notes are stemmed separately indicating two different parts, so the staccato applies only to the upper note.

The opposite musical articulation of staccato is [[legato]], signifying long and continuous notes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kennedy and Joyce Bourne, "Staccato", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music''{{Full|date=June 2015}}&lt;!--Third edition 1980 cited elsewhere in this article; is this the fourth, fifth, or some other edition?--&gt; (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; There is an intermediate articulation called either [[mezzo staccato]] or [[non legato]]. 

By default, in the music notation program [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]], "staccatos shorten a note by 50%."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Spreadbury, Michael Eastwood, Ben Finn, and Jonathan Finn, "Sibelius 5 Reference", edition 5.2 (March 2008), p.&amp;nbsp;284.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staccatissimo ==
In [[musical notation]], '''staccatissimo''' (plural: ''staccatissimi'' or the [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] form ''staccatissimos'') indicates that the notes are to be played extremely separated and distinct, a superlative staccato. This can be notated with little pikes over or under the notes, depending on [[Stem (music)|stem]] direction, as in this example from [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 0 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 0 in D minor]]:

: &lt;score&gt;
\new Score {
  \new Staff {
    \relative c' {
      \time 3/4
      \key d \minor
      \clef treble
      d8-&gt;(\ff cis d2~
      d4) a'-! d-!
      es-! e-! f-!
      fis-! g-! gis-!
      a8(-&gt; gis a4)
    }
  }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Alternatively, it can be notated by writing the word "staccatissimo" or the abbreviation "staccatiss." over the staff. A few composers, such as Mozart, have used staccato dots accompanied by a written instruction ''staccatissimo'' when they mean the passage to be played ''staccatissimo''.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Farkas, ''The Art of French Horn Playing'' (Evanston: Summy-Birchard Company, 1956): p.&amp;nbsp;51. {{ISBN|978-0-87487-021-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The '''Stationers’ Register''' was a record book maintained by the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]] of London.  The company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry, including  printers, bookbinders, booksellers, and publishers in [[England]].  The Register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work, and constituted an early form of [[copyright]] law.  The Company's charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books.

For the study of English literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries&amp;mdash;for the [[Elizabethan era]], the [[Jacobean era]], the [[Caroline era]], and especially for [[English Renaissance theatre]]&amp;mdash;the Stationers' Register is a crucial and essential resource: it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else. Together with the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] (which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication), the Stationers' Register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and all of their immediate predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Elizabethan Stage,'' Vol. 3, pp. 164-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

By paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence, a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work.  One example: the Stationers' Register reveals that on 26 November 1607, the stationers John Busby and [[Nathaniel Butter]] claimed the right to print "A booke called Master William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear, as yt was played before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall vppon Sainct Stephens night at Christmas Last, by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the Globe on the Banksyde." (They paid sixpence.)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion,'' pp. 265 and 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world; books were sometimes published without registration, and other irregularities also occurred. In some cases, the [[playing company|companies of actors]] appear to have registered plays through co-operative stationers, with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Much Ado About Nothing]],'' ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]],'' ''[[As You Like It]],'' and ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' were registered, apparently for such a purpose ("to be stayed"), on 4 August 1600. Yet if this interpretation is correct, the strategy to forestall publication had limited success; the first two plays were published later in 1600, and the last in 1601. Only ''As You Like It'' remained out of print at the time. Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 359; Halliday, pp. 216, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1710, the Copyright Act or [[Statute of Anne]] entered into force, superseding company provisions pertaining to the Register.  The company continued to offer some form of registration of works until February 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5528">The metaphor of a '''trading zone''' is being applied to collaborations in [[science]] and [[technology]].  The basis of the metaphor is anthropological studies of how different cultures are able to exchange goods, despite differences in language and culture.  

==Overview==
[[Peter Galison]] produced the "trading zone" metaphor in order to explain how physicists from different paradigms went about collaborating with each other and with engineers to develop [[particle detector]]s and [[radar]].

According to Galison, "Two groups can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly different significance to the objects being exchanged; they may even disagree on the meaning of the exchange process itself.  Nonetheless, the trading partners can hammer out a local coordination, despite vast global differences.  In an even more sophisticated way, cultures in interaction frequently establish contact languages, systems of discourse that can vary from the most function-specific jargons, through semispecific pidgins, to full-fledged creoles rich enough to support activities as complex as poetry and metalinguistic reflection" (Galison 1997, p. 783)

In the case of radar, for example, the physicists and engineers had to gradually develop what was effectively a [[pidgin]] or [[creole language]] involving shared concepts like ‘equivalent circuits’ that the physicists represented symbolically in terms of field theory and the engineers saw as extensions of their radio toolkit. 

Exchanges across disciplinary boundaries can also be carried out with the help of an agent: a person who is familiar enough with the language of two or more cultures to facilitate trade.

At one point in the development of [[MRI]], surgeons saw a lesion where an engineer familiar with the device would have recognized an artifact produced by the way the device was being used.  It took someone with expertise in both physics and surgery to see how each of the different disciplines viewed the device, and develop procedures for correcting the problem (Baird &amp; Cohen, 1999).  The ability to converse expertly in more than one discipline is called [[interactional expertise]] ([[Harry Collins|Collins]] &amp; Evans, 2002).

==Areas of Application==
*The U.S. [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]] calls for a “broadly inclusive interdisciplinary dialogue on nanotechnology” that would incorporate a wide range of stakeholders (http://www.nano.gov/html/society/Responsible_Development.htm).  This kind of a dialogue will require developing [[creole language|creoles]] that allow  different stakeholders to communicate, and also [[interactional expertise]] (Gorman, Groves, &amp; Catalano, 2004). 
*The [[Converging technologies|convergence]] between nano, bio, information and cognitive technologies will set an even greater premium on the development of trading zones and [[interactional expertise]] (Gorman, 2004).
*[[Computer science]] education requires development of trading zones between experts  in the social and learning sciences and computer scientists (Fincher &amp; Petre, 2004).  Each of these communities uses different methods and speaks a different language, hence the need for a creole and also for [[interactional expertise|interactional experts]].
*Managing [[Natural environment|environmental systems]] like the [[Everglades]] also requires the development of  trading zones (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bwfuller/Trading_Zone_Paper--Boyd_Fuller--Distribution--Jan_1-05.pdf). Brad Allenby suggests the development of a new kind of expertise in [[Earth Systems Engineering and Management]], which will include an interactional component (Allenby, 2005).

A workshop at Arizona State University on Trading Zones, [[Interactional expertise|Interactional Expertise]] and [[Interdisciplinary Collaboration]] raised the possibility of applying these concepts to other applications like global health and service science, and also identified avenues for future research (https://archive.is/20121215123346/http://bart.tcc.virginia.edu/Tradzoneworkshop/index.htm).

[[Image:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]

'''Transportation engineering''' or '''transport engineering''' is the application of technology and [[scientific principle]]s to the planning, functional design, operation and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for the safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods ([[transport]]) {{citation needed|reason=What is the source of this very specific definition|date=February 2016}}.  It is a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]].&lt;ref name="Institute of Transportation Engineering"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ite.org/career/index.asp|title=ITE – The Transportation Profession|work=ITE|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of transportation engineering within the civil engineering profession can be judged by the number of divisions in [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] (American Society of Civil Engineers) that are directly related to transportation. There are six such divisions (Aerospace; Air Transportation; Highway; Pipeline; Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean; and Urban Transportation) representing one-third of the total 18 technical divisions within the ASCE (1987).&lt;ref name="American Society of Civil Engineers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asce.org/ProgramProductLine.aspx?id=2147485055|title=ASCE – About Civil Engineering|work=ASCE|accessdate=2010-06-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702022026/http://www.asce.org/ProgramProductLine.aspx?id=2147485055|archivedate=2 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planning aspects of transportation engineering relate to elements of [[urban planning]], and involve technical forecasting decisions and political factors.  Technical forecasting of passenger travel usually involves an urban transportation planning model, requiring the estimation of [[trip generation]] (how many trips for what purpose), [[trip distribution]] (destination choice, where is the traveler going), [[mode choice]] (what [[mode of transport|mode]] is being taken), and [[route assignment]] (which streets or routes are being used).  More sophisticated forecasting can include other aspects of traveler decisions, including auto ownership, trip chaining (the decision to link individual trips together in a tour) and the choice of residential or business location (known as [[land use forecasting]]). Passenger trips are the focus of transportation engineering because they often represent the peak of demand on any transportation system.

A review of descriptions of the scope of various committees indicates that while facility planning and design continue to be the core of the transportation engineering field, such areas as operations planning, logistics, network analysis, financing, and policy analysis are also important to civil engineers, particularly to those working in highway and urban transportation. The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) list online the safety protocols, geometric design requirements, and signal timing.

Transportation engineering, as practiced by civil engineers, primarily involves planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of transportation facilities. The facilities support air, highway, railroad, pipeline, water, and even space transportation.&lt;ref name="Institute of Transportation Engineering"/&gt; The design aspects of transportation engineering include the sizing of transportation facilities (how many lanes or how much capacity the facility has), determining the materials and thickness used in [[Pavement (roads)|pavement]] designing the geometry (vertical and horizontal alignment) of the roadway (or track).

Before any planning occurs the Engineer must take what is known as an inventory of the area or if it is appropriate, the previous system in place. This inventory or database must include information on (1)population, (2)land use, (3)economic activity, (4)transportation facilities and services, (5)travel patterns and volumes, (6)laws and ordinances, (7)regional financial resources, (8)community values and expectations. These inventories help the engineer create business models to complete accurate forecasts of the future conditions of the system[[Review]].

Operations and management involve [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], so that vehicles move smoothly on the road or track.  Older techniques include [[Traffic sign|sign]]s, [[Traffic light|signals]], [[Road surface marking|marking]]s, and [[Toll road|toll]]ing.  Newer technologies involve [[intelligent transportation systems]], including advanced traveler information systems (such as [[variable message signs]]), advanced traffic control systems (such as [[ramp meter]]s), and [[vehicle infrastructure integration]]. [[Human factors]] are an aspect of transportation engineering, particularly concerning driver-vehicle interface and user interface of road signs, signals, and markings.

==Highway engineering==
{{Main article|Highway engineering}}
Engineers in this specialization:
*Handle the planning, design, construction, and operation of highways, roads, and other vehicular facilities as well as their related bicycle and pedestrian realms.
*Estimate the transportation needs of the public and then secure the funding for the project.
*Analyze locations of high traffic volumes and high collisions for safety and capacity.
*Use [[civil engineering]] principles to improve the transportation system.
*Utilizes the three design controls which are the drivers, the vehicles, and the roadways themselves.

==Railroad engineering==
{{main article|Railway systems engineering}}
Railway engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of railroads and mass transit systems that use a fixed guideway (such as [[light rail]] or even [[monorails]]).  Typical tasks would include determining horizontal and vertical alignment design, station location and design, and construction cost estimating.  Railroad engineers can also move into the specialized field of train dispatching which focuses on train movement control.

Railway engineers also work to build a cleaner and safer transportation network by reinvesting and revitalizing the rail system to meet future demands.  In the United States, railway engineers work with elected officials in Washington, D.C. on rail transportation issues to make sure that the rail system meets the country's transportation needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.org/AAR/About-Us.aspx|title=Association of American Railroads|work=AAR|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Port and harbor engineering==
{{Distinguish|Naval architecture|marine engineering}}
{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}
Port and harbor engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of ports, harbors, canals, and other maritime facilities.

==Airport engineering==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Airport engineers design and construct airports.  Airport engineers must account for the impacts and demands of aircraft in their design of airport facilities. These engineers must use the analysis of predominant wind direction to determine runway orientation, determine the size of runway border and safety areas, different wing tip to wing tip clearances for all gates and must designate the clear zones in the entire port.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21986">University '''technology transfer offices''' ('''TTOs'''), or '''Technology Licensing Offices''' ('''TLOs'''),  are responsible for [[technology transfer]] and other aspects of the commercialization of research that takes place in a university. TTOs engage in a variety of commercial activities that are meant to facilitate the process of bringing research developments to market, often acting as a channel between academia and industry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothaermel|first=F.

While TTOs are commonplace, many studies have questioned their financial benefit to the university.

== History ==
The history of technology transfer is intimately linked with the history of the [[science policy of the United States]].  The foundation for modern American science policy laid way out in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s letter in response to President Roosevelt's query about whether the US should maintain the high level of research funding it had been pouring into the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], which had coordinated large [[private-public partnership]] research projects as part of the war effort, including the [[Manhattan Project]].  Bush's answer was ''Science - the Endless Frontier''.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehlers|first=Vernon|title=The Future of U.S. Science Policy|journal=Science|date=16 January 1998|volume=279|pages=302a–302|doi=10.1126/science.279.5349.302a|issue=5349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frontier&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Vannevar|title=Science the Endless Frontier|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|publisher=National Science Foundation|date=July 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that letter, Bush advocated that the US should continue to fund [[basic research]] at high levels, arguing that while the US no longer had a geographic frontier, extending the boundaries of science would allow the creation of new technologies, which in turn would spur new industries, create jobs, generate wealth, and maintain US power.&lt;ref name=Frontier/&gt;  As the US worked out its approach to funding science in the 1950s, Congress decided that the federal government should maintain ownership of patents on inventions funded by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Federal research funding drove the growth of the research university.  Many universities in the early 20th century did not engage in patenting and licensing, since the government owned most inventions, and out of fear of interfering with their missions of supporting the growth of knowledge and objective inquiry.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sampat|first=Bhaven N.|date=2006-07-01|title=Patenting and US academic research in the 20th century: The world before and after Bayh-Dole|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=Property and the pursuit of knowledge: IPR issues affecting scientific research|volume=35|issue=6|pages=772–789|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2006.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Maryann|last2=Desrochers|first2=Pierre|date=2003-03-01|title=Research Universities and Local Economic Development: Lessons from the History of the Johns Hopkins University|journal=Industry and Innovation|volume=10|issue=1|pages=5–24|doi=10.1080/1366271032000068078|issn=1366-2716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the postwar period, universities relied mostly on external patent management organizations such as the [[Research Corporation]], while few set up their own research foundations that were independent from but affiliated to the university.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   Some universities, such as [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of Wisconsin]], had active licensing programs of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C|last2=Nelson|first2=Richard R|last3=Sampat|first3=Bhaven N|last4=Ziedonis|first4=Arvids A|date=2001-01-01|title=The growth of patenting and licensing by U.S. universities: an assessment of the effects of the Bayh–Dole act of 1980|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=30|issue=1|pages=99–119|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00100-6|citeseerx=10.1.1.334.3228}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There was a shift in universities' approaches to technology transfer between 1970-1980.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this period, universities began taking commercialization efforts into their own hands and setting up TTOs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Bayh–Dole Act]] of 1980 led many US universities to set up tech transfer offices.  The Act was created to try to spur the stagnant US economy of the 1970s, harking back to Vannevar Bush's vision of the role of federal research funding in the US economy.  The Act decentralized ownership of inventions funded with federal grants, allowing universities that received federal grant funding to maintain ownership of such inventions, obligating them to try to patent and license the inventions to US companies, and requiring universities to share license income with inventors.&lt;ref name=Mowery&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C.|last2=Sampat|first2=Bhaven N.|date=2004-12-01|title=The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 and University–Industry Technology Transfer: A Model for Other OECD Governments?|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|language=en|volume=30|issue=1–2|pages=115–127|doi=10.1007/s10961-004-4361-z|issn=0892-9912|citeseerx=10.1.1.1025.6800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapin/files/shapin_lrbivorytrade.pdf|title=Ivory Trade|last=Shapin|first=Steven|date=11 September 2003|website=Harvard.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
While the broad goal of TTOs is to commercialize university research, they engage in numerous activities that not only bring these developments to market but also encourage and support faculty and students in the entire technology transfer process. Such encouragement may increase the chances of faculty and students creating research developments that can be commercialized. Some of the major functions of TTOs include:

=== Industry partnerships ===
An important task of many TTOs is to create and maintain industry partnerships that may be crucial for collaboration and bringing technologies to market.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etzkowitz|first=Henry|date=1998-12-01|title=The norms of entrepreneurial science: cognitive effects of the new university–industry linkages|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=27|issue=8|pages=823–833|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(98)00093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities such as MIT and Northwestern have separate offices for industry and corporate relations which typically work in conjunction with the TTO of the institution. In this case, TTOs often exploit the relationships developed by the corporate relations office, focusing more specifically on the technology transfer process itself. TTOs often employ two methods when engaging with industry partners: 1) the "pull" method, in which TTOs ''receive'' interest from industry partners in bringing specific technologies at the university to market, and 2) the "push" method, in which TTOs actively ''seek'' industry partners for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4438&amp;context=flr|title=Interface: The Push and Pull of Patents|last=Lee|first=Peter|date=2009|website=Fordham Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual property ===
The Bayh-Dole Act obligated universities to seek [[patent]] protection, when appropriate, for inventions to which they elect title; after passage of the Bayh-Dole Act many US universities created intellectual property policies that obligated faculty to assign inventions to the university.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt; Universities typically [[License#Patent licensing|license]] the patent to a company that will invest money in developing the invention into a product, which it will then be able to sell at a premium, recouping its investment and making profit before the patent expires.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Donald S|last2=Waldman|first2=David|last3=Link|first3=Albert|date=2003-01-01|title=Assessing the impact of organizational practices on the relative productivity of university technology transfer offices: an exploratory study|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=27–48|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counseling and incubation for startups ===

TTOs at many universities often provide general business and legal counseling to foster entrepreneurship among faculty and students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Shea|first=Rory P.|last2=Allen|first2=Thomas J.|last3=Chevalier|first3=Arnaud|last4=Roche|first4=Frank|date=2005-09-01|title=Entrepreneurial orientation, technology transfer and spinoff performance of U.S. universities|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=The Creation of Spin-off Firms at Public Research Institutions: Managerial and Policy Implcations|volume=34|issue=7|pages=994–1009|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2005.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing resources, funding, and connections to [[University spin-off|university spin-off companies]], TTOs attempt to increase the chances of [[startup company|startup]] success, which may result in financial gain if the university owns the intellectual property of the invention or has an equity stake in the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, many TTOs establish [[business incubator]]s and programs for faculty and students in an attempt to enhance the entrepreneurial atmosphere among researchers at the university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Rhonda G.|date=2002-08-01|title=Technology business incubators: how effective as technology transfer mechanisms?|url=|journal=Technology in Society|volume=24|issue=3|pages=299–316|doi=10.1016/S0160-791X(02)00010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of such incubators and programs include the [[Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator]] as well as the [[Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator]] at [[Harvard University]], and [[Fab Lab MSI]], affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. Research has suggested that incubators at TTOs have not had a high incidence of technology transfer, despite this being one of the reasons they were established, and may even negatively impact the success of TTOs and technology transfer at the university.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolympiris|first=Christos|last2=Klein|first2=Peter G.|date=2017-06-01|title=The Effects of Academic Incubators on University Innovation|journal=Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=145–170|doi=10.1002/sej.1242|issn=1932-443X|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/106979/1/WRAP-effects-academic-incubators-university-innovation-Kolympiris-2017.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and organization ==
The structure and organization of TTOs can affect its overall performance and can vary among universities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brescia|first=F.|last2=Colombo|first2=G.|last3=Landoni|first3=P.|title=Organizational structures of Knowledge Transfer Offices: an analysis of the world's top-ranked universities|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|volume=41|issue=1|pages=132–151|doi=10.1007/s10961-014-9384-5|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since TTOs deal with both academic research and industry, they consist of a diverse set of individuals, including scientists, lawyers, analysts, licensing experts, and business managers. By having individuals (particularly different scientists, engineers, and analysts) with varying sets of expertise in research, TTOs attempt to more effectively assess, protect, and profit from the research developments taking place in  multiple disciplines throughout the university.

TTOs can by classified into three different types:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* ''internal:'' existing as an integrated part of the university and controlled by university administration
* ''external:'' existing as an independent company that does not operate under the control of university administration
* ''mixed:'' having components of both internal and external TTOs 
As of 2012 the "internal" type was most common in the US.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Strategies ==
TTOs attempt to capitalize on the research developments made at the university by employing strategies focused on providing the university with opportunities for financial gain and increased research impact. A common strategy that TTOs engage in is licensing their inventions, either to an industry partner or back to the university inventor if the inventor started a company (i.e. a university spin-off).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macho-Stadler|first=Inés|last2=Pérez-Castrillo|first2=David|last3=Veugelers|first3=Reinhilde|date=2007-06-01|title=Licensing of university inventions: The role of a technology transfer office|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=25|issue=3|pages=483–510|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2006.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this approach, TTOs can bring university technologies to market without having to engage in production and distribution themselves. TTOs can also take an equity stake in the spin-off company rather than licensing the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lockett|first=Andy|last2=Wright|first2=Mike|last3=Franklin|first3=Stephen|title=Technology Transfer and Universities' Spin-Out Strategies|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=185–200|doi=10.1023/a:1022220216972|via=|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has suggested that equity in spin-off companies may provide higher returns than licensing,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=Michael J|last2=Lee|first2=James N|date=2000-09-01|title=University revenues from technology transfer: Licensing fees vs. equity positions|url=|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=15|issue=5|pages=385–392|doi=10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this strategy seems to be more common with TTOs that are financially independent from the parent university (i.e. external TTO structure).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While these strategies vary greatly among TTOs at different universities, a majority of them employ some combination of licensing and equity stakes, with licensing being a more standard practice.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== International diffusion &amp; TTOs outside the US ==
As many major research universities across the US began to adopt TTOs, institutions outside the US became attracted to the idea of taking control of their commercialization activities as well. Prior to the 2000s, many German-speaking and Scandinavian countries had a policy of "professor's privilege", in which faculty retain the right to control the intellectual property of their inventions. In addition, in recent years many [[OECD]] and [[European Union|EU]] nations have created legislation that emulates Bayh-Dole, in an attempt to increase the commercialization activities and impact of their respective research universities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geuna|first=Aldo|last2=Rossi|first2=Federica|date=2011-10-01|title=Changes to university IPR regulations in Europe and the impact on academic patenting|url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/3753/1/3753.pdf|journal=Research Policy|series=Special Issue: 30 Years After Bayh-Dole: Reassessing Academic Entrepreneurship|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1068–1076|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2011.05.008|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/industry-and-services/benchmarking-industry-science-relationships_9789264175105-en|title=Benchmarking Industry-Science Relationships|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark was among the first to abolish professor's privilege, followed by Germany, Austria, Norway and Finland between 2000-2007.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Countries such as  France and the UK, which already had policies in place that grant intellectual property rights to universities during this period, began heavily encouraging and enforcing these institutional ownership rights.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As of 2011, most European countries grant universities the rights to the intellectual property of inventions developed by faculty researchers, yet a few countries such as Italy and Sweden still employ professor's privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnstrand Damsgaard|first=E.|last2=Thursby|first2=M. C.|date=2013-02-01|title=University entrepreneurship and professor privilege|url=https://academic.oup.com/icc/article/22/1/183/882569/University-entrepreneurship-and-professor|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=183–218|doi=10.1093/icc/dts047|issn=0960-6491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, there has been a marked increase in the commercialization activities of universities and creation of TTOs in Europe.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Several Asian countries such as Japan, China, and India have also shifted towards a Bayh-Dole type legislation, although some countries such as Malaysia have a shared ownership model.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen|first=Tina|date=2010|title=Asian Initiatives on Bayh-Dole, with Special Reference to India: How Do We Make It More "Asian?"|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&amp;context=ckjip|journal=Chicago-Kent Journal of Intellectual Property|volume=10|pages=44–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mok|first=Ka Ho|title=The quest for an entrepreneurial university in East Asia: impact on academics and administrators in higher education|url=|journal=Asia Pacific Education Review|volume=14|issue=1|pages=11–22|doi=10.1007/s12564-013-9249-x|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there has been a general shift towards increased commercialization and the establishment of TTOs across higher education institutions in Asian countries. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Although universities created TTOs with hopes of financial gain, many TTOs have retained losses in their commercialization activities and have not generated significant local economic development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trune|first=Dennis R|last2=Goslin|first2=Lewis N|date=1998-03-01|title=University Technology Transfer Programs: A Profit/Loss Analysis|url=|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=57|issue=3|pages=197–204|doi=10.1016/S0040-1625(97)00165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It has been argued that protecting intellectual property and patenting is a costly process, and of all the patents and licenses a university issues, there may be a limited number of inventions that actually yield enough revenue to cover or surpass these costs. Research has shown that larger, more established TTOs are sufficiently profitable, whereas many smaller, more recent TTOs are not, and that an estimated half of TTOs retain losses in their commercialization activities (of those that do not have losses, a majority do no better than to cover their costs).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Even the most profitable TTOs only produce revenue that amounts to 1-3% of the total research expenditures at the university.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, less than 1% of licensed technologies actually yield over $1M in revenue.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another criticism of TTOs is its role in the research atmosphere of the university, with many scholars arguing that its presence and purpose of engaging in commercialization activities conflicts with a university's mission of furthering knowledge and objective academic inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischut|first=Peter M.|last2=Haas|first2=Scott|date=2005|title=University Technology Transfer Offices: A Status Report|journal=Biotechnology Healthcare|volume=2|issue=2|pages=48–53|issn=1554-169X|pmc=3564362|pmid=23393451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebecca Eisenberg and [[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] have argued that the Bayh-Dole Act spurred university tech transfer offices to become too aggressive in patenting, creating [[patent thicket]]s and a [[tragedy of the anticommons]] especially in the field of [[biomedical research]].&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heller |first=M. A. |last2=Eisenberg |first2=R. |title=Can Patents Deter Innovation?

He has introduced anthropological insights and themes to the history of medicine and science; developed innovative frameworks for the analysis of science and globalisation; and conducted historical research into the material cultures of scientific exchange. His influential formulation of the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]] of science and medicine has generated a new style of inquiry within [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Seth S. Putting knowledge in its place: science, colonialism, and the postcolonial, ''Postcolonial Studies'' Special Issue: Science, Colonialism, Postcolonialism 12(4): 373–83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==

Anderson was born and educated in [[Melbourne]], Australia, where he attended the [[University High School, Melbourne|University High School]]. His father, Hugh McDonald Anderson (1927-2017), was a leading [[folklorist]] and historian of Australian popular and literary culture, with more than forty books to his credit; his mother, Dawn Anderson, has written books on drama education and creativity.

He graduated from the University of Melbourne Medical School (M.B., B.S. [equivalent to the US M.D.]) in 1983. During the medical course he conducted neurophysiology research, supervised by Ian Darian-Smith, which earned him the B.Med.Sc. (1980). He was an intern at the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]], and had paediatric training at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford. In the 1986 season he was the assistant doctor for the [[Footscray Football Club]] (now the AFL Bulldogs). From 1987, he worked in general practice in the inner west of Melbourne, which he continued intermittently until 1999. 
 
Anderson ("Dr. Androgen") was a co-presenter on the award-winning radio program "Spoonful of Medicine" ([[3RRR]]) from 1987–88.

== Poetry ==

As a medical student, Anderson began writing and publishing poetry. More than forty poems have appeared in a range of leading journals in Australia and the US. His poetry collection, ''Hard Cases, Brief Lives'' (Adelaide: Ginninderra, 2011) was short-listed in 2012 for the Mary Gilmore Award of the Association for the Study of Australian Literature (ASAL).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson W. Hard Cases, Brief Lives [Poetry]. Adelaide: Ginninderra Press; 2011.; [http://www.australianpoetry.org/2012/02/16/mary-gilmore-award-shortlist-announced/ "Mary Gilmore Award Shortlist Announced"] ''Australian Poetry''. Retrieved 13 November 2–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of medicine and science ==

Anderson completed a PhD in the Department of the History and Sociology of Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1992. His dissertation was on US colonial medicine and public health in the [[Philippines]], and his advisor was [[Charles E. Rosenberg]]. Before moving to Sydney, Anderson held appointments at [[Harvard University]] (1992–95); the University of Melbourne (1995–2000); [[UCSF]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] (2000–2003); and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] (2003–08). At Melbourne, he founded the Centre for Health and Society (1997)&lt;ref&gt;[http://chs.unimelb.edu.au/ "Melbourne School of Population and Global Health: Centre for Health and Society"], "University of Melbourne". Retrieved 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to establish the Onemda VicHealth Koori Health Unit (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onemda.unimelb.edu.au/ "Onemda VicHealth Koori Health Unit"], "University of Melbourne". Retrieved 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At Madison, he was chair of the Department of Medical History and Bioethics.

He was the founding editor of ''Health and History'' (1998), and served as associate editor for the ''East Asian STS Journal'' and ''Postcolonial Studies''. He served on the councils of the American Association of the History of Medicine (AAHM), the Australian and New Zealand Society for the History of Medicine, the Australian Society of Health, Law and Ethics, History of Medicine in Southeast Asia (HOMSEA), the Institute of Postcolonial Studies (Melbourne), and the Pacific Circle.

Anderson was awarded a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Foundation]] (2007–08), and he was a Frederick Burkhardt Fellow of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (2005–06), which he held at the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton]]. In 2013 he was a Whitney J. Oates Fellow at the Humanities Council, Princeton University and a John Hope Franklin Fellow at Duke University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56774">In the early 1960s, an interest in women and their connection with the environment was sparked, largely by a book written by [[Esther Boserup]] entitled ''Woman's Role in Economic Development''.&lt;ref name=Tiondi&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Tiondi, T.|year=2001|title= Women, environment and development: Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America|type=Theses and Dissertations|id=Paper 1549|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1980s, policy makers and governments became more mindful of the connection between the environment and gender issues.&lt;ref name=GDRC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Development Research Center|url=http://www.gdrc.org/|accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes began to be made regarding natural resource and environmental management with the specific role of women in mind.  According to the World Bank in 1991, "Women play an essential role in the management of natural resources, including soil, water, forests and energy...and often have a profound traditional and contemporary knowledge of the natural world around them".&lt;ref name=WorldBanK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/gender/gender-envi.html|title=Gender and the Environment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas women were previously neglected or ignored, there was increasing attention paid to the impact of women on the natural environment and, in return, the effects the environment has on the health and well-being of women. The gender-environment relations have valuable ramifications in regard to the understanding of nature between men and women, the management and distribution of resources and responsibilities and the day-to-day life and well being of people.&lt;ref name=Env&amp;Planning&gt;Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 2011, volume 29, pages 237-253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's connection with the environment==

===Women, environment and development (WED) debate===

Different discourses have shaped the way that sustainable development is approached, and as time goes on women have become more integrated in shaping these ideas. The definition of sustainable development is highly debated itself, but is defined by Harcourt as a way to "establish equity between generations" and to take into account "social, economic, and environmental needs to conserve non-renewable resources" and decrease the amount of waste produced by industrialization.&lt;ref name=harcourt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harcourt|first1=Wendy|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sustainable Development.|date=1994|publisher=International Society for Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first discourse that emerged in relation to women was Women in Development (WID), the perspective that advocated for women's status to be improved in developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if all people mattered|last=Beneria|first=Lourdes|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0415537490|location=New York|pages=1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then transformed into Women, Environment, and Development (WED). Critiques for WID included its place in a larger western mindset, perpetuating a colonial and liberal discourse that was not compatible with supporting the global population of women. WID placed women as central actors in household, rural and market economies and looked to the hierarchical institution of western development to fix the issues that arise because of this.&lt;ref name=harcourt /&gt;

The next shift in discourse took place in the early 1970s, where people began to critique the roots of development and start to look at alternative ways to go about interacting with the global community and developing countries, with women and the environment as central actors. This was defined as Women, Environment, Development (WED).&lt;ref name=braid&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title=Women, the Environment, and Sustainable Development|date=1994|publisher=Zed Books in association with INSTRAW}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schultz et al., "The women, environment and development debate (WED-debate) is anchored in a critical view of development policies where the link between modernization/industrialization and technology on the one hand and environmental deterioration on the other is focused".&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz et al.|first1=Irmgard|title=Research on Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development|journal=Institut für sozial-ökologische|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; WED discourse is centralized around the synthesis of different ideologies, one of which being ecofeminism.&lt;ref name=leach&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leach|first1=Melissa|title=. Earth Mother Myths and Other Ecofeminist Fables: How a Strategic Notion Rose and Fell.|journal=Development and Change|date=January 31, 2007|volume=38|issue=1|page=67-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecofeminism may be seen as a root ideology for WED, whereas women are viewed with a biological connection to nature that enables them to have a deeper connection and stewardship of it. This ideology was transformed into the political sphere where it took a new shape as women having a socially constructed connection to nature through our global systems.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

Programs started in the 1990s based on the WED discourse and were instituted by the United Nations International Research Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW). These programs were in response to the relation between gender and environmental violences such as waste disposal, pesticide use nuclear testing and other detrimental environmental practices.&lt;ref name=braid /&gt;

The outcome of many of these programs did not produce the desired impacts on women.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt; The WED discourse placed emphasis on women as solution holders to environmental issues but policies were not directed at empowering women, rather the sectors that women are involved in, such as agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=February 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leach argues that the overall impact of politicizing the role of women and the environment through the WED discourse appropriated women's labor without providing proper resources or capacity to succeed.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

=== Farming and agriculture ===
{{See also|Feminization of agriculture}}

In a majority of the world, women are responsible for farm work and related domestic food production.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|date=Spring 1992|title=The gender and environment debate: lessons from India|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=18|issue=1|jstor=3178217|doi=10.2307/3178217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764296_The_Gender_and_Environment_Debate_Lessons_from_India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Disinherited peasants, disadvantaged workers: a gender perspective on land and livelihood|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=33|number=13 (Mar. 26 – Apr. 3, 1998)|pp=A2–A1|jstor=4406578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jiggins&gt;{{cite book|author=Jiggins, J. |year=2004|title=Changing the boundaries: Women-centered perspectives on population &amp; the environment|location= Covelo, Ca|publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel&gt;{{cite book|author=Lastarria-Cornhiel, S.|year=2006|title=Feminization of Agriculture: Trends and Driving Forces|location=Santiago|publisher= RIMISP}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of women are taking over and expanding their involvement in [[agricultural]] tasks but this has not changed the gender division of labor with regard to reproductive work.&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel /&gt;  Esther Boserup looked into the farming systems of men and women in [[Africa]] and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Boserup&gt;Boserup, E. (1970). Woman's Role in Economic Development.  Male and female farming systems  (15-65).&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz ''et al.'' (2001), found that "90% of women in the developing world, where most of the planet's biological wealth is found, depend on their land for survival. Women head 30% of the households in developing countries, 80% of food production in sub-Saharan Africa is done by women, 60% in [[Asia]] and 50% in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Even though women are largely responsible for the actual agricultural work performed, men, generally own the land, therefore controlling women's labor upon the land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; 

====Africa====
Esther Boserup examined the farming systems of men and women in Africa and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; In Botswana, men typically have greater access to advanced technologies and plowing abilities.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Zambia also has a high percentage of women farmers yet they are not explicitly recognize and often neglected entirely.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Consistent lack of access to credit, mobility, technological advancements, and land ownership further complicate women's agricultural roles. A group of women in Kenya began farming trees way before climate change was prioritized because they had seen what happens to lands that are depleted of its nutrients and the adverse effects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steady|first=Filomina Chioma|date=2014|title=Women, Climate Change, and Liberation in Africa|url=http://libproxy.sdsu.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1690372156?accountid=13758|journal=Race, Gender &amp; Class|volume=21|pages=312-333|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Latin American and Caribbean====
In Peru, women often participate in food production and family farming yet they do not generally benefit directly from their labor.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Their work is not considered as valuable as men's.  Women in the Caribbean have always been associated with agriculture and do have access to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; However, women still do not have the same access to technology as men and generally have smaller plots of land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; 

The dependence on nature and the environment for survival is common among Third World women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; It has been argued by environmental feminists&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; that this dependence creates a deeply rooted connection between women and their surroundings.  The dependency women have on natural resources, based on their responsibilities, creates a specific interest that may be different from the interests of men.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Jiggins et al. suggests that the views women have on nature are unique in that they connect the land to immediate survival and concern for future generations rather than simply looking at the land as a resource with monetary value.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; With the development of newer technologies since the 1940s, there has been a shift to more non-farm activities, however, men more than women are the ones participating in the shift, leaving women behind.&lt;ref name=Boserup /&gt; It has been projected that the continuation of men shifting to urban livelihoods, more and more women will be depended on to maintain the household by farming.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;Especially during the neoliberal policy regime in Latin America, with the increasing use of exports, women were ideal for their ‘gendered skills,’ they were paid less for their farming labor and not likely to organize, coining the term ‘feminization of responsibility.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if All People Mattered|last='Beneria'; 'Berik'; 'Floro'|first='Lourdes'; 'Gunseli'; 'Maria'|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues such as climate change could have a greater impact on women because the land they farm will be negatively affected.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

====Asia and Pacific Islands====
In the Asian and Pacific Island regions, 58% of women involved in the economy are found in the agriculture sector. This involves work in own-account farms, labor in small enterprises for processing fruits, vegetables and fish, paid and unpaid work on other peoples land, and collecting forest products.&lt;ref name=ESCAP&gt;{{cite book|last1=United Nations, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|title=Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific|date=2017|publisher=United Nations ESCAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Out of all the women working in this sector, 10–20% have been found to have tenure to the land they work on.  Reasons for this number include economic and legal barriers. For example, in terms of loans women are found to get fewer and less loans to acquire land then men.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

One other factor that plays into women’s land rights for agriculture is the cultural norms of the area.  In the Asian and the Pacific women’s societal rolls have been defined by patriarchal norms of the larger global society, where men are viewed as breadwinners and women are viewed as caretakers. This can be expressed through the number of hours women spend doing unpaid care work per day. In developing countries in total, women spend 4 hours and 30 minutes of care work a day versus the 1 hour and 2 minutes that men spend.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

===Land ownership and property management===

In many parts of the world, specifically developing countries, there is a great deal of inequality when it comes to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; Traditional practices and bureaucratic factors often prevent women's access to natural resource development and management.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Frequently, women do not have the right to own land and/or property, but they often are the ones who tend to the land. [[Bina Agarwal]], has written a great deal about gender and land rights in Third World countries and according to her, "Hence, insofar as there is a gender and class-based division of labor and distribution of property and power, gender and class structure people's interactions with nature and so structure the effects of environmental change on people and their responses to it."&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Women's access to control of natural resources, land ownership and property management is a developing issue and is the subject of continuous debate in both the environmental realm and women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

===Women's property status and the likelihood of violence===
"World wide, physical violence by husbands against wives is estimated to range between 10% and 50% (p824)".&lt;ref name=P&amp;A&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Panda, P.|author2=Agarwal, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title= Marital violence, human development and women's property status in India|journal=World Development|volume=33|issue=5|pp=823–850|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to pinpoint the causes of marital violence but economic dependence is widely acknowledged as one of the main sources. Land or property ownership provides women who may be experiencing marital violence with a credible exit option.  Land ownership creates a means of production of both income and power.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry&gt;{{cite web|author=Chowdhry, P.|year=2011|title= Reduction of Violence Against Women: Property Ownership &amp; Economic Independence in Rural Haryana|publisher=UN Women|url=http://www.unwomensouthasia.org/assets/Violence-Property-Rights2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed in Kerala, India examined the effects of property status and the likelihood of violence against women.  Close to 500 women were surveyed about a number of happenings in the household such as the amount of longterm and current violence that occurred, women's ownership of the land or house, and other sociodemographic characteristics.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The violence that occurs can be physical, such as hitting or kicking or psychological, such as threats or belittlement. Long-term violence, or violence that had been occurring throughout the entirety of the marriage, was experienced by 41% of women in rural households, while 27% of urban household women reported violence in various forms. Current violence, or violence occurring within 12 months of the time of survey was experienced by 29% in a physical capacity and 49% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt;

Of all the women surveyed, 35% did not own any property and of that 35%, 49% experienced physical violence while 84% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The amount of violence was significantly lower in households where women owned land or property.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; According to this particular study, women's access to land and property ownership reduces the risk of spousal abuse by enhancing the livelihood of women as well as providing an escape route and means for survival if abuse begins.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; In many developing countries, where marital violence is prominent, barriers such as unequal laws and social and administrative bias&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; keep women from owning land and property.  A vast number of women are left out of owning immovable property (land or house) furthering their likelihood of experiencing marital violence.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry /&gt; (Chowdhry). It can also be argued that land rights greatly shape an individuals relationship with nature and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;

===Relationship between violence of nature and women===

The WED debate has examined the correlation between the degradation of the environment and the subordination of women.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; [[Carolyn Merchant]] and [[Vandana Shiva]] wrote that there is a connection between dominance of women and dominance of nature. Shiva said, "The rupture within nature and between man and nature, and its associated transformation from a life-force that sustains to an exploitable resource characterizes the Cartesian view which has displaced more ecological world-views and created a development paradigm which cripples nature and woman simultaneously".&lt;ref name=Shiva&gt;Shiva, V. (1988). Staying Alive, London: Zed.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of women's labor as well as the abuse of natural environment are connected as they are both marginalized within the economy. Both the environment and women have been viewed as exploitable resources that are significantly undervalued.&lt;ref name=Perkins /&gt; This argument supports ecofeminism in that women in developing countries rely on nature to survive, therefore, destruction of the environment results in elimination of women's method to survival.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; According to Jiggins, environmental degradation effects women the most, furthering the inequalities between men and women.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; One study showed that new developments in technology and developments in land access are denied to women, furthering their subordination and inequality.&lt;ref name=Nightingale&gt;}{{cite journal|author1=Nightingale, A.|year=2006|title=The nature of gender: work, gender, and environment|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=24|issue=2|pp= 165–185|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/rgroves/nightingalepub1.pdf|doi=10.1068/d01k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Ecofeminism===
[[Ecofeminism]] says that women are closer to nature than men are. This closeness, therefore, makes women more nurturing and caring towards their environment.  Ecofeminism encompasses a variety of views but has a focus of patriarchal oppression and the social constructions relating to women and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Some indicate the biology of women as the reason behind the closeness, while others credit culture and historical factors.&lt;ref name=Agarwal2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=2000|title= Conceptualising environmental collective action: why gender matters|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=24|issue=3|pp=283–310|doi=10.1093/cje/24.3.283|url=http://binaagarwal.com/downloads/apapers/conceptualizing_environmental_collective_action.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ecofeminist believes in a direct connection between oppression of nature and the subordination of women. Vandana Shiva, is credited with bringing ecofeminism into public consciousness by her reports of the [[Chipko]] movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;
The Chipko movement also led to the formation of anti alcoholism.

===Environmental or ecological feminism===

Environmental or ecological feminism differs from ecofeminism in that it is more focused on the actual, specific interactions with the environment. Connections between environment and gender can be made by looking at the gender division of labor and environmental roles rather than an inherent connection with nature.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; The gender division of labor requires a more nurturing and caring role for women, therefore that caring nature places women closer with the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; The knowledge of nature is shaped by the experiences an individual has.  Women have a distinct knowledge of the land, yet are excluded from policy decisions of development on that land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; This is prominent in many developing countries where the responsibility of collecting fuel and fodder is placed upon the women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Both the resources and the meanings are taken into consideration with environmental feminism. There is a challenge to not only focus on the gender division of labor but also the actual appropriation methods of the resources.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; In other words, there is not simply an inherent connection between women and nature, rather there are material realities that exist.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; Bina Agarwal&lt;ref name=Agarwal1997&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Gender and environment management in South Asia: can romanticized pasts help model desirable futures?|journal=Macalester International|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1132&amp;context=macintl}} Article 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes ecofeminism and outlines three problematic elements which are:
*Historical characterization of the situation of women and nature
*Linking of the emancipation of women with that of nature
*Assumptions about women's agency

====Criticism====
[[Bina Agarwal]] has critiqued the ideas of environmental feminism. She proposes problems with welfare, efficiency, and source of land. 
*Welfare

Due to gender differences in income-spending patterns, women are at a higher risk of living in poverty. For this reason, access to land is of special importance. Land access allows for a number of production advantages such as growing trees, fodder and/or crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www-fulcrum-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/concern/monographs/bg257f65x|title=A Field of One's Own|last=Agarwal|first=Bina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0521418682|location=Cambridge, England|pages=pg. 32 &amp; pp.37-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, land access also allows for increased credit, bargaining power and strengthens aggregate real wages rates.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even the smallest amount of land can have huge impacts on welfare directly as well as increasing entitlement to family welfare.&lt;ref name=Chada&gt;Chadha, G K (1992). Non-farm Sector in India's Rural Economy: Policy, Performance and Growth Prospects, mimeo, Centre for Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi (1992), showed that households that owned land earned markedly more than landless households.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Efficiency
#Incentive effect: If women are given secure land rights, there will be a greater incentive for higher production rates.  Women will be motivated to use the best technologies, increase cultivation, and make long-term investments. Environmentally sound use of the land resource and reduced out-migration to cities by women and their dependents are other benefits of women’s secure land rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Credit and input access effect: "Titles would enhance women's ability to raise production by improving their access to agricultural credit, as well as by increasing women's independent access to output, savings and cash flow for reinvestment".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;
#Efficiency of resource use effect: Studies have shown the possibility that women use resources more efficiently than men.  This could mean anything from making a more productive use of loans of money earned to the ability of women to achieve higher values of output based on cropping patterns.
#Gender specific knowledge and talent pool effect: Many women have specific and often greater knowledge about certain crops and planting patterns.  If women are included as farm managers, a more diverse and talented informed pool will be created.
#Bargaining power and empowerment effect: Providing women with the opportunity to own land will increase their sense of empowerment and could help women to assert themselves more in various situations such as policy creation other government schemes.

*Source of land
Because public land available for distribution is now quite limited, most of the land will need to come from private sectors.  "To get a share of land, therefore, it is critical for women to stake a claim in privatised land".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

===Feminist political ecology ===
Feminist political ecology builds from [[ecofeminism]] and environmental feminism and lays out three essential factors which are: 
# [[wiktionary:gendered knowledge|Gendered knowledge]], or the ways in which access to scientific and ecological knowledge is structured by gender (this is considered part of [[gender feminism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |subscription=yes |jstor=40435825|title=Public Affairs Quarterly Vol. 6, No. 4 |date=October 1992 |pages=435–456 |chapter=Multiculturalism and Epistemology |first=Steven |last=Yates |quote=Feminists offer their distinctive twist to this approach by saying that all knowledge and cognition are "gendered"; hence the term gender feminism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
# Gendered environmental rights and responsibilities, including differential access by men and women to various legal and de facto claims to land and resources.
#Gendered politics and grassroots activism, including an examination of women within and as leaders of environmental movements.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

Feminist political ecology seeks to discover the role and place of women in environmental development on a political scale.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

==In developed nations==

===Sweden===
Sweden has historically had a political culture that inherently protects the environment. Sweden is one of the highest-ranking countries when assessing gender equality, but the government does agree there is room for improvement. Women in Sweden have been empowered to protect the environment through the government and policies, a lot like other developed nations. In Sweden, the majority of local government workers are women at 64% and since the 2010 election, 45% of Swedish parliament is made up of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality in Sweden|url=https://sweden.se/society/gender-equality-in-sweden/|website=Government of Sweden|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has recognized that women are the most affected by climate change and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denton|first=Fatma|date=July 2002|title=Climate Change Vulnerability, Impacts, and Adaptation: Why Does Gender Matter?|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/stable/4030569?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Gender and Development|volume=10|pages=10-20|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this recognition they have committed to contribute to increasing the participation for women in decisions and policy debates surrounding climate change and other environmental issues. They also have committed to increasing resources for women in civil society who present issues about the environment, hoping to increase accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government offices of Sweden|title=Policy for Environmental and Climate Issues in Swedish Development Cooperation|url=http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/15/64/98/24249736.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson and Merchant draw on the idea that the women's environmental movement in Sweden was based on both symbolic and political perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson &amp; Merchant|title='Peace with the Earth:' Women and the Environmental Movement in Sweden|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=1986|issue=9.5–6|pages=465–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of the environmental movement and women’s movement in Sweden, women were very aware that changes had to be made both within society and ideologies, then enacted politically to create a cohesive collective society.

Elin Wagner (1882–1949) presented herself as a radical feminist in early movements. She was a writer, journalist, environmentalist, ecologist and pacifist. She was a large inspiration for the environmental and feminist movements. She saw a large flaw in the popular ideology after World War II: that men had the ability to control and conserve nature for the entire global community or all of mankind. With a place in both politics and writing, she was inspired to write her novel, ''Alarm Clock''. Her novel was barely noticed when released in 1941, but during Sweden's women's movement in the 1970s, her messages became a driving force behind the movement. She believed that there should be a large presence of intellectuals in social movements. Wagner and other key Swedish feminist scholars and intellectuals of that time shaped the parameters of Swedish thinking and both the environmental and women's movements. Throughout her life, Wagner stressed the importance of nature and the environment, an idea we see through the identity of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=A|title=Elin wägner and radical environmentalism in Sweden: The good earthworm|journal=Environmental History Review|date=1994|volume=18|issue=3|pages=59–74|jstor=3984710|doi=10.2307/3984710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden has it ingrained in both their identity and traditions to have a deep sense of nature, which has played a huge role in shaping the overall consensus of the country to protect the environment, especially for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breiting &amp; Wickenberg|title=The progressive development of environmental education in Sweden and Denmark|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the transformation of the opinion and ideologies of the Swedish people, it became much easier to entrench environmental policies. Women working within institutions protected the global environment by pushing for bans on nuclear energy or industry degrading local environment. In 1980, there was a national referendum on nuclear power in Sweden. The voting patterns revealed that 43% of women were against nuclear power, while only 21% of men opposed it.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merchant|first1=C|title=Earthcare: Women and the Environment|date=1996|location=New York|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden and the women of the country have demonstrated that environmental protection can be achieved through transitioning ideologies followed by institutional change.

==Women's attitude and the environment==
The deep connection between women and men comes from the daily interaction between them.{{citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}} In recent decades, environmental movements have increased as the movements for women's rights have also increased.&lt;ref name = "Mellor"&gt;Mellor, Mary.(1997). Feminism &amp; Ecology. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's union of nature preservation with [[women's rights]] and [[Women's liberation|liberation]] has stemmed from invasion of their rights in the past.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"/&gt;

In developing areas of the world, women are considered the primary users of [[natural resources]] (Land, forest, and water), because they are the ones who are responsible for gathering food, fuel, and fodder.&lt;ref name= "Abzug"&gt;Abzug, Bella. (1995). Women and the Environment. International Authors Series. New York: The Department of Public Information.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in these countries, women mostly can't own the land and farms outright, they are the ones who spend most of their time working on the farms to feed the [[household]]. Shouldering this responsibility leads them to learn more about soil, plants, and trees and not misuse them. Although, technological inputs increase male involvement with land, many of them leave the farm to go to cities to find jobs; so women become increasingly responsible for an increasing portion of farm tasks.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"&gt;Jiggins, Janice. (1994). Changing the Boundaries: Women-Centered Perspectives on population and the Environment. New York: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These rural women tend to have a closer relationship with land and other natural resources, which promotes a new culture of respectful use and preservation of natural resources and the environment, ensuring that the following generations can meet their needs.&lt;ref name = "Silent"&gt;From Silent Spring to vocal vanguard. (1997, January). United Nations Chronicle, 34(3), 35-38. Retrieved December 13, 2006, from ProQuest database.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides considering how to achieve appropriate [[agricultural]] production and human nutrition, women want to secure access to the land.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Women's perspectives and values for the environment are somewhat different from men's. Women give greater priority to protection of and improving the capacity of nature, maintaining farming lands, and caring for nature and environment's future.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Repeated studies have shown that women have a stake in environment, and this stake is reflected in the degree to which they care about natural resources. [[Ecofeminism]] refers to women's and feminist perspectives on the environment – where the domination and exploitation of women, of poorly resourced peoples and of nature is at the heart of the ecofeminist movement.

==Climate change and women==
Many of the environmental effects of climate change have disproportionately placed women in more vulnerable circumstances. Environmental occurrences that affect the activities women are found to be mainly responsible for in developing countries include increase in storm frequency and intensity, increase in floods, droughts, and fires. The Indian Government's National Action Plan on Climate Change said "The impacts of climate change could prove particularly severe for women. With climate change there would be increasing scarcity of water, reductions in yields of forest biomass, and increased risks to human health with children, women and the elderly in a household becoming the most vulnerable. ...special attention should be paid to the aspects of gender."&lt;ref name=arora&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonsson-Arora|first1=Seema|title=Virtue and vulnerability: Discourses on women, gender and climate change|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=May 2011|volume=21|issue=2|pages=744–751|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Asia women are strongly engaged in subsistence fishing as well as collection of food in local habitats. These habitats, such as [[mangroves]], [[seagrass]] beds, and [[lagoons]] are all being negatively influenced by a changing climate, creating barriers in the direct work of women which then ripple out to their community.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

The subsequent response to the connection between women and climate change has evoked multiple responses in the policy realm.  Policy makers have shifted policy to reflect gender sensitive frameworks to address climate change.&lt;ref name=arora /&gt;
Arora-Jonsson argues that by focusing on the vulnerability of women in relation to climate change, it places more responsibility on women and shifts the narrative to ignore the root causes of the issue, power relations and institutional inequality.&lt;ref name=arora /&gt; The outcome of UN movements and policies for promoting women in areas impacted by climate change such as agriculture have not been scientifically proven to have any beneficial results on women communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=2002|volume=37|issue=8|page=679-680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and perception of the environment==
Given the environmental degradation caused while men have had dominance over women, and women's large investment in [[environmental sustainability]], some have theorized that women would protect the Earth better than men if in power. Although there is no evidence for this hypothesis, recent movements have shown that women are more sensitive to the earth and its problems. They have created a special [[value system]] about environmental issues. People's approaches to environmental issues may depend on their relationship with nature. Both women and nature have been considered as subordinates entities by men throughout history, which conveys a close affiliation between them.&lt;ref&gt;Wenz, Peter S. (2001). Environmental Ethics Today. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the perception of the natural environment between men and women differs: women tend to perceive natural resources in means of necessity, while men perceive it in means of "commercial entities or income generating tools." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academicresearchjournals.org/IJPSD/PDF/2016/April/Aditya.pdf|title=Role of Women in Environmental Conservation|last=Aditya|first=Sandeep Kumar|date=April 2016|website=Academic Research Journals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, rural Indian women collect the dead branches which are cut by storm for fuel wood to use rather than cutting the live trees.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, Annabel. (1991). Women and the Environment. New Jersey: Zed Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Since African, Asian, and Latin American women use the land to produce food for their family, they acquire the knowledge of the land/soil conditions, water, and other environmental features.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt; Any changes in the environment on these areas, like deforestation, have the most effect on women of that area, and cause them to suffer until they can cope with these changes. One of the good examples would be the Nepali women whose grandmothers had to climb to the mountain to be able to bring in wood and fodder.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt;

An example of female prominence in the defense of natural forests comes from India in 1906.  As forest clearing was expanding conflict between loggers and government and peasant communities increased. To thwart resistance to the forest clearing, the men were diverted from their villages to a fictional payment compensation site and loggers were sent to the forests. The women left in the villages, however, protested by physically hugging themselves to the trees to prevent their being cut down, giving rise to what is now called the [[Chipko movement]], an environmentalist movement initiated by these Indian women (which also is where the term tree-huggers originated).&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998"&gt;Breton, Mary J. (1998). Women pioneers for the environment. Boston: Northeastern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict started because men wanted to cut the trees to use them for industrial purposes while women wanted to keep them since it was their food resource and deforestation was a survival matter for local people.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

Gender-based commitments and movements such as [[feminism]] have reached to a new approach through the combination of feminism and [[environmentalism]] called [[Ecofeminism]]. Ecofeminists believe on the interconnection between the domination of women and nature. According to ecofeminism the superior power treats all subordinates the same. So, ecofeminism takes into account women subordination and nature degradation.&lt;ref name = "Mellor" /&gt; Remarking all these different reactions, one can see that however, most policy decision makers are men.

Her passion for environmental conservation lead her to found the Greenbelt Movement in 1977. Wangari Maathai's personal life was turbulent with divorce and jailings, as well as constant confrontations with the Kenyan government. Her push to protect national land from development made her less than favorable to Kenyan president [[Daniel arap Moi]], who served from 1978 to 2002.

=== Maria Cherkasova ===
[[Maria Cherkasova]] (b. 1938) is a [[Russia]]n journalist, ecologist, and director of [[Centre for Independent Ecological Programmers]] (CIEP). She is known for coordinating a 4-year campaign to stop construction of hydro-electric dam on the [[Katun River]]. After Cherkasova's involvement in the student movement on environmental protection in the 1960s, she began to work for the [[Red Data Book]] for the Department of Environmental Protection Institute. She researched and preserved rare species until she became the editor of [[USSR]] Red Data Book. She co-founded the [[Socio-Ecological Union]], which has become the largest ecological NGO in the former Soviet Union. In 1990, she became director of CIEP, which arrange and drives activities in an extensive range of ecologically related areas on both domestic and international fronts. Cherkasova recently has shifted her focus on protecting [[children's rights]] to live in a healthy environment and speaks for them both inside and outside Russia.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

===Rachel Carson===
[[Rachel Carson]] (1907–1964) was an [[United States|American]] scientist, writer, and [[ecologist]]. Rachel Carson went to the Pennsylvania College for Women, majoring in English, but she was inspired by her [[biology]] teacher so she switched her major to biology. She became more interested and focused on the sea while she was working at the [[Marine Biological Laboratories in Massachusetts]]. Her eloquent prose let to the publication of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind|Under the Sea-Wind: a Naturalists' Picture of Ocean Life]]'', in 1941. In 1949 she became chief editor of the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS). Her second book, ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', won the [[National Book Award]] and sold more than 200,000 copies. After that she retired from FWS and became a full-time writer. After her third and final book about the sea, ''The Edge of the Sea'', Carson focused on effects of chemicals and pesticides on the environment. That is when she wrote her book about environment, ''[[Silent Spring]]''. The book was about what man has done to the nature and eventually to himself, and started a modern environmental movement. Carson believed that humanity and nature are mutually dependent on each other. She argued that industrial activities such as [[pesticides]] use can damages the earth [[ecosystem]] and will have far-reaching ecological consequences such as future human health problems. Today, scientific studies have demonstrated these consequences.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

=== Jane Goodall ===
[[Jane Goodall]] (b. 1934) is a female environmentalist most well known for her chimpanzee study, in which she lived among the primates. She became interested in animals as a young child and spent her early adulthood saving money to fund her dream of taking a trip to Africa. Her position as secretary to Louis Leakey led to her participation in several anthropological digs and animal studies, and eventually she was selected to study chimpanzee behavior in Tanzania. She made several discoveries about the behavior of chimpanzees on these studies and is credited with discovering the chimpanzee behavior of eating meet and creating tools. She published a book about the study entitled ''In the Shadow of Man''. She is also known for her activism, promoting the preservation of wild chimpanzee environments and opposing the use of animals in research. She has received numerous awards for her achievements and owns the Jane Goodall Institute for Wildlife Research, Education, and Conservation, a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-goodall-9542363#accomplishments|title=Jane Goodall|last=|first=|date=|website=biography.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological movements initiated by women==

===Chipko movement===
One of the first environmentalist movement which was inspired by women was the [[Chipko movement]] (Women tree-huggers in India). "Its name comes from a Hindi word meaning "to stick" (as in glue). The movement was an act of defiance against the state government's permission given to a corporation for commercial logging. Women of the villages resisted, embracing trees to prevent their felling to safeguard their lifestyles which were dependent on the forests. Deforestation could qualitatively alter the lives of all village residents but it was the women who agitated for saving [End Page 163] the forests. Organized by a non-governmental organization that Chandi Prasad Bhatt led, the Chipko movement adopted the slogan "ecology is permanent economy". The women embracing the trees did not tag their action as feminist activism; however, as a movement that demonstrated resistance against oppression, it had all the markings of such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grewal, Jyoti|title=Theorizing Activism, Activizing Theory: Feminist Academics in Indian Punjabi Society|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=20|number=1|pages=161–183|date=Spring 2008|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nwsa_journal/v020/20.1.grewal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began when [[Maharajah]] of [[Jodhpur]] wanted to build a new palace in [[Rajasthan]], which is India's [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foothills. While the [[Lumberjack|axemen]] were cutting the trees, martyr [[Amrita Devi]] hugged one of the trees. This is because in Jodhpur, each child had a tree that could talk to it. The axmen ignored Devi, and after taking her off the tree, cut it down. Her daughters are environmentalists like [[Chandi Prasad Bhatt]] and Sunderlal Bahuguna.

===Green Belt movement===
Another movement, which is one of the biggest in women and environmental history, is the [http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/ Green Belt movement]. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Wangari Maathai]] founded this movement on the [[World Environment Day]] in June 1977.  The starting ceremony was very simple: a few women planted seven trees in Maathai's backyard. By 2005, 30 million trees had been planted by participants in the Green Belt movement on public and private lands. The Green Belt movement aims to bring environmental restoration along with society's economic growth. This movement led by Maathai focused on restoration of [[Kenya]]'s rapidly diminishing forests as well as empowering the rural women through environmental preservation, with a special emphasis on planting indigenous trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Belt Movement|date=2006|accessdate=November 15, 2006|url= http://www.wangarimaathai.or.ke/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muthuki|first=Janet|date=2006-01-01|title=Challenging patriarchal structures: Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement in Kenya|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233277225_Challenging_patriarchal_structures_Wangari_Maathai_and_the_Green_Belt_Movement_in_Kenya|journal=Agenda|volume=20|pages=83–91|doi=10.1080/10130950.2006.9674752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navdanya Movement===
[[Navdanya]] also known as the 'Nine Seeds Movement' seeks to empower local Indian farmers to move away from growing any [[genetically modified organism]] (GMOs) on their land and return to organic, [[chemical-free]] practices. This movement has reached over 5,000,000 Indian farmers and created over 65 seed banks around India.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Navdanya|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url= http://www.navdanya.org/home}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya fights to eliminate the [[commercialization of indigenous knowledge]] also known as 'Biopiracy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yamey, Gavin|title=The Bittersweet Sounds of the Modern Food Chain|journal=PLOS Biology|date=February 2006|volume=4|issue=2|pp=0165–0166|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040047|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya addresses multiple other international issues including climate change, food security, misapplication of technology, food sovereignty, fair trade, and many others.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt; This movement also created a learning center entitled Bija Vidyapeeth. Bija Vidyapeeth, in collaboration with Schumacher College in the United Kingdom, seeks to educate participants in sustainability and ecological principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navdanya|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url= http://www.navdanya.org/earth-university}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenyan land takeover===
In Kenya, starting in the mid-1980s, women protested against the elites and big foreign corporations who were coercing and controlling the production of the land.  Rather than allowing food to be grown for survival, women were pressured by both their husbands and the government to cultivate coffee for foreign profit. Protests continued and gained strength over the next couple of decades.  The protests eventually ended in a Kenyan power shift enforcing democratic national elections which resulted in redistribution of land possible.&lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Perkins, E.|author2=Kuiper, E.|author3=Quiroga-Martínez, R.|author4=Turner, T.

The '''École Nationale Supérieure des Industries Chimiques''' ('''ENSIC''') is an Engineering School dedicated to [[Chemical Engineering]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]].

Ensic Nancy is one of the seven schools of the [[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine|Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine]] (INPL), France's largest technological university.
==Creation==
In October 1885, it was announced that the authorities were in favour of the creation of an institute of chemistry in Nancy.  This pulled together a variety of chemical activities in the University of Nancy, with the specific aim of instructing young men in the practical application of chemistry to industry and agriculture. The decree authorizing the creation of the Institute was made on 8 September 1887 and construction began in 1888. The first 6 students joined in 1889 and [[Albin Haller]] was appointed as director on 30 July 1890.  on 6 June 1892 it was formally inaugurated by the President of the Republic, [[Marie François Sadi Carnot]].

''La contribution des pharmaciens à la création (1887-1892) et à l'enseignement de l'Institut Chimique de Nancy. L'influence des systèmes étrangers d'éducation sur cette création.'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Achievements==
One of its early professors, [[Victor Grignard]], obtained the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Chemistry]] in 1912 for his invention of the organo-metallic compounds known as "[[Grignard reagent|Grignard's reagents]]". After the Second World War, ENSIC introduced to France chemical engineering principles developed in the English-speaking world.

The school created a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] in December 2008 to support its activities, called ''Fondation ENSIC'', with the participation of [[Arkema]].
