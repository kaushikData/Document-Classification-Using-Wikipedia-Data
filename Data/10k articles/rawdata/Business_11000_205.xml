'''Alan Knott-Craig''' (born 8 May 1952, [[Oudtshoorn]], [[South Africa]]) is a retired South African former CEO of [[Vodacom]] (1996 - 2008) and [[Cell C]] (2012 - 2014).

== Early life and career ==
Knott-Craig was born on 8 May 1952, Oudtshoorn, South Africa, where he spent his formative years. In 1974 he graduated in a Bachelor of Science degree from the [[University of Cape Town]]. Prior to 1993 he was Senior General Manager of Mobile Communications at [[Telkom (South Africa)|Telkom]] SA, before he moved to [[Vodacom]]. In 1996 he was appointed CEO of Vodacom. He held that position until he stepped down in 2008. He also served as an Independent Non-Executive Director of Murray &amp; Roberts Holdings. He was appointed to the Murray &amp; Roberts Board in 2008. He served as chairman of the health, safety and environment committee until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whoswho.co.za/alan-knott-craig-snr-1055|title=Alan Knott-Craig (Snr) {{!}} Who's Who SA|website=whoswho.co.za|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he joined Cell C as its CEO until he stepped down in 2014 due to ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/technology/2014/05/08/alan-knott-craig-steps-down-as-cell-c-ceo|title=Alan Knott-Craig steps down as Cell C CEO|website=Business Day Live|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Please Call Me and the Constitutional Court ===
In 2008, former employee [[Nkosana Makate]] took [[Vodacom]] to court, claiming that the profitable [[Nkosana Makate|Please Call Me]] message service was originally his invention and demanding compensation. Eight years later, Makate eventually won his case in the [[Constitutional Court]] (the highest court in South Africa). Makate will now enter negotiations with Vodacom for a 15% cut of the R70 billion he claims 'Please Call Me' has earned for [[Vodacom]] since its inception.

A 2014 judgement in the South Gauteng High Court supported Makate's claim to having originated [[Nkosana Makate|Please Call Me]]. The court heard that, in November 2000, Makate had shared his idea (initially termed the "buzz" idea) with Philip Geissler, then board member and director of product development and management at [[Vodacom]]. Geissler had agreed to give Makate a cut should the Please Call Me innovation prove a success. Makate's witnesses presented emails sent by Geissler and an article in [[Vodacom]]'s "Talk Time" internal newsletter which acknowledged and praised Makate for his idea and his contribution to the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPJHC/2014/135.html|title=Makate v Vodacom (Pty) Limited (08/20980) [2014] ZAGPJHC 135 (1 July 2014)|website=www.saflii.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court also rejected former CEO Allan Knott-Craig's lie that he had come up with the idea. Knott-Craig had published the lie in his autobiography, and later lied in court, claiming he had the idea while watching two security guards trying to communicate on phones without airtime.&lt;ref&gt;Knott-Craig, Alan; Afonso, Eunice (2009). ''Second is nothing: creating a multi-billion rand cellular industry''. Johannesburg: Pan Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the High Court found against Makate's claim for compensation, holding [[Vodacom]]'s argument that Geissler had not had the authority to promise Makate such compensation and that the debt would have expired (in legal terms, been prescribed) within three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPJHC/2014/135.html|title=Makate v Vodacom (Pty) Limited (08/20980) [2014] ZAGPJHC 135 (1 July 2014)|website=www.saflii.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nkosana Makate|Makate]] took the case on appeal, and then took it to the [[Constitutional Court]]. In April 2016 Justice [[Chris Jafta]] found in Makate's favour and against Vodacom, overturning both judgements and finding that Geissler had had the authority to promise compensation, and that Makate's case was not based on an unpaid debt. In his judgement, Justice Chris Jafta had harsh words for Knott-Craig and Geissler. Among other things he said : “In not compensating the applicant [Makate]… [[Vodacom]] associated itself with the dishonourable conduct of its former CEO, Mr Knott-Craig and his colleague, Mr Geissler. This leaves a sour taste in the mouth. It is not the kind of conduct to be expected from an ethical corporate entity,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-opinion/nkosana-makate-won-please-call-case/|title=How Nkosana Makate won the Please Call Me case|date=2016-04-28|website=Moneyweb|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7505">'''Antonia Albert''' is an [[Austria|Austrian]] business economist and entrepreneur. In 2015, she co-founded the startup Careship in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] as an online marketplace for in-home senior care. Albert helped raise $4 million in investor funding in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. Careship has expanded to the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] as well as the cities of [[Hamburg]], [[Düsseldorf|Dusseldorf]] and [[Frankfurt]].

The business model used by Careship and similar services is controversial.

The '''Bank Discount Tower''' is a [[skyscraper]] located on Yehuda HaLevi Street 23 corner with Herzl Street in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. It is the headquarters of the [[Israel Discount Bank]].&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/LocalIsrael/TelAvivAndCenter/Article.aspx?id=178053 Tel Aviv's Rehov Herzl is where the city that never sleeps started out, [[Jerusalem Post]]]. Retrieved 2016-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Completed in 2006, three years after construction began in 2003, the tower has 30 floors, 7 basement floors, and is 105 meters in height. Construction of the tower took place in two stages, with construction of the first 13 floors ending in 2006, and the upper 17 floors being constructed after the tower was partly occupied.

The Tel Aviv Municipality granted a building permit on condition that the bank preserve the historic Schiff House next door, which was restored and reopened as a museum of banking.&lt;ref name="jpost" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">The '''Bundesverband Großhandel, Außenhandel, Dienstleistungen e.V.''' (BGA), Federal Association of Wholesale, Foreign Trade, Services [[Registered association (Germany)|e.V.]] is a German umbrella organization of associations of these branches of industry based in Berlin. It was founded on March 29, 1949 by representatives of 40 associations as a general association of German wholesale and foreign trade. Today, the organization has almost 70 member associations and represents around 125,000 German companies with a sales volume of around EUR 1,000 billions.&lt;ref&gt;"BGA  Struktur_Organigramm" [https://www.bga.de/bga/strukturorganigramm/]&lt;/ref&gt;

It represents the interests of the German wholesale, foreign trade, and services sectors. The BGA supports its members in matters of professional, economic, and social policy. To this end, as with all lobbying associations, contacts with representatives of the Federal Government and the German [[Bundestag]], as well as the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], are indispensable.

The presidium is currently headed by its president Holger Bingmann&lt;ref&gt;Pressemeldung BGA 26. September 2017: "BGA: Dr. Holger Bingmann ist neuer BGA-Präsident" [https://bga.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pressebereich_2/PDFs_Pressemeldungen/PD4317.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and the association is managed by its CEO Gerhard Handke&lt;ref&gt;"Gerhard Handke neuer Hauptgeschäftsführer des BGA" [https://www.presseportal.de/pm/6564/552628]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capital impairment''' is the case when the company lost its [[asset]], so the asset is lower than the [[stock]] of a company. One way to avoid capital impairment is [[reduction of capital]] without any compensation.

'''Archibald Carlisle Kotchian''' (July 17, 1914 – December 14, 2008), known as '''Carl''' or '''A.C.''', was an American business executive who served as the president of [[Lockheed Corporation]]. His admission of [[Lockheed bribery scandals|paying millions of dollars]] in bribes to foreign government officials led to the jailing of Japan's prime minister and political upheaval in several countries in the 1970s.

Kotchian was born on July 17, 1914 in Kermit, [[Divide County, North Dakota]] and grew up in [[Long Beach, California]], attending Long Beach Junior College (now known as [[Long Beach City College]]).&lt;ref name=LATObit&gt;Pae, Peter. [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/valley/la-me-kotchian21-2008dec21,0,6307680.story "A. Carl Kotchian dies at 94; ex-Lockheed chief admitted paying bribes to foreign officials"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', December 21, 2008. Accessed December 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended [[Stanford University]], where he received an undergraduate degree and a [[Master of Business Administration]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Kotchian, a [[Certified Public Accountant]] worked for [[Price Waterhouse]] in Los Angeles. He was hired in 1941 by Vega Airplane Company, a subsidiary of Lockheed Aircraft. At Lockheed, he supervised the firm's surge in aircraft production during [[World War II]]. He established the firm's manufacturing site in [[Marietta, Georgia]], which became the primary production location for the [[C-130 Hercules]] cargo plane and later for the [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter. He became president of Lockheed in 1967, a period in which the firm produced the [[C-5 Galaxy]] cargo plane and the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] spy plane for the U.S. military and the [[Lockheed L-1011|L-1011 TriStar]] jet for the commercial market.&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

Development of the L-1011 began in the late 1960s, during Kotchian's presidency, and was started without any firm orders. In 1971, the United States government provided a $250 million loan to help bail the firm out of mounting development costs for military programs and for the L-1011. In testimony before the [[United States Senate]] in 1976, Kotchian described how he had met with government officials in Japan and made payoff of 500 million [[Japanese yen|yen]], the equivalent of US$1.7 million, part of a total of US$12 million in payments to Japanese politicians and businessmen that led to the sale of 21 L-1011 aircraft by Lockheed, then worth US$430 million. [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was ultimately convicted of accepting a bribe, one of many notable Japanese politicians who were involved in the scandal.&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

In his Senate testimony, Kotchian disclosed that Lockheed paid $1.1 million in the early 1960s to a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] official later identified as [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Prince Bernhard]], husband of [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] in his role as inspector general of the [[Military of the Netherlands]]. After the revelations, the prince stepped down from his military position.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

In a 1977 profile in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Kotchian reflected his bitterness at the Lockheed directors who ousted hims as chief operating officer and vice chairman in March 1976 based on his $38 million of what the board called "questionable payments". Kotchian described that he felt that&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, Robert. [https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/03/archives/kotchian-calls-himself-the-scapegoat-kotchian-calls-himself-the.html "Kotchian Calls Himself The Scapegoat; Kotchian Calls Himself the Scapegoat"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 3, 1977. Accessed December 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lockheed has become the scapegoat for 300 companies that the S.E.C. said were doing the same thing, and Haughton and I are the scapegoats for the scapegoat.... Some call it gratuities. Some call them questionable payments. Some call it extortion. Some call it grease. Some call it bribery. I look at these payments as necessary to sell a product. I never felt I was doing anything wrong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A resident of [[Palo Alto, California]], Kotchian died at age 94 on December 14, 2008. He had been married to the former Lucy Elizabeth Carr who had died in 2002.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Galbraith, Kate (December 22, 2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/business/23kotchian.html "A. Carl Kotchian, Lockheed Executive, Dies at 94".] ''[[The New York Times]]''. Accessed December 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm, Obituary," ''Los Angeles Times.'' on July 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[organizational theorist]], Professor and Dean at Cal State L.A.'s College of Business and Economics&lt;ref name="LAT 2007"&gt;Times Staff and Wire Reports. "Donald G. Malcolm, 88; led Cal State L.A.'s College of Business and Economics," ''Los Angeles Times,'' July 09, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[management consultant]], known as co-developer of the [[Performance, Evaluation, and Review Technique]] (PERT).&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanical Engineering Magazine,'' Vol. 84, 1962, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Engineering: IE,'' Vol. 6, 1974. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Malcolm was born and raised in [[Indianapolis]]. In 1940 he obtained his BSc in Public Service Engineering from [[Purdue University]],&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; and after the war his MSc in [[industrial engineering]].&lt;ref name="LAT 2007"/&gt; 

In [[World War II]] Malcolm served on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific as radioman.&lt;ref name="LAT 2007"/&gt; After his graduation Malcolm started his academic career as research team leader of the Operations Research Team at the Johns Hopkins University.&lt;ref name="DGMO"/&gt;
In 1950 he was lecturer in Mechanical Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;''Register - University of California,'' Vol. 2, 1950, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1952 assistant professor of industrial engineering at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;''Register - University of California, Volume 2.'' University of California Press, 1952. p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1950s he was also management consultant for [[Booz, Allen and Hamilton]] in Chicago, Illinois, and in those days participated with the [[United States Navy Special Projects Office|US Navy Special Projects Office]], especially with [[Willard Fazar]], in the development of [[PERT]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm (1959, 646)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954-1955 he was president of the American Institute of Industrial Engineers, now [[Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). ''Scientific and Technical Societies of the United States and Canada,'' Sixth edition, 1955. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 he settled as management consultant with his own consultancy firm ''Management Technology Inc.'' From 1962 to 1967 he also directed the National Safety Standards division of the US Department of Transportation. From 1970 he was one of the Senior Vice Presidents of Computer Applications, Inc.,&lt;ref name="DGMO"/&gt; and from 1972 to 1981 he served as dean of the College of Business and Economics at the [[California State University, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="LAT 2007"/&gt;

In 1965 Malcolm was awarded a Distinguished Alumnus Award from [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand F. Leimkuhler. ''An Enduring Quest: The Story of Purdue Industrial Engineers.'' 2009, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; After his retired in 1981 and Malcolm moved to the Hawaiian island of [[Maui]], where he remained active for many more years. In the new millennium he had moved back to the mainland, and died in 2007 at his home in Santa Monica.&lt;ref name="LAT 2007"/&gt;

== Work ==
=== Team leader on operations research projects ===
Malcolm made his most notable contributions as team leader on specific operations research projects. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (2007) summarized:
:"From the mid 1950's he was a team leader on operations research projects at [[Booz Allen Hamilton|Booz Allen]] in Chicago; the [[System Development Corporation|Systems Development Corp.]], and Operations Research, Inc. in Santa Monica. While at Booz Allen, he headed the research team that developed the original PERT System for the Navy's first submarine-launched ballistic missile, the Polaris. During this time frame, he also led the team designing the first computer -based Business Game for the American Management Association, which was the model for many such computer simulations in subsequent years."&lt;ref name="DGMO"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14612">{{For|the currency of the European Union|Euro}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}

'''Eurodollars''' are [[time deposit]]s denominated in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]s at [[bank]]s outside the [[United States]], and thus are not under the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[Federal Reserve]]. Consequently, such deposits are subject to much less regulation than similar deposits within the U.S. The term was originally coined for U.S. dollars in European banks, but it expanded over the years to its present definition. A U.S. dollar-denominated deposit in Tokyo or Beijing would be likewise deemed a Eurodollar deposit. There is no connection with the [[euro]] currency or the [[eurozone]].

More generally, the ''euro-'' prefix can be used to indicate any currency held in a country where it is not the official currency: for example, '''Euroyen''' or even '''Euroeuro'''.

== History ==

Gradually, after [[World War II]], the quantity of [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] outside the [[United States]] increased significantly, as a result of both the [[Marshall Plan]] and imports into the U.S., which had become the largest consumer market after World War II.

As a result, large amounts of [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] were in the custody of foreign banks outside the United States. Some foreign countries, including the [[Soviet Union]], also had deposits in U.S. dollars in American banks, granted by certificates. Various history myths exist for the first Eurodollar creation, or booking, but most trace back to Communist governments keeping dollar deposits abroad:–

In one version, the first booking traces back to [[History of the People's Republic of China|Communist China]], which, in 1949, managed to move almost all of its U.S. dollars to the Soviet-owned [[Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord – Eurobank|Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord]] in Paris before the United States froze the remaining assets during the Korean War.&lt;ref name="Garson 2001"/&gt;

In another version, the first booking traces back to the Soviet Union during the [[Cold War]] period, especially after the invasion of [[Hungary]] in 1956, as the Soviet Union feared that its deposits in North American banks would be frozen as a retaliation. It decided to move some of its holdings to the [[Moscow Narodny Bank]], a Soviet-owned bank with a [[United Kingdom|British]] charter. 
The British bank would then deposit that money in the U.S. banks. There would be no chance of confiscating that money, because it belonged to the British bank and not directly to the Soviets. 
On 28 February 1957, the sum of $800,000 was transferred, creating the first eurodollars. Initially dubbed "Eurbank dollars" after the bank's [[Teleprinter|telex]] address, they eventually became known as "eurodollars"&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite book

|authorlink=George Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt; as such deposits were at first held mostly by [[Europe]]an banks and [[financial institution]]s.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; A major role was played by [[City of London]] banks, as the [[Midland Bank]], now [[HSBC]], and their offshore [[holding company|holding companies]].

In the mid-1950s, Eurodollar trading and its development into a dominant world currency began when the Soviet Union wanted better interest rates on their Eurodollars and convinced an Italian banking cartel to give them more interest than what could have been earned if the dollars were deposited in the U.S. The Italian bankers then had to find customers ready to borrow the Soviet dollars and pay above the U.S. legal interest-rate caps for their use, and were able to do so; thus, Eurodollars began to be used increasingly in global finance.&lt;ref name="Garson 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garson|first=Barbara|title=Money Makes the World Go Around|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-670-86660-1|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurodollars can have a higher interest rate attached to them because of the fact that they are out of reach from the Federal Reserve. U.S. banks hold an account at the Fed and can, in theory, receive unlimited liquidity from the Fed if necessary. These required reserves and Fed backing make U.S. Dollar deposits in U.S. banks inherently less risky, and Eurodollar deposits slightly more risky, which requires a slightly higher interest rate.&lt;ref name="Willette"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traderbrains.com/what-is-a-eurodollar-and-why-does-it-have-a-different-interest-rate/ |title=What is a Eurodollar and Why Does it Have a Different Interest Rate? |last1= Willette |first1= Jeff |date= April 3, 2014 |website= traderbrains.com |accessdate= April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1970, 385 billion eurodollars were booked offshore.&lt;ref&gt;William Brittain-Catlin: Offshore – The Dark Side of the Global Economy; Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005, p.8-9&lt;/ref&gt; 
These deposits were lent on as U.S. dollar loans to businesses in other countries where interest rates on loans were perhaps much higher in the local currency, and where the businesses were exporting to the USA and being paid in dollars, thereby avoiding [[foreign exchange risk]] on their loans.

Several factors led Eurodollars to overtake certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by U.S. banks as the primary private short-term money market instruments by the 1980s, including:
* The successive [[Bretton Woods system#The U.S. balance of payments crisis .281958.E2.80.9368.29|commercial deficits]] of the [[United States]]
* The U.S. Federal Reserve's ceiling on domestic deposits during the high inflation of the 1970s&lt;ref name="Burghardt"&gt;{{cite book

|year=2003
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eurodollar deposits were a cheaper source of funds because they were free of reserve requirements and deposit insurance assessments&lt;ref name="Burghardt"/&gt;

== Market size ==

By December 1985 the [[Eurocurrency]] market was estimated by [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|Morgan]] Guaranty bank to have a net size of 1.668 billion, of which 75% were likely eurodollars.&lt;ref&gt;Harold G. Vatter and John F. Walker (editors): History of the U.S. Economy since World War II; Sharpe, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the markets are not responsible to any government agency its growth is hard to estimate. The Eurodollar market is by a wide margin the largest source of global finance. In 1997, nearly 90% of all international loans were made this way.&lt;ref name="Shaxson"&gt;{{cite book

== Futures contracts ==

The Eurodollar futures contract refers to the financial [[futures contract]] based upon these deposits, traded at the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME). More specifically, EuroDollar futures contracts are derivatives on the interest rate paid on those deposits. A Eurodollar future is a cash settled futures contract whose price moves in response to the interest rate offered on US Dollar denominated deposits held in European banks.{{cn|date=June 2015}} 
Eurodollar futures are a way for companies and banks to lock in an interest rate today, for money it intends to borrow or lend in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikinvest:Eurodollar futures|Eurodollar futures on Wikinvest]]&lt;/ref&gt; Each CME Eurodollar futures contract has a notional or "face value" of $1,000,000, though the [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] used in futures allows one contract to be traded with a [[Margin (finance)|margin]] of about one thousand dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmegroup.com/wrappedpages/clearing/pbrates/performancebond.html?group=CME%20INTEREST%20RATE%20FUTURES&amp;type=OutrightRates&amp;h=2&amp;reporttype=marginrate|title=Outrights/Vol Scans for Performance Bonds - Margins - CME Group|work=cmegroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CME Eurodollar futures prices are determined by the market’s forecast of the 3-month [[United States dollar|USD]] [[London Interbank Offered Rate|LIBOR]] [[interest rate]] expected to prevail on the [[settlement date]]. A price of 95.00 implies an interest rate of 100.00 - 95.00, or 5%. The settlement price of a contract is defined to be 100.00 minus the official [[British Bankers' Association]] fixing of 3-month LIBOR on the day the contract is settled.

=== How the Eurodollar futures contract works ===

For example, if on a particular day an investor buys a single three-month contract at 95.00 (implied settlement LIBOR of 5.00%):

* if at the close of business on that day, the contract price has risen to 95.01 (implying a LIBOR decrease to 4.99%), US$25 will be paid into the investor's margin account; or
* if at the close of business on that day, the contract price has fallen to 94.99 (implying a LIBOR increase to 5.01%), US$25 will be deducted from the investor's margin account.

On the settlement date, the settlement price is determined by the actual LIBOR fixing for that day rather than a market-determined contract price.

===History===
The Eurodollar futures contract was launched in 1981, as the first cash-settled futures contract. People reportedly camped out the night before the contract’s open, flooding the pit when the CME opened the doors. That trading pit was the largest pit ever, nearly the size of a football field, and quickly became one of the most active on the trading floor, with over 1500 traders and clerks coming to work every day on what was then known as the CME’s upper trading floor. That floor is no longer, with the CME having moved over to the CBOT’s trading floor and 98% of Eurodollar trading now done electronically.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

=== Eurodollar futures contract as synthetic loan ===

A single Eurodollar future is similar to a [[forward rate agreement]] to borrow or lend US$1,000,000 for three months starting on the contract settlement date. Buying the contract is equivalent to lending money, and selling the contract short is equivalent to borrowing money.

Consider an investor who agreed to lend US$1,000,000 on a particular date for three months at 5.00% per annum (months are calculated on a 30/360 basis). Interest received in 3 months' time would be US$1,000,000 × 5.00% × 90 / 360 = US$12,500. 
* If the following day, the investor is able to lend money from the same start date at 5.01%, s/he would be able to earn US$1,000,000 × 5.01% × 90 / 360 = US$12,525 of interest. Since the investor only is earning US$12,500 of interest, s/he has lost US$25 as a result of interest rate moves.
* On the other hand, if the following day, the investor is able to lend money from the same start date only at 4.99%, s/he would be able to earn only US$1,000,000 × 4.99% × 90 / 360 = US$12,475 of interest. Since the investor is in fact earning US$12,500 of interest, s/he has gained US$25 as a result of interest rate moves.

This demonstrates the similarity. However, the contract is also different from a loan in several important respects:
* In an actual loan, the US$25 per basis point is earned or lost ''at the end of the three-month loan, not up front''. That means that the profit or loss per 0.01% change in interest rate ''as of the start date of the loan'' (i.e., its [[present value]]) is less than US$25. Moreover, the present value change per 0.01% change in interest rate is ''higher'' in ''low'' interest rate environments and ''lower'' in ''high'' interest rate environments. This is to say that an actual loan has [[bond convexity|convexity]]. A Eurodollar future pays US$25 per 0.01% change in interest rate no matter what the interest rate environment, which means it does not have convexity. This is one reason that Eurodollar futures are not a perfect proxy for expected interest rates. This difference can be adjusted for by reference to the [[implied volatility]] of options on Eurodollar futures.
* In an actual loan, the lender takes credit risk to a borrower. In Eurodollar futures, the principal of the loan is never disbursed, so the credit risk is only on the margin account balance. Moreover, even that risk is the risk of the [[Clearing house (finance)|clearinghouse]], which is considerably lower than even unsecured single-A credit risk.

=== Other features of Eurodollar futures ===

40 quarterly expirations and 4 serial expirations are listed in the Eurodollar contract.&lt;ref name="Eurodollar Contract Specifications"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cme.com/clearing/clr/spec/contract_specifications_cl.html?product=ED|title=Futures &amp; Options Trading|work=cme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This means that on 1 January 2011, the exchange will list 40 quarterly expirations (March, June, September, December for 2011 through 2020), the exchange will also list another four serial (monthly) expirations (January, February, April, May 2011). This extends tradeable contracts over ten years, which provides an excellent picture of the shape of the [[yield curve]]. The front-month contracts are among the most liquid futures contracts in the world, with liquidity decreasing for the further out contracts. Total [[open interest]] for all contracts is typically over 10 million.

The CME Eurodollar futures contract is used to hedge [[interest rate swap]]s. There is an [[arbitrage]] relationship between the interest rate swap market, the [[forward rate agreement]] market and the Eurodollar contract. CME Eurodollar futures can be traded by implementing a spread strategy among multiple contracts to take advantage of movements in the forward curve for future pricing of interest rates.

== Sweeps ==
{{update|section|date=October 2013}}
In [[Banking in the United States|United States banking]], Eurodollars are a popular option for what are known as "[[sweep account|sweeps]]". Until 21 July 2011, banks were not allowed to pay interest on corporate [[Transactional account|checking accounts]]. To accommodate larger businesses, banks may automatically transfer, or sweep, funds from a corporation's checking account into an overnight investment option to effectively earn interest on those funds. Banks usually allow these funds to be swept either into [[Money market fund|money market mutual funds]], or alternately they may be used for bank funding by transferring to an offshore branch of a bank.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}

An '''executive officer''' ('''CCE''') is generally a person responsible for running an [[organization]], although the exact nature of the role varies depending on the organization. In many militaries, an executive officer is the second-in-command, reporting to the [[commanding officer]]. The XO is typically responsible for the management of day-to-day activities, freeing the commander to concentrate on strategy and planning the unit's next move.

==Administrative law==
While there is no clear line between executive or principal and inferior officers, principal officers are high-level officials in the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of U.S. government such as department heads of independent agencies. In ''[[Humphrey's Executor v. United States]]'', 295 U.S. 602 (1935), the Court distinguished between executive officers and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial officers by stating that the former serve at the pleasure of the [[President of the United States|president]] and may be removed at his discretion. The latter are removed only with procedures consistent with statutory conditions enacted by Congress. The decision by the Court was that the [[Federal Trade Commission]] was a quasi-legislative body because of other powers it had, and therefore, the president could not fire an FTC member for political reasons. Congress can’t retain removal power over officials with executive function (''[[Bowsher v. Synar]]''). However, statutes can restrict removal if not purely executive (''Humphrey''’s executor), but can't restrict removal of purely executive officer (''[[Myers v. United States]],'' 272 U.S. 52 (1926)). The standard is whether restriction "impedes the president’s ability to perform his constitutional duty" (''[[Morrison v. Olson]]'', 487 U.S. 654 (1988)).

==Corporate law and other legal associations==
{{further|Chief executive officer}}
In [[business]], the executive officers are the top officers of a corporation, the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) being the best-known type. The definition varies; for instance, the California Corporate Disclosure Act defines "executive officers" as the five most highly compensated officers not also sitting on the [[board of directors]]. In many insurance policies, executive officer means, in the case of a corporation, any chairman, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, president, or general counsel. In the case of a [[sole proprietorship]], an executive officer is the sole proprietor. In the case of a [[partnership]], an executive officer is a managing partner, senior partner, or administrative partner. In the case of a [[limited liability company]], an executive officer is any member, manager, or officer.

In [[Charity (practice)|charity]]/[[voluntary sector]]/[[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]], the executive officer(s) are those appointed to drive the day-to-day decisions of the organization. This is normally a formal appointment made by the executive board of trustees. Specific responsibilities and scope vary and are usually called out in a [[governance document]].

== Military ==&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt;
In the units of some [[Military|military force]]s, typically those that are naval in nature (including the U.S. Marine Corps), the executive officer is the [[second-in-command]], reporting to the [[commanding officer]] (CO).  

In most non-naval military services that are land-based (except the U.S. Army, where an executive officer is the second-in-command of certain units) or in joint military organizations, the executive officer is an administrative staff position versus a command position.  XOs in these positions typically assist a commander or deputy commander (or in the case of joint staffs or joint commands, a director) by managing day-to-day activities such as management of the senior officer's schedule, screening of documents or other products, and oversight of the senior officer's administrative support staff.

Management of individual assets in the [[airline]] industry is derived from the military terminology, where an executive officer or first officer, is the second in command of the aircraft. In a fixed wing aircraft, the first officer sits in the right-hand seat, but on a rotary wing aircraft, they sit on the left. Management of the airline as a whole is more in-line with the corporate example above.

=== United Kingdom ===

The term XO is not used in most [[British Army]] or [[Royal Marines]] units, where the designation second-in-command (2i/c) is used as a formal appointment. However, the position does exist in some specialist regiments within the Royal Artillery where the exact duties vary. In the [[Royal Air Force]], the term XO is informally used between officers and airmen, referring to the officer who is second-in-command. It is, however, formally used in the [[Royal Navy]]. In smaller vessels, such as [[submarine]]s and [[frigate]]s, the executive officer also holds the position of [[first lieutenant#United Kingdom|first lieutenant]]. Originally, the second-in-command was usually referred to as first lieutenant (or as "number one"), although it is becoming more common to hear the term XO. On larger ships of the Royal Navy, in which the XO holds the rank of [[commander]], the XO is usually referred to simply as "the commander". The XO also heads the executive department.

=== United States ===
==== {{Visible anchor|United States Army}} ====&lt;!-- Other articles link here --&gt;
There are executive officer slots in each [[company (military unit)|company]], [[battalion]], [[regiment]], and [[brigade]], though generally not at higher levels of command until the [[field army|army]] level.  The XO is typically the second-in-command, and serves as the day-to-day manager of the command staff.  The XO is typically responsible for the management of day-to-day activities, such as administration, maintenance, and logistics, freeing a commander to concentrate on tactical/operational planning and execution and a [[general officer]] commander to concentrate on similar planning and execution at the operational-strategic level.  The XO may take charge in the absence of the commander, the exception being commands with a deputy commander, although recent army command reductions have either merged the two, or eliminated the deputy.  

A few organizations within the army maintain authorizations for a [[chief warrant officer]] to serve as an XO/2IC. One example of this is the [[Modular Ammunition Platoon]], where the ammunition technician acts as the second-in-command during the absence of the platoon leader. While the experience gained as an XO is highly beneficial for an army officer's professional development, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for a command position.  At the [[army]] level of command, a commanding general will have a deputy commanding general as second in command and an "executive officer" on his personal staff who works as his liaison to the general staff and an aide-de-camp who takes care of his calendar and personal needs.

==== United States Marine Corps ====
The executive officer is the [[billet]] of the officer who is second-in-command at the company/[[artillery battery|battery]], [[battalion]]/[[squadron (aviation)|squadron]], and [[Marine expeditionary unit|Marine Expeditionary Unit]] (MEU)/[[regiment]]/aviation [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] (i.e., Marine Aircraft Group, Marine Air Control Group, and Marine Wing Support Group) level. Per the ''Marine Corps Manual'', paragraph 1007.5: "The executive officer shall be an officer of the organization who is eligible to succeed to command, and normally will be the officer next in rank to the commander. As the direct representative of the commander, all orders issued by the executive officer shall have the same force and effect as though issued by the commander. The executive officer shall conform to and effectuate the policies and orders of the commander and shall be prepared to assume command at any time the need should arise." At higher levels of command, the second-in-command is the assistant division/wing commander or, in the case of a [[Marine expeditionary force|Marine Expeditionary Force]] (MEF), deputy commander. For those commands having a general officer (usually a brigadier general) in command without a designated assistant commander or deputy commander, such as a [[Marine expeditionary brigade|Marine Expeditionary Brigade]] (MEB) or [[List of United States Marine Corps logistics groups|Marine Logistics Group]] (MLG), the chief of staff (a colonel) is the second-in-command. Unlike their U.S. Navy counterparts, XOs of U.S. Marine Corps squadrons in [[United States Naval Aviator#Squadron commanding officer|U.S. Naval Aviation]] do not "fleet up" to become CO.

==== United States Navy and United States Coast Guard  ====
An XO is assigned to all ships, aviation squadrons, and shore units and installations, and is responsible to the captain for all ship’s work, drills, exercises, personnel organization, and the policing and inspection of the ship. When the ship goes to action stations, the XO confirms that the ship actually is ready for combat and reports this to the captain. The XO's own action station is in a separate part of the ship from that of the captain, so that a single hit will not likely incapacitate both officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title =Naval Orientation
 | publisher =US Navy
 | pages =16-2
 | url =http://navyadministration.tpub.com/12966/css/Executive-Officer-Xo-294.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On small ships with no [[first lieutenant]], [[gunnery officer]], or [[navigator]], the executive officer may also be responsible for the duties of those officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayo |first=Claude Banks |authorlink = |title =Your Navy |publisher =Parker &amp; Baird Company |volume = |edition = |date =1939 |location =[[Los Angeles]] |pages =287&amp;288 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier air wings in the U.S. Navy do not have an XO, but have a deputy commander (DCAG) instead; for shore-based or functional naval air wings, the equivalent position is the deputy commodore.

In the U.S. Coast Guard, on board small cutters and patrol boats that are commanded by either a junior officer or a senior enlisted member, executive [[chief petty officer]]s or executive petty officers are usually assigned to serve as second-in-command.

On U.S. [[aircraft carrier]]s, per Title 10 [[United States Code]], both the captain (i.e., the commanding officer or CO) and the XO assigned to the ship are [[Naval aviation|naval aviator]]s or [[naval flight officer]]s.  Although not specified by 10 U.S.C., large, air-capable [[amphibious assault ship]]s will have one of the two senior positions (CO or XO) occupied by a [[Surface warfare insignia|surface warfare officer]] and the other by a naval aviator or naval flight officer, alternating at each change of command.  In [[naval aviation]], in U.S. Navy squadrons (other than fleet replacement squadrons and the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron {viz., Blue Angels}), the XO will eventually "fleet up" to become the CO of that squadron after twelve to fifteen months as XO.  This fleet up model was also adopted in the early 2000s for XO and CO positions of both large amphibious assault ships (but not aircraft carriers) and [[Arleigh Burke-class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] guided missile destroyers.  In addition to operational and tactical responsibilities, XOs also shoulder most of the CO's administrative burden, to include oversight of the command's administrative officer (if assigned) and administrative department.

The term of XO in the Navy and Coast Guard should not be confused with the term ''[[Secretary#Executive assistant|executive assistant]]'' (''EA'') in those services, the latter being an officer in the rank of [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain (O-6)]] who serves either dual-hatted as, or in addition to, the [[chief of staff]] to a [[flag officer]].

==== United States Air Force ====
In the U.S. Air Force,  XO is not a command or second-in-command position.  Instead, it is used to designate a company grade officer or junior field grade officer who serves as a staff administrative assistant to a senior officer, starting with a commander at the squadron level or above (e.g., squadron, group, wing, numbered air force, major command).&lt;ref&gt;Air Force Organization, AFI 32-101 {{cite web |url=http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI38-101.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313053458/http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI38-101.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the other uniformed services, this position may be called an aide, an "executive assistant" or an [[adjutant]].  Like the Army, while experience gained as an XO is highly beneficial for an Air Force officer's professional development, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for a command position.&lt;ref&gt;The Executive Officer Guide http://www.afmentor.com/mentor/execguide-appendix-b.html Accessed 2012-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt;  For officers holding second-in-command positions, the U.S. Air Force uses the titles of "vice commander" (CV), or "deputy commander" (CD) for an officer who serves as the second-in-command for an organization above [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] level.  For a squadron level organization, the second-in-command is typically termed the "director of operations" or "operations officer" (DO).  These latter terms were previously used for similar positions at the group and wing level until renamed as the "operations group commander (OG/CC). The rank of an executive officer in the U.S. Air Force can vary from [[lieutenant]] or [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] working for a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], to a major or lieutenant colonel in support of a brigadier general or major general, to a colonel serving as the executive officer to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the Air Force]].  

====Personal staff officers==== 
The U.S. Air Force uses the term ''executive officer'' for officers assigned as personal staff officers to general officers. Their role is similar to [[Aide-de-camp#United States|aides-de-camp]] in the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force and [[Aide-de-camp#United States|flag aides and flag lieutenants]] in the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard.

==== Executive officer, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ====
A unique application of the term is executive officer to the [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]], and commander, [[United States European Command]]. This position is typically held by a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] or [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] (LH) and is drawn from all of the armed services. The duties involve serving as both an "executive assistant" to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe#Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR) and also includes command responsibilities for the U.S. military community at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Biography of Brigadier General Gregory Lengyel, Executive Officer to SACUER (2010-2012) https://archive.is/20120717150747/http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=13949 Accessed on 2012-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9151">A '''fare basis code''' (often just referred to as a '''fare basis''') is an alphabetic or alpha-numeric code used by airlines to identify a fare type and allow airline staff and travel agents to find the rules applicable to that fare.  Although airlines now set their own fare basis codes, there are some patterns that have evolved over the years and may still be in use.

Fare codes start with a letter called a '''booking class''' (indicating [[travel class]] among other things) which almost always matches the letter code that the reservation is booked in.&lt;ref name="cranky"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://crankyflier.com/2007/07/25/fun-with-fare-basis-codes/ | title=The Cranky Flier, Fun with Fare Basis Codes | year=2007 | accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other letters or numbers may follow.  Typically a fare basis will be 3 to 7 characters long,&lt;ref name="gbtp"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Guide to Becoming a Travel Professional | author=Todd/Ginger, Rice, Susan | year=2005 | page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can be up to 8.&lt;ref name="cranky"/&gt;

== Booking class ==

The first character of the fare basis code is always a letter, and will almost always match the booking class.&lt;ref name="gal"&gt;{{cite book | title=Galileo 360(degrees). V1 Course book. | publisher=Galileo Travelport | year=2009 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booking codes are the identifiers used by the airline's [[revenue management]] department to control how many seats can be sold at a particular fare level.  For example, a plane may have 25 economy seats still available and the airline may show it in a reservation system as &lt;code&gt;Y7 K5 M4 T6 E3&lt;/code&gt; which indicates how many of each booking class can be reserved. Some codes cannot be sold by agents, and those seats may be reserved for international connections, loyalty programs, or airline staff relocation.

Booking codes were defined by [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]],{{cn|date=February 2018}} but airlines have deviated from the IATA standard and current booking codes are airline-specific.&lt;ref name="gal12"&gt;{{cite book | title=Galileo 360(degrees). V1 Course book. Galileo Travelport. 2009. | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same code may have different meanings for tickets issued by different airlines. Many airlines use nearly all letters of the alphabet to allow finer yield management. Nevertheless, certain booking codes have retained the same meaning across most airlines:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Booking code
! Meaning
|-
| F
| full-fare [[First class (aviation)|First class]]&lt;ref name="gal1316"&gt;{{cite book | title=Galileo 360(degrees). V1 Course book. Galileo Travelport. 2009. | year=2009 | pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, on airlines which have first class distinct from business class. 
|-
| J
| full-fare [[Business class]]
|-
| W
| full-fare [[Premium economy]]&lt;ref&gt;on airlines that offer it, may be some discount economy on airlines without it such as [[Turkish Airlines]]&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Y
| full-fare [[Economy class]]
|}

== Other common patterns ==
Letters and numbers in other sections of the fare basis code may provide the following information:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code
! Standard position in fare basis code
! style="width: 70%;" |Meaning
|-
| E 
| Second letter
| This often indicated that the fare was an "Excursion Fare".  These fares typically had a minimum and maximum stay requirement to encourage use by the holiday market and not business travellers.
|-
| Numerals
| Latter parts of the fare basis
| Numerals often indicate the maximum stay the fare rules will allow at a destination. Thus a YE45 is an economy excursion fare with a maximum stay of 45 days.  Similar patterns could be YE3M indicating a 3-month maximum.&lt;ref name="cranky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt;
|-
| H or L
| Other than first letter
| High or low season&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt;
|-
| W or X 
| Other than as the first letter
| These two letters are commonly used in airfares to state if a fare is valid on a weekday (X) or restricted to weekends (W).&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt; The specific days of a weekend may vary, and can include Friday travel.
|-
| OW
|On higher level fares, normally follows the initial booking code.
| One-way fare only&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt;
|-
| RT
|On higher level fares, normally follows the initial booking code.
| Return fare
|-
| Two-letter country codes
|Usually at the end of the code, except if followed by "CH" or "IN"
| Fare bases often end with two-letter country codes. This will be the case when an airline has an international fare in both directions. For example, a fare from Great Britain to Australia may be YE3MGB, and YE3MAU from Australia to Great Britain.&lt;ref name="gal1316" /&gt; This allows the fare to have similar rules, but may have some variations in change fees or to comply with local trade restrictions.
|-
| CH 
| Last two characters
|Child fare (typically up to 11 years old, but 15 in some cases)
|-
| IN
| Last two characters
|Infant fare (typically up to 2 years old, but 3 years in some cases)
|}

== Airline-specific codes ==
There is an endless list of other codes on modern fares. These are not standardized in any way, and may often be for short-term use. The following are some examples:
* '''Codes that indicate an airline's common name for a fare'''.  As a hypothetical example, an airline selling what they refer to as their "Super-Saver" fare may use SPRSVR in the fare basis, or may use it as the entire code.
* '''Codes that limit a fare to a particular company or organisation'''.  An airline may negotiate a fare with the XYZ company and include these letters in their fare basis.  Negotiated fares are normally only visible to agents that have a contract to sell them, and are not publicly listed.
* '''Codes for use with military personnel, or federal government employees'''. These are commonly used in the United States, and often indicate fares with minimal or no restrictions on changes and refunds.
* '''ID''' and '''AD''' used for airline staff (Industry Discount) and travel agency staff (Agent Discount). It may include a number indicating the percentage of discount from the full fare, e.g., AD75.

== Fare construction ==
Fare construction refers to the application of fares which can cover the flights in the reservation, necessary to price the air ticket for issuance.

It is commonly presented as a single line with standardized codes&lt;ref&gt;[https://servicehub.amadeus.com/c/portal/view-solution/774026/en_US/fare-calculation-symbols-and-explanations Fare Calculation Symbols and Explanations, Amadeus]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for travel agents to price the ticket in [[global distribution system]]s. For example, a fare construction may say:

{|class=wikitable
 |-
 |HKG||SU||X/MOW||SU||KGD||598.78SCLA||/-RIX||SU||X/MOW||SU||HKG||371.37ACLA||NUC 970.15||END||ROE 7.849222||XT 160G3 120HK 45I5 105RI 33LV 61XM 713YQ
 |-
 |from [[Hong Kong]]||by [[Aeroflot]]||transfer in [[Moscow]]||by [[Aeroflot]]||to [[Kaliningrad]]||598.78 on fare SCLA||[[arrival unknown]] to [[Riga]]||by [[Aeroflot]]||transfer at [[Moscow]]||by [[Aeroflot]]||to [[Hong Kong]]||371.37 on fare ACLA||total fare in [[Neutral unit of construction|NUC]]|| end of fare ||rate of exchange|| the various taxes, fees and charges added in ticketing currency
 |}

Fare construction is a complicated task because each fare comes with a lot of rules regarding the usage, however the rules are designed to be validatable by computers so the system can decide to accept or reject easily. Most commonly fare construction is done by a computer automatically, but it is not guaranteed that the lowest fares can be found, therefore manual fare construction can also be done, which means finding the suitable fares manually and applying the fares to an itinerary in order to buy a ticket.

== Multiple fare basis ==
It is common for a multi-sector air ticket to have more than one fare basis, particularly if it is for carriage on more than one airline, or different classes of travel are involved. The issuing airline may often have an interline agreement to allow other airlines on the ticket. One disadvantage of this system is that if any change is made, the most restrictive fare rule, and/or the highest change fee, may apply to the entire ticket, not just the portion being changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businesstravel.about.com/od/faqs/g/Glossary-Fare-Basis.htm |title=What is a Fare Basis (or fare code)? |publisher=Businesstravel.about.com |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Distribution Systems ==
In a [[Global Distribution System]], the fare basis will typically display as part of a fare display, and will not normally be shown in an availability display.
Some modern booking systems allow availability searches using parameters such as time of day and lowest fare, and may negate the need for an agent to firstly study the fare basis rules.

== Tickets ==
The fare basis is normally shown on the air ticket.  On older paper tickets, it was highlighted on the relevant coupon for that flight. On modern e-tickets, it is often printed under the flight details.

'''''Government Executive''''' is an American [[News organization|media publication]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]] that covers daily government business. Their reporting is tailored to civilian posts, federal bureaucrats, and military officials who partake in the day-to-day of public policy in the United States.  

''Government Executive'' is led by Tom Shoop, the organization's vice president and editor-in-chief, and Katherine McIntire Peters, the deputy editor. Constance Sayers is its [[President (corporate title)|president]] and [[Publishing|publisher]], and Tim Hartman is [[chief executive officer]] of the Government Executive Media Group, a subsidiary of [[Atlantic Media]]. 

Government Executive Media Group also includes ''Nextgov'', which covers technology and the future of government; ''Defense One,'' covering emerging national security issues; and ''Route Fifty,'' reporting on state and local government. The site also maintains a burgeoning events division, which produces at least 85 events per year. Last year, it produced “Fedstival,” a convention of leaders throughout the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] to discuss the future of bureaucracy.

The '''Standards Board for Alternative Investments''' ('''SBAI'''), formerly known as the '''Hedge Fund Standards Board''', is an international [[Standards organization|standard-setting body]] for the [[alternative investment]] industry and sets the voluntary standard of best practices and practices endorsed by its members. Its primary role is to be the custodian of the Alternative Investment Standards (formerly known as "the Standards"), which are designed to create a "framework of transparency, integrity and good governance" in the way the hedge fund industry operates.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ar16"&gt;{{cite book|title=HFSB Annual Report|date=2016|publisher=Standards Board for Alternative Investments|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== History ==
The SBAI originated in June 2007, when a group of leading [[alternative investment]] managers formed the Hedge Fund Working Group to develop industry standards in areas such as disclosure, valuation, risk management, governance, and shareholder conduct..&lt;ref name="HFSB001"/&gt; Founding firms included [[Marshall Wace]], [[Cheyne Capital Management]], [[Man Group]], and [[CQS (Asset Manager)|CQS]].&lt;ref name="ar16"/&gt; In January 2008, the working group was established as a nonprofit, called the Hedge Fund Standards Board (HFSB). Its primary purpose was to oversee what's called the "Standards" (now known as the "Alternative Investment Standards"). At its inception, the board had 14 leading hedge fund managers and was chaired by Sir [[Andrew Large]] to develop the standards.&lt;ref name="large"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Andrew Large: Advisor to the Board|url=http://www.sbai.org/2016/05/13/sir-andrew-large-advisor-to-the-board/|website=SBAI|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 it had almost 200 hedge fund managers and [[institutional investors]] as members; the total assets under management of all members was $3 trillion.&lt;ref name="HFSB002"/&gt; In 2014, the board became an affiliate member of the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) and in 2016 established mutual observer relationship with the [[International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds]].&lt;ref name="HFSB003"/&gt;

On July 2011, Dame [[Amelia Fawcett]] was appointed Chair of the SBAI, replacing Andrew Large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dame Amelia Fawcett DBE|url=http://www.sbai.org/2016/05/12/dame-amelia-fawcett-dbe/|website=SBAI|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, SBAI becomes an affiliate member of [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) and in 2016 SBAI and [[International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds]] (IFSWF) agreed to engage in mutual observership.&lt;ref name="feb18"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standards Board for Alternative Investments (SBAI)|date=February 2018|publisher=SBAI|location=London|url=http://www.sbai.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SBAI-General-Presentation.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 it announced that it was changing its name from HFSB to the SBAI or Standards Board for Alternative Investments (SBAI) to "reflect the evolution of the industry". Specifically, it noted that "managers increasingly offer their investment strategies through a variety of vehicles beyond '[[hedge funds]]', including [[liquid alternatives]], regulated funds, [[Equity co-investment|co-investment vehicles]], drawdown funds, and [[managed accounts]]" while at the same time moving away from "hedge fund" as a term in order to "classify and integrate a diverse array of alternatives strategies by underlying asset class, return profile, market exposure, or liquidity".&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hedge Funds Standards Board (HFSB) Becomes Standards Board for Alternative Investments (SBAI)|url=http://www.sbai.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HFSB-Press-Release-13-September-2017.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=Standards Board for Alternative Investments|date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3543">'''Henry Fairfax''' (1634–1702) was an English clergyman and academic, [[Dean of Norwich]] after the [[Glorious Revolution]].

==Life==

He was a twin son (with John) of [[Charles Fairfax (antiquary)|Charles Fairfax]], and grandson of [[Thomas Fairfax, 1st Lord Fairfax of Cameron]]. He was educated at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], where he matriculated 21 July 1653. He graduated B.A. in 1657, M.A. 1659, B.D. 26 April 1660, and D.D. 10 March 1680. He was elected a Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=FRFS662H|name=Fairfax, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was senior fellow of Magdalen in 1687, when James II endeavoured to force on the college a president of his own choosing. Fairfax signed the petition to the king (9 April 1687) begging him to cancel his decree ordering the fellows to elect [[Anthony Farmer]]. When that appeal failed he voted for a second petition to the same effect (15 April), and on 17 April took a prominent part in electing [[John Hough (bishop)|John Hough]] to the presidency. With his colleagues he wrote to [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]] (19 April), asking  for his intervention with the king. On 6 June he was summoned before the [[court of high commission]] at [[Whitehall]]. On 13 June he was brought before [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|George Jeffreys]], president of the court, protested against the proceedings, denied their legality, and declined to sign any answer to the charges brought against him. Jeffreys abused him, and told him he was fit for a madhouse.

On 22 June 1687 the high court commissioners suspended Fairfax from his fellowship; but he disputed the validity of the act, and still resided in the college. When the royal commissioners first visited Magdalen on 20 October Fairfax absented himself, although he was in Oxford, whereupon he was pronounced [[contumacious]] (31 October) He appeared before the commissioners next day, and denied the right of the king's new nominee, [[Samuel Parker (English bishop)|Samuel Parker]], to act as president. He would appeal, he said, to the [[court of king's bench]], and with another fellow, Thomas Stafford, signed a protest against the proceedings of the Oxford visitors. On being warned of its dangers he withdrew the document; but he was finally expelled the college and his name struck off the books (25 October). On 11 November his fellowship was filled up. On 22 December he was included in the decree which disqualified all the expelled fellows of Magdalen from holding any ecclesiastical benefice.

After the abdication of James II Fairfax was restored to his fellowship (26 October 1689). A year later (23 October 1689) he was rewarded with the deanery of Norwich, and he died there on 2 May 1702, aged 68, being buried in the cathedral. He is one of the persons credited with the authorship of ''An Impartial Relation of the whole proceedings against St. Mary Magdalen Colledge in Oxon.... in 1687'' (1688), usually claimed for [[Charles Aldworth]], vice-president of the college.

'''Oracle Hyperion Planning''' is a budgeting and forecasting application that aims at improving business predictability. It used to be owned by [[Hyperion Solutions Corporation]], which was purchased by [[Oracle Corporation]] in March 2007. Oracle Hyperion Planning uses [[Essbase]] (a [[multidimensional database]] product sold by [[Hyperion Solutions Corporation|Hyperion]]) as a database and calculation engine, a relational repository for business logic, and includes a [[web-based]] [[user interface]].

The software itself is a collection of [[JavaServer Pages]] and [[Java Servlets]] that provide a web interface, as part of an [[N-tier]] architecture: a [[relational database]] ([[Microsoft SQL Server]], [[IBM DB2]] or [[Oracle database]]), [[Java EE]] [[servlet container]] ([[Apache Tomcat]], [[IBM]] [[WebSphere]], [[BEA Weblogic]] or [[Oracle Application Server]]), and the [[Essbase]] server itself make up a full installation of the product.

'''IPS Supported Employment''' is an [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] approach to [[supported employment]] for people who have a  mental illness. IPS stands for '''Individual Placement and Support'''. IPS supports people in their efforts to achieve steady, meaningful employment in mainstream competitive jobs, either part-time or full-time. This stands in contrast to other vocational rehabilitation approaches that employ people in [[sheltered workshop]]s and other set-aside jobs.

IPS has been extensively researched and proven to be effective compared to standard employment services.&lt;ref name="Bond_2008"/&gt;

== Principles ==
IPS is based on eight principles.&lt;ref name="Bond_2004"/&gt; Mental health agencies that implement IPS aim to follow these principles in delivering vocational services.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  || IPS Principles
|-
| &amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp; || Every person with severe mental illness who wants to work is eligible for IPS supported employment.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp; || Employment services are integrated with mental health treatment services.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp; || Competitive employment is the goal.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp; || Personalized benefits counseling is provided.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp; || The job search starts soon after a person expresses interest in working.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp; || Employment specialists systematically develop relationships with employers based upon their client's preferences.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp; || Job supports are continuous.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp; || Client preferences are honored.
|}

The implementation of these principles can be assessed by using a [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ips/page19/page21/files/se-fidelity-scale002c-2008.pdf fidelity scale] and an accompanying [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ips/page19/page49/page49.html manual] that have been developed specifically for IPS.

== Research ==
IPS was first studied in a [[randomized controlled trial]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="Drake_1996"/&gt; Between 1996 and 2011, IPS was evaluated in 15 randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref name="Drake_2011"/&gt; This research has established IPS as an [[evidence-based practice]] in community psychiatry. Studies in this body of research typically compare IPS to another approach to vocational rehabilitation. Study participants are randomized to receive services from one of the vocational approaches being studied. Researchers observe the proportion of participants in each group who get jobs within some fixed period of time. This follow-up period varies across studies from 6 months to 30 months, averaging 18 months.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011_b"/&gt; On average, 60% of research participants get a competitive job during the follow-up period when they receive IPS, whereas 24% of participants get a competitive job when receiving other vocational services.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011_b" /&gt; These results, along with data from non-research implementations of IPS, have resulted in the establishment of benchmark employment rates for IPS programs.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011_b" /&gt;

In addition to testing the [[Comparative effectiveness research|comparative effectiveness]] of IPS, researchers have conducted [[implementation research]] on IPS,&lt;ref name="Bond_2008_b"/&gt; research on predictors of outcome (who gets jobs and why),&lt;ref name="Bond_2008_c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salkever_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michon_2005"/&gt; barriers to employment for people who have a serious mental illness,&lt;ref name="Biegel_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbiere_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McQuilken_2003"/&gt; and a number of other [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~charky1/page40/page23/files/voc-pubs.11-11.pdf related areas.]

== What happens in IPS ==
IPS services are typically delivered by supported employment teams that operate within [[Community mental health service|community mental health agencies]]. These teams work with their agency's clinical staff to coordinate services. When a client at the agency expresses interest in working, that client is referred to an employment specialist on the IPS team for an initial meeting. The employment specialist works with the client to learn about his or her goals and preferences and provides information about how IPS works. When someone chooses to enroll in IPS, that person and the employment specialist make a plan together and begin to look for regular jobs in the community as soon as the client expresses interest in doing so. Employment specialists are trained to provide people with support, coaching, resume development, interview training, and on-the-job support. Employment specialists are also trained to do job development; a process in which employment specialists build relationships with employers in businesses that have jobs that are consistent with client preferences.

In IPS, the client's preferences are central. The client decides whether or not employers and potential employers know about her/his mental illness and whether or not the employment specialist will talk to employer/s on his or her behalf. The client also decides which jobs to apply for and how much he or she wants to work. The decision about how much to work is often influenced by a desire to transition to a working life while minimizing the risk of being both out of work and without disability benefits. Part of the employment specialist's job is to connect people with benefits counseling so that they can make informed decisions in this area.

People who try IPS often get a number of jobs before finding one that is a good fit. In IPS there is an orientation towards moving between jobs as part of a normal process. This process aims at convergence towards stable employment and toward the client's personal [[Recovery model|recovery]] goals.

==Access to IPS Services==
As of 2009 only 2.1% of U.S. mental health clients had access to evidence-based vocational services.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA_2009"/&gt; Mental health agencies often face financing challenges in implementing IPS due to the absence of clear reimbursement policies for vocational services in psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Drake_2009"/&gt; Nonetheless, as of 2011, IPS was offered by mental health agencies in at least 13 states.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011"/&gt; Because there is no national directory of IPS providers, people interested in access to these services must ask local mental health services providers about their vocational services in order to find out whether or not evidence-based vocational services are available.

== Dissemination ==
The [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ips/page3/page10/page10.html Johnson &amp; Johnson – Dartmouth Community Mental Health Program] was created to further the dissemination of IPS by providing a structure for supporting implementations of IPS at the state level. In 2001, the [http://prc.dartmouth.edu/ Dartmouth Psychiatric Research Center] launched this program with philanthropic support from [http://www.jnj.com/connect/caring/corporate-giving/ Johnson &amp; Johnson Corporate Contributions]. This program has resulted in the formation of a national learning collaborative that supports the implementation of IPS services in everyday (i.e., non-research) settings. Membership in this collaborative is widespread. As of 2011, 13 states containing 130 participating mental health agencies were part of the collaborative.&lt;ref name="Becker_2011"/&gt; States that enter the learning collaborative receive four years of seed funding to support initial implementation efforts. After this first phase, states and their participating agencies stay involved by sharing outcome and service data, participating in research projects, and by continuing statewide implementation efforts.

== IPS outside of the United States ==
Although IPS was developed in the United States, research literature suggests a wider interest in IPS and suggests that the intervention is effective across a range of cultures and policy environments. Randomized trials of IPS have been conducted in Canada,&lt;ref name="Latimer_2006"/&gt; throughout Europe,&lt;ref name="Burns_2007"/&gt; including in the UK, in Australia,&lt;ref name="Killackey_2008"/&gt; The Netherlands,&lt;ref name="Michon_2011"/&gt; Switzerland,&lt;ref name="Hoffman_2011"/&gt; and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Wong_2008"/&gt;

In the UK, Centre for Mental Health has developed a Centres of Excellence project based on the Dartmouth Medical School scheme. The Centres will act as exemplars of how Individual Placement and Support (IPS) can be implemented in localities across England. http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/employment/ips.aspx

[[John F. Kennedy Jr.]] was an American lawyer, journalist, magazine publisher, and the son of [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. On the evening of July 16, 1999, Kennedy died when the airplane he was flying crashed into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], approximately {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} west of [[Martha's Vineyard]], Massachusetts. Kennedy's wife, [[Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy|Carolyn Bessette]], and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, were also on board and died. The [[Piper Saratoga]] light aircraft had departed from New Jersey's [[Essex County Airport]], and its intended route was along the coastline of [[Connecticut]] and across [[Rhode Island Sound]] to [[Martha's Vineyard Airport]].

The official investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) concluded that Kennedy fell victim to [[spatial disorientation]] while he was descending over water at night and consequently lost control of his plane. Kennedy did not hold an [[instrument rating]] and therefore he was only certified to fly under [[visual flight rules]]. At the time of the crash, the weather and light conditions were such that all basic landmarks were obscured, making visual flight challenging, although legally still permissible.

== Background ==
On the evening of July 16, 1999, [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]] piloted a [[Piper Saratoga]] to attend the wedding of his cousin, [[Rory Kennedy|Rory]], to [[Mark Bailey (writer)|Mark Bailey]]. The plane also carried Kennedy's wife, [[Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy|Carolyn Bessette]], and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette. Kennedy had purchased his plane three months before the crash.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bessette sisters were seated in the second row of seats, which faced the rear of the plane and were back-to-back with the pilot's seat.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight===
Kennedy checked in with the air traffic control tower at [[Martha's Vineyard Airport]] before his departure. At 8:38&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 16, Kennedy departed from [[New Jersey]]'s [[Essex County Airport]], {{convert|21|mi|km}} west of [[Midtown Manhattan]]. At about 9:41&amp;nbsp;p.m., unknown until subsequent official investigations, Kennedy's plane crashed nearly nose first into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual&gt;{{cite web |title=Factual Report — NTSB ID:  NYC99MA178 |date=2000-07-06 |accessdate=2018-08-13 |website=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/GeneratePDF.aspx?id=NYC99MA178&amp;rpt=fa|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017041426/http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=20001212X19354&amp;key=1|archivedate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 10:05&amp;nbsp;p.m., the air traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard Airport had a clerical-duties summer intern contact the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) office in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]] about Kennedy's failure to arrive, but the intern was told that no information could be released to him over the phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-02-06-kennedy-crash-call_x.htm| title=Audio clip on JFK Jr.'s plane released|newspaper=[[USA Today]]| date=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coast Guard notified ===
At 2:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 17, the [[Kennedy family|Kennedy]]s reported to the [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod|local Coast Guard Air Station]] that the plane had not arrived. At 4 a.m., the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] began a search and rescue operation. Kennedy's cousin, [[Anthony Stanislas Radziwill]], told the press that if Kennedy was still alive, "He'll find a way to get out. He possesses the will to survive, enough will for all three of them."&lt;ref name=Heymann499&gt;Heymann, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials were not optimistic about finding Kennedy alive after several pieces of debris from his plane were recovered in the Atlantic Ocean. "There is always hope," Coast Guard Lt. Gary Jones said. "But unfortunately, when you find certain pieces of evidence, you have to be prepared for anything."&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;

=== President Clinton's response ===
President [[Bill Clinton]] spoke with Kennedy's older sister, [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]], and later called his paternal uncle, [[Ted Kennedy|Ted]]. Clinton also spoke to [[Andrew Cuomo]], who was married to Kennedy's cousin, [[Kerry Kennedy|Kerry]], at the time. "He wanted to let them know he was thinking about them, that we'll do everything we can, and that our prayers are with them", Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/jfkjr/stories/kennedy071899.htm|title=JFK Jr. Feared Dead in Plane Crash|date=July 18, 1999|publisher=Washington Post|first=Michael|last=Grunwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton ordered [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] warships to assist in the search for Kennedy's plane. Critics argued that the search was an abuse of taxpayer dollars, as no ordinary citizen would receive similar treatment.&lt;ref name="rites"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gellman |first=Barton|title=Kennedy, Bessette Sisters Given Shipboard Rites |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/jfkjr/stories/kennedy072399.htm |author2=Ferdinand, Pamela |date=1999-07-23|publisher=''Washington Post''|page=A1|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton said that afternoon that the Kennedys had "suffered much, and given more", and he also called for them to feel "the strength of God, the love of their friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens".

=== Debris and bodies recovered ===
On July 19, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] vessel ''[[NOAAS Rude (S 590)|Rude]]'' finally located fragments of Kennedy's plane using [[side-scan sonar]]. The ''Rude'' captured high-resolution images which were used to create a three-dimensional map of the ocean floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-07-22/news/9907220415_1_carolyn-bessette-kennedy-bessette-family-rep-patrick-kennedy|title=Divers Found Bodies|date=July 22, 1999|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 20, the salvage ship [[USNS Grasp (T-ARS-51)|USNS ''Grasp'' (T-ARS-51)]] identified the plane's fuselage.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/jfkjr/recovery.htm| title=John F.

On the afternoon of July 21, divers recovered the bodies of Kennedy and the Bessette sisters. Divers found the Bessette sisters were near the fuselage, while Kennedy himself was still strapped in his seat.&lt;ref name=Heymann499/&gt; Coast Guard Admiral Richard M.

MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) officially declared that Kennedy's plane had crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard; the probable cause of the crash was [[pilot error]]: "[Kennedy]'s failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation".&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual /&gt; Kennedy was not qualified to fly his plane by "instruments only". The crash occurred in conditions not legally requiring such qualification. Other pilots besides Kennedy flying similar routes on the night of the accident reported no visual horizon due to [[haze]].&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual/&gt;

=== Possible contributing factors ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
'''Haze and visibility'''

Atmospheric conditions along Kennedy's flight path on the night of the crash were occasionally hazy, which can lead to [[spatial disorientation]] for pilots. The weather was officially listed as "[[visual meteorological conditions]]" (VMC), which allowed Kennedy to fly under [[Visual Flight Rules]] (VFR) rather than [[Instrument Flight Rules]] (IFR), as he lacked an [[instrument rating]]. The visibility was very poor in Essex County, New Jersey, and airports along Kennedy's flight path reported visibilities between 5 and 8 miles with haze and a few clouds. Some pilots flying similar routes as Kennedy on the night of the accident reported no [[Visual flight|visual horizon]] over water because of haze. Also, the NTSB reported on one pilot who cancelled a similar flight that evening due to "poor" weather. The conditions near the crash site were: "Clear skies at or below 12,000 feet; visibility 10 miles".&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual/&gt;

'''Pilot experience'''

Kennedy first obtained his [[Private Pilot License|private pilot license]] in 1998, and received "high performance airplane" and "[[complex airplane]]" endorsements two months before the crash.&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual/&gt; His estimated total flight experience before the crash was about 310 hours, of which 55 hours were at night. His estimated flight time in the accident airplane was about 36 hours, of which about 9.4 hours were at night. Approximately 3 hours of that flight time were without a [[Certified Flight Instructor]] (CFI) on board, and only 48 minutes of that time was flown at night, which included a night landing.&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual/&gt;

It is not clear how much of his total flight experience was in the plane type that crashed or in Kennedy's other, more basic plane, the [[Cessna Skylane|Cessna Skylane 182]]. Fifteen months before the crash, Kennedy had flown about 35 flights either to or from northern New Jersey and the Martha's Vineyard area. Kennedy flew more than 17 of these legs without a CFI on board, including at least five at night. His last known flight in his airplane without a CFI on board happened two months before the crash.&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual/&gt;

'''Pilot training'''

The CFI who prepared Kennedy for his private pilot checkride stated that he had "very good" flying skills for his level of experience.&lt;ref name="Salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=JFK Jr.: The truth behind the crash|url=https://www.salon.com/2000/07/07/kennedy_13/|website=Salon, July 7, 2000|publisher=Salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months before the crash, Kennedy passed the FAA's written airplane instrument examination and later enrolled in an instrument rating course. He continued to receive flight instruction in New Jersey in his plane, including flights from CDW to MVY. His instructors said Kennedy required help working the [[rudder]] pedals to taxi and land the plane because of his ankle injury.&lt;ref name="Salon.com"/&gt;

During a training flight at night under [[Instrument meteorological conditions|instrument conditions]], his instructor stated that Kennedy had the ability to fly the airplane without a visible horizon but may have had difficulty performing additional tasks under such conditions. He also stated that the pilot was not ready for an instrument evaluation, and needed additional training. The instructor at the time of the crash was not aware that Kennedy would be flying in those conditions without an instructor on board. The CFI further stated that he had talked to Kennedy on the night of the accident and offered to fly with him that night. He stated that Kennedy had the capability to conduct a night flight to Martha's Vineyard as long as a visible horizon existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Safety Board Blames Pilot Error in Crash of Kennedy Plane|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/07/nyregion/safety-board-blames-pilot-error-in-crash-of-kennedy-plane.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychological stress'''

The NTSB suggested that Kennedy's marriage may have contributed to a source of stress by the time of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,90819,00.html Book Details John F. Kennedy, Jr., Carolyn Jeanne Bessette Marital Problems] [[Fox News]], 2003-07-01&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Kennedy's magazine, ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'', was in serious financial trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secrets and Lies|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/08/john-f-kennedy-jr-carolyn-bessette-divorce-drugs-scandal|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Aeronautical Information Manual]] (AIM): "stress from everyday living can impair pilot performance, often in subtle ways. Distractions can so interfere with judgment that unwarranted risks are taken, such as flying into deteriorating weather conditions to keep on schedule."

'''Pilot distraction'''

From 8:49&amp;nbsp;p.m., about 10 minutes after departure, and for a 5 minute period lasting until 8:54&amp;nbsp;p.m., Kennedy's plane flew in the same vicinity as [[American Airlines]] Flight 1484, a [[Fokker 100]], which was on approach to [[Westchester County Airport]] (HPN).&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual/&gt; The [[Traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS) sounded on the Fokker 100, leading to some discussion between the Fokker and the New York approach controller (ATC). However, the interaction ended with American Airlines Flight 1484 reporting to ATC that they believe the other plane was a Piper and that the TCAS warning was resolved. No corrective action was reported to have been taken by ATC nor American Airlines Flight 1484.&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual/&gt; It is not known if Kennedy was aware of, or distracted by, the incident.

'''Late departure'''

The flight was originally scheduled for daylight hours, but had to be postponed after Kennedy's sister-in-law was delayed at work. Heavy traffic further delayed Kennedy's flight and pushed it back until after dark. Originally planned to depart at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Kennedy's plane departed at 8:39&amp;nbsp;p.m. instead, nearly a half-hour past sunset. At the time of the takeoff, the moon was just above the horizon and provided very little illumination.

'''No flight plan or request for help'''

Kennedy never received a weather briefing or filed a [[flight plan]] with any [[Flight Service Station]]. Except for the take-off portion of his flight, Kennedy did not contact any air traffic controllers; during the flight, he never requested help or declared an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN0722279520070208 John F. Kennedy Jr.'s last radio comments were routine], 2007-02-07&lt;/ref&gt; Under the conditions of his flight, Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan, and because he did not, no one knew his exact route or expected time of his arrival. According to the Weather Service International, as reported in the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, Kennedy made two weather requests before taking off. The information he was provided indicated that visibility ranged from 10 miles along his route to four miles at Martha's Vineyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/about/employment/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20001212X19354&amp;ntsbno=NYC99MA178&amp;akey=1|website=National Transportation Safety Board|title=National Transportation Safety Board Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flight over featureless, open water'''

Shortly after passing [[Point Judith, Rhode Island]], Kennedy's plane headed directly towards Martha's Vineyard. Instead of following the coastline of [[Rhode Island Sound]] and [[Buzzards Bay]], which would have provided visible lights on the ground, Kennedy chose the shorter, direct path over a 30-mile (50&amp;nbsp;km) open stretch of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="We dared to think that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair"|url=http://www.thedailyobserver.ca/2012/07/19/we-dared-to-think-that-this-john-kennedy-would-live-to-comb-gray-hair|publisher=The Daily Observer|date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook, crossing large bodies of water at night may be very hazardous, not only from the standpoint of ditching in the water, but also because the featureless horizon visually blends with the water, in which case [[depth perception]] and [[Spatial disorientation|orientation]] become difficult.

'''Foot injury'''

Six weeks before the crash, Kennedy had fractured his left ankle in a [[paragliding]] accident over the Memorial Day weekend. He had surgery and wore a cast which was removed just the day before the fatal flight. He still walked with a limp on the day of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carolyn's Terrible Premonition – She Told Saks Girl She Dreaded Flying That Night |url=https://nypost.com/1999/07/22/car0lyns-terrible-prem0niti0n-she-told-saks-girl-she-dreaded-flying-that-night/ |publisher=The New York Post |date=July 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his interviews, Kennedy's orthopaedic surgeon stated that, at the time of the crash, he would have been able to apply the type of pressure that would normally be required to drive a car.

'''Incorrect radio frequencies'''

While the NTSB examined the wreckage, they soon discovered that both of Kennedy's radios had incorrect frequencies selected. Kennedy had accidentally selected 127.25 for Martha Vineyard's [[Automatic Terminal Information Service|ATIS]] instead of 126.25; likewise, he selected 135.25 for Essex County ATIS, but it should have been 135.5. The NTSB declined to comment on the contribution this factor had in the crash, if any.&lt;ref name=NTSB.Factual/&gt;

==Aftermath==
On the morning of July 22, relatives brought the cremated remains of Kennedy onto the {{USS|Briscoe|DD-977|6}}. His ashes were later scattered into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[Martha's Vineyard]].&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gellman |first=Barton|title=Kennedy, Bessettes Given Shipboard Rites |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/jfkjr/stories/kennedy072399.htm  |author2=Ferdinand, Pamela |date=1999-07-23|newspaper=Washington Post|pages=A1| accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was used for the public memorial service with the permission of [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]].&lt;ref name="rites" /&gt; ''Briscoe'' spent about half an hour off the Vineyard's southwest coast. She was two or three miles away from the crash site.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-07-22/news/9907230127_1_carolyn-bessette-kennedy-lisa-ann-bessette-dr-richard-freeman|title=Loved Ones Say Farewell|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=July 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Bill Clinton]] ordered that the flags at the [[White House]] be lowered to [[half-staff]] to honor Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clintons, Kennedy family fly to New York for JFK Jr. Mass |date=July 23, 1999 |accessdate=August 2, 2016 |website=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/07/23/jfk.memorial/}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a public memorial service for Kennedy, his paternal uncle, [[Ted Kennedy|Ted]], stated:

{{quote|We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But, like [[John F. Kennedy|his father]], he had every gift but length of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/EMK/Tribute+to+John+F.+Kennedy+Junior.htm |title=Tribute to John F.

Kennedy's last will and testament, signed 18 months before his death, stipulated that all of his personal belongings, property, and holdings were to be "evenly distributed" among his two nieces, [[Rose Kennedy Schlossberg|Rose]] and Tatiana, and nephew, [[John Schlossberg|John]], who were among 14 beneficiaries in the will.&lt;ref name="Heymann499" /&gt;

== Popular culture ==
Episodes of the two Canadian series, ''[[Final 24]]'' and ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Air Disasters]]'', both explore the details of Kennedy's life and death, and the events surrounding the plane crash.

'''Lawrence Lewis "Larry" Shenfield''' (October 5, 1891 &amp;ndash; October 9, 1974) was an [[advertising]] executive who was instrumental in promoting the development of [[radio broadcasting]] during its golden age of the 1920s and 1930s.  Larry lined up sponsors to help further the popularity of such stars as [[Orson Welles]] and [[Dinah Shore]].  After his retirement, Larry developed a second career as a prominent [[philatelist]] internationally recognized in the field of [[postal history]].&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]] 10 Oct 1974 "Lawrence L. Shenfield, 83; Philatelists and Ad Executive"&lt;/ref&gt;  His careful studies of the [[postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States]] are relied upon by [[stamp collectors]] and experts in [[philately]] to the present day.

== Background and business career ==
[[File:Lawrence L Shenfield and Dinah Shore.jpg|thumb|[[Dinah Shore]] with Lawrence Shenfield]]
Mr. Shenfield was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Births Reported in October 1891 | publisher = Brooklyn Genealogy Information Page | url = http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Birth/1891/1891.OctBirth.html | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his undergraduate degree in architecture in 1914 from [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] and served in the U.S. Army during [[World War I]], having undergone [[artillery]] training in [[Plattsburgh]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Plattsburg, New York Training Camp, 1917 | publisher = New River Notes | url = http://www.newrivernotes.com/ww1/plattsburg.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, Shenfield worked in New York as an architect for [[Eggers &amp; Higgins]] and designed a number of buildings in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]].  

Subsequently, Shenfield left architecture for the rapidly growing field of radio and television advertising.  He worked for the advertising firm Pedlar &amp; Ryan, where he handled advertising and public relations for radio broadcasts by [[Orson Welles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilson | first = Jeff | title = "A New Kind of Radio Program": Orson Welles (Lady Esther) | publisher = WellesNet.com | url = http://www.wellesnet.com/R_LE_OV.htm | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Shenfield became a principal in the advertising firm Doherty, Clifford, Steers &amp; Shenfield.  In 1939, Shenfield became acquainted with [[Dinah Shore]] and was instrumental in launching her career by promoting the nationwide [[CBS]] radio program, ''Ben Bernie's Orchestra'' as well as the [[NBC]] Radio program [[The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street]].  In 1965, Shenfield retired after Doherty, Clifford, Steers &amp; Shenfield merged with Maurice H. Needham Co., forming the predecessor of the [[Omnicom Group]], one of the world's largest advertising holding companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Omnicom Group Inc. | publisher = FundingUniverse.com| url = http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Omnicom-Group-Inc-Company-History.html | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Shenfield returned briefly from retirement to provide support for Doherty, Clifford, Steers &amp; Shenfield's and [[Merck &amp; Co.]]'s lawsuit against the [[Federal Trade Commission]] concerning truth and fairness in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Doherty, Clifford, Steers &amp; Shenfield, Inc., Petitioner, v.

== Philatelic career ==

Shenfield was a prominent expert, collector and writer of [[philatelic literature]] on [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[philately]].  In 1942, he published a pamphlet on [[Prisoner of War]] and [[Flag of Truce]] mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tear Sheets | publisher = Stamps4Collectors.com | url = http://www.stamps4collectors.com/tearsheets/s1.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shenfield subsequently was active in the [[Collectors Club of New York]] and numerous [[philatelic]] congresses. At the 1946 Philatelic Congress, Shenfield presented ''Letter Unpaid Marking of Louisville, Kentucky''.&lt;ref name="pbbooks"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hartmann | first = Leonard H. | title = Books on Philately: Confederate States of America | publisher = pbbooks.com | url = http://pbbooks.com/csa.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, the Confederate Stamp Alliance awarded Shenfield the Haydn Myer Award in recognition of his distinguished service to the Alliance.&lt;ref name="Confederate Stamp Alliance"&gt;{{cite web | title = A concise history of the Confederate Stamp Alliance | publisher = The Confederate Stamp Alliance | url = http://www.csalliance.org/csa-1.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080623230509/http://www.csalliance.org/csa-1.htm | archivedate = 2008-06-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, along with F. Van Dyk MacBride, Shenfield co-chaired the editorial board for the Dietz Confederate Catalog and Handbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = APS Hall of Fame 1960-1964 | publisher = [[American Philatelic Society]] | year = 1999 | url = http://www.stamps.org/almanac/alm_halloffame_1960-64.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shenfield's most widely known book on [[Confederate States postal history]], ''Confederate States of America, The Special Postal Routes'', was published in 1961.&lt;ref name="pbbooks"/&gt; The book is generally known as the best single source for the various special postal operations of the [[Confederate States of America]] and is regarded as a major reference work in the area of Confederate [[philately]] by prominent philatelic [[auction]] houses, [[stamp collectors]] and [[philatelists]].&lt;ref name="pbbooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Major Reference Books | publisher = Robert A.

Shenfield died in 1974 and is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)]], New York. After his death, Shenfield's surviving sons, James Philip Shenfield and Lawrence Walker Shenfield, sold Shenfield's collection of Confederate stamps and [[philatelic cover]]s at [[public auction]] through H.R. Harmer in New York City. Each year, Shenfield's essay on Confederate postal usage and routes is included in the introduction to Confederate States stamps in the [[Scott catalogue]].

'''Ljubljana Stock Exchange''' or '''LJSE''' ({{lang-sl|Ljubljanska borza}} {{IPA-sh|ljubljanska boɾza|}}) is a [[stock exchange]] located in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]]. It is Slovenia's only stock exchange. The exchange trades shares of Slovenian companies, as well as bonds and [[commercial paper]]s. The only [[stockholder]] of the ''Ljubljana Stock Exchange'' is [[Zagreb Stock Exchange]].

==About the Ljubljana Stock Exchange==

The core business of the Ljubljana stock exchange is to ensure a secure, efficient and successful operation of the regulated segment of the Slovene capital market, in accordance with the law and other regulations.

LJSE performs the following business activities: 
* operates the stock exchange market in financial instruments, for which it had obtained authorization from the Agency,
* provides the prices of financial instruments,
* provides information on supply and demand, market values and other data on financial instruments,
* provides technical services to support trading,
* operates a CSI.

Additional activities include the services for trading members and listed companies.

==History==

The existing Ljubljana Stock Exchange was established in 1989. However, brokerage in Slovenia has a much longer tradition: the first stock exchange in Ljubljana existed as early as in the period between 1924 and 1942. Unfortunately, during the Second World War the trading on the old exchange was suspended, and after the war also officially banned by a decree by the new communist regime which replaced monarchy in Yugoslavia. Slovenians were thus left without a stock exchange for almost half a century. Then in the 1989 the Ljubljana Stock Exchange was officially established. In the year 1993 LJSE introduced electronic trading on BTS - on complex Stock Exchange Information System three times a week, floor trading still remained on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The new system of electronic information dissemination - SEOnet was launched in year 2002. Three years later LJSE introduced the elite segment of the official market, listing Slovenia's prime companies, and named it Prime Market. In the middle of the year 2008 the first regional road-show of SE Europe, organized by all 8 exchanges from the region, was held in Zagreb. In the same year Vienna Stock Exchange became the new majority owner of the LJSE (it acquired an 83.34% share). Year 2009 was crucial for establishment of '''"[[CEE Stock Exchange Group]]"''' (CEESEG), which at the time comprised the [[Vienna Stock Exchange]] and the stock exchanges of Budapest, Ljubljana and Prague. In the year 2010 there were a lot of important events: The SBITOP Index as the first genuine LJSE blue-chip index became a benchmark index, LJSE launched INFO HRAMBA - the new information system for the central storage of regulated information of all issuers on the LJSE, LJSE published the Slovene Capital Market Development Strategy, which had been prepared in cooperation with the capital market participants and was the answer to the changed economic and financial circumstances in the previous two years, LJSE proposed the introduction of 'P accounts' in the third pension pillar, LJSE started trading on the international trading system Xetra® and thus became integrated into the international capital market. As of July 2015 Ljubljana Stock Exchange is owned by Zagreb Stock Exchange. On 22 February 2016, the Ljubljana Stock Exchange, along with the [[Belgrade Stock Exchange]], decided to join SEE Link, and [[EBRD]]-sponsored regional network for trading securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkanews.org/index.php/2016/02/22/serbia-slovenia-stock-exchanges-to-join-regional-platform/ |title=Serbia, Slovenia stock exchanges to join regional platform |work=Reuters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304152239/http://www.balkanews.org/index.php/2016/02/22/serbia-slovenia-stock-exchanges-to-join-regional-platform/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading==

Trading on the Ljubljana Stock Exchange operates through an electronic order book in the Xetra® trading system. Xetra® trading system was implemented at the Ljubljana Stock Exchange on December 6, 2010. The Slovene capital market is now more easily accessible, internationally comparable and competitive market.
The exchange has pre-market sessions from 08:00am to 09:30am and normal trading sessions from 09:30am to 01:00pm on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the Exchange in advance.
On the basis of meeting the LJSE liquidity criteria, securities are traded in the '''continuous''' or '''auction''' trading methods.

The two trading methods ensure greater market integrity, improve best-price-forming mechanisms, and enable the Exchange and its members to set up internal controls and thus help identify potential cases of market manipulation.

===Stock indices===

'''SBI TOP''' is the first genuine LJSE blue-chip index and serves as the Slovene capital market benchmark index. It measures the performance of the most liquid and highly capitalized stocks on the LJSE Market. It is designed as a tradable index. Due to the liquidity of the constituents, it is intended to serve as underlying for index-linked financial instruments.

During the 1920s, he was nicknamed "Lizz" Elizalde, playing the [[clarinet]] and the [[saxophone]] alongside his brother Fred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/manuel-lizz-elizalde-mn0001484139|title=Manuel "Lizz" Elizalde biography|first=Eugene|last=Chadbourne|work=AllMusic|date=|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born into a respected family in the New Hampshire town of [[Rindge, New Hampshire|Rindge]], specifically to [[naturalist]] and [[Harvard Medical School]] professor Dr. Charles Eliot Ware ("a leading physician in Boston"&lt;ref name="mfa.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-british-fleet-forming-a-line-off-algiers-32602|title=The British Fleet Forming a Line off Algiers|date=2018-03-16|work=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and his wife Elizabeth in 1858, Mary Lee Ware was an avid nature-lover and lived according to the precept "It is more blessed to give than to receive."&lt;ref name=hale&gt;Hale, Emily.

Beauty that ranged from the picturesque landscape to the language which she quickly excelled, to the art for which the country is famous. This is no surprise given that her father, Dr. Charles Ware (Harvard class of 1834&lt;ref name="Charles Eliot Ware"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-20021531|title=Charles Eliot Ware|date=1887-05-01|publisher=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|others=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while not a botanist himself raised his daughter to love botany with a passion.

The "ever-loyal and ever-generous"&lt;ref name=daston /&gt; Mary Lee Ware and her mother were drawn into the Glass Flowers enterprise in 1886 when her former teacher, Professor George Goodale, approached them with his idea to populate the new Botanical Museum (of which he was the first director) with Blaschka glass specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/140881/1999/09/01/research/flowers-out-glass|title=Flowers Out of Glass {{!}} Penn State University|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being independently wealthy and (already) liberal benefactors of Harvard's botany department,&lt;ref&gt;Flowers that never fade / Franklin Baldwin Wiley.

Furthermore, the report notes that the activity of the Blaschka "has been greatly increased by their exclusive devotion to a single a single line of work."&lt;ref&gt;Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891, pp. 160-163 - https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427018526$1i&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1889, Leopold made and gifted a bouquet of glass flowers to the Wares which, at some later date, was given to Harvard and is now part of the Glass Flowers exhibit.&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;Harvard University Herbaria and Botany Libraries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossi-Wilcox, Susan M.

[[File:Glass Flowers gift-bouquet.jpg|thumb|right|Glass Flowers gift-bouquet]]
Early in the making of the Glass Flowers, Mary Lee Ware engaged in correspondence with Professor Goodale regarding the making of the collection, one of which contained a remark of Leopold's regarding the false rumor that secret methods were used in the making of the Glass Flowers: ''"Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation. The only way to become a glass modeler of skill, I have often said to people, is to get a good great-grandfather who loved glass."''
Miss Ware is also known to have visited the Blaschka home/studio three times, the first in 1899 along with Prof. Goodale, Mrs Goodale and their son Francis. By this time Mary was the sole benefactress of the Blaschkas, as her mother, Elizabeth C. Ware, had died the previous year (1898&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi/page/gr/%3Chttp://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=148054012|title=Elizabeth Cabot Lee Ware (1819-1898) - Find A...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;). During the course of these visits she became very great friends with Rudolf and his wife Frieda, and, on one occasion, Rudolf wrote to Mary L. Ware regarding his vision of how the Flowers should be displayed: ''"I think pure white sheets will do best as bestow good light to the whole room. The models will look best either on pure white or a deep velvet-black."''&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear, Anne Collins, and Weitekamp, Margaret A. Analyzing Art and Aesthetics. Artefacts: Studies in the History of Science and Technology; v. 9. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A preference Harvard evidently agreed with as, to this day, the botanical model are wired down to pure white boards within the original (albeit [http://www.secondlife.net/ refurbished]) cases.
Regardless, Mary's second visit was around 1908 and the third on October 3, 1928. This second visit, made after Leopold's death, was related via a letter from Miss Ware to the second director of the Botanical Museum, Professor [[Oakes Ames (botanist)|Oakes Ames]].&lt;ref name=schultes /&gt; This letter appears to confirm the previous statement of Leopold's regarding his son; Miss Ware writes, ''"One change in the character of his work and, consequently in the time necessary to accomplish results since I was last here, is very noteworthy. At that time...he bought most of his glass and was just beginning to make some, and his finish was in paint. Now he himself makes a large part of the glass and all the enamels, which he powders to use as paint."''&lt;ref name=daston /&gt; This missive to Professor Ames was published in January 9, 1961 by the [[Harvard University Herbaria]] - Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University Vol. 19, No. 6 - under the title "How Were The Glass Flowers Made?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ware|first=Mary Lee|last2=S.|first2=R. E.|date=1961|title=HOW WERE THE GLASS FLOWERS MADE?|jstor=41762212|journal=Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University|volume=19|issue=6|pages=125–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to funding and visiting, Mary took a fairly active role in the project's progress, going so far as to personally unpack each model&lt;ref name=ware /&gt; and making arrangements for Rudolph's fieldwork in the U.S. and Jamaica&lt;ref name=ware /&gt; – the purpose of such trips being to gather and study various plant specimens before returning to the old style Bohemian lamp-working table at which he (and Leopold) worked.

It is also known that, in 1898, Mary Lee Ware was made a member of the Committee of Overseers on the Botanic Garden and the Botanic Museum - an addition that was met with pleasure by its members, including Professor Goodale. Indeed, Miss Ware's "generous gifts of money and time for the advancement of the Department...[were] already known from the previous [Harvard] Annual Reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reports of the President and the Treasurer of Harvard College|date=1898–1899|publisher=Harvard University|page=4622|url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/viewtext/2574409?n=4622&amp;s=4&amp;printThumbnails=no|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon her death in 1937, Miss Ware left a will with assets worth one million dollars, $600,000 of which she bequeathed on charity and education. Of this vast sum, a full half of it (the largest single bequest in her will) was given to Harvard for completion and the upkeep of the Glass Flowers (as well as support Rudolf and Frieda).&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/45694008/|title=Fitchburg Sentinel from Fitchburg, Massachusetts on January 15, 1937 · Page 1|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ware Farm and agricultural work==
[[File:Ware farm.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The Ware family farm in Rindge NH]]
Although her mother remained in Boston, Mary Lee Ware clearly considered herself a New Hampshirite and apparently maintained the West Rindge family farm of her childhood.  However, she is almost always called Miss Mary Lee Ware of Boston; very rarely is Rindge, NH mentioned. Reportedly (per the majority of sources) she was a seasonal resident of both Massachusetts and New Hampshire, spending the summers at the Ware Farm in Rindge while wintering in Boston with her mother.&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt; The Ware Farm was sold to Mary's father, Dr. Ware, by a Joseph Davis and Dorestos Armory for $3000 in 1868 – the place having 450 total acres, 21.5 dedicated to pasture land with another 56.5 for cultivation.&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt; Housing from two to forty people (mostly hired hands), the place was spared from a massive tornado that, on September 13, 1928, hit West Rindge. Enduring for twenty minutes, the disaster leveled the land and resulted in a $100,000 loss for the town. Thankfully, "the beautiful Mary Lee Ware estate proper was not damaged," yet the estate workers' homes suffered via falling trees. Her estate manager, William S. Cleaves, fled his truck - to the relative safety of his home - in the nick of time, just before a falling tree crushed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=gendisasters|title=West Rindge, NH Tornado, Sept 1928|url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/new-hampshire/15064/west-rindge-nh-tornado-sept-1928|website=GenDisasters.com|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years earlier, in 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Charles Eliot Ware |journal= Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences |volume= 23 |issue= 2 |pages= 346–347 |date= May 1888 |jstor= 20021531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Eliot Ware"/&gt; and 1898 respectively, the farm saw the death of both Miss Ware's parents, Dr. Charles Eliot and Elizabeth C. Ware, making Mary the sole heiress of the estate. Later, in 1931, the Ware farm was the location of her cousin Cordelia E. Ware's wedding (specifically, Cordelia was Mary L. Ware's first cousin once removed on her father's side - the child of his first cousin John Ware).&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;

Under Mary Lee Ware's strict but kind jurisdiction the farm blossomed, so to speak, with Miss Ware expanding it to a scale beyond that of what her parents enjoyed. Between 1898 (the year of her mother's death) and 1936 (a year before she died), she wired the entire farm for electricity, built gardens, all-season greenhouses, equipment barns, and a dairy and ice-house, purchased the neighboring Carr Farm and acreage (later the Ruth Morris Farm) which extends Ware Farm to the eastern shore of Pool Pond (approx. 500 acres), established a water system, and maintained a large-scale chicken operation on the acquired Carr Farm.&lt;ref name="hoofandclaw.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoofandclaw.org/ware/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311164611/http://www.hoofandclaw.org/ware/ |archivedate=2016-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Farm was known to be "an outstanding showplace with Jersey cows, poultry, a piggery, sheep, and Irish Settlers, all purebred...in 1911, her three foundation cows and a bull were imported from the Isle of Jersey."&lt;ref&gt;The Artist in Monadnock Farmyards by Ann Sawyer (9780557721603; Lulu.com), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Her affection for the family and its many non-family residents is illustrated by the fact that, upon her death, Mary's will designated funds to keep the farm and her "farm family" together for one full year.&lt;ref name="hoofandclaw.org"/&gt;

===Legacy===
It is known that, by at least 1913, Miss Ware was a member of the [[New Hampshire Horticultural Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report, Vols. 5-8, by New Hampshire Horticultural Society, 1913, page 107&lt;/ref&gt; The Grange Hall in Rindge was also named after her — the Mary L. Ware Grange Hall — doubtless in tribute to her many agricultural contributions; and, in addition, a Mary L. Ware Park was established in West Rindge.&lt;ref name="hoofandclaw.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annual report of the Town of Rindge New Hampshire 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Sadly, in 1957, the Hall was bought and converted into the Ed’s Country Auction House by Mr. Edward Gilman "Ed" Stevens.&lt;ref name="hoofandclaw.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edward Gilman "Ed" Stevens|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/unionleader/obituary.aspx?n=edward-gilman-stevens-ed&amp;pid=150782875|accessdate=15 January 2016|work=New Hampshire Union Leader|date=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward G.

Cole|url=|website=SentinelSource.com|publisher=SentinelSource.com|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding her will, Mary left $25000 to her Boston and West Rindge employees.&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt; As to the Ware Farm itself, it was given to "certain relatives and their children"&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt; but eventually passed out of the family's hands.

However, the Ware Farm remains in active use today. "In 2002 Steve and Beverly Lindell purchased the property, resurrected the Ware Farm name, and have since tended and cherished the property in a manner complimentary to its heritage: original buildings are lovingly preserved; the flower gardens are spellbinding and constantly abuzz with pollinators; horses roam and graze the pastures; it's forest is managed in conservation through the Monadnock Conservancy. The farm presently consists of 230 acres, the majority on the east side of Woodbound Road, matching closely the original Ware Farm footprint."&lt;ref name="hoofandclaw.org"/&gt; Today the farm is the home-base of [http://www.hoofandclaw.org/#intro ''HOOF&amp;CLAW''] - a training and consultation center for dog handling and horsemanship - as well as the home of Blaine Capone, HOOF&amp;CLAW's founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hoofandclaw.org/about/#bio|title=MISSION|website=BESOTORO|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Capone, in turn, continues to honor the legacy and philanthropic spirit of Miss Ware, insofar as her deep love of nature went, working with HOOF&amp;CLAW to preserve the environment and inspire solutions to environmental issues.

==Community involvement==
As a Philanthropist of many interests, Mary Lee Ware contributed in other many and varied ways to the States of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. However, though "well known locally in NH and Boston for charitable works, she often kept her donations anonymous from the public."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eraven.franklinpierce.edu/academicshowcase/2017/marulli.htm|title=Marulli: Academic Showcase|website=eraven.franklinpierce.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts===
Aside from the Glass Flower enterprise, Mary Lee Ware supported Harvard University in other ways, donating four table cases to the Economic Room&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reports of the President and the Treasurer of Harvard College|date=1929–1930|publisher=Harvard University|page=245|url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/viewtext/2582401?n=245&amp;s=4&amp;printThumbnails=no|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with various sums of money for research and preservation purposes, as is evidenced in various Harvard Treasurer's Statements. In addition, she was one of early anthropologist [[Frederic Ward Putnam]] of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] many wealthy donors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Correspondences between her and Putnam reveals that Miss Ware provided a significant amount of money for America’s first preserved archaeological site in 1886: [[Serpent Mound]] in Ohio, along with Putnam’s other later archaeological endeavors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Between 1928 and her death (1937), Miss Ware sent a short letter to John Templeton Coolidge regarding a set of [[spur]]s she found among her cousin Mr. Hall's books. Spurs which, she speculated, were worn by famed [[historian]] [[Francis Parkman]] during his expedition he ''[[The Oregon Trail (book)|The Oregon Trail]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.masshist.org/blog/1469|title=Massachusetts Historical Society: the Beehive|website=www.masshist.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main body of the letter to Mr. Coolidge reads "''The spurs I found among Mr. Hall’s army outfit, labelled “F.P.[”] as you see, and we wondered if by any chance they could have been worn by Mr. Parkman on his “Oregon Trail” journey. It is of course only a guess, but certainly F.P. could only mean Mr. Parkman and Miss Lizzie might have given them to Mr. Hall as a keep-sake. If they were his, possibly your son Jack would like them. If not, you can of course do as you please with them.''" Miss Ware's cousin, this Mr. Hall, is presumed to be [[Henry Ware Hall]] seeing as he shared an uncle with Francis Parkman: "Edward Brooks Hall—the same Hall who had married Mary Lee Ware’s aunt Harriet. So Henry, Francis, and Mary were all first cousins." Mary Lee Ware sent the letter to Mr. Coolidge because he was Parkman’s son-in-law. Said letter was recently obtained by the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Mary's interest in history and cultural artifacts is further noted by the fact that the first annual meeting of the [[Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities]] was held at her 41 Brimmer Street Boston home.&lt;ref&gt;The Magazine of History with Notes and Queries, Volume 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary L. Ware did at least some work with the Christian Register, helping in the selection of letters in a 1917 edition.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Register - Volume 96 - Page 1190&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, from at least 1906 to 1913 she was a member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, as known by a pair of letters she exchanged during those respective years to [[Anne Whitney]], a reputable Massachusetts poet and sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;Papers of Anne Whitney, 1834-1915: a guide. MSS.4 - http://academics.wellesley.edu/lts/archives/mss.4.html - https://www.wellesley.edu/sites/default/files/assets/departments/libraryandtechnology/files/archives/mss.4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Ware attended the first annual meeting of the [[Woman's National Farm &amp; Garden Association]]'s New England Branch in Boston, and was elected to the position of "Chairman Executive Committee."&lt;ref&gt;Woman's National Farm and Garden Association Bulletin, Volume 6, Issue 8, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary was a corporate member of the [[Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Youth]], along with her cousins Charles E. and Harriet P. Ware of Fitchburg and (possible relative) Mrs. Mary G. Ware of Lancaster.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the Trustees of the Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Youth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public documents of Massachusetts, Volume 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Lee Ware was an officer in the [[Massachusetts Forestry Association]]&lt;ref&gt;The Lumber Manufacturer and Dealer, Volume 66&lt;/ref&gt; from at least 1906 to 1915, occupying such roles as one of many Vice-Presidents, a member of the Executive Committee along with Ways and Means&lt;ref&gt;Pamphlets on Forestry in Massachusetts, Volume 10&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being the Chairman of the Membership and Publications Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Forestry Association - Woodland and Roadside, Volumes 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Forestry Association - [https://books.google.com/books?id=TLMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA47&amp;lpg=RA1-PA47&amp;dq=Mary+Lee+Ware&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4_CSDm6frX&amp;sig=1Du_TIGWWKcU4AEyyaq-TajFaGE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit-O6P1tXQAhVm7oMKHXu-Cq84ChDoAQgsMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mary%20Lee%20Ware&amp;f=false Woodland and Roadside: Volumes 5-8]&lt;/ref&gt; As in so many of her roles she was, curiously and again, known as "Mary Lee Ware of Boston," though this could easily be due to her seemingly preferred Rindge residence being outside of Massachusetts.

===New Hampshire===
Similarly showing her love of the natural world, in 1901–1902 Mary Lee Ware played a pivotal role in the creation of the New Hampshire [[Rhododendron State Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sentinelsource.com/community/weeklies/taking-it-one-room-at-a-time-rindge-historical-society/article_fc498610-9eb6-532b-b2c4-11c6694c3171.html|title=Taking it one room at a time Rindge Historical Society preserves 256 years of history|last=BOROZINSKI|first=AMANDA|work=SentinelSource.com|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; when, in 1901, subsequent owner Levi Fuller planned to "lumber off" the property and would have if not for Mary, who bought it in 1902. Giving it to the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]] (AMC) a year later, she signed the deal on the condition that the woodland "...be held as a reservation properly protected and open to the public...forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhododendron State Park|url=http://www.newhampshire.com/article/99999999/NEWHAMPSHIRE0304/110419946/0/55|website=NewHampshire.com|publisher=NewHampshire.com|accessdate=15 January 2016|date=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhododendron State Park Park History - https://www.nhstateparks.org/uploads/RhododendronStatePark_History_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The contract also barred cutting down any trees or picking any [[rhododendron]], a promise that has been broken only once due to the 1938 hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Old Patch Place|url=http://www.beqbooks.com/rhodo/patch.htm|website=Bequaert Old Books|publisher=Frank Bequaert|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The donated land is called "Old Patch Place," remodeled by the AMC as a hostel/clubhouse but has since (1946) come under the protection of the N.H. Division of Parks and Recreation — the system's only designated botanical park. The "Old Patch Place" cottage near the park entrance was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.

Miss Ware was a unit chairwoman of the Women's Committee and Council of National Defense in the Granite State, working with the Federal Food Administrator of New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;The Granite Monthly: A Magazine of Literature, History and State Progress, Volume 51, p. 200-202&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the [[Rindge Historical Society]] Museum's collection of artifacts "began with the efforts of Mary Lee Ware...a seasonal resident of Rindge. Ms. Ware, around the turn of the twentieth century, took it upon herself to solicit donations of historical items from the town’s residents."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rindgehistoricalsociety.org/?page_id=59|title=The Collection|date=2015-03-23|work=Rindge Historical Society|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection, today located near the center of Rindge, was once housed at the Ingalls Memorial Library (which would itself later benefit from Mary's generosity). Indeed, in the very first issue of the Rindge Community Newsletter (a volunteer effort by the Rindge Chamber of Commerce), Mary L. Ware was credited with the founding of the Rindge Museum, stating that she asked for the historical donations per "a large horse-drawn wagon and a few of her hired men."&lt;ref&gt;Google cache of a 2012 Newsletter from the Rindge Chamber of Commerce - http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hZ9MsbTMMHMJ:rindgechamber.org/newsletter/2012/Final%2520Newsletter.pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:The grave of Mary Lee Ware at Mt. Auburn Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The grave of Mary Lee Ware at Mt. Auburn Cemetery]]
The circumstances of Mary Lee Ware's death - which took place a few months after the Glass Flowers enterprise ended - is described in a letter addressed to Professor Oakes Ames. On January 5 "the poor old lady had a heavy stroke which left her almost completely paralyzed. There seemed to be no question whatever but that she could not possibly recover and, four days later, she had another shock which, thank God, carried her peacefully off."&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;  Having died at her 41 Brimmer Street Boston home at the age of 79, Miss Ware was buried next to her parents at [[Mt. Auburn Cemetery]], her funeral taking place on January 12 at [[King's Chapel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/45693823/|title=Fitchburg Sentinel from Fitchburg, Massachusetts on January 13, 1937 · Page 3|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officiated over by Reverends John and Palfrey Perkins with many notable personages in attendance, including Francis Goodale (Prof. Goodale's son).&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt; Acting as an usher at the funeral was a child named Charles E. Ware 3rd, presumably the son of her cousin Charles Eliot Ware of [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]] of whom her will designated a favorable sum.&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt; Indeed, another letter to Professor Ames states that a letter of condolence should be sent to Charles E. Ware of Fitchburg, furthering the appearance that the two cousins were close.&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt; Miss Mary L. Ware's death was, in addition, reportedly taken hard by Rudolf Blaschka, whose own health was beginning to fail (as detailed in another letter to Professor Ames by Mr. Louis C. Bierweiler, former assistant to Professor [[Louis Agassiz]]).&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reports of the President and the Treasurer of Harvard College&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a later letter from a solicitor to the Soviet authorities details a pension that Mary Lee Ware set for Rudolf and which continued to Frieda until 1941 - after which Mrs. Blaschka had no income at all.&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;

It is known that, upon death, Mary's will detailed the donation of her taxidermied bird and animal collection to the [[Ingalls Memorial Library]] of Rindge — "The collection native to this region was donated through the generosity and under the will of Mary Lee Ware. It is quite a wonderful collection and many Rindge residents know of its existence because of school visits."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://208.112.52.16/Library_Services.cfm|title=Welcome to the Town of Rindge - Ingalls Memorial Library Miscellaneous Services|website=208.112.52.16|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also left them $5000 and, furthermore, was one of the Trustees of and partly responsible for writing the Annual Report of the Library, as she was a signatory of said Report in 1917; this also made her one of the Officers of the Town of Rindge.&lt;ref&gt;Rindge. "Annual Reports of the Officers of the Town of Rindge, N. H.: For the Year Ending March 1 and the Invoice and Taxes for April 1." Print. - page 22&lt;/ref&gt; At some point in life Mary Lee Ware inherited [[Robert Salmon]]'s ''[[The British Fleet Forming a Line off Algiers]]'' painting from her father, Dr. Charles Eliot Ware - though how he acquired it is not known. She bequeathed the painting in 1937 (presumably after her death and per her will) to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts (MFA)]] in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="mfa.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/amica/amico887359-17785.html|title=Robert Salmon / The British Fleet Forming a Line off Algiers / 1829|website=www.davidrumsey.com|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Miss Ware's will detailed sizable donations to organizations such as the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], Kentucky's [[Berea College]], and the [[American Unitarian Association]].&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;&lt;ref name="hoofandclaw.org"/&gt; In addition,&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
The independent wealth of Mary L. Ware and her family was owed to the fact that her mother, Elizabeth C. Ware, was a descendant of the wealthy [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] [[Cabot family|Cabots]] - a merchant family dating back to the early 1700s.&lt;ref&gt;The Cabot Family - http://library.albany.edu/preservation/brittle_bks/Crawford_Familiesv1/Chpt9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/elizabeth-cabot-lee_28529786|title=Elizabeth Cabot Lee 1819-1898 - Ancestry|website=www.ancestry.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 Miss Ware began a subscription to the [[Fund for the Encouragement of Mexican and Central American Research]], as recorded in a Harvard University Annual Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College|date=1900–1901|publisher=Harvard University|page=5325|url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/2574409?n=5325|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rug on the floor of the Edward Hall Library in the [[First Parish in Cambridge]] was "given in memory of Miss Mary Lee Ware, a first cousin of Rev. Edward Hall," who presided as Minister from 1882 to 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/congregational-polity/for-an-industrial-society/|title=The Church in Harvard Square: For an Industrial Society|date=2014-09-09|work=Harvard Square Library|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Lee Ware reportedly never owned an automobile - apparently traveling to and from Boston via the train, and by horse and buggy when in Rindge.&lt;ref name="hoofandclaw.org"/&gt;

Mary's relationship with her brother, Charles Ware Jr., is not known. It is known, though, that Charles Jr. also went to Harvard in the 1870s and lived in Boston for a while – marrying in 1881 – before moving to Newton. Why Mary and her mother never involved him (and his wife) in the Glass Flowers enterprise is unknown.

'''Nominative determinism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that people tend to gravitate towards [[vocation|areas of work]] that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting [[surname]]s. These included a book on polar explorations by [[Daniel Snowman]] and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation that some sort of psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in ''New Scientist'', as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept [[aptronym]], and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. "Aptronym" merely means the name is fitting, without saying anything about why it has come to fit.

The idea that people are drawn to professions that fit their name was suggested by psychologist [[Carl Jung]], citing as an example [[Sigmund Freud]] who studied pleasure and whose surname means "joy". A few recent empirical studies have indicated that certain professions are disproportionately represented by people with appropriate surnames (and sometimes given names), though the methods of these studies have been challenged. One explanation for nominative determinism is ''[[implicit egotism]]'', which states that humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves. An alternative explanation is [[genetic determinism|genetic]]: a person might be named Smith or Taylor because that was originally their occupation, and they would pass on their genes to their descendants, including an aptitude for activities involving strength in the case of Smith, or dexterity in the case of Taylor.

==Background==
Before people could gravitate towards areas of work that matched their names, many people were given names that matched their area of work.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=2}} The way people are named has changed over time.{{sfn|Fowler|2012| p=11}} In pre-urban times people were only known by a single name &amp;ndash; for example, the Anglo-Saxon name Beornheard.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{efn-ua|Even the Romans, whose [[Roman naming conventions|naming system]] is generally assumed to have used three names, started out with a single name, e.g., Romulus. Over the course of fourteen centuries this then first evolved to two names, to three names (e.g., [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], where Marcus is the [[praenomen]], Tullius the [[nomen gentilicium]], and Cicero the [[cognomen]]), back to two names, and finally one name again.{{sfn|Salway|1994|p=124–126}}}} Single names were chosen for their meaning or given as [[nickname]]s.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=71}} In England it was only after the [[Norman conquest]] that surnames were added, although there were a few earlier [[Epithet|bynames]] that were not hereditary,{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}}{{sfn|McKinley|1990|pp=25–34}}  such as [[Edmund Ironside]].{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=68}} Surnames were created to fit the person, mostly from [[patronymic|patronyms]] (e.g., John son of William becomes John Williamson), [[occupational name|occupational descriptions]] (e.g., John Carpenter), character or traits (e.g., John Long), or location (e.g., John from Acton became John Acton).{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=2}} Names were not initially hereditary; only by the mid-14th century did they gradually become so.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=viii}} Surnames relating to trades or craft were the first to become hereditary, as the craft often persisted within the family for generations.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=143}}{{efn-ua|Ancient Roman fathers passed on their cognomen to their children as well.{{sfn|Salway|1994|p=127}} According to Gaius Plinius Secundus, better known as [[Pliny the Elder]], cognomina derived from occupations were initially taken from agriculture &amp;ndash; for example, Cicero means chickpea. Ergo, Marcus Tullius Cicero, the orator, was a descendent of a grower of chickpeas,{{sfn|Wilson|2003|p=10}} although it is also said the cognomen was given for the shape of the nose being similar to that of a chickpea.{{sfn|McKeown|2010|p=22}}}} The appropriateness of occupational names has decreased over time, because tradesmen did not always follow their fathers:{{sfn|Fowler| 2012|p=11}} an early example from the 14th century is "Roger Carpenter the pepperer".{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=143}}

Another aspect of naming was the importance attached to the wider meaning contained in a name. In 17th-century England it was believed that choosing a name for a child should be done carefully. Children should live according to the message contained in, or the meaning of their names.{{sfn|Smith-Bannister|1997|p=11}} In 1652 [[William Jenkyn]], an English clergyman, argued that first names should be "as a thread tyed about the finger to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our Master".{{sfn|Jenkyn|1652|p=7}} In 1623, at a time when [[Puritans|Puritan]] names such as Faith, Fortitude and Grace were appearing for the first time, English historian [[William Camden]] wrote that names should be chosen with "good and gracious significations", as they might inspire the bearer to good actions.{{sfn|Camden|1984|p=43}}{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=14}} With the rise of the [[British Empire]] the English naming system and English surnames spread across large portions of the globe.{{ sfn|American Council of Learned Societies|1998|p=180}}

By the beginning of the 20th century, Smith and Taylor were two of the three most frequently occurring English surnames; both were occupational, though few smiths and tailors remained.{{sfn|Weekley|1914|p=43–44}}{{efn-ua|Over time many surnames in patrilineal systems go extinct, sometimes leaving a few to dominate, depending on factors such as number of male children, immigration and merging women's surnames with their spouses upon marriage. A [[Korean surnames|Korean surname]] has a 43% chance of being either Kim, Lee or Park. The [[Galton–Watson process]] models mathematically how much chance a surname has to survive. Under constant assumptions of 1 in 3 chance of 0, 1 or 2 sons, there is a 67% chance that by the fourth generation the surname has died out.{{sfn|Ratzan|2004|p=120–122}}}} When a correspondence between a name and an occupation did occur, it became worthy of note. In an 1888 issue of the ''[[Kentish Note Book]]'' magazine a list appeared with "several carriers by the name of Carter; a hosier named Hosegood; an auctioneer named Sales; and a draper named Cuff".{{sfn|Feedback|2000}}  Since then, a variety of terms for the concept of a close relationship between name and occupation have emerged. The term ''[[aptronym]]'' is thought to have been coined in the early 20th century by the American newspaper columnist [[Franklin Pierce Adams|Franklin P. Adams]].{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=18}} Linguist Frank Nuessel coined ''aptonym'', without an "r", in 1992.{{sfn|Nuessel|1992}} Other synonyms include ''euonym'',{{sfn|Room|1996|p=40}} ''Perfect Fit Last Name'' (PFLN),{{sfn|Levey|1985}} and ''namephreak''.{{sfn|Conrad|1999|p=16}} In [[literary science]] a name that particularly suits a character is called a ''charactonym''.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|1995|p=229}} Notable authors who frequently used charactonyms as a stylistic technique include [[Charles Dickens]] (e.g., [[Gradgrind|Mr. Gradgrind]], the tyrannical schoolmaster){{sfn|Lederer|2010|p=67}} and [[William Shakespeare]] (e.g., the lost baby [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]] in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'').{{sfn|Cavill|2016|p=365}} Unlike nominative determinism, the concept of aptronym and its synonyms do not say anything about causality, i.e. why the name has come to fit.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=16}}

Because of the potentially humorous nature of aptronyms a number of newspapers have collected them. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] reported irregularly on reader-submitted gems, including substitute teacher Mr. Fillin, piano teacher Patience Scales, and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s spokesman on the evils of rock 'n roll, Cardinal Rapsong.{{sfn|Conrad|1999|p=16–17}} Similarly, the journalist Bob Levey on occasion listed examples sent in by readers of his column in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': a food industry consultant named Faith Popcorn, a lieutenant called Sergeant, and a tax accountant called Shelby Goldgrab.{{sfn|Levey|1985}}{{sfn|Levey|2000}} Dutch newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'' had an irregularly featured column called "Nomen est omen" with Dutch examples.{{sfn|Hoekstra|2011|p=45}} Individual name collectors have also published books of aptronyms.{{sfn|Dickson|1996}}{{sfn|Hoekstra|2001}} [[Onomastics|Onomastic]] scholar R.M. Rennick called for more verification of aptronyms appearing in newspaper columns and books.{{sfn|Rennick|1982|p=193}} Lists of aptronyms in science, medicine, and law are more reliable as they tend to be drawn from easily verifiable sources.{{sfn| Keaney|Groarke|Galvin|McGorrian|2013}}{{sfn|Bennett|1992}}

==Definition==
Nominative determinism, literally "name-driven outcome",{{sfn|Alter|2013|p=7}} is the [[hypothesis]] that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work which reflect their names. The name fits because people, possibly subconsciously, made themselves fit. Nominative determinism differs from the concept of aptronyms in that it focuses on causality.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=16}}

The term has its origin in the "Feedback" column of the British magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1994. A series of events raised the suspicion of its editor, John Hoyland, who wrote in the 5 November issue:

{{quote|We recently came across a new book, ''Pole Positions—The Polar Regions and the Future of the Planet'', by [[Daniel Snowman]].{{sfn|Snowman|1993}} Then, a couple of weeks later, we received a copy of ''London Under London—A Subterranean Guide'', one of the authors of which is Richard Trench.{{sfn|Trench|1993}} So it was interesting to see Jen Hunt of the [[University of Manchester]] stating in the October issue of ''[[The Psychologist (publication)|The Psychologist]]'': "Authors gravitate to the area of research which fits their surname."{{sfn|Hunt|1994|p=480}} Hunt's example is an article on incontinence in the ''[[British Journal of Urology]]'' by A. J. Splatt and D. Weedon.{{sfn|Splatt|Weedon|1977}}

We feel it's time to open up this whole issue to rigorous scrutiny. You are invited to send in examples of the phenomenon in the fields of science and technology (with references that check out, please) together with any hypotheses you may have on how it comes about.{{sfn|Feedback|1994a}}}}

Feedback editors John Hoyland and Mike Holderness subsequently adopted the term ''nominative determinism'' as suggested by reader C. R. Cavonius. The term first appeared in the 17 December issue.{{sfn|Alter|2013|p=230}} Even though the magazine tried to ban the topic numerous times over the decades since,{{sfn|Feedback|2015}} readers kept sending in curious examples. These included the U.S. Navy spokesman put up to answer journalists' questions about the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], one Lieutenant Mike Kafka;{{sfn|Feedback|2004}} authors of the book ''The Imperial Animal'' Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox;{{sfn|Feedback|2005}} and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on knife crime, Alfred Hitchcock.{{sfn|Feedback|2007}}

As used in ''New Scientist'' the term nominative determinism only applies to work.{{sfn|Feedback|1994a}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994b}}{{sfn|Feedback|2000}}{{sfn|Feedback|2015}} In contributions to other newspapers ''New Scientist'' writers have stuck to this definition, with the exception of editor Roger Highfield in a column in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', in which he included "key attributes of life".{{sfn|Highfield|2011}}{{sfn|Colls|2011}}{{sfn|Telegraph staff|2011}}{{efn-ua|Others have extended the area of influence; for example researchers Keaney ''et al.'' entitled their study into the relationship between people called Brady and those who had pacemakers inserted for [[bradycardia]] "The Brady Bunch? New evidence for nominative determinism in patients' health".{{sfn| Keaney|Groarke|Galvin|McGorrian|2013}}}}

Prior to 1994 other terms for the suspected psychological effect were used sporadically. ''Onomastic determinism'' was used as early as 1970 by [[Roberta Frank]].{{sfn|Frank|1970|p=25}} German psychologist [[Wilhelm Stekel]] spoke of "Die Verpflichtung des Namens" (the obligation of the name) in 1911.{{sfn|Stekel|1911|p=110}} Outside of science, ''cognomen syndrome'' was used by playwright [[Tom Stoppard]] in his 1972 play ''[[Jumpers (play)|Jumpers]]''.{{sfn|Stoppard|1972|p=52}} In [[Ancient Rome]] the predictive power of a person's name was captured by the Latin proverb "nomen est omen", meaning the name is a sign.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}} This saying is still in use today in English{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}} and other languages such as French,{{sfn|Fibbi|Kaya|Piguet|2003|p=0}} German,{{sfn|Schaffer-Suchomel|2009|p=1}} Italian,{{sfn|Gerber|2006|p=0}} Dutch,{{sfn|Hoekstra|2001|p=1}} and Slovenian.{{sfn|Duša|Kenda|2011|p=0}}

''New Scientist'' coined the term ''nominative contradeterminism'' for people who move away from their name, creating a contradiction between name and occupation. Examples include Andrew Waterhouse, a professor of wine,{{sfn|Feedback|2014b}} would-be doctor Thomas Edward Kill, who subsequently changed his name to Jirgensohn,{{sfn|Slovenko|1983|p=227}} and the Archbishop of Manila, [[Jaime Sin|Cardinal Sin]].{{sfn|Feedback|1996}}{{efn-ua|Over the years ''New Scientist'' has reported on other variations on the theme, including ''onomatopoeic nominative determinism'' (e.g., [[European Space Agency]] chief mission scientist Bernard Foing),{{sfn|Feedback|2006}} ''nominative indeterminism'' (to explain the existence of hundreds of scientific articles whose authors include a Wong and a Wright),{{sfn|Feedback|2014a}} and ''occupational preferentialism'' (the hypothesis that one's work influences one's taste, for example policemen liking [[John Constable|Constable]]'s paintings).{{sfn|Feedback|1999}}}} The synonym ''inaptronym'' is also sometimes used.{{sfn|Nunn|2014}}

==Research==
===Theoretical framework===
The first scientists to discuss the concept that names had a determining effect were early 20th-century German psychologists.{{sfn|Flugel|1930|p=208}} Wilhelm Stekel spoke of the "obligation of the name" in the context of compulsive behaviour and choice of occupation;{{sfn|Stekel|1911|p=110}} [[Karl Abraham]] wrote that the determining power of names might be partially caused by inheriting a trait from an ancestor who was given a fitting name. He made the further inference that families with fitting names might then try to live up to their names in some way.{{sfn|Abraham|1979|p=31}} In 1952 [[Carl Jung]] referred to Stekel's work in his theory of [[synchronicity]] (events without causal relationship that yet seem to be meaningfully related):{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=27}}

{{Quote|We find ourselves in something of a quandary when it comes to making up our minds about the phenomenon which Stekel calls the "compulsion of the name". What he means by this is the sometimes quite gross coincidence between a man's name and his peculiarities or profession. For instance&amp;nbsp;... Herr Feist (Mr Stout) is the food minister, Herr Rosstäuscher (Mr Horsetrader) is a lawyer, Herr Kalberer (Mr Calver) is an obstetrician&amp;nbsp;... Are these the whimsicalities of chance, or the suggestive effects of the name, as Stekel seems to suggest, or are they "meaningful coincidences"?{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=15}}}}

Jung listed striking instances among psychologists—including himself: "Herr [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] (Joy) champions the [[Beyond the Pleasure Principle|pleasure principle]], Herr [[Gerhard Adler|Adler]] (Eagle) the will to power, Herr Jung (Young) the idea of rebirth&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Jung|1972|p=15}}

In 1975 psychologist Lawrence Casler called for empirical research into the relative frequencies of career-appropriate names to establish if there is an effect at work or whether we are being "seduced by [[Fortuna|Lady Luck]]". He proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics – attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.{{sfn|Casler|1975|p=472}}

In 2002 the researchers Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing that people have a basic desire to feel good about themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the [[self]]. Given the ''[[endowment effect|mere ownership effect]]'', which states that people like things more if they own them, the researchers theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name.{{efn-ua|Studies have shown that most people like the name given to them.{{sfn|Joubert|1985|p=983}} Extensive research also has found a strong effect called the [[name-letter effect]]: when given the choice between letters, people significantly prefer the ones from their own name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=353}}}} They called this unconscious power ''[[implicit egotism]]''.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}} Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011|p=46}} Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.{{sfn|Smeets|2009|p=11}}

===Empirical evidence===
[[File:Igor Judge 2007 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a man|[[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Igor Judge]], a former judge]]
Those with fitting names give differing accounts of the effect of their name on their career choices. [[Igor Judge]], former [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=18}} Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision.{{sfn|Silverman|Light|2011}} Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force.{{sfn|Nelson}} Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms,{{sfn|Cole|2001}} was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said "That had never occurred to me."{{sfn|Nevid|Rathus|2009|p=202}} [[Church of England]] vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers had anything to do with him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".{{sfn|Colls|2011}}

How much is down to the subconscious is difficult to say, but the fact that your name is similar may be a reason for showing more interest in a profession than you might otherwise.

While reports by owners of fitting names are of interest, some scientists have questioned their value in deciding whether nominative determinism is a real effect.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=18}}{{sfn|Smeets|2009|p=14}} Instead, they argue that the claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}} To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed.{{sfn|Bateson|Martin|2001|p=124}} In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479–480}} However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham ''et al.'' for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham ''et al.'' to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011|p=23}}{{efn-ua|Confounding variables have also played a role in research into ''monogrammic determinism'': in 1999 Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive monograms (e.g., ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g., PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999}} Morrison &amp; Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artifact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. Indeed when grouping the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005}}}}

Aware of Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Mauricio published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds.{{efn-ua|Initially Pelham and colleagues defended their methods in a rebuttal Simonsohn assessed as also lacking in diligence.{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2011|p=25}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=31}}}} In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations whose titles matched their surnames, for example, baker, carpenter, and farmer.{{sfn|Pelham|Mauricio|2015|p=692}}

In 2009 Michalos reported the results of an analysis of the occurrences of people with the surname Counsell registered as independent barristers in England and Wales versus those with the name in England and Wales as whole. Given the low frequency of the name in England and Wales as a whole he expected to find no one registered, but three barristers named Counsell were found.{{sfn|Michalos|2009|p=17}}

In 2015 researchers Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb published a paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the [[General Medical Council]], and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an [[orthopedic surgery|orthopaedic surgeon]], and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided a wide range of alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were [[genitourinary medicine]] (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and [[urology]] (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). [[Neurology|Neurologists]] had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables.{{sfn|Limb|Limb|Limb|Limb|2015|p=24–26}} In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, "doc", "law", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds were more likely to be [[radiology|radiologists]] than [[dermatology|dermatologists]].{{sfn|Abel|2010|p=65}} Two separate studies by Krajick and Neimi in 2005, both analysing large samples of names of scientists, showed 1.35% of geologists having names referring to their field, and in political science, 1.26%.{{sfn|Krajick|2005|p=15}}{{sfn|Neimi|2005|p=13}}

As for Casler's third possible explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, but it was not statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

'''Offshoring as a service''' ('''OaaS''') is a [[business model]] in which the [[offshore office]] is not owned by the entity itself, instead it is [[outsourcing|outsourced]] to a [[vendor]]. The concept of [[offshoring]] is not new; however, in the past, some companies have tried to open their own offshore offices. The OaaS model leans towards utilizing a [[team]] or [[company]] which specializes in offshoring work and uses them on a [[contractual]] basis as a part of their own team.

== Benefits ==
Offshoring provides several benefits to medium and small scale businesses by reducing operational costs and providing capability to sustain downturns in economic cycles.

It is crucial for companies to either invest in a robust management structure in offshore or find a trusted partner to effectively leverage offshore teams. 
Offshoring provides several benefits, for example:
* Reduced operational costs providing capability to sustain downturns in economic cycles.  
* Access to a bigger talent pool.
* 24 hours operational opportunity.
* Increased productivity with extended working hours (onshore and offshore handoff).
* Increased flexibility.
* Economies of scale.
* Diversity and access to a team that has a broader and longer view of the world.

==Challenges==
Offshoring can have its own challenges like communication and cultural issues, high turnover rate, lack of effective management, physical proximity, etc.  
It is crucial for companies to either invest in a robust management structure in offshore or find a trusted partner to effectively leverage offshore teams.  
Choose a company that:
* provides end-to-end services
* has a strong management team with broad experience working in startups and understands the unique challenges of startups
* agrees to proactive communication and state of the art delivery management methodologies
* is not just an offshore shop but has presence in the US (or wherever the company is based and wants to offshore from) as well
* has an offshore team that also travels frequently to US (or wherever you are based and want to offshore from)
* has a team that has studied, worked and lived in US and Europe
* has a technology and management team that has experience in offshoring

[[Image:Roto chileno.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monument to the Chilean '''''roto''''', [[Plaza Yungay]], Santiago.]]

In the mural it is written; "What once was ours, will be ours once again", and "Hold on rotos (Chileans), because here come the Colorados of Bolivia"]]
'''''Roto''''', f. '''''rota''''', (literally "broken") is a term used to refer to Chilean people and in particular to the common Chilean. In [[Chile]] from the start of the 20th century it was applied with a negative [[classism|classist]] connotation to poor city-dwellers. It is also used contemptuously in other Spanish-speaking countries, especially [[Bolivia]]&lt;!---BROKEN LINK---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batallas.org/viewtopic.php?p=158950&amp;sid=c490b82637a239cfcdcd6a52ee9f9b64|title=Los Colorados de Bolivia en la Guerra del Pacífico|accessdate=|format=PHP|author=|date=|publisher=www.batallas.org}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peru]], to refer to Chileans in a derogatory manner. Otherwise, despite its defects, the roto is also considered a figure of national identity and pride in Chile.

==Historical usage==
The term ''roto'' has been used in [[Peru]] since the times of the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]], when [[Diego de Almagro]]'s disappointed troops returned to [[Cusco|Cuzco]] (after a failed gold-seeking expedition in Chile) with their torn clothes, due to the extensive and laborious passage on foot through the [[Atacama desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diario.elmercurio.com/detalle/index.asp?id={ff7d780d-671b-41f1-8ab2-a07c851aaa16} |title=Roto chileno |accessdate=2 August 2013 |format=ASP |author=Cañas Palacios, Gastón |date=20 September 2010 |publisher=diario.elmercurio.com |quote= |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Larraín Valdés, Gerardo |title=Diego de Almagro |url= |format= |year=2001 |origyear=1996 |editor= |publisher=Luxemburgo |isbn=956-272-488-3 |language=Spanish |quote=[...] los [españoles que volvieron] de Chile estaban en tan pobres condiciones, ya que nadie les daba trabajo ni posibilidades de desenvolverse en alguna actividad, que por sus ropas harapientas los llamaban los '''rotos''' chilenos.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term became more used after the [[War of the Confederation|Chilean campaigns against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] in 1839 —Chilean troops defeated the confederation at the [[Battle of Yungay]] on 20 January 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academiahistoriamilitar.cl/?do=noticias.verDetalle&amp;id=86 |title=Batalla de Yungay y conmemoración del roto chileno – Yungay y el roto chileno: El proceso de consolidación de la nacionalidad |accessdate=15 October 2012 |author=López Ardiles, Marcos |date=17 January 2012 |publisher=www.academiahistoriamilitar.cl |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chile tributes were paid to the victors of Yungay and, in a gesture of recognition, 20 January was declared the [[:es:Día del Roto Chileno|''Día del Roto Chileno'']] (in Spanish; ''Day of the Chilean Roto'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feriadoschilenos.cl/DiasNacionales.html#DiaDelRotoChileno |title=Días nacionales en Chile: Otros días en que se observan celebraciones |accessdate=17 March 2013 |author=Farah, Miguel |date=14 March 2013 |publisher=www.feriadoschilenos.cl |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;— and the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–84).

The figure of the ''Chilean Roto'' is commemorated by very diverse organisations and actors such as the [[Chilean Army]], ultra-nationalist activists, the Communist Party and local organisations of ordinary citizens. The Army has a particular appreciation to the figure which was regarded as the main hero –a collective and anonymous hero- of some of the most crucial battles in the war against Bolivia and Peru.
In this context, the webpage of the Chilean Army states:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ejercito.cl/historia/hisp-ind.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005011805/http://www.ejercito.cl/historia/hisp-ind.htm |date=5 October 2007 }}; 15 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The patriotism, bravery and heroism was embodied in the Chilean roto, who represents the ordinary man that left all to fight for its country. This was the one who fought in Yungay and characterised himself by his fierceness and determination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oresteplath.cl/antologia/origen-roto.html ''Epopeya del “roto” chileno''], by  Oreste Plath.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-23762010000100009&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=es ''Exaltación del mestizo: la invención del roto chileno''], by Horacio Gutiérrez.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family have a wealth of over €8billion, making them the 5th richest family in Germany, according to Handelsblatt [https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/mittelstand/familienunternehmer/siemens-porsche-merck-das-sind-deutschlands-reichste-unternehmer-clans/20245870.html]

== History ==
[[File:Goslar - Siemenshaus aus 1693.JPG|thumb|Siemens House at [[Goslar]], built in 1692]]

=== Origin ===
The Siemens family was first documented in 1384 with '''Henning Symons''', a farmer of the [[Free imperial city]] of [[Goslar]] in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]]. The family tree begins with ''Ananias Siemens'' (ca 1538-1591), a citizen, brewer and owner of an [[oil mill]] at Goslar, belonging to the Shoemaker's [[Guild]], as his ancestors have been shoemakers.

His grandson Hans (1628–94), speaker of the Merchant's Guild and commander of the town's vigilance committee, built the Siemens House at Goslar in 1692. It is still owned by the family and houses their private archives and an exhibition on the family history. The Siemens family provided numerous members to the Goslar city council as well as four mayors, the last being Johann Georg (1748–1807).

===Development===
[[File:Berlin Siemensstadt Kabelwerk Westend.jpg|thumb|[[Siemens]]-Cable Factory in Berlin-[[Siemensstadt]] around 1900]]
The most important branches of the Goslar family (there are also other families with the same surname in Northern Germany) go back to the farmer Christian Ferdinand Siemens (1787–1840). His sons [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Werner Siemens]] (since 1888 ''von'' Siemens), [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|(Carl) Wilhelm Siemens]] (known as ''Sir William Siemens''), Hans Siemens, Friedrich Siemens and [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens|Carl (Heinrich) von Siemens]] became engineers and entrepreneurs.

Werner Siemens, a former artillery and engineering officer in the Prussian army, invented a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] that used a needle to point to the right letter, instead of using [[Morse code]]. Based on this invention, he founded the company ''[[Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens &amp; Halske]]'' on 1 October 1847, with the company taking occupation of its workshop on 12 October. His business partner [[Johann Georg Halske]], a master mechanic, was particularly involved in the construction and design of electrical equipment such as the press which enabled wires to be insulated with a seamless coat of [[gutta-percha]], the pointer telegraph, the [[Samuel Morse|morse]] telegraph and measuring instruments. The company was internationalised soon after its founding. One brother of Werner represented him in England ([[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|Sir William Siemens]]) and another in [[St.Petersburg]], [[Russia]] ([[Carl Heinrich von Siemens|Carl von Siemens]]), each earning recognition. In 1867 Mr Halske withdrew from the company because his more conservative views on company policy diverged from those of the rather venturous Siemens brothers.

In 1848, the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe; 500&amp;nbsp;km from Berlin to [[Frankfurt am Main]]. In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long distance telegraph networks in Russia. In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental Indo-European ([[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to [[London]]) telegraph line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://w4.siemens.de/archiv/en/laender/asien/indien.html | title=Siemens history | accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1870 a [[transatlantic communications cable]]. In 1857, Werner von Siemens described the [[countercurrent exchange]] and in 1867 a [[dynamo]] without permanent magnets. A similar system was also independently invented by [[Charles Wheatstone]], but Siemens became the first company to build such devices. In 1881, a Siemens [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Alternator]] driven by a [[watermill]] was used to power the world's first electric street lighting in the town of [[Godalming]], United Kingdom. The company continued to grow and diversified into [[electric locomotive|electric trains]] and [[light bulbs]]. In 1887 it opened its first office in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens website [http://www.siemens.com/history/en/news/1125_japan.htm August 1, 2012 – 125 Years Siemens in Japan (1887–2012)] Retrieved on August 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the founder retired and left running the company to his brother Carl and sons Arnold and Wilhelm.

In 1888, Werner Siemens received hereditary [[German nobility|ennoblement]] as ''von'' Siemens by [[Frederick III, German Emperor]]. His brother [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|William]] had been [[knight]]ed – becoming Sir William – by [[Queen Victoria]] a few months before his death in 1883. The brother [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens|Carl]] in St. Petersburg was ennobled by [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1895. Werner's cousin and father-in-law, Carl Georg Siemens (1809–1885), a professor of technology at the [[University of Hohenheim]], received personal ennoblement by the [[Kingdom of Württemberg|King of Württemberg]]. Werner's nephew [[Georg von Siemens|Georg]], co-founder of [[Deutsche Bank]], was ennobled by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], in 1899.

Siemens &amp; Halske (S &amp; H) was incorporated in 1897, and then merged parts of its activities with Schuckert &amp; Co., Nuremberg in 1903 to become [[Siemens-Schuckert]]. In 1919, S &amp; H and two other companies jointly formed the [[Osram]] [[lightbulb]] company. During the 1920s and 1930s, S &amp; H started to manufacture [[radios]], [[television set]]s, and [[electron microscopes]]. In 1932, [[:de:Reiniger, Gebbert &amp; Schall|Reiniger, Gebbert &amp; Schall]] (Erlangen), [[Phönix AG]] (Rudolstadt) and [[Siemens-Reiniger-Veifa mbH]] (Berlin) merged to form the [[Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG]] (SRW), a producer of medical technology and the third of the so-called ''parent companies'' that [[Ernst von Siemens]] decided in 1966 to merge to form the present-day [[Siemens]] AG,&lt;ref name="historysite"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the largest electro-technological firms in the world. The company, during all its stages from Siemens &amp; Halske AG, Siemens-Schuckertwerke AG and Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG until its merger to [[Siemens AG]] in 1966, has always been led by subsequent generations of the founder's family, at first by Werner's brother [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens|Carl]], then by Werner's sons [[Arnold von Siemens|Arnold]], [[Georg Wilhelm von Siemens|Wilhelm]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Siemens|Carl Friedrich]], later by his grandsons [[Hermann von Siemens|Hermann]] and [[Ernst von Siemens|Ernst]], and until 1981 by his great-grandson [[Peter von Siemens]].

Today the descendants of Werner and Carl von Siemens have a minority ownership of 6.9% (by comparison: the [[Ford family tree|Ford family]] controls the Ford Motor Company with a share of 2%), thus still being the largest single shareholder. Based on a market cap of €112billion, the Siemens family holds €7,7 billion worth of common stock in the company and received €201million in dividends in 2016. Considerable parts of this share have been endowed to [[charitable trust]]s controlled by family members. The family keeps a seat in the Siemens [[Supervisory Board]] and is said to take influence in the background. Until 1981, the chairman of the Supervisory Board has always been a member of the family. The ''von Siemens'' are said to return to the chairmanship in the future should necessity require it or an eligible candidate be ready to run.&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.handelsblatt.com/edition/102/ressort/companies-markets/article/siemens-appoints-heir-of-founder-to-board Siemens Names Founder's Heir to Board], Global Edition Handelsblatt, January 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circleofvalues.com/vltg_portfolio/we-say-it-we-mean-it/ ''How can we live our values embracing our heritage?''], an interview with Dr. Nathalie von Siemens&lt;/ref&gt; The clan's principal aim has always been to guarantee its 169 years old company independence, stability and solid growth.

The social study of [[marketing]] is an interdisciplinary area of [[social science]]. It combines perspectives from [[anthropology]], [[economic sociology]], [[science and technology studies]], and [[cultural studies]] to study [[Consumption (sociology)|consumption]]. Work in the area emphasizes the social and cultural dimensions of marketing practices but focuses also on technical and historical issues that have shaped contemporary consumer markets. Its emergence follows similar developments in [[social studies of finance]]. But it is also seen as  response to mainstream marketing management research which focuses on marketing as a series of tools and techniques devoid of social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Svensson|first=Peter|date=2007|title=Producing marketing: towards a social-phenomenology of marketing work|journal=Marketing Theory|volume=7|issue=3|pages=271–290|doi=10.1177/1470593107080346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "social studies of marketing" was first used to refer to a body of marketing theories by the economic sociologist Fabian Muniesa in his book Provoked Economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Provoked Economy|last=Muniesa|first=Fabian|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=2014|isbn=9782343083049|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He writes: 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;'The emerging field of the social studies of marketing ... can be defined as having a shared interest in how specialties such as marketing, market research, branding and advertising shape (purposeful, most of the time) the things they target – specifically consumers. ... Of course, this does not mean that consumers do not exist and that marketing is a fiction' (2014: 32). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theoretically, the main discussions in the area centre on questions of agency and representation.  Dealing with questions of agency, and informed by [[actor–network theory]], many discussion explore the ways that seemingly trivial material objects such as shopping bags,&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2007.00732.x/full Cochoy 2007 A sociology of market-things, The Sociological Review]&lt;/ref&gt; carts and trolleys&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1470593107086483 Cochoy 2008 Calculation, qualculation, calqulation, Marketing Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; and retail displays fundamentally shape how people consume. Accepting that these objects can influence what people buy has led researchers to question dominant views of consumers as sovereign decision makers that are more typical in studies of consumer markets. Dealing with representation, work in the area argues that the main task of marketing is to describe markets. The notion of [[performativity]] has emerged as a key concept here. It tells us that marketing practices which supposedly measure consumer behaviours can also be said to produce them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1998.tb03475.x/full Cochoy 1998 Another discipline for the market economy: marketing as a performative knowledge and know-how for capitalism, The Sociological Review]&lt;/ref&gt; This has led the area to engage in philosophical discussions in particular [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[social constructionism]]. The latter suggests that all reality – including consumer behaviour – is made up or constructed through representations. They former, says that there is an underlying real world, even if marketers base their decisions only on limited representation of that real world.

Authors who have contributed to this area are predominantly based on Europe and North America. They include prominent sociologists such as  [[Michel Callon]] and business researchers such as [https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/luis.araujo.html Araujo]; [http://schulich.yorku.ca/faculty/detlev-zwick/ Zwick]; [https://www.business-school.ed.ac.uk/about/people/84/Neil/Pollock Pollock]; [http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/katy-mason Mason]; and [https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-management-politics-and-philosophy/staff/sscmpp Schwartzkopf].

A '''sports agent''' is a legal representative (hence [[agent (law)|agent]]) for professional sports figures such as athletes and coaches. They procure and negotiate employment and [[Testimonial|endorsement]] contracts for the [[principal (commercial law)|athlete or coach]] whom they represent.
Because of the unique characteristics of the [[sports industry]], sports agents are responsible for communications with team owners, managers, and other individuals.  Also, they are responsible for making recommendations in regard . In addition to finding income sources, agents often handle [[public relations]] matters for their clients. In some large sports agencies, such as [[International Management Group|IMG]], [[Creative Artists Agency]], Roc Nation Sports and [[Octagon (Sports Agency)|Octagon]], agents deal with all aspects of a client's finances, from investment to filing taxes.

Sports agents may be relied upon by their clients for guidance in all business aspects, and sometimes even more broadly.  For example, hockey agents start recruiting clients as young as 15, allowing the agent to guide the athlete's career before the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]], which happens usually at 18 years of age.

Due to the length and complexity of contracts, many sports agents are lawyers or have a background in contract law. Agents are expected to be knowledgeable about finance, business management, and financial and risk analysis, as well as sports. It is important for a sports agent to follow trends in sports. Other skills an agent must possess are excellent communication and negotiation skills. Agents must be highly motivated, willing to work long hours, and capable of multitasking. It is very common for agents to be in negotiations on behalf of several clients at one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm Job Profiles.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109035912/http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm |date=2010-01-09 }} – description of roles of sports agent and some educational programs to prepare for the field&lt;/ref&gt;

Some agents are part of large companies, and some are on their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2007/07/16/an-industry-of-conglomerates/ An Industry Of Conglomerates] Sports Agent Blog, July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The number of clients an individual agent can handle and how many clients his or her employing agency can handle in total are interdependent variables.

Before the 1990s, most [[association football|football]] players did not use agents. In some cases, they used their fathers as agents. Because of most parents' naivete about the football business, these young footballers were often given less-than-stellar contracts by football clubs, which yielded lower salaries than they thought they deserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article396507.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 "The Big Interview: Neil Webb"] ''Sunday Times'', Nov. 28, 2004, interview with soccer/football player&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, there were only three licensed agents in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html "Market Saturation of Agents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810181903/http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html |date=2011-08-10 }}, May 23, 2002, note: source can be translated into English on the website&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2002, there were 33.  According to [[FIFA]], there were 5,187 licensed association football agents worldwide, with 600 agents in Italy alone.&lt;ref&gt;[ FIFA – Players' agents list – by country]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001, agents have not been licensed by FIFA. Instead, agents are now licensed directly by each association.

Sports agents generally receive between 4 and 10% of the athlete's playing contract, and 10 to 20% of the athlete's endorsement contract, although these figures vary. [[NFL]] agents are not permitted to receive more than 3%, and [[NBA]] agents not more than 4%, of their client's playing contracts.

==Media depictions==
The popularity of television shows such as ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', which stars a [[talent agent]] named [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]], and ''[[Arliss]]'', have helped glamorize the profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2008/12/04/so-you-want-to-be-an-agent-the-entourage-effect/ "So, You Want To Be An Agent? The Entourage Effect"] Sports Agent Blog, Dec. 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to that, movies such as ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', ''[[Two for the Money (2005 film)|Two for the Money]]'', and ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' depicted sports agents. In England, ITV's ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'' put a new spin on sports agents by casting a no-holds-barred female agent [[Hazel Bailey]]. The television show ''[[Ballers]]'', which started in 2015, also shows a strong depiction of sports agents.

Due to the popularity of these works, there has been increase of attention in the profession. Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s son decided to become a football agent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/blairs-son-to-become-a-football-agent-1829864.html "Blair's son to become a football agent"] Nov. 28, 2009, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swedish Standard Industrial Classification''', commonly referred to as '''SNI''', is a Swedish industry standard economic classification system, consisting of a hierarchy of codes that are up to 6-digits long. The most recent version of the SNI standard is '''SNI 2007''', which corresponds to NACE Revision 2.

The SNI standard is modeled on the [[Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community]], commonly referred to as NACE. The SNI standard is maintained by [[Statistics Sweden]] (also known as SCB), a Swedish government office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/ctryreg/ctrydetail.asp?id=258 United Nations Statistics Division, List of National Classifications, Sweden, SNI 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of estimating the value of a company by calculating the depth of its [[market penetration]] as evidenced by its [[customer base]] and industry niche.

The process consists of:

* profiling a company's type of customer and analysing which complementary companies share these customers.&lt;ref&gt;How to sell your business for maximum value: Part 1 http://www.canopylaw.com/about.php?pg=12&lt;/ref&gt;
* valuing the barriers to entry into the industry niche that the company operates in.

== Valuation overview ==

The Market Penetration Model focuses on the synergy and opportunities for fast growth between the target company and the acquiring company. It prioritises ability to exploit future customer opportunities over previous financial performance.&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt;

Many of the [[web 2.0]] start up successes are valued using this method, due to the perceived value of customer attention over past profit.&lt;ref&gt;How the sale of Instagram shows that the value of a business is not based on profit http://www.canopylaw.com/about.php?pg=2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages/disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===

MPM has some advantages over other valuation methods:

* Values intangible factors: such as customer attention, which are not otherwise reflected in financial data.
* Modern: MPM is relevant to web based businesses whose value is not accurately portrayed in financial figures and hard assets.

=== Disadvantages ===

The main criticisms can be summarised as:

* Intangible: the assessment of the value of particular customer segmentation and industry niches is highly subjective.
* Reliance on competition between buyers: a buyer will not need to pay a premium for future growth potential if there is no competitive bidding process.

== Examples ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8598">The '''weighted average cost of capital''' ('''WACC''') is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. The WACC is commonly referred to as the firm's [[cost of capital]]. Importantly, it is dictated by the external market and not by management. The WACC represents the minimum return that a company must earn on an existing asset base to satisfy its creditors, owners, and other providers of capital, or they will invest elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Nuno Fernandes"&gt;Fernandes, Nuno. 2014, Finance for Executives: A Practical Guide for Managers, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies raise money from a number of sources: [[common stock]], [[preferred stock]], straight [[debt]], [[Convertible bond|convertible debt]], [[Exchangeable bond|exchangeable debt]], [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]], [[Option (finance)|options]], [[Pension|pension liabilities]], [[executive stock option]]s, governmental subsidies, and so on. Different securities, which represent different sources of finance, are expected to generate different returns. The WACC is calculated taking into account the relative weights of each component of the [[capital structure]]. The more complex the company's capital structure, the more laborious it is to calculate the WACC.

Companies can use WACC to see if the investment projects available to them are worthwhile to undertake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Bennet Stewart III | title = The Quest for Value | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
In general, the WACC can be calculated with the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=James A. |last1=Miles |first2= John R. |last2=Ezzell |title=The weighted average cost of capital, perfect capital markets and project life: a clarification |journal=Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis |volume=15 |number=3 |date=September 1980 |pages=719–730 |doi=10.2307/2330405|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.6733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{WACC}  = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N r_i \cdot MV_i }{\sum_{i=1}^N MV_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of sources of capital (securities, types of liabilities); &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the required [[rate of return]] for security &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;MV_i&lt;/math&gt; is the market value of all outstanding securities &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case where the company is financed with only equity and debt, the average cost of capital is computed as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\text{WACC}  = \frac{D}{D+E}K_d + \frac{E}{D+E}K_e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the total debt, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the total shareholder's equity, &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cost of capital#Cost of debt|cost of debt]], and &lt;math&gt;K_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cost of equity]]. The market values of debt and equity should be used when computing the weights in the WACC formula.&lt;ref name="Nuno Fernandes 2"&gt;Fernandes, Nuno. Finance for Executives: A Practical Guide for Managers. NPV Publishing, 2014, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax effects===
Tax effects can be incorporated into this formula. For example, the WACC for a company financed by one type of shares with the total market value of &lt;math&gt;MV_e&lt;/math&gt; and cost of equity &lt;math&gt;R_e&lt;/math&gt; and one type of bonds with the total market value of &lt;math&gt;MV_d&lt;/math&gt; and cost of debt &lt;math&gt;R_d&lt;/math&gt;, in a country with corporate tax rate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, is calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;\text{WACC}  = \frac{MV_e}{MV_d+MV_e} \cdot R_e + \frac{MV_d}{MV_d+MV_e} \cdot R_d \cdot (1-t)&lt;/math&gt;

Actually carrying out this calculation has a problem. There are many plausible proxies for each element. As a result, a fairly wide range of values for the WACC for a given firm in a given year, may appear defensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Murray |last1=Frank |first2= Tao |last2=Shen |title=Investment, Q, and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital |ssrn= 2014367 |journal=Social Science Research Network|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
===Debt===

Advantages:
* no loss of control (voting rights)
* upper limit is placed on share of profits
* flotation costs are typically lower than equity
* interest expense is [[Tax deduction|tax deductible]]

Disadvantages:
* legally obliged to make payments no matter how tight the funds on hand are
* in the case of bonds, full face value comes due at one time
* taking on more debt = taking on more [[financial risk]] (more [[Systemic risk|systematic risk]]) requiring higher cash flows
&lt;br /&gt;
''The firm's debt component is stated as k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' and since there is a tax benefit from interest payments then the after tax WACC component is k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;(1-T); where T is the [[Tax|tax rate]].

===Equity===

Advantages:

* no legal obligation to pay (depends on class of shares)
* no maturity
* lower financial risk
* it could be cheaper than debt, with good prospects of profitability

Disadvantages:

* new equity dilutes current ownership share of profits and [[Suffrage|voting rights]] (control)
* cost of underwriting equity is much higher than debt
* too much equity = target for a [[Leveraged buyout|leveraged buy-out]] by another firm
* no [[tax shield]], dividends are not tax deductible, and may exhibit double-taxation

3 ways of calculating KK&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;:
#[[Capital asset pricing model|Capital Asset Pricing Model]]
#[[Dividend discount model|Dividend Discount Method]]
# Bond Yield Plus [[Risk premium|Risk Premium]] Approach

''Cost of new equity should be the adjusted cost for any underwriting fees terme flotation costs (F)''

K&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1-F) + g; where F = [[flotation cost]]s, D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is dividends, P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is price of the stock, and g is the growth rate.

Weighted average cost of capital equation:

WACC= (W&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;)[(K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;)(1-t)]+ (W&lt;sub&gt;pf&lt;/sub&gt;)(K&lt;sub&gt;pf&lt;/sub&gt;)+ (W&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt;)(K&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Marginal cost of capital schedule==
'''Marginal cost of capital''' ('''MCC''') '''schedule''' or an investment opportunity curve is a graph that relates the firm's Weighted cost of each unit of capital to the total amount of new capital raised. The first step in preparing the MCC schedule is to rank the projects using IRR. The higher the IRR the better off a project is.

The '''World Theater''' was a [[vaudeville]] and [[movie theater]] at 1506 Douglas Street in [[downtown Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffrey S. Spencer [researcher &amp; writer]|first=Kristine Gerber [project director]|title=Building for the ages : Omaha's architectural landmarks|date=2003|publisher=Omaha Books|location=Omaha, Neb.|isbn=0-9745410-1-X|page=41|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Its name was changed to the '''Omaha Theater''' in February 1935 when it was sold to new management.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;   It closed on February 26, 1978 and was razed in 1980 to allow for the construction of a parking garage.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;

== History ==
The 2,500 seat World Theater was designed by architect [[C. Howard Crane]] for the World Realty Company.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;   Crane, a native of Detroit, was one of the foremost theatrical architects in the United States.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;   Harry Lawrie, of the Omaha architectural firm of [[Mendelssohn, Fisher and Lawrie]], oversaw the project from Omaha.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;   The James Black Masonry and Construction Company served as the general contractors.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;  Construction took ten months.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;

The theater was constructed of brick on a steel frame.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;   The exterior was faced in glazed [[terra cotta]] all around.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;   Three grand arched windows with iron mullions separated by four sets of Corinthian columns dominated the front of the theater.&lt;ref name="World Theater, Cinema Treasures" /&gt;   Railings with balustrade sills completed the windows' ornamentation.&lt;ref name="World Theater, Cinema Treasures" /&gt;     The Corinthian columns supported an enriched frieze and cornice decorated with dentils and modillions.&lt;ref name="World Theater, Cinema Treasures" /&gt;   A parapet band with sculptured inserts and the inscribed words, ''World Theatre'', was centered at the top of the building.&lt;ref name="World Theater, Cinema Treasures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Omaha Theater|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/1210|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior included a large chandelier with a thousand cut-glass crystals hanging from the large center dome of gold and silver inlay.&lt;ref name="Beautiful Chandelier, World Theater"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beautiful Chandelier, World Theater|newspaper=The Omaha World-Herald Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|date=April 9, 1922|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Two smaller chandeliers hung from two lesser domes.&lt;ref name="Beautiful Chandelier, World Theater" /&gt;   In the lobby hung a chandelier of prismatic glass in the shape of a globe, surrounded by an orbit of comets, stars and crescents.&lt;ref name="Beautiful Chandelier, World Theater" /&gt;   Torchers of cathedral glass set on Corinthian shafts and marble bases are on the mezzanine foyer, and a ceiling of Chinese silk and Chinese coins decorated the women's lounge.&lt;ref name="Beautiful Chandelier, World Theater" /&gt;  The stage curtain was made of velvet with gold fringe and large tassels sewn by the Drapery Department of the [[J. L. Brandeis and Sons Store]].&lt;ref name="Brandeis Store Decorations"&gt;{{cite news|title=Opening of the New World Theater|newspaper=The Omaha World-Herald Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|date=April 23, 1922|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The velvet carpets, also provided by the J. L. Brandeis Store, were in harmonizing shades of blue and gold.&lt;ref name="Brandeis Store Decorations" /&gt;  Completing the Brandeis decorations were davenports and overstuffed chairs in the promenade lounge and other smaller lounges.&lt;ref name="Brandeis Store Decorations" /&gt;

A $45,000 pipe organ manufactured by Hope-Jones Wurlitzer was installed by the theater's opening.&lt;ref name="Pipe Organ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Music|newspaper=The Omaha World-Herald Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|date=April 30, 1947|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The grand opening of the World Theater was on Saturday, April 15, 1922.&lt;ref name="Douglas Street Was Crowded Yesterday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Douglas Street Was Crowded Yesterday|newspaper=The Omaha World-Herald Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|date=April 16, 1922|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A crowd of over 10,000 attended the opening with shows at 2:00 pm, 4:20 pm, 6:45 pm and 9:15 pm.&lt;ref name="World Opening Planned"&gt;{{cite news|title=World|newspaper=The Omaha World-Herald Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|date=April 14, 1922|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prices for the grand opening were 50 cents for unreserved seats, and 75 cents with a reservation.&lt;ref name="Douglas Street Was Crowded Yesterday" /&gt;

In February 1935 the World Theater was sold and the new management renamed it the Omaha Theater.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;   It closed on February 26, 1978.  When plans for redevelopment of the theater failed, the building was razed in 1980 and a parking garage built at the location.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Alexander was great philanthropist, just like his brother, who donated the most of his wealth to charity.&lt;ref name="nqy"/&gt; Around 1908, Alexander founded the society for feeding poor school children in Zagreb, where he was also the treasurer.&lt;ref name="hswc"&gt;{{hr icon}} Sandra Prlenda; The History of Social Work in Croatia, 1900- 1960; stranica 14,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Dundović J.

Every society which had the fortune to have Alexander as a treasurer, never had problems with finances. During [[World War I]], Alexander organized and largely financed the "Council for helping the unemployed and disabled employees of trading, industrial and financial institutions", which he also chaired as the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}}  Imenik dostojanstvenika, činovnika i javnih službenika Kraljevina Hrvatske i Slavonije, 1918: 169.&lt;/ref&gt; His greatest merit was when he, fall of 1914, established a public kitchen for the poor citizens and families of those who fought on the battlefield during the war.&lt;ref name="nqy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hswc"/&gt; Alexander founded the charity "Prehrana".&lt;ref name="nqy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hswc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Zaklada predsjednika i osnivača "Prehrane" Šandora A.

"Prehrana" distributed millions of meals, according to some estimates over 15 millions. At the beginning of the World War I, Alexander donated 1 million golden [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|guldens]] as an irreversible war loan to the state. For that,  on August 13, 1918, Alexander was knighted by [[Charles I of Austria]] and awarded with the title ''pl.'' (plemeniti {{hr icon}} = noble ) ''Sesvetski''.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}}  Viktor Anton Duišin; Heraldički zbornik, Zbornik plemstva u Hrvatskoj; Slavoniji, Dalmaciji, Bosni-Hercegovini, Dubrovniku, Kotoru i Vojvodini; 1938 Zagreb; 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
