It was founded in 1974.&lt;ref name="misshist"&gt;American Councils for International Education. [http://www.americancouncils.org/missionHist.php Mission &amp; History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001180436/http://www.americancouncils.org/missionHist.php |date=2009-10-01 }}. Accessed November 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president of ACTR is Thomas Garza.

In the mid-1980s with the gradual opening of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society, the ACTR board established [[The American Council for Collaboration in Education and Language Study]] (ACCELS). ACCELS undertook the administration of U.S. government-funded exchanges for a variety of audiences, including high school and undergraduate students, teachers, professionals, and academics.

In 1998, ACTR and ACCELS united to one organization. Now ACTR and ACCELS continue as divisions of [[American Councils for International Education]].  ACTR is the professional association and the focus of educational, training, and research programs for U.S. citizens; ACCELS administers exchange, training, and technical assistance programs with the countries of eastern Europe, Russia, and Eurasia.

ACTR is also a member organization of the [[International Association of Teachers of Russian Language and Literature]] (MAPRYAL).&lt;ref&gt;MAPRYAL.

'''Bettina Arndt''' (born 1 August 1949) is an Australian sex therapist, journalist, author and clinical psychologist.

== Early life ==
Arndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 – 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''née'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 – 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children&lt;ref name="Talking"&gt;{{Cite web| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131028114106/http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1951266.htm | archive-date = 28 October 2013 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1951266.htm|title=Transcripts: Bettina Arndt|work=Talking Heads with Peter Thompson|publisher=[[ABCTV]]|date=18 June 2007|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (brothers Christopher and Nicholas).

== Education ==
In 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to Sydney where she trained as a clinical psychologist specialising in sexual therapy. In 1973, she completed her [[Master of Psychology]] degree at the [[University of New South Wales]], where her thesis was on orgasm problems.&lt;ref name="Overington"&gt;{{Cite news |last= Overington| first= Carolyn | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140528090559/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/ten-questions-bettina-arndt/story-e6frg996-1225926450012 | archive-date = 28 May 2014 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/ten-questions-bettina-arndt/story-e6frg996-1225926450012|title=Ten Questions:Bettina Arndt|work=[[The Australian]]  |date = 20 September 2010|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Arndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982. Her work in sex education also involved post-graduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cadzow | first = Jane | title = The sex advocate | url = http://www.bettinaarndt.com.au/wp-content/uploads/The-Sex-Advocate-Good-Weekend.pdf | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend (supplement)]] &amp;#124; [[The Age]] | date = 28 August 2010 | accessdate = 7 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arndt moved on to writing about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia.

In 1986, Arndt married the American lawyer Warren Scott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/style/bettina-m-arndt-marries-a-lawyer.html |title=Bettina M.

She lived in Manhattan for five years, and while living in the United States wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in [[Canberra]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989). In August 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.

In 2007, the Australian television programme ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' broadcast allegations of plagiarism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Paul Barry]] (presenter) |date= 30 April 2007 |title= Bettina's organic leftovers |series= [[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]] |medium= Television  |url= http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1910530.htm |access-date= 7 June 2017 |publisher= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Arndt, allegations that were not disputed.

''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire, was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.

Arndt has served on a number of committees advising the Australian government on policy matters, including the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, the National Advisory Committee on Ageing, the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team and the Child Support Review Reference Group.

==Release of "Decision Earth"==
Its asserted aim was assisting students to make informed consumer product choices, and to educate then in the environmental impact of their choices:&lt;ref name="ERIC_RecordDetails-ED3541_Decision: Earth"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The unit focuses on the concept of consumer product life cycle analysis, an approach to assessing the environmental impacts of a product at each stage in its life from raw materials extraction through disposal. Using this approach, a product is evaluated in terms of energy consumed, atmospheric and waterborne emissions generated and solid waste created for disposal.&lt;ref name="ERIC_RecordDetails-ED3541_Decision: Earth"/&gt;

For Dewey, this distinction was largely a false one; like [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Lev Vygotsky]], he viewed the mind and its formation as a communal process. Thus the individual is a meaningful concept only when regarded as an inextricable part of his or her society, and the society has no meaning apart from its realization in the lives of its individual members. As evidenced in his later ''Experience and Nature'' (1925), this practical element, [[learning by doing]], arose from his subscription to the philosophical school of [[Pragmatism]].

==Synopsis==
In ''Democracy and Education'', Dewey argues that the primary ineluctable facts of the birth and death of each one of the constituent members in a social group determine the necessity of education. On one hand, there is the contrast between the immaturity of the new-born members of the group (its future sole representatives) and the maturity of the adult members who possess the knowledge and customs of the group. On the other hand, there is the necessity that these immature members be not merely physically preserved in adequate numbers, but that they be initiated into the interests, purposes, information, skill, and practices of the mature members: otherwise the group will cease its characteristic life.

Dewey observes that even in a "savage" tribe, the achievements of adults are far beyond what the immature members would be capable of if left to themselves. With the growth of civilization, the gap between the original capacities of the immature and the standards and customs of the elders increases. Mere physical growing up and mastery of the bare necessities of subsistence will not suffice to reproduce the life of the group. Deliberate effort and the taking of thoughtful pains are required. Beings who are born not only unaware of, but quite indifferent to, the aims and habits of the social group have to be rendered cognizant of them and actively interested. According to Dewey, education, and education alone, spans the gap.

==Reception==
Dewey's ideas were never broadly and deeply integrated into the practices of American public schools, though some of his values and terms were widespread.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Fifty Major Thinkers on Education (From Confucius to Dewey). Routledge, February 2002, Edited by Joy Palmer, Liora Bresler, David Edward Cooper. pp 177-178&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progressive education]] (both as espoused by Dewey, and in the more popular and inept forms of which Dewey was critical) was essentially scrapped during the [[Cold War]], when the dominant concern in education was creating and sustaining a scientific and technological elite for military purposes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} In the post-Cold War period, however, progressive education had reemerged in many [[school reform]] and [[education]] theory circles as a thriving field of [[inquiry learning]] and [[inquiry-based science]].

Some find it cumbersome that Dewey's [[philosophical anthropology]], unlike [[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Egan]], [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and [[Nietzsche]], does not account for the origin of thought of the modern mind in the [[aesthetic]], more precisely the [[myth]], but instead in the original occupations and industries of ancient people, and eventually in the [[history of science]].&lt;ref name="Polito2005"&gt;Theodora Polito, ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/epat/2005/00000037/00000004/art00003 Educational Theory as Theory of Culture: A Vichian perspective on the educational theories of John Dewey and Kieran Egan]'' Educational Philosophy and Theory, Vol. 37, No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of this approach is that it does not account for the origin of
[[cultural institution]]s, which can be accounted for by the aesthetic. [[Language]] and its development, in Dewey's philosophical anthropology, have not a central role but are instead a consequence of the cognitive capacity.&lt;ref name="Polito2005" /&gt;

==Legacy==
{{POV section|date=March 2014}}
While Dewey's educational theories have enjoyed a broad popularity during his lifetime and after, they have a troubled history of implementation.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt; Dewey's writings can also be difficult to read, and his tendency to reuse commonplace words and phrases to express extremely complex reinterpretations of them makes him susceptible to misunderstanding. So while he held the role of a leading [[public intellectual]], he was often misinterpreted, even by fellow academics. Many enthusiastically embraced what they mistook for Dewey's philosophy, but which in fact bore little or a distorted resemblance to it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Simultaneously, other progressive educational theories, often influenced by Dewey but not directly derived from him, were also becoming popular, such as [[Educational perennialism]] which is [[teacher]]-centered as opposed to student-centered. The term 'progressive education' grew to encompass numerous contradictory theories and practices, as documented by historians like [[Herbert Kliebard]].

Several versions of progressive education succeeded in transforming the educational landscape: the utter ubiquity of guidance counseling, to name but one example, springs from the progressive period. Radical variations of educational progressivism were troubled and short-lived, a fact that supports some understandings of the notion of failure.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} But they were perhaps too rare and ill-funded to constitute a thorough test.

== Structure of the education system ==

The Bahamas education includes primary education, secondary education, tertiary education, with a more recent addition of preschool institutions before those three stages. All education that is given to the students in the Bahamas along with their policies are made by the Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Inclusive_Education/Reports/kingston_07/bahamas_inclusion_07.pdf|title=Caribbean Symposium on Inclusive Education|last=Smith|first=Ross|date=December 2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Education is led by the Minister of Education and a few other council members that are in charge of various tasks for the education system as a whole. The Minister of Education strictly handles policies and guidelines that have to do with private and public schools. The Permanent Secretary is assistant to the Minister of Education in organization and administering the tasks of The Ministry of Education. The individual who is in charge of the Department of Education is the Director of Education and also education officer of the Minister of Education. The actual Department of Education deals with tasks being given out to schools and the guidelines their systems need to follow.

&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As of today, it is required that all children from the ages 5 to 16 years old are to be signed up for some sort of educational facility. Despite private education, public education is free to all people who wish to enroll. There are no racial, gender, or economic background limitations when it comes to who receives education as well. In 2007, about 66,000 students were in enrolled in some kind of institution that is public. Over half of that number are already in their primary education stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Early Childhood/Preschool Education ==

Centers for children who fell in the early childhood category didn't have access to the education they do now. The government of the Bahamas assisted in implementing preschool centers for children under the age of 5. They also took action to make daycare centers and private preschools for the significant number of children who were in need of it. The importance of the expansion of preschools was based on the fact that children needed to be more equipped when entering first grade. Most of them don't have the fundamental skills but some of them do  that would allow them to comprehend what is going on in that next level.

In order to guarantee success in the preschools, it was necessary for the government to establish the Preschool and Daycare Centre Council. They oversee all systems and functions that take place in the daycares and private preschools across the country. 64 preschools that are stand alone or a preschool unit, an addition to a primary school, reside all across the Bahamas today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.19ccembahamas.com/single-post/2015/06/17/THE-PATH-TO-PRESCHOOL-A-FOCUS-ON-PRESCHOOL-EDUCATION-IN-THE-BAHAMAS|title=19 CCEM In The Bahamas|website=19 CCEM In The Bahamas|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every couple of years the Council re-evaluates the curriculum of these preschools to stay updated with the changing world around them. Their curriculum is the standard reading, writing, and numeracy, but the Council continues to strive to bring technology in the mix. Technology makes up most of the workforce that they will eventually enter into, so it is crucial for them to be ready for when they use it in their primary and secondary schools.

== Primary Education ==

With the number of children living in urban areas of the Bahamas rising, it was about time for primary schools to make an appearance. Primary Education begins at age 5 and lasts for six years. Most students speak English by this point in their studies, but there are occasions where a child is still coming to understand English as their second language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.educoas.org/Portal/bdigital/contenido/interamer/BkIACD/Interamer/Interamerhtml/Millerhtml/mil_beth.htm|title=EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN THE BAHAMAS|last=Bethel|first=Keva|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary schools heavily reinforce English as their second language so from that point on, there is a commonality among all the students. As a result, primary school teachers are taught the mechanisms used to teach the students English in addition to their regular everyday studies. Those include: math, science, language arts, reading, etc.

At this stage, educators are guiding the students to become problem-solvers and make connections from the curriculum to real life.

== Secondary Education ==

Secondary Education is a total of three years, but is divided into two equal parts of the time they spend there. The first half, considered junior high, accommodates students from ages eleven to fourteen. The second half of those three years, considered senior high, accommodates ages fourteen to seventeen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reason for this split is merely because the schools don't want any bullying taking place on the younger students and, in turn, affecting their focus on their schoolwork.

The secondary education curriculum was designed to expose the students to cultural subjects as well as vocational and technical subjects. The hope is the students will be presented opportunities that integrate them socially and culturally to fully comprehend life out of the institution.

By the end of grade nine, students are administered a Bahamas Junior Certificate examination that they must pass this exam in order to move onto their next level. The Bahamas General Certificate of Secondary Education is given to students as an exit exam at the end of grade 12.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is expected that students make it all the way to grade 12 once they enrol in the first grade. Most students complete secondary school with no problem, but it is up to them if they wish to pursue a post-secondary school institution.

== Tertiary Education/University of the Bahamas ==

There are a number of small-scale community colleges across the country that are open to any student looking to further their post-secondary education. As expected, there is an application process that students must complete before being accepted.

In 1974, one of the larger colleges within the Bahamas opened its doors with offerings of associate degrees, certificates, and diplomas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The College of the Bahamas was an equivalent of a state school in terms of how prestigious it was. As time went on, the Bahamas realized that in order for them to keep up with the competitive edge of universities, they would have to expand their programs. Various bachelor's degrees were added in fields of Nursing, Business, and Education around the early 1990s which accelerated their program developments.

The College Council continued to grow their institution by adding various buildings to provide educational environments for the different career fields. All of the expanding they were doing was what set off the idea of creating an upgraded College of the Bahamas: University of the Bahamas. A committee was created to handle all of the planning that would go into the future University and by August 2006 a plan was finalized.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ub.edu.bs/about-us/history/|title=History - University of The Bahamas|work=University of The Bahamas|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition was one that took time, but by August 2016 the President of the University's academic committee, Jerome Fitzgerald, announced that the College of the Bahamas was officially the [[University of the Bahamas]].

The University expresses that its mission is to promote a higher education for their students that will benefit them in all aspects of their careers. University of the Bahamas strives to build the commonwealth of their country, so it is more than worth it to them to have built something as large-scale as the new institution.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Education and Prison Reform ==
To increase rehabilitation rates in the Bahamas, there was an education program introduced to help the imprisoned become better prepared for release and integration into society. The World Declaration on Education for All organization works to reduce illiteracy among adults and has been an active advocator for bettering the education system in prisons in the Caribbean. The goal pf the World Declaration on Education for All was to educate all people through growth and development of any and all education programs in place at different correctional facilities. The organization focused on the skills inmates had and worked to further develop them and introduce new skills that would be necessary to education and release. They worked with other countries and organizations to educate many people across the world. It was in the 1990s, the Minister of Education of the Bahamas reviewed the EFA guidelines and initiated a 5-year program to better the education system in the prisons in the Bahamas. There were 6 formal programs directly linked to education and 3 informal programs indirectly linked to providing a better education to inmates. Providing inmates with education, enables them to find job opportunities and increases the chances of successfully becoming a part of society. Reintegration is an important part of being released from prison. It is when officers try to aid inmates with necessary information and tools to successfully rejoin society and return to the life you may have had before imprisoned. The program focused on individuals between the ages of 16 and 24.&lt;ref&gt;Niles, B., &amp; Bernard, A. (2000). Beginning Again Approaches to Education for Rehabilitation in Caribbean Prisons. EDUCATION FOR ALL IN THE CARIBBEAN: ASSESSMENT 2000 MONOGRAPH SERIES 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special Institutions ==

The Bahama's education system does all it can to make sure that all of their students receive some form of access to education whenever possible. They have a Special Services Division who recognizes the needs of the disabled students and creates an environment where they can thrive in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Special Education schools, located on New Providence and Grand Bahamas, provide this type of environment as they are strictly for children with mental and physical limitations.

On the other hand, not all handicapped students are recommended to go to these schools. Students who are autistic or even hearing impaired are encouraged to attend the public schools because educators want a blended environment with no child being left out.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, the students will receive realistic scenarios because they weren't sheltered from other people. Teachers are well-equipped with various counseling, guidance, and psychology tools to refine the learning material in the classrooms.

== Technology disadvantage ==

The Bahamas have come a long way since the 1950s with their education systems. Although students were still able to learn, they had difficulty thriving in the classroom due to the lack of updated materials provided by the schools. They used what resembles a white board to take all their notes on instead of a journal or workbook for each of their classes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This system proved to not be efficient because students were struggling when it came time to learning handfuls of material without proper storage for their notes.

One educator at a technical college in the Bahamas discusses how although the teachers have access to technology such as smart boards or computers, the students do not.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T002&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;docId=GALE%7CA394184282&amp;docType=Article&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA394184282&amp;searchId=R4&amp;userGroupName=cod_lrc&amp;inPS=true{{dead link|date=April 2017}}{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education is becoming more technology-based and younger teachers that are coming into the education workforce are equipped to teach with such technology, but with students having a lack of knowledge about the advances, the teachers can't do this.

Another instructor at a local college argues that the government will see a positive outcome if their students were able to take advantage of online learning. Most students spend a majority of their time online outside of class, so it is likely that they would be more inclined to participate in class projects. The future is projected to be very dependent on technology and the students will gather the tools they need once they are more exposed to how it works.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

There have been attempts to try to fix this issue with the education system, but there have been many bumps in the road.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2018}} Institutions have come across a lack of funding when trying to teach the instructors the process of actually demonstrating to the students how to use the online programs. Not to mention, teachers weren't expecting all the overtime hours they would have to put in when learning the online programs in addition to teaching their regular classroom hours. Many of them opted out of learning the programs which leaves a huge disconnect if all the teachers aren't interested in participating.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Most recently,{{When|date=January 2018}} the Bahamas government has discussed the importance of technology, especially when students enter the workforce. For example, if a student enters the medical field, it is possible they will need to be educated on how to use certain equipment or technology that their job may require. The government recognizes this concern, but has yet to make any big moves about requiring technology in the classrooms. Some families have computers in their homes while others can't afford the luxury. The goal of the future Bahamas is to make technology accessible to all through whatever means it takes to get them there.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Eleni Lambiri''' (9 February 1889 – 30 March 1960) was a [[Greece|Greek]] conductor and composer.

==Life and career==
Eleni Lambiri was born in [[Athens]], daughter of the composer [[Georgios Lambiris]] and granddaudhter of the poet [[Andreas Laskaratos]]. She studied composition with [[Edoardo Sacredote]] at the Athens Conservatory (from 1907 to 1908). In fact she was the first woman who studied composition at the Athens Conservatory, for this reason she gained the title of the first Greek woman composer. Subsequently, she studied composition with [[Max Reger]] and conducting with [[Hans Scheidt]] in the Royal Conservatory of [[Leipzig]] (from 1 October 1908 to 27 July 1911). She graduated from the Royal Conservatory of Leipzig in 1911. In 1913 the operetta «To apokriatiko oneiro» (A dream in carnival), with text of [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]] and composition of Eleni Lambiri, was performed at the Panellinion Τheatre.&lt;ref&gt;''Ta Nea Kefallinias kai Ithakis''; 3/9/1960; issue number 172&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing her studies, she worked in [[Milan]] as a conductor. On 15 January 1915 she registered the author's rights of the opereta «Isolma»,&lt;ref&gt;''Gazzetta Ufficiale del Regno d`Italia''; issue number 198 of 10/08/1915, page 4765&lt;/ref&gt; at the Milan regional registry (number of registry 64794). «Isolma» was an operetta in three acts fully composed and written by Eleni Lambiri. This opereta has been recorded in 1958, by Totis Karalivanos as conductor and Spiros Kapsaskis as choir director.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjmRXOWDjy0&lt;/ref&gt;  In about 1925 she returned to [[Patras]], Greece, where she worked as director of the Patras Conservatory until 1953. At the same time she wrote the music criticism for the local newspaper of Patras «Neologos Patron».  She died at the Municipal Hospital of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=Eleni+Lambiri&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cAEcTcPZJIGB8ga62ODvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eleni%20Lambiri&amp;f=false|title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first=Julie Anne|last=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Ensor''' J.P. (17 December 1769 – 3 December 1843) was an eminent Irish author and lawyer.

Ensor was born in [[Ardress, County Armagh]] and lived in [[Ardress house]], [[Ireland]] and educated at the [[Royal School, Armagh]] followed by [[Trinity College Dublin]]. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1792. He married Esther Weld (sister of famous Irish explorer, author and painter [[Isaac Weld]]) on 7 January 1804. His father, George Ensor, and uncle, [[John Ensor]], were architects who designed much of [[Merrion Square]], [[Parnell Square]], the Rotunda of the [[Rotunda Hospital]], now the [[Ambassador Theatre (Dublin)]], the [[Hotel Saint George]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecastlehotelgroup.com/hotel-st-george-page27956.html thecastlehotelgroup.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Castle Hotel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecastlehotelgroup.com/the-castle-hotel-page28771.html thecastlehotelgroup.com]&lt;/ref&gt; - all in [[Dublin]]. They originated from [[Coventry]] and [[Wilnecote]], [[England]]. George (Senior) was the first of the 'Irish' Ensors and John the first of the [[Rollesby Hall]]/[[New Zealand]] Ensors.

He was  a well-known political writer and patriot, author of at least twenty books of educational and Irish interest, and the father-in-law of [[J. P. Prendergast]] the historian. He was a friend of [[Daniel O'Connell]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]]. He accompanied [[John Stuart Mill]] (aged 14) to France in 1820. Was a grand juror and [[High Sheriff]] (1806) of [[County Armagh]] and died on 3 December 1843 at the family home, [[Ardress House]], now property of the National Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-ardresshouse/ nationaltrust.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18057">'''Group cognition''' is a social, largely linguistic phenomenon whereby a group of people produce a sequence of utterances that performs a cognitive act. That is, if a similar sequence was uttered or thought by an individual it would be considered an act of cognition or thinking. The group can be a small group, such as 3-5 people talking together or working together online. The group can also be a larger collective, such as a classroom of students or a global community contributing asynchronously to an extended discourse on a problem or topic or to a knowledge repository like Wikipedia. The theory of group cognition is a [[postcognitivism]] philosophy, which considers a larger unit of analysis than an individual mind as a producer of cognitive activities such as creative problem solving.

== Concepts of Group Cognition ==

'''Group cognition''' refers to an analytic viewpoint that looks beyond individual cognition to include the interaction of individuals with other people, with artifacts and with cultural resources as producing cognitive products through their interaction. Accordingly, cognition or thinking can be analyzed in a number of ways:

•	An individual thinks and speaks. The thought takes place in the individual’s mind (inside the head) and can be expressed in the (external) world through speech, gesture, writing, artifacts. This has been a '''traditional cognition''' view since Descartes.&lt;ref name=Descartes /&gt;

•	A small group of people collaborates, usually through spoken or written communication, and produces utterances or other products that cannot be attributed to any one of the group members by themselves. The individuals may build on each other’s ideas (transaction).&lt;ref name=Wegner /&gt; Also, there may be group processes or features of the group interaction, which themselves contribute to the '''small-group cognition'''.&lt;ref name=Stahl2006 /&gt;

•	One or more people may interact with various kinds of artifacts, such as software applications&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, G. (2016) ''Constructing Dynamic Triangles Together: The Development of Mathematical Group Cognition''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; or software agents, resulting in '''extended cognition'''.&lt;ref name=Adams /&gt;

•	One or more people may interact within a social setting, such as a culture or a socio-technical system, resulting in '''social cognition''' or '''situated learning'''.&lt;ref name=Lave /&gt;

•	Larger groups of people, artifacts and cultural settings (activity systems) may interact, resulting in '''collective intelligence''' or '''distributed cognition'''.&lt;ref name=Hutchins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pea /&gt;

=== Small-Group Cognition ===

Small groups of people can engage in activities such as mathematical problem solving and can accomplish intellectual achievements. These accomplishments often proceed by means of interactions in which ideas emerge from the discourse between multiple perspectives and cannot be credited to any one person. An utterance by one person is elicited by and responds to the previous discussion and group context in ways that would otherwise not have arisen, and the utterance is structured so as to elicit specific kinds of responses from other participants. Through a sequence of complexly and subtly interwoven interactions, cognitive results are achieved. The meaning of what was said is determined at the group level of the interactions, and is not in general attributable primarily to the expression of pre-existing mental representations of the individual participants.

Of course, small-group cognition relies on the ability of the participating individuals to interpret and understand the group meaning. But even this individual understanding is fundamentally situated in, and emerges from, the interactions of the group, which are structured so as to coordinate these understandings. The philosophy of group cognition does not deny individual cognition, but calls for a re-thinking of the ontology, epistemology and methodology for exploring mind.

Social psychologists, sociologists and organizational theorist have occasionally referred to group cognition. However, these disciplines have generally rejected the notion for fear of conjuring up images of trans-personal "metaphysical" phenomena. Sociologists emphasized the negative possibilities of "[[group think]]" or "[[mass psychology]]", whereby members of a group are persuaded by peer pressure to forsake their own individual rationality. Psychology is focused on the individual as the unit of analysis. Twentieth century psychology reacts against popularized readings of earlier idealist philosophy and tends to reduce social phenomena to individual psychology or rational calculations of self-interest of individuals.

===Other Forms of Group Cognition===

== Analyzing Online Group Cognition ==

Online interactions, if carefully planned for, can provide ideal data for research on group cognition. If the interaction takes place through text and persistent drawings, logs can preserve an excellent detailed record of virtually everything that took place across the network. Thus, one can analyze everything that was available to the participants and shared by them. In contrast to video analysis, there is no need to worry about camera angles, lighting, transcriptions, interview protocols, coding reliability, etc. to produce an accurate and useful record.

The data can be analyzed for evidence of the accomplishment of problem solving and other tasks (group cognition) through collaborative interaction within the online group. This can be achieved through close analysis of how groups of participants co-construct shared meanings and sustain joint activities through the sequentiality and relatedness of their situated contributions and their social participation. Of course, there are many questions that cannot be addressed this way, such as what goes on in individual heads and what is remembered by specific participants years later. But these issues are beyond the scope of a group-cognition research agenda. The group accomplishments have been largely ignored in previous educational research, but may constitute what is unique to computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and most promising for the future of computer support for building collaborative knowledge.

== Research and Analysis ==

=== The [[Virtual Math Teams]] (VMT) Research Project ===
The [[Virtual Math Teams]] (VMT) research project was directed by [[Gerry Stahl]] from 2003-2014. It is continuing at the Math Forum as part of NCTM. The VMT project is a prototypical example of [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] research.

The VMT research group at [[Drexel University]] and the Math Forum has developed a methodology for chat analysis that is tuned to the exploration of small-group cognition in a chat environment. This approach is inspired by ethnomethodologically-informed [[conversation analysis]], but the domain differs in multiple significant ways from that of most conversation analysis: Chat is online so neither the participants nor their production of utterances is visible; interactions are text-based so they lack intonation, personality, accent; the topics are math problem solving, rather than socializing; the participants are primarily teenage students engaged in learning, not adult domain experts; the groups are usually 3 to 5 instead of dyads; the participants generally do not know each other or know much about each other; etc.

The VMT Project's analysis looks closely, line-by-line, at how chat postings build upon each other sequentially; how they respond to previous postings and elicit future ones; how they establish the social order of the group interaction; how they repair problems of co-construction of shared group meanings; how they construct, reference, remember and name resources that they use in their [[meaning-making]]. Analysis considers the context within which interactions occur, building up understanding of types of interaction through which targeted hypotheses can be explored in quasi-experimental investigations, ethnographic observation or structured interviews.

The aim of the VMT Project is to understand students interactions, for example: How students approach a given problem and make use of the [[affordances]] of their technology? How do different technical details change or mediate the interactions and the methods that students develop? Such understanding can guide the design of [[Computer-supported collaborative learning|CSCL]] systems to support effective networked learning.

===Other Research Centers or Projects===

==The Small-Group Unit of Analysis==

Small-group cognition focuses on the small group as the unit of analysis. In this, it contrasts with theories that are oriented to larger units like [[communities of practice]] as well as to the individual person. In this sense, the theory of small-group cognition complements theories like [[distributed cognition]] and [[cultural-historical activity theory]] as well as individual cultural psychology. Small-group cognition theory proposes that small groups are the "engines of knowledge building." The knowing that groups build up in manifold forms is what becomes internalized by their members as individual learning and externalized in their communities as certifiable knowledge. In this sense, the small-group phenomena underlie much of what takes place at the larger scale.

The Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]]&lt;ref name=Vygotsky /&gt; argued that higher-level human cognition is not a biological given aptitude. Rather, individual cognition is developed gradually through social interaction. Various adult intellectual abilities are results of internalization processes through which interpersonal interactions are transformed. For instance, speech begins with talk among people in small groups and dyads. Gradually, young children around the age of four transform speech with others into self-talk, and later into silent speech. The flow of silent speech evolves into the thought of the individual. Such a view reverses the perspective of reductionist psychology and argues for a developmental priority of group cognition. In this sense, the small-group phenomena underlie much of what takes place at the individual scale.

=== Writings on Small-Group Cognition ===

•	Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2006 /&gt; discusses the potential of computer and network technology to promote group cognition. It reflects on the methodology for analyzing group cognition and provides some analyzed examples of small group cognitive interaction. The author coined the term ''group cognition'' while writing this book. The term had rarely been used before. The motivation for the VMT research project emerges from the previous CSCW and CSCL studies reported in this book.

•	Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2009 /&gt; presents 28 chapters analyzing various aspects of the study of group cognition as conducted by the [[Virtual Math Teams]] Project. Chapters are written by the editor, [[Gerry Stahl]], and other members of the VMT research team, visiting researchers who worked on the project and international colleagues. The VMT project was designed specifically to study group cognition in small teams of students discussing mathematics online. A scientific methodology for designing experiments, collecting data, analyzing logs and developing theory is discussed in the book. A number of case studies of excerpts from logs are included. Several chapters discuss larger implications and philosophic issues.

•	Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2013 /&gt; discusses the potential of computer and network technology to promote group cognition. It reflects on the design-based research methodology for analyzing group cognition and provides some analyzed examples of small group cognitive interaction. It includes philosophic, technical, historical, mathematical and pedagogical considerations—providing a multi-faceted view of the VMT research project.

•	 Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2015 /&gt; is a monograph analyzing the work of a group of three students as they become introduced to dynamic mathematics during eight hour-long online sessions using VMT with GeoGebra. The monograph documents the team's development of mathematical group cognition. Introductory chapters motivate the study and discuss its case-study method. Concluding chapters reflect on the group-cognitive development and its implications for re-design of the math curriculum.

•	Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2014 /&gt; presents a philosophical argument for the concept of small-group cognition.

[[File:Hauora.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[whare]], named with domains of Hauora.]]
The '''Hauora''' is a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[philosophy]] of [[health]] and [[well-being]] unique to [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tki.org.nz/r/health/curriculum/statement/page31_e.php Te Kete Ipurangi (TKI) – The Online Learning Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four dimensions of Hauora; Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing - health), Taha Hinengaro (Mental &amp; Emotional wellbeing - self-confidence), Taha Whanau (Social Wellbeing - self-esteem) and Taha Wairua (Spiritual wellbeing - personal beliefs) There is physical, emotional/mental, social and spiritual caring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/entertainment/attitude/8221630/Chant-grab-their-chances Chant grab their chances]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whare Tapa Wha model represents aspects of Hauora as the four walls of a [[Wharenui|whare]], each wall representing a different dimension. All four dimensions are necessary for strength and stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durie|first1=Mason|title=Whaiora; Maori Health Development|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Other models of Hauora have been designed. For example, in 1997, Moeau suggested that a fifth dimension, [[Tangata whenua|whenua]] (connection with the land), be added to the original model. In 2001, Hokowhitu also tried to have whenua added to the Tapawha model but again it was not added.

The Hauora has been integrated into [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s in New Zealand to allow students to learn and understand the traditional Māori aspects of well-being.

'''Helen Frances Codere''' (September 10, 1917 &amp;ndash; June 5, 2009) was an American cultural anthropologist who received her BA from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1939  and her PhD in [[anthropology]] from [[Columbia University]] where she studied with [[Ruth Benedict]]. She is best known for her work with the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] people of coastal [[British Columbia]], Canada, known formerly as the "Kwakiutl."

Her academic years spanned over fifty years and included professorships at [[Vassar College]], the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Bennington College]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

== Personal life ==

Helen Codere was born in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], but soon after moved to Minnesota. She never married and stated that "single women lack some of the freedom and mobility of single men; they are objects of even greater curiosity and scrutiny in a world in which going two by two is projected",&lt;ref name="negri"&gt;Negri, Gloria. 2009 Helen Codere – A Real Anthropologist. The Boston Globe, July 5:http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/07/05/helen_codere_91_anthropologist_studied_rwanda_pacific_northwest/, accessed January 23, 2012. Print&lt;/ref&gt; although she did have a longtime companion, Marion Tait.&lt;ref name="irvine"&gt;Irvine, Judith T., Stephen Pastner. 2009 In Memoriam – Helen Codere, Anthropology News. October 1.http://fadograph.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/helen-codere-in-anthropology-news/, accessed January 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her vacation place in Vermont closely resembles her childhood interest of living like the author [[Henry David Thoreau]] had once done – it had no running water, but a system of barrels with gutters along the two cabins. Codere favored khaki-type trousers and casual shirts. She is known for being a "renaissance woman," by her friends. "She was extremely accurate with words, had a great sense of humor, a compelling laugh, and was fiercely independent. She was adamant about reading the paper every day, and always looked ready to go on a hike".&lt;ref name="negri"/&gt;

==Career==
Codere held positions in the [[American Ethnological Society]] and various faculty appointments, notably [[Brandeis]] (1964–82), where she also served as dean of the graduate school (1974 – 77). Her academic appointments spanned five decades and included positions at [[Vassar College]], the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Bennington College]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Her many awards and fellowships include the Social Science Research Council and the Guggenheim Foundation.&lt;ref name="irvine"/&gt;

"Codere entered anthropology at a time when the members of the American Anthropology Association would have fitted into one ballroom",.&lt;ref name="rosman"/&gt; Codere was also one of the first women anthropologists to hold a senior faculty position in a university. Among her achievements, was the 1966 editing of [[Franz Boas]]' book ''Kwakiutl Ethnography''; after he died she continued the work of the Kwakiutl peoples.&lt;ref name="irvine"/&gt; In 1951, and 1954–55, Codere went on trips to study the Kwakiutl people, where she lived with a family.

==Later life==
After retiring, Codere lived on Concord where she continued to volunteer at the library, and spend time with her companion, Marion Tait. When Tait died, Codere never fully recovered. She died on June 5, 2009. She had donated all of her land to the Vermont Land Trust and most of her books to the library at the [[University of Vermont]]’s anthropology department.&lt;ref name="irvine"/&gt;

==Works==

===Kwakiutl===

Codere's first major work was ''Fighting with Property: Study of Kwakiutl Potlatching and Warfare, 1792–1930'', which was also her dissertation for Columbia. In this book, Codere tries to emphasize "the more amiable features [of the potlatch] such as the capacity for sociability and cooperativeness, rather than the aggressive and competitiveness",&lt;ref name="rosman"&gt;Rosman, Abraham and Paula Rubel. 2010 Helen Francis Codere. American Anthropologist 112(2):342-&amp;ndash;350.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the dominant view of the time, and it was also seen as a wasteful and unproductive to civilized values. In ''Fighting with Property'', she carries out an historical examination of materials on the [[Kwakiutl]] people from 1792–1930, however, Boas' work formed the basis of her work. She documented that there was a "major shift that took place was the distribution of property and vigor of potlatches for social prestige and the co-existent decrease and final extinction of warfare and physical violence"&lt;ref name="codere"&gt;Helen Codere. 1950 Fighting with Property: A Study of Kwakiutl Potlatching and Warfare. New York: J.J. Augustin&lt;/ref&gt; which the Kwakiutl define as "fighting with property" rather than with weapons. She says that this change can have profound implications not only for an understanding of the Kwakiutl people but also "for knowledge of human potentialities for change away from destructiveness, at a point in the history of the world when such a change is necessary".&lt;ref name="codere"/&gt;

Her work on the Kwakiutl was not only important for understanding that culture but also because "first, it was one of the pioneering efforts of what later came to be known as [[historical anthropology]]. Second, while the majority of anthropologists of the time were doing synchronic studies of societies, Codere's work focused on culture change".&lt;ref name="rosman"/&gt;

===Rwanda===
After her work with the Kwakiutl, she expanded her work to the Tutsi and Hutu of [[Rwanda]] in 1959, during a time of revolution. "The general purpose of the Rwanda field research," she wrote, "was to study change." While in Rwanda, she was challenged to communicate in two languages – Kinyarwanda and French.&lt;ref name="irvine"/&gt; She collected forty-eight autobiographies of Rwandan men and women: [[Tutsi]], [[Hutu]], and Twa of different ages, education levels, economic statuses and occupations, and along with other research that had been done, she studied the social change, focusing more on the problems and social tensions, rather than the functional theory of society.&lt;ref name="rosman"/&gt; She viewed society has a "complex adaptive system" which was essentially a "bundle of relations".&lt;ref name="codere2"&gt;Helen Codere. 1975 African Autobiography, the Biography of an African Society: Rwanda. The Journal of African History 16:473&amp;ndash;474&lt;/ref&gt; The autobiographies that she took showed the complexities of the [[caste system]] and also showed details of intercaste relationships, and the ways these were changing.&lt;ref name="rosman"/&gt; Her studies about Rwandan [[social structure]] were carried out when that very social structure entered a period of rapid transformation.

'''Hip-hop based education''' ('''HHBE''') refers to the use of [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], especially [[rapping|rap]] songs and lyrics, as curricular resources.

Integrating hip-hop into academic curriculum gives youth more interest in education and promotes literacy.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} HHBE advocates believe that hip-hop can be used in classrooms to inspire youth to be agents of social and political.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, Ernest.

== HHBE programs ==

===The Hip-hop Education Guidebook===
[[Marcella Runell Hall|Marcella Runell]] and [[Martha Diaz]] created the "Hip-Hop Education Guidebook: Volume 1", a comprehensive collection of lesson plans and resources that educators can use to integrate hip-hop into their classroom curriculum. The book concept was inspired by Diaz, who founded and curated the Hip-Hop Education Summit with Patricia Wang. The lessons include subjects such as mathematics, science, social justice, literacy, and language arts. The education guide introduces teachers to the many ways that hip-hop education can be used in the classroom and it also validated teachers who had previously implemented hip-hop into their curriculum. Hip-Hop Association published the work and Runell stated that the response has been "tremendous."&lt;ref name="Kirkland, David E 2008"&gt;Kirkland, David E. "“You Must Learn”: Promoting Hip-Hop Education." Youth Media Reporter 2.1-6 (2008): 42-46. Academic Search Complete. Web. 19 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hip-hop Educational Literacy Program (H.E.L.P)===
[[Asheru]], born Gabriel Benn, director of Arts in Education at a D.C. based special education school with the help of Rick Henning launched the H.E.L.P program. It's a monthly periodical and reading supplement designed by teachers and curriculum writers to combine hip-hop music with literacy instruction. Songs for the periodical are chosen based on three criteria, the first being "the song must be socially redeeming or otherwise significant themes addressed in the songs lyrical content, followed by rich vocabulary use, and lastly the song must be performed by a popular artist.&lt;ref name="Kirkland, David E 2008"/&gt;

===Trials of a Hip-hop Educator===
In 2007 Tony Muhammad started a popular Myspace blog titled "Trials of a Hip-hop Educator". Teachers who were implementing hip-hop into their classrooms could go to this blog and share their struggles with each other.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Hip Hop Schoolhouse===
Hip-hop artist [[Common (rapper)|Common]], with the help of his mother, Dr. Mahalia Hines, developed a self-help hip-hop series of three books—all written by Common—that were released under the company name Hip Hop Schoolhouse. Dr. Hines, with the help of her education colleagues has also created lesson plans and units on how to teach the series to youth. Each book also includes a hip-hip vocabulary dictionary in the back for teachers who are not familiar with hip-hop language.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Hip Hop 101===
Hip-hop educator and artist [[Professor A.L.I.]] currently teaches a University of California approved Hip-Hop History course entitled "Beats, Rhymes and Life: Hip Hop History 101" as part of the Blend-Ed Consortium of schools ([[The Athenian School]], [[College Preparatory School]], [[Lick-Wilmerding]], [[Urban School]], and [[Marin Academy]]) in which his "XFactor' Album is an integrated part of the curriculum, using, as he states, "Hip-Hop to teach Hip-Hop".&lt;ref&gt;BlendedConsortium.org [http://www.blendedconsortium.org/instructors/] 26 November 2014 (accessed 21 December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hip Hop Saves Lives===
Artist &amp; educator Chad Harper founded Hip Hop Saves Lives&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hiphopsaveslives.org/&lt;/ref&gt; as an extra-curricular workshop for youths in schools across New York City. The students write and record a song about a humanitarian "hero" of their choosing; they then film a music video and send it to their hero. One such "hero" was [[Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c495qvPCTkQ&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences''', CU (IFESCU) was established in 1976 as Institute of Forestry with the help of [[Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]], and [[Bangladesh Forest Department]], under [[University of Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]]. It's the pioneer institute for forestry education in Bangladesh. Later, it was renamed as Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences in 1996. The Institute started providing in-service training (Master of Forestry) to newly recruited ACF (Assistant Conservator of Forests) in 1977-78, regular 4-year B.Sc. (Hons.) in [[Forestry]] in 1978-79, M.Sc. in [[Forestry]] in 1996, B.Sc. (Hons.) in [[Environmental Science]] in 2000-2001 and M.Sc. in [[Environmental Science]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences |url=http://www.cu.ac.bd/ctguni/index.php?option=com_cudata&amp;task=institute%20of%20forestry%20and%20environmental%20sciences |publisher=University of Chittagong |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israel Arts and Science Academy''' ('''IASA''') is a national, residential high school for Israeli students.  It opened its doors in September 1990, and was founded by Mary Jane and Robert H. Asher and the late [[Raphi Amram]]. IASA was the first high school in the west which combined studies in science, music, humanities and art. 

==Student body==
The school's students are immigrants and native-born religious and secular Jews and Israeli Arabs (Muslim, Christian and Druze. They come from over 100 communities across Israel. The student body numbers approximately 300, including day students from Jerusalem, in addition to residential students.  

IASA students are accepted without regard for their financial ability; 70% receive scholarship assistance.  Admission is based solely on merit. Tuition is discussed only after the student is accepted.  Scholarship assistance, if required, is then arranged.  

IASA's goals are excellence, leadership and community service. Pluralism and mutual respect are natural outcomes of living in the IASA community.

95 percent of graduates go on to perform military service. Of the more than 1,000 graduates who have had enough time since graduating to do so, approximately 25% have earned PhDs.

==Service programs==
Talpiot is the most exclusive program of the Israel Defense Force (IDF). Annually, Talpiot accepts only 50 of approximately 100,000 high school graduates. They must serve for nine years. Talpiot has been responsible for most of the innovations Israel has developed for use by the IDF. Despite the small size of IASA, more Talpiot members are graduates of the Academy than any other school.

Sh’nat Sherut is a voluntary year of public service which graduates of Israeli high schools may undertake in addition to their army service. Nationally, 2.8% of high school graduates volunteer for this program.  This past year,{{when|date=February 2018}} with permission granted by appropriate army offices, 42% of IASA graduates volunteered for Sh’nat Sherut. This is a result of IASA's unique Crown Community Service Program.  Every student provides community service every Tuesday afternoon during the three years at IASA.  

==Academics==
Students may major in either [[natural sciences]], [[music]], [[visual arts]], or [[humanities]], though they study most subjects (those which are not related to their area of interest) in mixed classes. The science students choose one main subject, such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], or [[biology]], and they must also learn [[computer science]] and/or another subject.

IASA's Music Department was shaped by the visions of three educators: Israeli composer and ethnomusicologist [[Andre Hajdu]] (student of [[Zoltán Kodály]], [[Olivier Messiaen]] and [[Darius Milhaud]]), composer and educator [[Michael Wolpe]], and teacher of ear-training [[Bat Sheva Rubinstein]]. The Music Department has produced a generation of young Israeli musicians.

The studies in the Art Department consist of painting, sculpting, photography, and video art classes. Students also study the history of modern art and classic art. In their second year, students write their own academic paper about any art topic they choose. In their third year, students work on their final practical exhibit.

=== Humanities Department ===
The [[Humanities]] Department was opened in the 2007–2008 [[school year]]. It was opened in a partial experimental format in 2006-2007. The students learn by the "[[Great books]]" curriculum, which emphasizes  reading [[primary sources]], group discussions, [[Literary criticism|commentary]], [[analysis]] and [[academic writing]]. The department's "Unique Program" includes several [[course (education)|courses]] arranged in a [[Chronology|chrono]]-[[History|historical]] order, from [[Ancient Greece]] to the [[Modern Era]]. Each course has a different dominant [[discipline]], but the program is [[interdisciplinary]] in its nature. The students submit during every course several academic papers. Besides this program, the students must fulfill three other requirements:

* Study of a second [[foreign language]]: Besides the mandatory [[English studies]] in Israel's school system, The Department's students are obliged to learn [[Arabic]], [[French language|French]] or [[Latin]]. Students with a background knowledge of another language may learn it instead.
* Enhanced studies of two subjects: The student may choose from [[History]], [[Bible]], [[Literature]], [[Jewish thought]] and [[Philosophy]]. A student who wishes to study an [[exact science]] may do so within the Science Department's "secondary science" studies.    
* Writing a final [[dissertation]]: The students write a [[thesis]] in any field of knowledge of the humanities. Dissertations are held to a high [[Academic standards|academic standard]], and are written under the instruction of [[Master of Arts|M.A.]]s and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD.]]s from [[University|academic institutes]] and from the school's staff. Students often participate and win in competitions for remarkable dissertations held by the [[Israeli Ministry of Education|Ministry of Education]] and other research institutes.

The students often go on school trips, usually to locations which are relevant to the "Unique Program" studies (e.g. [[Judaean Desert]], [[Jerusalem's Old City]]). 

Since the 2012–2013 school year, students and teachers of the department hold a [[Book discussion club|Book Club]] in which they read a [[literary work]] and conduct a meeting where they [[Discussion|discuss]] and [[Analysis|analyze]] the piece.

== Alumni ==
Notable alumni include the Israeli Arab journalist [[Sayed Kashua]]; composers [[Aviya Kopelman]] and [[Matti Kovler]]; and [[Eran Shir]], the founder of Dapper. Inc.

Saying that following Israel's actions in Gaza, "courageous civic activism" had become necessary, dozens of IASA graduates published a letter in December 2014 calling on Israelis to refuse serving in the IDF, become [[conscientious objector]]s and stop what they view as oppression of Palestinians. Deputy Education Minister Avi Wortzman protested the letter, saying, "The signers of the letter are using the name of the school to gain media attention, and this is a terrible act".&lt;ref&gt;"Yarden Skop 'Graduates of elite Jerusalem high school call for draft refusal'" (28 December 2014) Haaretz http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.634184&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JORDY''' or '''Joint Optical Reflective Display''' is an optical viewing device developed based on [[NASA]] technology. It is used to help the [[visually impaired]] see and read.

The name is inspired by the [[Star Trek]] character, [[Geordi La Forge]].&lt;ref&gt;https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff2003/hm_7.html Many people are familiar with the popular science fiction series Star Trek: The Next Generation, a show featuring a blind character named Geordi La Forge, whose visor-like glasses enable him to see. What many people do not know is that a product very similar to Geordi’s glasses is available to assist people with vision conditions, and a NASA engineer’s expertise contributed to its development.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kendriya Vidyalayas Sangathan''' ({{abbrlink|lit.|literal translation}} "central schools") are a system of [[Government of India|central government]] schools in [[India]] that are instituted under the aegis of the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] (MHRD). It comprises over 1,193 schools in India ({{as of|2018|November|01|lc=y}}) and three abroad. It is one of world's largest chains of schools.

==History==
The system came into being in 1963 under the name 'Central Schools'. Later, the name was changed to Kendriya Vidyalaya. All the schools are affiliated to the [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE). Its objective is to educate children of the [[Indian Defence Services]] personnel who are often posted to remote locations. With the army starting its own [[Indian Army Public Schools|Army Public Schools]], the service was extended (but not restricted) to all central government employees.

A uniform curriculum is followed by these schools all over India. By providing a common syllabus and system of education, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are intended to ensure that the children of government employees do not face education disadvantages when their parents are transferred from one location to another. The schools have been operational for more than 50 years.&lt;ref name="KVS"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=National Informatics Centre (NIC), Government of India| work=Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan| url=http://www.kvsangathan.nic.in/| title=Kendriya Vidyalaya| accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, which literally translates to 'Central School Organisation', oversees the functioning of the schools with its headquarters in [[New Delhi]].

The administration of this body is based on levels. The chairman of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is always the Minister in Charge of Human Resource Development of the Government of India; the deputy chairman is Minister of State of MHRD. The real working power lies with the Commissioner of KVS; there are additional commissioners to accompany Commissioner in the administration of KVS in different fields. The head of a KVS region is Deputy Commissioner accompanied by an Assistant Commissioner. There are individual principals of every KV administrating the schools along with a Vice-Principal, Head Master/ Mistress.

The Vidyalaya also has several committees for the holistic development of the students and well maintenance of the school compound and system.

The most important one is the VMC (Vidyalaya Management Committee), which is the head of all committees.

==Locations==
{{main|List of Kendriya Vidyalayas}}
[[File:KVS Headquarters at Katwaria Sarai, Delhi.jpg|thumb|right|Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan building, Delhi]]
{{as of|2018|March}}, there were 1,183 schools named Kendriya Vidyalayas. Kendriya Vidyalaya is one of the longest school chain in world with 1,137 schools in India and three operated abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kvsangathan.nic.in/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625035631/http://kvsangathan.nic.in/|publisher=Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan|title=KVS homepage|archivedate=25 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of {{formatnum:1227951}} students ({{as of|2017|March|31|lc=y}}) and 56,445 employees were on the rolls ({{as of|2013|September|1|lc=y}}). These were divided among 25 regions, each headed by a deputy commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kvsangathan.nic.in/ |title=Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan |publisher=Kvsangathan.nic.in |date=2013-03-31 |accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three Kendriya Vidyalayas outside India are in [[Kathmandu]], [[Moscow]], and [[Tehran]]. They are intended for children of Indian embassy staff and other expatriate employees of the government of India.

One school in [[Tshimalakha]], [[Bhutan]], was transferred to the Bhutanese government, thus ceasing to be a Kendriya Vidyalaya (then known as Indo-Bhutan Central School (IBCS)) in 1989, after one of the major Indo-Bhutan projects (the Chukhha Hydal power project) was near completion. Indian government employees were gradually transferred back to their own country.

==Features==
[[File:KVS Students.jpg|thumb|Kendriya Vidyalaya Students participating in a rally]]
All the schools share a common syllabus and offer bilingual instruction, in [[English language|English]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. They are co-educational.

[[Sanskrit]] is taught as a compulsory subject from classes VI to VIII and as an optional subject until class XII. Students in classes VI to VIII could study the [[German language]] until November 2014, when the scheme was discontinued. But was again re continued and is available in some schools until class 10.

[[File:Kenya_School_of_Law_logo.jpg|thumb|right|Logo of the Kenya School of Law]] 
The '''Kenya School of Law''' (KSL) is the only [[bar school]] in [[Kenya]]. After their completion of an Undergraduate Degrees in Law from a recognized university, students attend the Kenya School of Law to be prepared for admission to the Kenyan Bar.

The Kenya School of Law was established as a law vocational training school for the training of barristers in 1963. It was created by Gerald Davis, a barrister under the auspices of Lord Justice Denning. Many of the lecturers appointed by Gerald Davis went on to become Judges in the UK. The standard of teaching was very high. However, the establishment of Faculties of Law in East African universities led to a need to change the training offered at the Kenya School of Law. The Kenya School of Law was re-established as in 1995 to provide the Advocates Training Program which focused on the preparation of young [[lawyer]]s for entry into the legal profession.

In 2005, a ministerial task force on the Development of a Policy and Legal Framework for Legal Education in Kenya expanded the mandate of the Kenya School of Law to include the following:
*[[Advocate]]s Training
*Continuing Professional Legal Development
*[[Paralegal]] Training
*The provision of Specialized Professional Legal Training in Public Service
*Conducting of Projects, Consultancies and Research 

The Council of Legal Education Act is the basis of legal training in Kenya.

'''Lawrence LeShan''' (born September 6, 1920)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Directory|year=1968|publisher=American Psychological Association|page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an American [[psychologist]], educator and the author of the best-selling ''How to Meditate'' (1974) a practical guide to [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="leshan1"&gt;Fields, Tracy. (1995). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W9JPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yQcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6898,2945907&amp;dq=lawrence-leshan&amp;hl=en Cancer Patients Call On Mind To Help Heal The Body]. ''[[Star-Banner|Ocala Star-Banner]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He has authored or co-authored approximately 75 articles in the professional literature and thirteen books on a diverse range of topics including [[psychotherapy]], [[war]], [[cancer treatment]], and [[mysticism]]. He has also written science fiction under the pseudonym Edward Grendon.

==Biography==

{{NewThought}}
LeShan holds a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Developmental psychology|Human Development]] from the [[University of Chicago]] and has taught at [[Pace College]], [[Roosevelt University]], and the [[New School for Social Research]]. He worked as a clinical and research psychologist for more than 50 years, including six years as a psychologist in the [[U.S. Army]].

In the 1960s and 1970s, LeShan conducted extensive research in the field of [[parapsychology]]. In his book ''The Medium, the Mystic, and the Physicist: Toward a General Theory of the Paranormal'', he investigated paranormal topics, mystical thought and [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Healey 1976"&gt;Healey, Tim. (1976). ''The Medium, the Mystic, and the Physicist: Toward a General Theory of the Paranormal by Lawrence LeShan''. ''[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]]''. Volume 9, No. 2. pp. 154-155.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book LeShan claimed to have tested his hypothesis of "clairvoyant reality". He said the results were a success and he could heal with [[Energy medicine|mental power]] and train others to do the same. However, Tim Healey wrote the results were not convincing as nine of his students had eight attempts at using a clairvoyant training technique and all scored four to fives misses.&lt;ref name="Healey 1976"/&gt;

In ''World of the Paranormal: The Next Frontier'', LeShan advanced his [[paranormal]] ideas further, claiming that psychic abilities such as  [[clairvoyance]], [[precognition]] and [[telepathy]] can be explained using quantum theory.

In the 1980s, LeShan's focus shifted to the psychotherapy of cancer support, a field in which he is considered a pioneer. LeShan lives in [[New York City]]. LeShan was married to the late [[Eda LeShan]], who was also a writer.&lt;ref name="wed"&gt;(20 August 1944).

The '''Mexican Youth Athenaeum''', later known as the ''Athenaeum of Mexico'', was a Mexican civil association founded on October 28, 1909 with the purpose of working in favor of culture and art, by means of organization public meetings and debates. Born as a response of a generation of young intellectuals who in the decline of the [[Porfiriato|rule of President Porfirio Díaz]] set a series of criticisms to [[determinism]] and [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] set by the [[Auguste Compte|Comtian]] and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencerian]] [[positivism]] as the development model of Porfirio Díaz's administration and the group of the "[[científico]]s. Through a series of conferences and different cultural efforts they activated a reflexive awareness on education.

The members of the Athenaeum gave to [[Education in Mexico|Mexican education system]] a wider vision which rejected racist biological determinism and which found a solution for the cost of social adjustment problem generated by the processes which change society as industrialization or urbanization.

Against the official position of [[Justo Sierra]], porfirian minister of Instruction, and the "científicos" (pejoratively nicknamed in the Mexican slang), [[José Vasconcelos]] and the Athenaeum generation promoted criticism of the philosophical sole vision (positivism and determinism). The Athenaeum generation proposed [[academic freedom]], [[freedom of thought]], and overall the cultural, ethic and aesthetic values in which Latin America emerged as a political and social reality. Here is important to emphasize that one of the most important characteristics of the Porfiriato years, was its disdain for everything national, Mexican; its fascination for European, French, German or if nothing of these were possible American things and ideas, as the only way for achieving progress.

[[Antonio Caso]], [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[Pedro Henríquez Ureña]], [[Ricardo Gomez Rebelo]] and José Vasconcelos along with the other members of the Youth Athenaeum set up the basis to an ambitious rescue of what is Mexican, and to set what is Latin American as an identity that besides being real, might be possible in the future and mainly non-dependent on the destruction of national, local, Latin-American, as the way to progress, as it happened under the Porfiriato and other experiments such as the [[Coronelismo]] in Brazil.

'''Moses Clark White''' ({{zh|t=懷德|s=怀德}}; [[Pinyin]]: ''Huáidé''; [[Foochow Romanized]]: ''Huài-dáik''; July 24, 1819 &amp;ndash; October 24, 1900) was both an [[American Methodist Episcopal Mission|American Methodist]] pioneer missionary in [[China]] and a [[physician]].

== Life ==
Moses Clark White was born in [[Paris, Oneida County, New York]] on July 24, 1819. White matriculated at [[Wesleyan University]] in 1842 and graduated in 1845. After graduation from Wesleyan, he spent two years in [[Yale]] studying [[medicine]] and [[theology]], and sometimes preached in the nearby town of [[Milford, Connecticut]]. On March 13, 1847, White married '''Jane Isabel Atwater of Homer''', who came from [[Cortland County, New York]] and was then a teacher in the [[Sunday school|Sabbath School]] in [[Rochester, N.Y.]]

[[File:MC White 1849.jpg|thumb|120px|M.C. White, ca. 1849|left]]
In September 1847 Moses White and Jane, along with [[Judson Dwight Collins]], arrived in [[Foochow]], beginning their missionary work there. Jane, however, fell sick shortly afterwards and finally died of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] on May 25, 1848, at the age of 26. In 1851, White was married a second time to '''Mary Seely''', who came from [[Onondaga, New York]] and also went to Foochow as a missionary.

During his seven years in Foochow, Moses White conducted a school for the secular and religious instruction of the Foochow people, and after mastering the local [[Fuzhou dialect]], he translated the [[Gospel of Matthew]], which was the first Christian document ever published in that vernacular. At the same time, White also served as a doctor, studying and treating the toxic effects of [[opium]].

Due to his poor health, Moses White was forced to leave Foochow in 1853 for [[New Haven]] (his wife Mary also left one year earlier) where he resumed [[medicine|medical studies]] at [[Yale]] and began a medical practice which he continued until the end of his life. He received an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree from Yale in 1854. In July 1856, he published in ''[[Methodist Quarterly Review]]'' his summarizing treatise on [[Fuzhou dialect]] '''''[[:s:The Chinese Language Spoken at Fuh Chau|The Chinese Language Spoken at Fuh Chau]]'''''.

White died on October 24, 1900.

The '''National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts''' or '''NCAFC''' is a membership-based organisation of activist students and education workers campaigning against [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]], [[Austerity|education cuts]] and [[privatisation]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="About NCAFC"&gt;[http://anticuts.com/what-is-the-national-campaign-against-fees-and-cuts/ What is the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was founded at a convention at [[University College London]] in February 2010 on a platform of campaigning for "free, fair and funded public education for all", paid for through the taxation of the rich and big business.

The organisation played a role in the [[2010 UK student protests]], calling several days of action following the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] organised demonstration on 10 November.&lt;ref name="Guardian #dayx"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/23/student-protests-anger-cuts-streets Politics as usual has failed. Students must take direct action], [[The Guardian]], 22 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that up to 130,000 students took part in the 24 November 2010 day of action across the UK.&lt;ref name="Guardian 24 Nov 2010 coverage"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/nov/24/student-protests-school-children-streets Student protests: school's out across the UK as children take to the streets], [[The Guardian]], 24 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 NCAFC organised a march through central [[London]], supported by the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] and the [[University and College Union]], in opposition to the government's Higher Education White Paper. As many as 15,000 students took part, with the [[Metropolitan Police]] pre-authorising the use of plastic bullets in the light of the violence after the previous year's protest against student fees. [[BBC]] reporter Mike Sergeant described the policing on the day as "quite extraordinary... It's the most tightly controlled march through London that I have ever seen".&lt;ref name="BBC 9 Nov 2011 coverage"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15646709 Thousands march in student protest over university fees], [[BBC News]], 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The government later withdrew the HE Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HE bill ‘to be shelved indefinitely’|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/418801.article|accessdate=26 March 2014|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, NCAFC organised another major national demonstration for free education, this time in collaboration with the [[Student Assembly Against Austerity]] and the [[Young Greens of England and Wales|Young Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/19/students-fight-for-the-right-to-free-education&lt;/ref&gt; Organisers claimed that the demonstration saw 10,000 students march and that the event was the largest mobilisation of students in Britain since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/19/student-protest-tuition-fees-scuffles-police|title = Student protest over tuition fees ends in scuffles with police|last = The Guardian|first = |date = 2014-11-19|work = |access-date = 01/06/2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the demonstration, NCAFC organised two separate nationwide days of action for free education, on December 3, 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://anticuts.com/?s=day+of+action|title = Live Blog: National Day of Action|date = 2015-03-12|accessdate = 01/06/2015|website = anticuts.com|publisher = |last = National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and January 31st 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/events/1673010939592270/|title = March for Education in your city...ROUND TWO|date = |accessdate = 01/06/2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first gained wide publicity after accusations of police violence at a student occupation at the University of Warwick&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/03/warwick-university-students-police-tuition-fee-protest|title = Warwick University students accuse police of attacking tuition fee protest|last = The Guardian|first = |date = 03/12/2014|work = |access-date = 01/06/2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second saw students marching in Brighton,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/events/315157348681626/?fref=ts|title = Brighton March for Free Education: No Fees, No Cuts, No Debt!|date = |accessdate = 01/06/2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/events/898867816804595/|title = Bath Marches For Free Education!|date = |accessdate = 01/06/2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Norwich&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/education/norwich_students_take_part_in_march_for_free_education_1_3938417|title = Norwich students take part in march for free education|last = |first = |date = 2015-02-02|work = |access-date = |via = 01/06/2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other cities.

These marches were followed by a demonstration co-ordinated by NCAFC at the Labour Party Conference in Birmingham in protest at the party's stance on Higher Education funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/events/425105397638482/|title = LIVING GRANTS NOT A GRADUATE TAX!

Despite significant gains for left wing candidates at the 2015 National Union of Students conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://thenorwichradical.com/2015/05/03/rebuilding-the-student-movement-the-left-takes-nus/|title = Rebuilding the Student Movement - The Left Takes NUS|last = Jarvis|first = Chris|date = 03/05/2015|work = |access-date = 01/06/2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.socialistaction.net/Britain/Students/Left-victories-mark-start-of-new-era-for-student-movement-NUS-Conference-2015-report.html|title = Left victories mark start of new era for student movement - NUS Conference 2015 report|date = 02/05/2015|accessdate = 01/06/2015|website = |publisher = |last = Socialist Action|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; candidates standing on the National Campaign Against Fees Cuts slate saw limited success. NCAFC's candidates for President, Beth Redmond, and Vice President Higher Education, Hattie Craig, widely regarded as presenting a 'hard left' face inside NUS in comparison to many of the other left-wing candidates, were not elected into full-time roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/megan-dunn-elected-as-new-nus-president/|title = Megan Dunn elected as new NUS President|date = 2015-04-22|accessdate = 01/06/2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nusdigital/document/documents/15088/293fa724474acad75e716e17b2438b5d/NC%202015%20VPHE%20Count%20Sheet.pdf|title = NUS Vice President Higher Education election 2015 count sheet|date = |accessdate = 01/06/2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NCAFC's candidate for Vice President (Welfare), Shelly Asquith, was elected, and Beth Redmond and Hannah Webb were elected to the NUS Block of 15, meaning the NCAFC have maintained a presence on the NUS National Executive Council&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://conference.nusconnect.org.uk/elections/results-and-count-sheets|title = NUS National Conference Results and Count Sheets|date = |accessdate = 01/06/2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as maintaining a strong presence in student unions and in autonomous areas of NUS.

In November 2015 the NCAFC organised another national student demonstration in London under the slogan: "No Borders, No Barriers, No Business". The demonstration aimed to connect the fight against cuts to maintenance grants affecting the million poorest students and issues of migration and the refugee crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sketchley|first1=Hannah|title=Why Students Are Marching Against a Government Waging a War on the Young and the Working Classes|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/hannah-sketchley/student-march-living-grants_b_8470256.html|website=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisers claimed 10,000 students from across the country joined the protest.

The demonstration was marked by a clash between police and protesters outside the [[Department for Business Innovation and Skills]] when protesters attempted to storm the building. This was followed by what organisers claimed was a use of the controversial [[kettling]] containment tactic on Victoria Street, before thousands of students broke police lines and began an unscheduled demonstration through the Victoria area that continued into the evening. 12 demonstrators were arrested over the course of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police arrest protesters at march against scrapping of student grants|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/live/2015/nov/04/student-grants-protest-free-education-live|website=The Guardian|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCAFC also has semi-autonomous campaigns in Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nations and Regions|url=http://anticuts.com/nations-and-regions/|publisher=NCAFC|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Operant conditioning diagram.png|thumb|400px|Diagram of operant conditioning]]
'''Operant conditioning''' (also called '''instrumental conditioning''') is a learning process through which the strength of a behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment.  It is also a procedure that is used to bring about such learning.

Although operant and [[classical conditioning]] both involve behaviors controlled by environmental stimuli, they differ in nature. In operant conditioning, stimuli present when a behavior is rewarded or punished come to control that behavior.  For example, a child may learn to open a box to get the candy inside, or learn to avoid touching a hot stove; in operant terms, the box and the stove are "discriminative stimuli". Operant behavior is said to be "voluntary": for example, the child may face a choice between opening the box and petting a puppy.

In contrast, [[classical conditioning]] involves involuntary behavior based on the pairing of stimuli with biologically significant events. For example, sight of candy may cause a child to salivate, or the sound of a door slam may signal an angry parent, causing a child to tremble. Salivation and trembling are not operants; they are not reinforced by their consequences, and they are not voluntarily "chosen".

The study of animal learning in the 20th century was dominated by the analysis of these two sorts of learning,&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. M. "Animal Learning and Behavior Theory" Ch. 5 in Hearst, E. "The First Century of Experimental Psychology"  Hillsdale N. J.,  Earlbaum, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; and they are still at the core of behavior analysis.

==Historical note==

===Thorndike's law of effect===
{{Main|Law of effect}}
Operant conditioning, sometimes called ''instrumental learning'', was first extensively studied by [[Edward L. Thorndike]] (1874–1949), who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorndike|first1=E.L.|year=1901|title=Animal intelligence: An experimental study of the associative processes in animals|url=|journal=Psychological Review Monograph Supplement|volume=2|issue=|pages=1–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole, but when first constrained, the cats took a long time to get out. With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, so the cats escaped more and more quickly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thorndike generalized this finding in his [[law of effect]], which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences ''strengthen'' behavior and some consequences ''weaken'' behavior. By plotting escape time against trial number Thorndike produced the first known animal [[learning curve]]s through this procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans appear to learn many simple behaviors through the sort of process studied by Thorndike, now called operant conditioning. That is, responses are retained when they lead to a successful outcome and discarded when they do not, or when they produce aversive effects. This usually happens without being planned by any "teacher", but operant conditioning has been used by parents in teaching their children for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="parenting"&gt;Miltenberger, R. G., &amp; Crosland, K. A. (2014). Parenting. The wiley blackwell handbook of operant and classical conditioning. (pp. 509–531) Wiley-Blackwell. {{DOI|10.1002/9781118468135.ch20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===B. F. Skinner===
{{Main|B. F. Skinner}} 
[[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) is referred to as the father of operant conditioning, and his work is frequently cited in connection with this topic. His 1938 book "The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis",&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis", 1938 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; initiated his lifelong study of operant conditioning and its application to human and animal behavior. Following the ideas of [[Ernst Mach]], Skinner rejected Thorndike's reference to unobservable mental states such as satisfaction, building his analysis on observable behavior and its equally observable consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=B. F.|year=1950|title=Are theories of learning necessary?|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=57|issue=|pages=193–216|doi=10.1037/h0054367|pmid=15440996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner believed that classical conditioning was too simplistic to be used to describe something as complex as human behavior. Operant conditioning, in his opinion, better described human behavior as it examined causes and effects of intentional behavior.

To implement his empirical approach, Skinner invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]], or "''Skinner Box''", in which subjects such as pigeons and rats were isolated and could be exposed to carefully controlled stimuli. Unlike Thorndike's puzzle box, this arrangement allowed the subject to make one or two simple, repeatable responses, and the rate of such responses became Skinner's primary behavioral measure.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "B. F. Skinner: The role of reinforcement and Punishment", subsection in: Psychology; Second Edition. New York: Worth, Incorporated, 2011, 278–288.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another invention, the cumulative recorder, produced a graphical record from which these response rates could be estimated. These records were the primary data that Skinner and his colleagues used to explore the effects on response rate of various reinforcement schedules.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ferster, C. B. &amp; Skinner, B. F.  "Schedules of Reinforcement", 1957 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; A reinforcement schedule may be defined as "any procedure that delivers reinforcement to an organism according to some well-defined rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staddon|first=J. E. R|author2=D. T Cerutti|date=February 2003|title=Operant Conditioning|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145124|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=115–144|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145124|pmc=1473025|accessdate=23 March 2013|pmid=12415075}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of schedules became, in turn, the basic findings from which Skinner developed his account of operant conditioning. He also drew on many less formal observations of human and animal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Mecca Chiesa (2004) Radical Behaviorism: The philosophy and the science&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Skinner's writings are devoted to the application of operant conditioning to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "Science and Human Behavior", 1953. New York: MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1948 he published ''[[Walden Two]]'', a fictional account of a peaceful, happy, productive community organized around his conditioning principles.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1948). Walden Two. Indianapolis: Hackett&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] published ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "Verbal Behavior", 1957. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; which extended the principles of operant conditioning to language, a form of human behavior that had previously been analyzed quite differently by linguists and others. Skinner defined new functional relationships such as "mands" and "tacts" to capture some essentials of language, but he introduced no new principles, treating verbal behavior like any other behavior controlled by its consequences, which included the reactions of the speaker's audience.

==Concepts and procedures==

===Origins of operant behavior: operant variability===
Operant behavior is said to be "emitted"; that is, initially it is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Thus one may ask why it happens in the first place.  The answer to this question is like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a "new" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment, in such aspects as the specific motions involved, the amount of force applied, or the timing of the response. Variations that lead to reinforcement are strengthened, and if reinforcement is consistent, the behavior tends to remain stable. However, behavioral variability can itself be altered through the manipulation of certain variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A|year=2002|title=Operant variability: Evidence, functions, and theory|url=|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=9|issue=4|pages=672–705|doi=10.3758/bf03196324|pmid=12613672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifying operant behavior: reinforcement and punishment===
{{Main|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}
Reinforcement and punishment are the core tools through which operant behavior is modified. These terms are defined by their effect on behavior. Either may be positive or negative. 
* '''Positive reinforcement''' and '''negative reinforcement''' increase the probability of a behavior that they follow, while '''positive punishment''' and '''negative punishment''' reduce the probability of behaviour that they follow. 
Another procedure is called "extinction".
* '''Extinction''' occurs when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement. During extinction the behavior becomes less probable. 
There are a total of five consequences. 
# '''[[Positive reinforcement]]''' occurs when a behavior (response) is [[reward system|rewarding]] or the behavior is followed by another stimulus that is rewarding, increasing the frequency of that behavior.&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2015|title=Neuronal reward and decision signals: from theories to data|journal=Physiological Reviews|volume=95|issue=3|pages=853–951|doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2014|pmc=4491543|pmid=26109341|quote=Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers.&amp;nbsp;... Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.|vauthors=Schultz W}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a rat in a [[Skinner box]] gets food when it presses a lever, its rate of pressing will go up.  This procedure is usually called simply ''reinforcement''.
# '''[[Negative reinforcement]]''' (a.k.a. escape) occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of an [[aversive]] stimulus, thereby increasing the original behavior's frequency. In the Skinner Box experiment, the aversive stimulus might be a loud noise continuously inside the box; negative reinforcement would happen when the rat presses a lever to turn off the noise.
# '''[[Positive punishment]]''' (also referred to as "punishment by contingent stimulation") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by an aversive stimulus. Example: pain from a [[spanking]], which would often result in a decrease in that behavior. ''Positive punishment'' is a confusing term, so the procedure is usually referred to as "punishment".
# '''[[Negative punishment]]''' (penalty) (also called "punishment by contingent withdrawal") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of a stimulus. Example: taking away a child's toy following an undesired behavior by him/her, which would result in a decrease in the undesirable behavior.
# '''[[extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]''' occurs when a behavior (response) that had previously been reinforced is no longer effective. Example: a rat is first given food many times for pressing a lever, until the experimenter no longer gives out food as a reward. The rat would typically press the lever less often and then stop. The lever pressing would then be said to be "extinguished."

It is important to note that actors (e.g. a rat) are not spoken of as being reinforced, punished, or extinguished; it is the ''actions'' that are reinforced, punished, or extinguished. Reinforcement, punishment, and extinction are not terms whose use is restricted to the laboratory. Naturally-occurring consequences can also reinforce, punish, or extinguish behavior and are not always planned or delivered on purpose.

====Schedules of reinforcement====
Schedules of reinforcement are rules that control the delivery of reinforcement. The rules specify either the time that reinforcement is to be made available, or the number of responses to be made, or both. Many rules are possible, but the following are the most basic and commonly used&lt;ref&gt;Schacter et al.2011 Psychology 2nd ed. pg.280–284 Reference for entire section Principles version 130317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

* Fixed interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a fixed time has elapsed after the previous reinforcement. This schedule yields a "break-run" pattern of response; that is, after training on this schedule, the organism typically pauses after reinforcement, and then begins to respond rapidly as the time for the next reinforcement approaches.
* Variable interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a variable time has elapsed from the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a relatively steady rate of response that varies with the average time between reinforcements.
* Fixed ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. An organism trained on this schedule typically pauses for a while after a reinforcement and then responds at a high rate. If the response requirement is low there may be no pause; if the response requirement is high the organism may quit responding altogether.
* Variable ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a variable number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a very high, persistent rate of response.
* Continuous reinforcement: Reinforcement occurs after each response. Organisms typically respond as rapidly as they can, given the time taken to obtain and consume reinforcement, until they are satiated.

====Factors that alter the effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment====
The effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment can be changed. 
# '''Satiation/Deprivation''': The effectiveness of a positive or "appetitive" stimulus will be reduced if the individual has received enough of that stimulus to satisfy his/her appetite. The opposite effect will occur if the individual becomes deprived of that stimulus: the effectiveness of a consequence will then increase. A subject with a full stomach wouldn't feel as motivated as a hungry one.&lt;ref name = Miltenberger84&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Immediacy''': An immediate consequence is more effective than a delayed one. If one gives a dog a treat for sitting within five seconds, the dog will learn faster than if the treat is in thirty.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Contingency''': To be most effective, reinforcement should occur consistently after responses and not at other times. Learning may be slower if reinforcement is intermittent, that is, following only some instances of the same response. Responses reinforced intermittently are usually slower to extinguish than are responses that have always been reinforced.&lt;ref name = Miltenberger84/&gt;
# '''Size''': The size, or amount, of a stimulus often affects its potency as a reinforcer. Humans and animals engage in cost-benefit analysis. A smaller amount of food may not, to a rat, seem a worthwhile reward for an effortful lever press. A pile of quarters from a slot machine may keep a gambler pulling the lever longer than a single quarter. Most of these factors serve biological functions.  For example, the process of satiation helps the organism maintain a stable internal environment ([[homeostasis]]). When an organism has been deprived of sugar, for example, the taste of sugar is an effective reinforcer. When the organism's [[blood sugar]] reaches or exceeds an optimum level the taste of sugar becomes less effective or even aversive.

====Shaping====
{{main|Shaping (psychology)}}
Shaping is a conditioning method much used in animal training and in teaching nonverbal humans. It depends on operant variability and reinforcement, as described above. The trainer starts by identifying the desired final (or "target") behavior. Next, the trainer chooses a behavior that the animal or person already emits with some probability. The form of this behavior is then gradually changed across successive trials by reinforcing behaviors that approximate the target behavior more and more closely. When the target behavior is finally emitted, it may be strengthened and maintained by the use of a schedule of reinforcement.

====Noncontingent reinforcement====
Noncontingent reinforcement is the delivery of reinforcing stimuli regardless of the organism's behavior. Noncontingent reinforcement may be used in an attempt to reduce an undesired target behavior by reinforcing multiple alternative responses while extinguishing the target response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=M.|last2=Sigafoos|first2=J.|last3=Bushell|first3=H.|year=1998|title=Use of noncontingent reinforcement in the treatment of challenging behavior|url=|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=22|issue=|pages=529–547|doi=10.1177/01454455980224005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent "reinforcement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poling|first1=A.|last2=Normand|first2=M.|year=1999|title=Noncontingent reinforcement: an inappropriate description of time-based schedules that reduce behavior|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=32|issue=|pages=237–238|doi=10.1901/jaba.1999.32-237|pmc=1284187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimulus control of operant behavior===
{{main|Stimulus control}}
Though initially operant behavior is emitted without an identified reference to a particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come under the control of stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced. Such stimuli are called "discriminative stimuli." A so-called "[[three-term contingency]]" is the result. That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment. Example: a rat may be trained to press a lever only when a light comes on; a dog rushes to the kitchen when it hears the rattle of his/her food bag; a child reaches for candy when s/he sees it on a table.

====Discrimination, generalization &amp; context====
Most behavior is under stimulus control. Several aspects of this may be distinguished: 
*'''Discrimination''' typically occurs when a response is reinforced only in the presence of a specific stimulus. For example, a pigeon might be fed for pecking at a red light and not at a green light; in consequence, it pecks at red and stops pecking at green.  Many complex combinations of stimuli and other conditions have been studied; for example an organism might be reinforced on an interval schedule in the presence of one stimulus and on a ratio schedule in the presence of another. 
*'''Generalization''' is the tendency to respond to stimuli that are similar to a previously trained discriminative stimulus. For example, having been trained to peck at "red" a pigeon might also peck at "pink", though usually less strongly.
*'''Context''' refers to stimuli that are continuously present in a situation, like the walls, tables, chairs, etc. in a room, or the interior of an operant conditioning chamber. Context stimuli may come to control behavior as do discriminative stimuli, though usually more weakly.  Behaviors learned in one context may be absent, or altered, in another.  This may cause difficulties for behavioral therapy, because behaviors learned in the therapeutic setting may fail to occur elsewhere.

===Behavioral sequences: conditioned reinforcement and chaining===
Most behavior cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one. The scope of operant analysis is expanded through the idea of behavioral chains, which are sequences of responses bound together by the three-term contingencies defined above.  Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a "conditioned reinforcer". For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may be used to reinforce "turning around" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence "noise – turn-around – light – press lever – food". Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.

===Escape and avoidance===
In escape learning, a behavior terminates an (aversive) stimulus. For example, shielding one's eyes from sunlight terminates the (aversive) stimulation of bright light in one's eyes.  (This is an example of negative reinforcement, defined above.) Behavior that is maintained by preventing a stimulus is called "avoidance,"  as, for example, putting on sun glasses before going outdoors.  Avoidance behavior raises the so-called "avoidance paradox", for, it may be asked, how can the non-occurrence of a stimulus serve as a reinforcer? This question is addressed by several theories of avoidance (see below).

Two kinds of experimental settings are commonly used: discriminated and free-operant avoidance learning.

====Discriminated avoidance learning====
A discriminated avoidance experiment involves a series of trials in which a neutral stimulus such as a light is followed by an aversive stimulus such as a shock. After the neutral stimulus appears an operant response such as a lever press prevents or terminate the aversive stimulus. In early trials, the subject does not make the response until the aversive stimulus has come on, so these early trials are called "escape" trials. As learning progresses, the subject begins to respond during the neutral stimulus and thus prevents the aversive stimulus from occurring. Such trials are called "avoidance trials." This experiment is said to involve classical conditioning because a neutral CS is paired with the aversive US; this idea underlies the two-factor theory of avoidance learning described below.

====Free-operant avoidance learning====
In free-operant avoidance a subject periodically receives an aversive stimulus (often an electric shock) unless an operant response is made; the response delays the onset of the shock. In this situation, unlike discriminated avoidance, no prior stimulus signals the shock. Two crucial time intervals determine the rate of avoidance learning. This first is the S-S (shock-shock) interval. This is time between successive shocks in the absence of a response. The second interval is the R-S (response-shock) interval. This specifies the time by which an operant response delays the onset of the next shock. Note that each time the subject performs the operant response, the R-S interval without shock begins anew.

====Two-process theory of avoidance====

This theory was originally proposed in order to explain discriminated avoidance learning, in which an organism learns to avoid an aversive stimulus by escaping from a signal for that stimulus. Two processes are involved: classical conditioning of the signal followed by operant conditioning of the escape response:

a) ''Classical conditioning of fear.'' Initially the organism experiences the pairing of a CS (conditioned stimulus) with an aversive US (unconditioned stimulus). The theory assumes that this pairing creates an association between the CS and the US through classical conditioning and, because of the aversive nature of the US, the CS comes to elicit a conditioned emotional reaction (CER) – "fear." b) ''Reinforcement of the operant response by fear-reduction.'' As a result of the first process, the CS now signals fear; this unpleasant emotional reaction serves to motivate operant responses, and responses that terminate the CS are reinforced by fear termination. Note that the theory does not say that the organism "avoids" the US in the sense of anticipating it, but rather that the organism "escapes" an aversive internal state that is caused by the CS.
Several experimental findings seem to run counter to two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes very slowly even when the initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response might be expected to extinguish (see [[Classical conditioning]]). Further, animals that have learned to avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.&lt;ref name="Pierce 2004"&gt;Pierce &amp; Cheney (2004) Behavior Analysis and Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operant or "one-factor" theory====
Some theorists suggest that avoidance behavior may simply be a special case of operant behavior maintained by its consequences. In this view the idea of "consequences" is expanded to include sensitivity to a pattern of events. Thus, in avoidance, the consequence of a response is a reduction in the rate of aversive stimulation. Indeed, experimental evidence suggests that a "missed shock" is detected as a stimulus, and can act as a reinforcer. Cognitive theories of avoidance take this idea a step farther. For example, a rat comes to "expect" shock if it fails to press a lever and to "expect no shock" if it presses it, and avoidance behavior is strengthened if these expectancies are confirmed.&lt;ref name="Pierce 2004"/&gt;

===Operant hoarding===
Operant hoarding refers to the observation that rats reinforced in a certain way may allow food pellets to accumulate in a food tray instead of retrieving those pellets. In this procedure, retrieval of the pellets always instituted a one-minute period of [[extinction]] during which no additional food pellets were available but those that had been accumulated earlier could be consumed. This finding appears to contradict the usual finding that rats behave impulsively in situations in which there is a choice between a smaller food object right away and a larger food object after some delay. See [[schedules of reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=M.R.|year=1990|title=Operant hoarding: A new paradigm for the study of self-control|url=|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=53|issue=|pages=247–262|doi=10.1901/jeab.1990.53-247|pmc=1323010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These neurons are equally active for positive and negative reinforcers, and have been shown to be related to [[neuroplasticity]] in many [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;PNAS 93:11219-24 1996, Science 279:1714–8 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also exists that [[Dopamine#Functions in the brain|dopamine]] is activated at similar times.

[[Cholinergic]] projections, in contrast, are dense even in the posterior cortical regions like the [[primary visual cortex]]. A study of patients with [[Parkinson's disease]], a condition attributed to the insufficient action of dopamine, further illustrates the role of dopamine in positive reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Frank, Lauren C. Seeberger, and Randall C. O'Reilly (2004) "By Carrot or by Stick: Cognitive Reinforcement Learning in Parkinsonism," ''Science'' 4, November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It showed that while off their medication, patients learned more readily with aversive consequences than with positive reinforcement. Patients who were on their medication showed the opposite to be the case, positive reinforcement proving to be the more effective form of learning when dopamine activity is high.

A neurochemical process involving dopamine has been suggested to underlie reinforcement.  When an organism experiences a reinforcing stimulus, [[dopamine]] pathways in the brain are activated. This network of pathways "releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many [[dendrites]], thus broadcasting a global reinforcement signal to [[postsynaptic neuron]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Wolfram|year=1998|title=Predictive Reward Signal of Dopamine Neurons|url=|journal=The Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows recently activated synapses to increase their sensitivity to efferent (conducting outward) signals, thus increasing the probability of occurrence for the recent responses that preceded the reinforcement. These responses are, statistically, the most likely to have been the behavior responsible for successfully achieving reinforcement. But when the application of reinforcement is either less immediate or less contingent (less consistent), the ability of dopamine to act upon the appropriate synapses is reduced.

==Questions about the law of effect==
A number of observations seem to show that operant behavior can be established without reinforcement in the sense defined above. Most cited is the phenomenon of [[Shaping (psychology)#Autoshaping|autoshaping]]  (sometimes called "sign tracking"), in which a stimulus is repeatedly followed by reinforcement, and in consequence the animal begins to respond to the stimulus. For example, a response key is lighted and then food is presented. When this is repeated a few times a pigeon subject begins to peck the key even though food comes whether the bird pecks or not. Similarly, rats begin to handle small objects, such as a lever, when food is presented nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timberlake|first1=W|year=1983|title=Rats' responses to a moving object related to food or water: A behavior-systems analysis|url=|journal=Animal Learning &amp; Behavior|volume=11|issue=3|pages=309–320|doi=10.3758/bf03199781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A.J.|year=1969|title=Animals respond for food in the presence of free food|url=|journal=Science|volume=166|issue=|pages=399–401|doi=10.1126/science.166.3903.399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strikingly, pigeons and rats persist in this behavior even when pecking the key or pressing the lever leads to less food (omission training).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=D.R.|last2=Williams|first2=H.|year=1969|title=Auto-maintenance in the pigeon: sustained pecking despite contingent non-reinforcement|url=|journal=J.

These observations and others appear to contradict the [[law of effect]], and they have prompted some researchers to propose new conceptualizations of operant reinforcement  (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=R.A.|last2=Gardner|first2=B.T.|year=1988|title=Feedforward vs feedbackward: An ethological alternative to the law of effect|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=11|issue=|pages=429–447|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00058258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, R.

In this view, many behaviors can be influenced by both classical contingencies (stimulus-response) and operant contingencies (response-reinforcement), and the experimenter's task is to work out how these interact.&lt;ref&gt;Locurto, C. M., Terrace, H. S., &amp; Gibbon, J. (1981) Autoshaping and conditioning theory. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of someone having a positive experience with a drug is easy to see how drug dependence and the law of effect works. The tolerance for a drug goes down as one continues to use it after having a positive experience with a certain amount the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Neil, Carlson; et al. (2007). Psychology The Science Of Behaviour. New Jersey, USA: Pearson Education Canada, Inc.,. p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; It will take more and more to get that same feeling. This is when the controlled substance in an experiment would have to be modified and the experiment would really begin. The law of work for psychologist B. F. Skinner almost half a century later on the principles of operant conditioning, "a learning process by which the effect, or consequence, of a response influences the future rate of production of that response.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Peter. Psychology, Worth, NY. 6th ed. pp 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Reinforcement and punishment are ubiquitous in human social interactions, and a great many applications of operant principles have been suggested and implemented. Following are a few examples.

===Applied behavior analysis===

{{main|Applied behavior analysis}}
[[Applied behavior analysis]] is the discipline initiated by [[B. F. Skinner]] that applies the principles of conditioning to the modification of socially significant human behavior. It uses the basic concepts of conditioning theory, including conditioned stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;), discriminative stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;), response (R), and reinforcing stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;rein&lt;/sup&gt; or S&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; for reinforcers, sometimes S&lt;sup&gt;ave&lt;/sup&gt; for aversive stimuli).&lt;ref name="Pierce 2004"/&gt; A conditioned stimulus controls behaviors developed through respondent (classical) conditioning, such as emotional reactions. The other three terms combine to form Skinner's "three-term contingency": a discriminative stimulus sets the occasion for responses that lead to reinforcement. Researchers have found the following protocol to be effective when they use the tools of operant conditioning to modify human behavior:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
# '''State goal'''  Clarify exactly what changes are to be brought about. For example, "reduce weight by 30 pounds."
# '''Monitor behavior'''  Keep track of behavior so that one can see whether the desired effects are occurring. For example, keep a chart of daily weights.
# '''Reinforce desired behavior'''  For example, congratulate the individual on weight losses.  With humans, a record of behavior may serve as a reinforcement. For example, when a participant sees a pattern of weight loss, this may reinforce continuance in a behavioral weight-loss program. However, individuals may perceive reinforcement which is intended to be positive as negative and vice versa. For example, a record of weight loss may act as negative  reinforcement if it reminds the individual how heavy they actually are. The [[token economy]], [[token economy|is]] an exchange system in which tokens are given as rewards for desired behaviors.  Tokens may later be exchanged for a desired prize or rewards such as power, prestige, goods or services.
# '''Reduce [[incentive]]s to perform undesirable behavior'''  For example, remove candy and fatty snacks from kitchen shelves.

Practitioners of applied behavior analysis (ABA) bring these procedures, and many variations and developments of them, to bear on a variety of socially significant behaviors and issues. In many cases, practitioners use operant techniques to develop constructive, socially acceptable behaviors to replace aberrant behaviors.  The techniques of ABA have been effectively applied in to such things as [[Lovaas model|early intensive behavioral interventions]] for children with an [[autism spectrum disorders|autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD)&lt;ref name="As-in-ABA"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dillenburger, K.|author2=Keenan, M.|year=2009|title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: dispelling the myths|journal=J Intellect Dev Disabil|volume=34|issue=2|pages=193–95|doi=10.1080/13668250902845244|pmid=19404840}}&lt;/ref&gt; research on the principles influencing [[criminology|criminal behavior]], HIV prevention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=DeVries, J.E.|author2=Burnette, M.M.|author3=Redmon, W.K.|year=1991|title=AIDS prevention: Improving nurses' compliance with glove wearing through performance feedback|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=24|issue=4|pages=705–11|doi=10.1901/jaba.1991.24-705|pmc=1279627|pmid=1797773}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservation of natural resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brothers, K.J.|author2=Krantz, P.J.|author3=McClannahan, L.E.|year=1994|title=Office paper recycling: A function of container proximity|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=27|issue=1|pages=153–60|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-153|pmc=1297784|pmid=16795821}}&lt;/ref&gt; education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dardig, Jill C.|author2=Heward, William L.|author3=Heron, Timothy E.|author4=Nancy A.

===Addiction and dependence===

Positive and negative reinforcement play central roles in the development and maintenance of [[addiction]] and [[drug dependence]]. An addictive drug is [[reward system|intrinsically rewarding]]; that is, it functions as [[#Primary reinforcers|a primary positive reinforcer]] of drug use. The brain's reward system assigns it [[incentive salience]] (i.e., it is "wanted" or "desired"),&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Reinforcement principles for addiction medicine; from recreational drug use to psychiatric disorder|journal=Prog. Brain Res.|volume=223|issue=|pages=63–76|doi=10.1016/bs.pbr.2015.07.005|pmid=26806771|quote=Abused substances (ranging from alcohol to psychostimulants) are initially ingested at regular occasions according to their positive reinforcing properties. Importantly, repeated exposure to rewarding substances sets off a chain of secondary reinforcing events, whereby cues and contexts associated with drug use may themselves become reinforcing and thereby contribute to the continued use and possible abuse of the substance(s) of choice.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug [addiction], cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing&amp;nbsp;... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an “escape” response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952).|vauthors=Edwards S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2012|title=From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation|journal=Eur.

This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience. The CS becomes hard not to look at (Wiers &amp; Stacy, 2006; Hickey et al., 2010a; Piech et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2011). The CS even takes on some incentive properties similar to its UCS. An attractive CS often elicits behavioral motivated approach, and sometimes an individual may even attempt to ‘consume’ the CS somewhat as its UCS (e.g., eat, drink, smoke, have sex with, take as drug). ‘Wanting’ of a CS can turn also turn the formerly neutral stimulus into an instrumental conditioned reinforcer, so that an individual will work to obtain the cue (however, there exist alternative psychological mechanisms for conditioned reinforcement too).|vauthors=Berridge KC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2015|title=Pleasure systems in the brain|journal=Neuron|volume=86|issue=3|pages=646–664|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018|pmc=4425246|pmid=25950633|quote=An important goal in future for addiction neuroscience is to understand how intense motivation becomes narrowly focused on a particular target. Addiction has been suggested to be partly due to excessive incentive salience produced by sensitized or hyper-reactive dopamine systems that produce intense ‘wanting’ (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). But why one target becomes more ‘wanted’ than all others has not been fully explained. In addicts or agonist-stimulated patients, the repetition of dopamine-stimulation of incentive salience becomes attributed to particular individualized pursuits, such as taking the addictive drug or the particular compulsions. In Pavlovian reward situations, some cues for reward become more ‘wanted’ more than others as powerful motivational magnets, in ways that differ across individuals (Robinson et al., 2014b; Saunders and Robinson, 2013).&amp;nbsp;... However, hedonic effects might well change over time. As a drug was taken repeatedly, mesolimbic dopaminergic sensitization could consequently occur in susceptible individuals to amplify ‘wanting’ (Leyton and Vezina, 2013; Lodge and Grace, 2011; Wolf and Ferrario, 2010), even if opioid hedonic mechanisms underwent down-regulation due to continual drug stimulation, producing ‘liking’ tolerance. Incentive-sensitization would produce addiction, by selectively magnifying cue-triggered ‘wanting’ to take the drug again, and so powerfully cause motivation even if the drug became less pleasant (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).|vauthors=Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving.  In addition, stimuli associated with drug use&amp;nbsp;– e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use&amp;nbsp;– become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug.&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become [[#Secondary reinforcers|conditioned positive reinforcers]] of continued use.&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]] as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing [[relapse]] upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.

In drug dependent individuals, negative reinforcement occurs when a drug is [[self-administration|self-administered]] in order to alleviate or "escape" the symptoms of [[physical dependence]] (e.g., [[tremor]]s and sweating) and/or [[psychological dependence]] (e.g., [[anhedonia]], restlessness, irritability, and anxiety) that arise during the state of [[drug withdrawal]].&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;

===Animal training===
{{main|Animal training}}
Animal trainers and pet owners were applying the principles and practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, a few of the most salient are the following: 
(a) availability of primary reinforcement (e.g. a bag of dog yummies); 
(b) the use of secondary reinforcement, (e.g. sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response, then giving yummy); 
(c) contingency, assuring that reinforcement (e.g. the clicker) follows the desired behavior and not something else; 
(d) shaping,  as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher; 
(e) intermittent reinforcement, as in gradually reducing the frequency of reinforcement to induce persistent behavior without satiation; 
(f) chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually constructed from smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;McGreevy, P &amp; Boakes, R."Carrots and Sticks: Principles of Animal Training".(Sydney: "Sydney University Press"., 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Example of animal training from Seaworld related on Operant conditioning 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seaworld.org/en/animal-info/animal-infobooks/animal-training/animal-training-basics|website=Animal training basics|publisher=Seaworld parks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal training has effects on positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement. Schedules of reinforcements may play a big role on the animal training case.

=== Child behaviour – parent management training ===
{{Main|Parent management training}}
Providing positive reinforcement for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of parent management training. Typically, parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child).&lt;ref name="Kazdin2010"&gt;Kazdin AE (2010). Problem-solving skills training and parent management training for oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. ''Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents (2nd ed.),'' 211–226. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called "successive approximations").&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="PMTO"&gt;Forgatch MS, Patterson GR (2010).

===Economics===
{{main|Behavioral economics}}
{{further|Consumer demand tests (animals)}}
Both psychologists and economists have become interested in applying operant concepts and findings to the behavior of humans in the marketplace. An example 
is the analysis of consumer demand, as indexed by the amount of a commodity that is purchased. In economics, the degree to which price influences consumption is called "the price elasticity of demand." Certain commodities are more elastic than others; for example, a change in price of certain foods may have a large effect on the amount bought, while gasoline and other essentials may be less affected by price changes. In terms of operant analysis, such effects may be interpreted in terms of motivations of consumers and the relative value of the commodities as reinforcers.&lt;ref&gt;Domjan, M. (2009). The Principles of Learning and Behavior. Wadsworth Publishing Company. 6th Edition. pages 244–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gambling – variable ratio scheduling===
As stated earlier in this article, a variable ratio schedule yields reinforcement after the emission of an unpredictable number of responses.  This schedule typically generates rapid, persistent responding. Slot machines pay off on a variable ratio schedule, and they produce just this sort of persistent lever-pulling behavior in gamblers. The variable ratio payoff from slot machines and other forms of gambling has often been cited as a factor underlying gambling addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleda|first1=Miguel Ángel Pérez|last2=Nieto|first2=José Héctor Lozano|date=2012|title=Impulsivity, Intelligence, and Discriminating Reinforcement Contingencies in a Fixed-Ratio 3 Schedule|url=https://search-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/docview/1439791203?accountid=12378|journal=The Spanish Journal of Psychology|volume=3|issue=15|pages=922–929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudge theory (or nudge) is a concept in [[behavioural science]], [[political theory]] and [[economics]] which argues that indirect suggestions to try to achieve non-forced [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] can [[Social influence|influence]] the motives, incentives and [[decision making]] of groups and individuals, at least as effectively – if not more effectively – than direct instruction, legislation, or enforcement.

===Praise===
{{Main|Praise}}
The concept of praise as a means of behavioral reinforcement is rooted in B.F. Skinner's model of operant conditioning. Through this lens, praise has been viewed as a means of positive reinforcement, wherein an observed behavior is made more likely to occur by contingently praising said behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazdin|first1=Alan|title=History of behavior modification: Experimental foundations of contemporary research|date=1978|publisher=University Park Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of praise in promoting positive behaviors, notably in the study of teacher and parent use of praise on child in promoting improved behavior and academic performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strain|first1=Phillip S.|last2=Lambert|first2=Deborah L.|last3=Kerr|first3=Mary Margaret|last4=Stagg|first4=Vaughan|last5=Lenkner|first5=Donna A.|date=1983|title=Naturalistic assessment of children's compliance to teachers' requests and consequences for compliance|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=16|issue=2|pages=243–249|doi=10.1901/jaba.1983.16-243|pmc=1307879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"/&gt; but also in the study of work performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Charles R.|last2=Anderson|first2=D. Chris|last3=Abel|first3=Dawn M.|last4=Sergio|first4=Joseph P.|date=1988|title=Task clarification, performance feedback, and social praise: Procedures for improving the customer service of bank tellers|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=21|issue=1|pages=65–71|doi=10.1901/jaba.1988.21-65|pmc=1286094|pmid=16795713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise has also been demonstrated to reinforce positive behaviors in non-praised adjacent individuals (such as a classmate of the praise recipient) through vicarious reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Kazdin, 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kazdin|first1=Alan E.|date=1973|title=The effect of vicarious reinforcement on attentive behavior in the classroom|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=6|issue=1|pages=71–78|doi=10.1901/jaba.1973.6-71|pmc=1310808}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise may be more or less effective in changing behavior depending on its form, content and delivery. In order for praise to effect positive behavior change, it must be contingent on the positive behavior (i.e., only administered after the targeted behavior is enacted), must specify the particulars of the behavior that is to be reinforced, and must be delivered sincerely and credibly.&lt;ref name="Brophy, 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brophy|first1=Jere|title=On praising effectively|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=1981|volume=81|issue=5|jstor=1001606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the effect of praise as a positive reinforcement strategy, numerous behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols.&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonsen|first1=Brandi|last2=Fairbanks|first2=Sarah|last3=Briesch|first3=Amy|last4=Myers|first4=Diane|last5=Sugai|first5=George|date=2008|title=Evidence-based Practices in Classroom Management: Considerations for Research to Practice|journal=Education and Treatment of Children|volume=31|issue=1|pages=351–380|doi=10.1353/etc.0.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisz &amp; Kazdin, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weisz|first1=John R.|last2=Kazdin|first2=Alan E.|title=Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents|date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008" /&gt; and parenting training interventions,&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garland|first1=Ann F.|last2=Hawley|first2=Kristin M.|last3=Brookman-Frazee|first3=Lauren|last4=Hurlburt|first4=Michael S.|date=May 2008|title=Identifying Common Elements of Evidence-Based Psychosocial Treatments for Children's Disruptive Behavior Problems|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=47|issue=5|pages=505–514|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816765c2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and behavioral rewards.

Several studies have been done on the effect cognitive-behavioral therapy and operant-behavioral therapy have on different medical conditions. When patients developed cognitive and behavioral techniques that changed their behaviors, attitudes, and emotions; their pain severity decreased. The results of these studies showed an influence of cognitions on pain perception and impact presented explained the general efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT) and Operant-Behavioral therapy (OBT).

===Psychological manipulation===
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
Braiker identified the following ways that manipulators [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes praise, [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or [[smile]], and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: may involve removing one from a negative situation
* [[Reinforcement#Intermittent reinforcement.3B schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist – for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall.
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], yelling, the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using [[verbal abuse]], explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

===Traumatic bonding===
{{Main|Traumatic bonding}}
Traumatic bonding occurs as the result of ongoing [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Traumatic Bonding: The development of emotional attachments in battered women and other relationships of intermittent abuse|last = Dutton|first = |date = 1981|journal = Victimology: An International Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Painter|issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson2008"&gt;Chrissie Sanderson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5vA42Opyx9cC&amp;pg=PA84 Counselling Survivors of Domestic Abuse]''. Jessica Kingsley Publishers; 15 June 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-84642-811-1}}. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other source indicated that 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/traumatic-bonding&lt;/ref&gt;
'The necessary conditions for traumatic bonding are that one person must dominate the other and that the level of abuse chronically spikes and then subsides. The relationship is characterized by periods of permissive, compassionate, and even affectionate behavior from the dominant person, punctuated by intermittent episodes of intense abuse. To maintain the upper hand, the victimizer manipulates the behavior of the victim and limits the victim's options so as to perpetuate the power imbalance. Any threat to the balance of dominance and submission may be met with an escalating cycle of punishment ranging from seething intimidation to intensely violent outbursts. The victimizer also isolates the victim from other sources of support, which reduces the likelihood of detection and intervention, impairs the victim's ability to receive countervailing self-referent feedback, and strengthens the sense of unilateral dependency...The traumatic effects of these abusive relationships may include the impairment of the victim's capacity for accurate self-appraisal, leading to a sense of personal inadequacy and a subordinate sense of dependence upon the dominating person. Victims also may encounter a variety of unpleasant social and legal consequences of their emotional and behavioral affiliation with someone who perpetrated aggressive acts, even if they themselves were the recipients of the aggression. '.

===Military Psychology===
{{Main|Military Psychology}}

Human beings have an innate resistance to killing and are reluctant to act in a direct, aggressive way towards members of their own species, even to save life.  This resistance to killing has caused infantry to be remarkably inefficient throughout the history of military warfare.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Killing: the Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society|last=Grossman|first=Dave|publisher=Little Brown|year=1995|isbn=978-0316040938|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon was not understood until [[S.L.A. Marshall]] (Brigadier General and military historian) undertook interview studies of WWII infantry immediately following combat engagement. Marshall's well-known and controversial book, Men Against Fire, revealed that only 15% of soldiers fired their rifles with the purpose of killing in combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men Against Fire: the Problem of Battle Command in Future War|last=Marshall|first=S.L.A.|publisher=Infantry Journal|year=1947|isbn=978-0-8061-3280-8|location=Washington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following acceptance of Marshall's research by the US Army in 1946, the Human Resources Research Office of the US Army began implementing new training protocols which resemble operant conditioning methods.  Subsequent applications of such methods increased the percentage of soldiers able to kill to around 50% in Korea and over 90% in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Revolutions in training included replacing traditional pop-up firing ranges with three-dimensional, man-shaped, pop-up targets which collapsed when hit.  This provided immediate feedback and acted as positive reinforcement for a soldier's behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.killology.com/behavioral-psychology|title=Behavioral Psychology|last=Murray, K.A., Grossman, D., &amp; Kentridge, R.W.|first=|date=21 October 2018|website=https://www.killology.com/behavioral-psychology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other improvements to military training methods have included the timed firing course; more realistic training; high repetitions; praise from superiors; marksmanship rewards; and group recognition. Negative reinforcement includes peer accountability or the requirement to retake courses.  Modern military training conditions [[Midbrain|mid-brain]] response to combat pressure by closely simulating actual combat, using mainly Pavlovian [[Classical conditioning|Classical Conditioning]] and [[B. F. Skinner|Skinnerian]] operant Conditioning (both forms of [[Behaviorism]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern marksmanship training is such an excellent example of behaviorism that it has been used for years in the introductory psychology course taught to all cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point as a classic example of operant conditioning. In the 1980s, during a visit to West Point, B.F. Skinner identified modern military marksmanship training as a near-perfect application of operant conditioning.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Lt. Col. Dave Grossman states about operant conditioning and US Military training that:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely possible that no one intentionally sat down to use operant conditioning or behavior modification techniques to train soldiers in this area…But from the standpoint of a psychologist who is also a historian and a career soldier, it has become increasingly obvious to me that this is exactly what has been achieved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his book, On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society, Grossman overviews the main factors influencing individual acts of aggression as:

* [[Stanley Milgram|'''Stanley Milgram's''']] (US Social Psychologist) '''Killing Factors:''' include '''t'''he demands of authority, group absolution, and distance from the victim (including emotional or psychological distancing).
* Ben '''Shalit''' (Israeli military psychologist) '''Factors:''' Shalit's ''Psychology of Conflict and Combat'' considers tactical circumstances such as available strategies, threat to the killer, and payoff for killer in terms of personal gain and enemy loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Conflict and Combat|last=Shalit|first=Ben|publisher=Praeger|year=1998|isbn=978-0275927530|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Predisposition of the killer:''' includes natural predisposition, training, conditioning and recent experiences of the soldier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Psychological distancing includes physical distance, dehumanizing the enemy (including through [[propaganda]]), and the impersonal use of technology such as night vision, drones, and airstrikes.  Modern conditioning techniques have had parallel effects on law enforcement firing rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Video games===
{{Main|Compulsion loop}}
The majority{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} of [[video games]] are designed around a [[compulsion loop]], adding a type of positive reinforcement through a variable rate schedule to keep the player playing. This can lead to the pathology of [[video game addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hopson: [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131494/behavioral_game_design.php Behavioral Game Design], [[Gamasutra]], 27 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Loot box}}
As part of a trend in the [[video game monetization|monetization of video games]] during the 2010s, some games offered [[loot box]]es as rewards or as items purchasable by real world funds. Boxes contains a random selection of in-game items. The practice has been tied to the same methods that slot machines and other gambling devices dole out rewards, as it follows a variable rate schedule. While the general perception that loot boxes are a form of gambling, the practice is only classified as such in a few countries. However, methods to use those items as [[virtual currency]] for [[online gambling]] or trading for real world money has created a [[skin gambling]] market that is under legal evaluation.&lt;ref name="eg pegi"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-11-are-loot-boxes-gambling | title = Are loot boxes gambling? | first = Vic | last = Hood | date = 12 October 2017 | accessdate = 12 October 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace culture of fear ===
{{Main|Culture of fear|Organizational culture|Toxic workplace|Workplace bullying}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]]: leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name="ashforth"&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations'', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755–778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Partial or intermittent [[negative reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name="braiker"/&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies are tolerated, a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual differences in sensitivity to [[Reward system|reward]], [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]], and [[motivation]] have been studied under the premises of [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] and have also been [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory#Workplace performance|applied to workplace performance]].

One of the many reasons proposed for the dramatic costs associated with healthcare is the practice of defensive medicine.  Prabhu reviews the article by Cole and discusses how the responses of two groups of neurosurgeons are classic operant behavior.  One group practice in a state with restrictions on medical lawsuits and the other group with no restrictions.  The group of neurosurgeons were queried anonymously on their practice patterns.  The physicians changed their practice in response to a negative feedback (fear from lawsuit) in the group that practiced in a state with no restrictions on medical lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Operant Conditioning and the Practice of Defensive Medicine.

'''''Poor Arnold's Alamanac''''' was a [[newspaper]] [[comics|comic]] strip by [[Arnold Roth]]. Each installment covered a single subject, with Roth devising gags on such topics as baseball, dogs, commuting, elephants, ice cream, smoking and the telephone. 

Roth wrote and drew ''Poor Arnold's Almanac'' from 1959 to 1961 and again from 1989 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=2-1560973226-0 Powell's Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Roth initially created a color [[Sunday strip|Sunday comic strip]] for the [[New York Herald Tribune Syndicate]], and nearly three decades later, it was revived for the [[Creators Syndicate]] as both a daily and a Sunday feature. Roth recalled:
{{quote|I think the only other times I’ve gotten a regular check for doing work was when I had a syndicated feature with the ''[[New York Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]''. And then a revival of that 30 years later. That was ''Poor Arnold’s Almanac''. . . . They had a very good comics editor. It was almost completely a writer’s syndicate. They had a few comics and the newer ones were ''[[B.C. (comic strip)|B.C.]]'' by [[Johnny Hart]] and [[Mell Lazarus]]’ ''[[Miss Peach]]'', which was very good also. It was sort of like ''[[Peanuts]]'' in a way, with bright little kids saying sophisticated things. But they had a few old-time things that they kept alive. I think one was called ''Mr. And Mrs.'' I can’t rattle them off. So Al sold them ''Tall Tales'', and I sold them ''Poor Arnold’s Almanac'', which ran two years. It was a Sunday only, which was why they canceled me. They wanted a [[daily strip|daily]]. They said it makes the Sunday feature stronger. The Sunday feature was doing—not great, but well enough for me to make money. At that time I was living in England, and my magazine work and record album work was starting. I wasn’t in great haste to do a daily. But during one of my many moves, when I came back, I found that I had penciled a stack of dailies, but I was never going to ink them. I didn’t want to get too locked up in the syndicate thing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedailycrosshatch.com/2009/03/24/interview-arnold-roth-pt-1-of-3/#more-3007 "Interview with Arnold Roth, Part I,"] ''The Daily Cross Hatch'' (March 24, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
==Books==
[[John Updike]] did the introduction when [[Fantagraphics Books]] published a book of Roth's strip in 1998. Updike later reprinted that essay in his collection ''Due Considerations'' (2007). “All cartoonists are geniuses, but Arnold Roth is especially so,” wrote Updike in his introduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5010">'''Ronald William Brunskill''' [[OBE]] (3 January 1929 – 9 October 2015) was an English academic who was [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Architecture at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]]. He was an authority on the [[history of architecture]] and particularly on British [[vernacular architecture]]. 

He was born in [[Lowton]] and attended Bury High School, before studying architecture under Reginald Cordingley at the University of Manchester. After a two-year stint with the British Army, Brunskill was appointed to a [[London County Council]] commission of architects. He left that position to teach at his alma mater, then spent a year at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] as a Commonwealth Fund fellow. He joined [[Williams Deacon's Bank]] in 1957, and oversaw the maintenance of 250 branch offices, designing twenty new buildings. Brunskill returned to Manchester as reader in 1960.

Brunskill contributed significantly to assessing the date, extent and impact of the [[Great Rebuilding]] of England. Brunskill accepted that for much of England [[William George Hoskins|W. G. Hoskins']]s thesis that the Great Rebuilding spanned the period from 1570 to 1640. But Brunskill contended that the period varied both by region and by social class: starting in [[South East England]] and among the higher-income social classes, and then spreading both geographically west and north and socially to lower-income classes.&lt;ref name=Brunskill27&gt;Brunskill, 1971, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Brunskill was awarded an [[New Year Honours 1990#Officers (OBE)|OBE]] for services to conservation. He was married to Miriam Allsopp, with whom he had two daughters, from 1960 until his death in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11984411/Ronald-Brunskill-architectural-historian-obituary.html|title=Ronald Brunskill, architectural historian - obituary|date=9 November 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SABIS''' is an [[education management organization]] that operates schools and licenses a proprietary education program. It is associated as licensor or operator with schools in 20 countries, including one in [[ISF International School Frankfurt Rhein-Main|Europe]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabis.net|title=SABIS|last=SABIS|website=www.sabis.net|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, SABIS managed charter schools in the United States enrolling 6,332 students on a ''[[Charter management organization#Vendor operated school|vendor operated school]]'' basis.&lt;ref name="jw2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodworth|first1=James L|title=Charter Management Organizations 2017|url=https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/CMO%20FINAL.pdf|publisher=Center for Research on Education Outcomes|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|90}}

==History==

In 1886 Reverend Tanios Saad and Louisa Proctor founded the [[International School of Choueifat]] in [[Choueifat]], a village near [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The school was initially for girls but later became co-educational.

The International School of Choueifat embarked upon an expansion program outside Lebanon in the mid-1970s that has since grown to include schools in 20 countries on five continents. The company is structured in three corporations headquartered in the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Lebanon]], and the [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E.]]

SABIS Educational Systems, Inc. of [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota]] was established in 1985 and licenses the SABIS Educational System in North America, South America, and Europe. In 1995 SABIS was contracted to operate the SABIS International Charter School (SICS) in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], a [[public charter school]]. In 2014, the [[International Academy of Trenton]] was founded as a SABIS charter school. As of 2016 SABIS operates 15 schools in the United States, comprising twelve charter schools, two licensed schools and one private school, [[The International School of Minnesota]].  It also has several branches in the Middle East with 12 in the United Arab Emirates alone (and counting) and other schools in Qatar, Oman, Egypt and so on. It also has several sister schools in Europe including a boarding school in [[Bath, England]] as well as a school in Romania and another in Germany, it has even extended itself further to India and Pakistan and proves to be one of the more difficult educational systems in those respective countries. Although the SABIS system is slightly different in each region depending on the management. The toughest proves to be the education system in the GCC where high school students can be subjected to a peak of 16 exams per week.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1998, SABIS established the [[Foxborough Regional Charter School|SABIS Foxborough Regional School]]. The company was released from its management contract in 2007 for curricula non-compliant with [[Massachusetts]] charter law.&lt;ref name= "bg080310"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/1442938731.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+10%2C+2008&amp;author=Anonymous&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;desc=The+achievement+gap+wins+one&amp;pqatl=google   |title=The Achievement Gap Wins One |work=[[Boston Globe]]   |date=10 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, SABIS' charter for the [[International Academy of Trenton|International Academy of Trenton Charter School]] was revoked by the state of [[New Jersey]] for failure to meet minimum standards.&lt;ref name="nc190125"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Taylor|title=N.J. orders shut down of 'failed' charter school despite $17M renovation|url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2018/01/trenton_charter_school_to_shut_down_following_17_m.html |accessdate=26 January 2018|publisher=NJ Advance Media|date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student Life Organization==

A student led society called the [[Student Life Organization]] is used in SABIS schools. SLO is usually led by a Student Life Coordinator. There are student discipline prefects during the SLO period. They are led by a Head Prefect.

The Student Life Organization, SLO, or Student Life is a SABIS educational approach used for students. It provides development of student's academic, managerial, organizational, and leadership skills. Some academic-based activities include student tutoring, planning school events, organizing community service projects, and being involved in the school newspaper and yearbook. SLO  points are also awarded to students who volunteer to help in the SLO and these points help the students get stronger recommendations for students.

[[File:Patient Operated Selector Mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM), was developed in the early 1960s, and used a sip-and-puff control mechanism]]

'''Sip-and-puff''' or '''sip 'n' puff''' ('''SNP''')  is [[assistive technology]] used to send signals to a device using [[Gauge pressure#Absolute.2C gauge and differential pressures - zero reference|air pressure]] by "sipping" (inhaling) or "puffing" (exhaling) on a straw, tube or "wand." It is primarily used by people who do not have the use of their hands. It is commonly used to control a [[motorized wheelchair]] by [[quadriplegics]] with very high injury to their [[spinal cord]] or people with [[ALS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atwiki.assistivetech.net/index.php/Alternative_wheelchair_control |title=Alternative wheelchair control - ATWiki |publisher=Atwiki.assistivetech.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calibration and setup==
Devices that use SNP technology require specific amounts of air pressure to be "sipped" or "puffed" by the user. These amounts of pressure are typically denoted as a hard sip/hard puff or soft sip/soft puff, however other terminologies might exist. Note that the words "hard" and "soft" are relative to the user and depend on their breathing abilities. Typically, air pressure levels pertaining to hard sips/puffs and soft sips/puffs are set through an initial [[calibration]] of the [[pressure sensor]] completed before the user starts to use their SNP device. With the assistance of an aid or technician, the user will program the SNP device to recognize their body's ability to produce hard sips/puffs and soft sips/puffs. Once this calibration process is complete, the SNP device will only recognize the user specific sips and puffs that have been saved into the SNP device.

==Motorized wheelchair control==
Typical applications of Sip-and-Puff devices are for control of a [[motorized wheelchair]]. Control typically consists of four different inputs from the user. An initial hard puff will enable the wheelchair to move forward, while a hard sip will stop the wheelchair. Conversely, an initial hard sip will enable the wheelchair to move backward, while a hard puff will stop the wheelchair. A continuous soft sip or soft puff will enable the wheelchair to move left or right respectively depending on how long the user blows into the tube, straw or "wand".

==Computer input device==
The mouth-controlled input provide users a simple and effective way to control [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] movement. Movement and operation of this [[joystick]] is similar to that of a mouth stick. Mouse button clicking is accomplished with the help of sips or puffs function of the joystick.

A sip-and-puff input device combined with [[computer accessibility]] software means many [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]-accessible programs can be used with this device.

The '''sociology of education''' is the study of how public [[institution]]s and individual experiences affect [[education]] and its outcomes. It is mostly concerned with the public schooling systems of modern industrial societies, including the expansion of [[higher education|higher]], [[further education|further]], [[adult education|adult]], and [[continuing education|continuing]] education.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Gordon Marshall (ed) ''A Dictionary of Sociology'' (Article: Sociology of Education), Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is seen as a fundamentally [[optimistic]] human endeavour characterised by [[Hope|aspiration]]s for [[Social progress|progress]] and betterment.&lt;ref name="schofield"&gt;Schofield, K. (1999). [http://www.aspa.asn.au/Papers/eqfinalc.PDF ''The Purposes of Education, Queensland State Education: 2010''] Accessed 2002, Oct 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood by many to be a means of overcoming handicaps, achieving greater [[Social equality|equality]], and acquiring wealth and [[social status]].&lt;ref name="Sargent"&gt;Sargent, M. (1994) ''The New Sociology for Australians'' (3rd ed.), Longman Cheshire, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; Education is perceived as a place where children can develop according to their unique needs and potential.&lt;ref name="schofield"/&gt; It is also perceived as one of the best means of achieving greater social equality.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Many would say that the purpose of education should be to develop every individual to their full potential, and give them a chance to achieve as much in life as their natural abilities allow ([[meritocracy]]). Few would argue that any education system accomplishes this goal perfectly.  Some take a particularly critical view, arguing that the education system is designed with the intention of causing the [[social reproduction]] of inequality.

== Foundations ==
Systematic [[sociology]] of [[education]] began with the work of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) on moral education as a basis for [[organic solidarity]], and with studies by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) on the [[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese literati]] as an instrument of political control. After [[World War II]], however, the subject received renewed interest around the world: from technological [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] in the US, egalitarian reform of opportunity in Europe, and [[human capital|human-capital]] theory in economics. These all implied that, with [[industrialization]], the need for a technologically skilled labour force  undermines [[social class|class]] distinctions and other ascriptive systems of stratification, and that education promotes [[social mobility]]. However, statistical and field research across numerous societies showed a persistent link between an individual's social class and achievement, and suggested that education could only achieve limited social mobility.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; Sociological studies showed how schooling patterns reflected, rather than challenged, class stratification and racial and sexual discrimination.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; After the general collapse of [[structural functionalism|functionalism]] from the late 1960s onwards, the idea of education as an unmitigated good was even more profoundly challenged. [[Neo-Marxists]] argued that school education simply produced a docile labour force essential to [[Late capitalism|late-capitalist]] class relations.

== Theoretical perspectives ==
The sociology of education contains a number of theories. Some of the main theories are presented below.

=== Political arithmetic ===
The Political Arithmetic tradition within the sociology of education began with Hogben (1938)&lt;ref&gt;Hogben, L. (1938) Political Arithmetic: a symposium of population studies, London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt; and denotes a tradition of politically critical quantitative research dealing with social inequalities, especially those generated by social stratification (Heath 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Heath, A. (2000) The Political Arithmetic Tradition in the Sociology of Education, Oxford Review of Education 26(3-4): 313-331.&lt;/ref&gt; Important works in this tradition have been (Glass 1954),&lt;ref&gt;Glass, D. V. (1954) Social Mobility in Britain, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; (Floud, et al. 1956)&lt;ref&gt;Floud, J., Halsey, A. H. and Martin, F. (1956) Social class and educational opportunity: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; and (Halsey, et al. 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, A. H., Heath, A. F. and Ridge, J. M. (1980) Origins and destinations : family, class, and education in modern Britain, Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; All of these works were concerned with the way in which school structures were implicated in social class inequalities in Britain. More recent work in this tradition has broadened its focus to include gender,&lt;ref&gt;Gorard, S., Salisbury, J. and Rees, G. (1999) Reappraising the apparent underachievement of boys at school, Gender and Education 11(4): 441-454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A., Heath, A. F. and Rothon, C. (2011) Equalisation or inflation? Social class and gender differentials in England and Wales, Oxford Review of Education 37(2): 215-240.&lt;/ref&gt; ethnic differentials &lt;ref&gt;Heath, A. F. and Cheung, S.-Y. (eds) (2007) Unequal Chances: ethnic minoroties in western labour markets, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and international differences.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, A. F. and Sullivan, A. (2011) Introduction: The democratisation of upper-secondary education?, Oxford Review of Education 37(2): 123-138.&lt;/ref&gt;  While researchers in this tradition have engaged with sociological theories such as Rational Choice Theory &lt;ref&gt;Breen, R. and Goldthorpe, J. (1997) Explaining Educational Differentials: Towards a Rational Action Theory, Rationality and Society 9(3): 275-305.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cultural Reproduction Theory,&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A. (2001) Cultural Capital and Educational Attainment, Sociology 35(4): 893-912.&lt;/ref&gt;  the political arithmetic tradition has tended to remain rather sceptical of 'grand theory' and very much concerned with empirical evidence and social policy. The political arithmetic tradition was attacked by the 'New Sociology of Education' of the 1970s &lt;ref&gt;M. F. D. Young (ed) Knowledge and Control: New Directions for the Sociology of Education, London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; which rejected quantitative research methods. This heralded a period of methodological division within the sociology of education. However, the political arithmetic tradition, while rooted in quantitative methods, has increasingly engaged with mixed methods approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Ogg, T., Zimdars, A. and Heath, A. F. (2009) Schooling effects on degree performance: a comparison of the predictive validity of aptitude testing and secondary school grades at Oxford University, British Educational Research Journal 35(5): 781-807.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural functionalism ===
[[Structural functionalism|Structural functionalists]] believe that society leans towards [[social equilibrium]] and social order. They see society like a human body, in which institutions such as education are like important organs that keep the society/body healthy and well.&lt;ref name="Bessant"&gt;Bessant, J. and Watts, R. (2002) ''Sociology Australia'' (2nd ed), Allen &amp; Unwin, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

====Socialization====

Social health means the same as social order, and is guaranteed when nearly everyone accepts the general moral [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] of their society. Hence structural functionalists believe the aim of key institutions, such as education, is to socialize children and teenagers. [[Socialization]] is the process by which the new generation learns the knowledge, attitudes and values that they will need as productive [[citizens]]. Although this aim is stated in the formal curriculum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au NSW Board of Studies, ''K-6 HSIE Syllabus (NSW Australia)'']&lt;/ref&gt; it is mainly achieved through the [[hidden curriculum]],&lt;ref name="harper"&gt;Harper, G. (1997) "Society, culture, socialization and the individual" in Stafford, C. and Furze, B. (eds) ''Society and Change'' (2nd ed), Macmillan Education Australia, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; a subtler, but nonetheless powerful, [[indoctrination]] of the [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and values of the wider society. Students learn these values because their behavior at school is regulated ([[Durkheim]] in &lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt;) until they gradually internalize and accept them.

====Filling roles in society====

Education must also perform another function: As various jobs become vacant, they must be filled with the appropriate people. Therefore, the other purpose of education is to sort and rank individuals for placement in the labor market [Munro, 1997]. Those with high achievement will be trained for the most important jobs and in reward, be given the highest incomes. Those who achieve the least, will be given the least demanding (intellectually at any rate, if not physically) jobs, and hence the least income.

According to Sennet and Cobb however, "to believe that ability alone decides who is rewarded is to be deceived".&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Meighan agrees, stating that large numbers of capable students from working-class backgrounds fail to achieve satisfactory standards in school and therefore fail to obtain the status they deserve.&lt;ref name="meighan 1997"&gt;Meighan, R. &amp; Siraj-Blatchford, I. (1997) ''A Sociology of Educating'' (3rd Ed), Cassell, London&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob believes this is because the middle class cultural experiences that are provided at school may be contrary to the experiences working-class children receive at home.&lt;ref name="jacob"&gt;Jacob, A. (2001) ''Research links poverty and literacy'', ABC Radio Transcript [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s433501.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, [[working class]] children are not adequately prepared to cope at school. They are therefore "cooled out"&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;Foster, L. E. (1987) ''Australian Education: A Sociological Perspective''(2nd Ed),  Prentice Hall, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; from school with the least qualifications, hence they get the least desirable jobs, and so remain working class. Sargent confirms this cycle, arguing that schooling supports continuity, which in turn supports [[social order]].&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; [[Talcott Parsons]] believed that this process, whereby some students were identified and [[label]]led educational failures, "was a necessary activity which one part of the social system, education, performed for the whole".&lt;ref name="meighan 1997"/&gt; Yet the structural functionalist perspective maintains that this social order, this [[Social change|continuity]], is what most people desire.&lt;ref name="Bessant"/&gt;

=== Education and social reproduction ===
The perspective of [[conflict theory]], contrary to the structural functionalist perspective, believes that society is full of vying social groups with different aspirations, different access to life chances and gain different social rewards.&lt;ref name=furze&gt;Furze, B. and Healy, P. (1997) "Understanding society and change" in Stafford, C. and Furze, B. (eds) ''Society and Change'' (2nd Ed), Macmillan Education Australia, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;  Relations in society, in this view, are mainly based on [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[oppression]], domination and [[Insubordination|subordination]].&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Connell&gt;Connell, R. W. and White, V., (1989) 'Child poverty and educational action' in Edgar, D., Keane, D. &amp; McDonald, P. (eds), ''Child Poverty'', Allen &amp; Unwin, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;  Many teachers assume that students will have particular middle class experiences at home, and for some children this assumption isn't necessarily true.&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; Some children are expected to help their parents after school and carry considerable domestic responsibilities in their often single-parent home.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, B. and Wyn, J. (1987) ''Shaping Futures: Youth Action for Livelihood'', Allen &amp; Unwin, Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt; The demands of this domestic labour often make it difficult for them to find time to do all their homework and thus affects their academic performance.

Where teachers have softened the formality of regular study and integrated student's preferred working methods into the curriculum, they noted that particular students displayed strengths they had not been aware of before.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; However few teachers deviate from the traditional [[curriculum]], and the curriculum conveys what constitutes knowledge as determined by the [[State (polity)|state]] - and those in power [Young in &lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt;]. This knowledge isn't very meaningful to many of the students, who see it as pointless.&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; Wilson &amp; Wyn state that the students realise there is little or no direct link between the subjects they are doing and their perceived future in the labour market.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Anti-school values displayed by these children are often derived from their consciousness of their real interests. Sargent believes that for working-class students, striving to succeed and absorbing the school's middle class values, are accepting their inferior social position as much as if they were determined to fail.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Fitzgerald states that "irrespective of their academic ability or desire to learn, students from poor families have relatively little chance of securing success".&lt;ref name=henry&gt;Henry, M., Knight, J., Lingard, R. and Taylor, S. (1988) ''Understanding Schooling: An Introductory Sociology of Australian Education'', Routledge, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, for middle and especially upper-class children, maintaining their superior position in society requires little effort. The federal government subsidises 'independent' private schools enabling the rich to obtain 'good education' by paying for it.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; With this 'good education', rich children perform better, achieve higher and obtain greater rewards. In this way, the continuation of privilege and wealth for the [[elite]] is made possible ''in continuum''.

Conflict theorists believe this [[social reproduction]] continues to occur because the whole education system is overlain with [[ideology]] provided by the dominant group. In effect, they perpetuate the [[myth]] that education is available to all to provide a means of achieving wealth and status. Anyone who fails to achieve this goal, according to the myth, has only themselves to blame.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Wright agrees, stating that "the effect of the myth is to…stop them from seeing that their personal troubles are part of major social issues".&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; The duplicity is so successful that many parents endure appalling jobs for many years, believing that this sacrifice will enable their children to have opportunities in life that they did not have themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; These people who are poor and disadvantaged are victims of a societal [[confidence trick]]. They have been encouraged to believe that a major goal of schooling is to strengthen equality while, in reality, schools reflect society's intention to maintain the previous unequal distribution of status and power [Fitzgerald, cited in &lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt;].

This perspective has been criticised as [[determinist]]ic and pessimistic, while there is some evidence for [[social mobility]] among disadvantaged students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kislev|first=E.|date=2016-05-01|title=The effect of education policies on higher-education attainment of immigrants in Western Europe: A cross-classified multilevel analysis|url=http://esp.sagepub.com/content/26/2/183.short|journal=Journal of European Social Policy|volume=26|issue=2|pages=183–199|doi=10.1177/0958928716637142|issn=0958-9287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be recognised however that it is a model, an aspect of reality which is an important part of the picture.

=== Structure and agency ===

==== Bourdieu and cultural capital ====
This theory of [[social reproduction]] has been significantly theorised by [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. However Bourdieu as a social theorist has always been concerned with the dichotomy between the objective and subjective, or to put it another way, between [[structure and agency]]. Bourdieu has therefore built his theoretical framework around the important concepts of [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]], field and [[cultural capital]]. These concepts are based on the idea that objective structures determine individuals' chances, through the mechanism of the habitus, where individuals internalise these structures. However, the habitus is also formed by, for example, an individual's position in various fields, their family and their everyday experiences. Therefore, one's class position does not determine one's life chances, although it does play an important part, alongside other factors.

Bourdieu used the idea of [[cultural capital]] to explore the differences in outcomes for students from different classes in the [[French educational system]]. He explored the tension between the conservative reproduction and the innovative production of knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name=harker&gt;Harker, R., (1990) "Education and Cultural Capital" in Harker, R., Mahar, C., &amp; Wilkes, C., (eds) (1990) ''An Introduction to the Work of Pierre Bourdieu: the practice of theory'', Macmillan Press, London&lt;/ref&gt; He found that this tension is intensified by considerations of which particular cultural past and present is to be conserved and reproduced in schools. Bourdieu argues that it is the culture of the dominant groups, and therefore their cultural capital, which is embodied in schools, and that this leads to social reproduction.&lt;ref name=harker/&gt;

The cultural capital of the dominant group, in the form of practices and relation to culture, is assumed by the school to be the natural and only proper type of cultural capital and is therefore legitimated. It demands "uniformly of all its students that they should have what it does not give" [Bourdieu &lt;ref name=swartz&gt;Swartz, D., "Pierre Bourdieu: The Cultural Transmission of Social Inequality" in Robbins, D., (2000) ''Pierre Bourdieu Volume II'', Sage Publications, London, pp.207-217&lt;/ref&gt;]. This legitimate cultural capital allows students who possess it to gain [[educational capital]] in the form of qualifications. Those lower-class students are therefore disadvantaged. To gain qualifications they must acquire legitimate cultural capital, by exchanging their own (usually working-class) cultural capital.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, R., (1984) "On Reproduction, Habitus and Education" in Robbins, D., (2000) ''Pierre Bourdieu Volume II'', Sage Publications, London, pp.164-176&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange is not a straightforward one, due to the class ethos of the lower-class students. Class ethos is described as the particular dispositions towards, and subjective expectations of, school and culture. It is in part determined by the objective chances of that class.&lt;ref name=gorder&gt;Gorder, K., (1980) "Understanding School Knowledge: a critical appraisal of Basil Bernstein and Pierre Bourdieu" in Robbins, D., (2000) ''Pierre Bourdieu Volume II'', Sage Publications, London, pp.218-233&lt;/ref&gt; This means that not only do children find success harder in school due to the fact that they must learn a new way of 'being', or relating to the world, and especially, a new way of relating to and using language, but they must also act against their instincts and expectations. The subjective expectations influenced by the objective structures found in the school, perpetuate social reproduction by encouraging less-privileged students to eliminate themselves from the system, so that fewer and fewer are to be found as one journeys through the levels of the system. The process of social reproduction is neither perfect nor complete,&lt;ref name=harker/&gt; but still, only a small number of less-privileged students achieve success. For the majority of these students who do succeed at school, they have had to internalise the values of the dominant classes and use them as their own, to the detriment of their original habitus and cultural values.'''

Therefore, Bourdieu's perspective reveals how objective structures play an important role in determining individual achievement in school, but allows for the exercise of an individual's agency to overcome these barriers, although this choice is not without its penalties.

'''Identity'''

Drawing on Bourdieu's ideas, Fuller (2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZuvAwAAQBAJ|title=Sociology, Gender and Educational Aspirations: Girls and Their Ambitions|last=Fuller|first=Carol|date=2009-02-10|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781441172822|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) adds to the theoretical understanding of structure and agency by considering how young people shape their educational identity and how this identity is often the result of messages reflected at them, for example, through grades, setting and gendered expectations. Social location is considered important but its role is complex. Her work considered the importance of understanding the ways that individuals identify within an academic discourse, a discourse that typically situates young people dichotomously; as those who will achieve and those that will not. Understanding the importance of areas such as self-efficacy, confidence and resilience in shaping educational identity at the level of agent and subsequently, educational attainment and aspirations, has been central to her most recent work.

'''John Tracy Kidder''' (born November 12, 1945) is an American writer of nonfiction books. He received the   [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his ''[[The Soul of a New Machine]]'' (1981), about the creation of a new computer at [[Data General|Data General Corporation]]. He has received praise and awards for other works, including his biography of [[Paul Farmer]], a doctor and anthropologist, titled ''[[Mountains Beyond Mountains]]'' (2003).

Kidder is considered a [[Creative nonfiction|literary journalist]] because of the strong story line and personal voice in his writing.&lt;ref name=Sims&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Sims |first1=Norman |editor1-first=Norman |editor1-last=Sims |title=The Literary Journalists |year=1984 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-31081-1 |pages=3–25 |chapter=The Literary Journalists }}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|5}} He has cited as his writing influences [[John McPhee]], [[A. J. Liebling]], and [[George Orwell]].&lt;ref name=DLB /&gt;{{Rp|127–128}} In a 1984 interview he said, "McPhee has been my model. He's the most elegant of all the journalists writing today, I think."&lt;ref name=Sims /&gt;{{Rp|7}}

Kidder wrote in a 1994 essay, "In fiction, believability may have nothing to do with reality or even plausibility. It has everything to do with those things in nonfiction. I think that the nonfiction writer's fundamental job is to make what is true believable."&lt;ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
John Tracy Kidder was born November 12, 1945, in New York City.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Authors: New Revision Series |volume=61 |year=1998 |publisher=Gale Research |isbn=0-7876-2004-1 |pages=263–267 |chapter=Kidder, Trina 1945– |author=Daniel Jones, John D. Jorgenson, editors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|263}}
He graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Phillips Academy – Notable Alumni – Literature, Publishing &amp; Journalism | url=http://wwwdev.andover.edu/About/Notable%20Alumni/Pages/LiteraturePublishingJournalism.aspx | publisher=Phillips Academy | year=2009 | access-date=June 10, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090620014733/http://wwwdev.andover.edu/About/Notable%20Alumni/Pages/LiteraturePublishingJournalism.aspx | archivedate=June 20, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended [[Harvard College]], originally majoring in [[political science]], but switching to English after taking a course in creative writing from [[Robert Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kidder |first=Tracy |date=Fall 1996 |title=Courting the approval of the dead |journal= TriQuarterly |issue=97 |page= |pages=43–59 |issn= 0041-3097}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an AB degree from Harvard in 1967.&lt;ref name=CA /&gt;{{Rp|263}}

Kidder served in the [[United States Army]] as a [[first lieutenant]], [[Military intelligence|Military Intelligence]], Vietnam, from 1967 to 1969.&lt;ref name=CA /&gt;{{Rp|263}} After returning from Vietnam, he wrote for some time and was admitted to the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].&lt;ref name=DLB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=David |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography |volume=185  |year=1997 |publisher=Gale Research |isbn=0-7876-1119-0 |pages=127–137 |chapter=Tracy Kidder }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|128}} He received an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degree from the [[University of Iowa]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=CA /&gt;{{Rp|263}}

==Career==
Kidder wrote his first book, ''The Road to Yuba City: a Journey into the [[Juan Corona]] Murders'', while at the [[University of Iowa]]. ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'' commissioned the work, and he continued writing as a freelancer for the magazine during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=DLB /&gt;{{Rp|128}} ''The Road to Yuba City'' was a critical failure,&lt;ref name=DLB /&gt;{{Rp|128, 137}} and Kidder said in a 1995 interview that

&lt;blockquote&gt;I can't say anything intelligent about that book, except that I learned never to write about a murder case. The whole experience was disgusting, so disgusting, in fact, that in 1981 I went to Doubleday and bought back the rights to the book. I don't want ''The Road to Yuba City'' to see the light of day again.&lt;ref name=DLB /&gt;{{Rp|129}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kidder has said that, unlike many other writers, he was not much influenced by his Vietnam experience: "Of course, whenever you're in an experience like Vietnam, it is bound to influence your work; it's inevitable, but I really don't think it greatly shaped me as a writer."&lt;ref name="DLB" /&gt;{{Rp|128}} His works for ''Atlantic Monthly'' include several essays and short stories about the Vietnam War, including "The Death of Major Great" (1974), "Soldiers of Misfortune" (1978), and "In Quarantine" (1980). Writing in 1997, David Bennett rated these three pieces "among the finest reporting to come out of Vietnam."&lt;ref name="DLB" /&gt;{{Rp|128}}

Kidder's second book, ''[[The Soul of a New Machine]]'' (1981), was much more successful than his first. His account of the complex community and environment of programming and computer development won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction]] in 1982. He has continued to write nonfiction books and articles, and these have been well received by the critics.&lt;ref name=DLB /&gt;{{Rp|127}} Kidder's 2009 book, ''Strength in What Remains,'' is a portrait of a man who survived the genocide in [[Burundi]].

He has explored a wide range of topics through his books, ''House'' (1985), a "biography" of a couple having their first house built, and the people involved in the project; ''Among Schoolchildren'' (1989), set in an elementary-school classroom in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]] and reflecting on US education through the lives of these 20 children and their teacher (these two books were both bestsellers); and ''[[Old Friends (book)|Old Friends]]'' (1993), which explored the daily lives and personal growth of a pair of elderly men in a nursing home. His books have made "Notable" annual lists of ''The New York Times'' and received positive praise from critics, in addition to awards.

In fall 2010 Kidder was selected as the first A.M. Rosenthal Writer-in-Residence at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Harvard Kennedy School]]'s [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]]. At the center, he worked with his onetime editor at The Atlantic, Richard Todd, on a book about writing, titled ''Good Prose: The Art of Nonfiction.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.randomhouse.com/acmart/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400069750|title = Random House website|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured to students and did research to identify his next narrative subject.

A '''training ground''' is an area where professional [[association football]] teams prepare for matches, with activities primarily concentrating on [[soccer skills|skills]] and fitness. They also sometimes form part of a club's [[youth system]], as clubs consider it important to have good facilities to aid the development of young players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/7509518.stm Pompey training ground approved], [[BBC Sport]], 16 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Training grounds are usually separate from a team's [[Soccer stadium|stadium]], as clubs use the facilities to avoid overusing the stadium's [[Soccer field|pitch]]. However, teams usually train inside the opposing team's stadium on the day before a [[UEFA|European]] away game, both for the benefit of the [[media (press)|media]] and to become familiar with the surface.

== Training ground incidents ==
There have been several high-profile incidents, at training grounds, where players have been injured in disputes between teammates.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Ben. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article4906911.ece "Training-ground bust-ups: the best of the best"], ''[[The Times]]'', 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joey Barton]] was given a suspended prison sentence, on 1 July 2008, for an assault on teammate [[Ousmane Dabo]] on [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City's]] training ground&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7535664.stm FA charges Barton over Dabo clash], [[BBC Sport]], 31 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andy Carroll]] broke teammate [[Steven Taylor (footballer)|Steven Taylor]]'s jaw in a fight.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Umeå School of Architecture''' (abbreviated UMA) was founded in 2009 as the fourth [[academic]] [[school]] in [[Sweden]] to provide a professional degree in [[architecture]]. It is part of [[Umeå University]]. Unlike the other Architectural Schools in Sweden, UMA has a spoken policy of [[sustainable development]] and [[integrated design]], and aims to grow into "an international [[laboratory]] of experimental architectural development."&lt;ref&gt;Arkitekthögskolan: [http://www.arch.umu.se/english/about-the-school-of-architecture/ About the School of Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Danish architect [[Peter Kjær (architect)|Peter Kjaer]] is appointed [[Rector (academia)|rector]] for the school.

The five-year architectural programme started in fall 2009 at provisionary premises in central [[Umeå]], but could before fall 2010 move to a new building by Danish architect firm [[Henning Larsen Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contractdesign.com/contract/design/features/Umeå-School-of-Archi-6896.shtml Article about the School at Contractdesign.com] Checked June 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; close to the [[Umeå Institute of Design]] and the [[Umeå Academy of Fine Arts]] at the [[Umeå Arts Campus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umu.se/english/news/.cid32667 Article about Umeå Arts Campus] Checked February 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Master of Architecture|Master's degree programs]] will start in fall 2010.
