'''''@earth''''' is a 2011 book made by the [[London]] born (and based) [[photomontage]] artist [[Peter Kennard]] with [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] artist Tarek Salhany. It is a [[photo-essay]] told through photomontage with seven chapters exposing the current state of the Earth, the conditions of life on it and the need to resist injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Borromeo |first=Leah |url=http://www.thecommentfactory.com/peter-kennard-mumbles-at-leah-borromeo-4945/ |title=Peter Kennard mumbles at Leah Borromeo |publisher=The Comment Factory |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on 1 May 2011 by [[Tate|Tate Publishing]].

Apart from the title ''@earth'' (which is also in different languages on its back cover) the pocket book contains no words and its story is told in sequences of constructed images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommentfactory.com/peter-kennard-on-earth-giacometti-heartfield-banksy-and-more-4897/|title=Peter Kennard on @earth, Giacometti, Heartfield, Banksy, and more|last=Kennard|first=Matt|date=6 June 2011|website=|publisher=The Comment Factory|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625174422/http://www.thecommentfactory.com/peter-kennard-on-earth-giacometti-heartfield-banksy-and-more-4897/|archivedate=25 June 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=4 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naomi Klein]], the author of ''[[No Logo]]'' and ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'', said of ''@earth'': "This book perfectly captures the brutal asymmetries of our age: heavy weaponry trained on broken people, all-seeing technologies and disappearing identities, perpetually exhaling industry and an asphyxiating planet. If there's a word that's worth a thousand pictures, it's @earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/pressoffice/pressreleases/2011/23602.htm |title=Press Releases &amp;#124; @earth by Peter Kennard (Tate Publishing) |publisher=Tate |date= |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''@earth'' was launched during a 3-day event called ''shooting@earth'' at [[Black Rat Projects]] in London, together with a display of artworks by [[War Boutique]]. The centrepiece was a [[paintball]] shooting gallery where visitors could fire at silhouetted figures of city bankers.&lt;ref name="AM Black Rat"&gt;Patrick Nguyen [http://arrestedmotion.com/2011/05/viewpoints-peter-kennard-war-boutique-—-shootingearth-black-rat-projects/ Viewpoints: Peter Kennard + War Boutique — ‘shooting@earth’ @ Black Rat Projects], Arrested Motion, 10 May 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3943">'''All Pakistan Awami Muslim League''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|آل پاکستان عوامی مسلم لیگ}}}}) is a Pakistani political party founded by [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] in February 1950. [[Pir of Manki Sharif]] and Khan Ghulam Mohammad Khan from the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–55)|North-West Frontier Province]] (NWFP) joined it soon afterwards.{{sfn|Kamran, Early phase of electoral politics in Pakistan|2009|p=269}}{{sfn|Chowdhury, Moulana Bhashani Leader of the Toiling Masses|2012|p=72}}

Around the same time, [[Iftikhar Mamdot]], who was dismissed from the premiership of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], formed a party called '''Jinnah Muslim League'''. The two parties merged to form '''Jinnah Awami Muslim League''' prior to the provincial elections in 1951.{{sfn|Kamran, Early phase of electoral politics in Pakistan|2009|p=264}}

In the Punjab provincial election in 1951, the Jinnah Awami Muslim League polled 18.3 percent votes and won 32 seats.{{sfn|Kamran, Early phase of electoral politics in Pakistan|2009|p=264}} In the NWFP, it won 4 seats.{{sfn|Kamran, Early phase of electoral politics in Pakistan|2009|p=269}}

In East Pakistan, '''East Pakistan Awami Muslim League''' was founded by [[Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani]] in June 1949.{{sfn|Chowdhury, Moulana Bhashani Leader of the Toiling Masses|2012|p=72}} It was established as the Bengali alternative to the domination of the Muslim League in Pakistan and over centralisation of the government. The party quickly gained massive popular support in East Bengal.&lt;ref name="samsuddin" /&gt; In the 1954 provincial election in Bengal, the party won 143 seats. The United Front led by the party won a total of 223 seats, soundly defeating the Muslim League with 10 seats.{{sfn|Kamran, Early phase of electoral politics in Pakistan|2009|p=277–278}}

Subsequently, the two parties merged in 1959 and used the name ''All Pakistan Awami Muslim League'' (''Awami Muslim League'').{{sfn|Kamran, Early phase of electoral politics in Pakistan|2009|p=274}} The party later evolved into the [[Awami League]], the party that, under the leadership of [[Shaikh Mujibur Rahman]] (himself a former aide to Suharwardy),&lt;ref name="samsuddin"&gt;Abu Zafar Shamsddin, Atmasriti (Self-memories) -1st part, Dhaka, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually led the forces of Bengali nationalism in the struggle against West Pakistan's military and political establishment.&lt;ref name="samsuddin" /&gt;

The All Pakistan Awami Muslim League was formed as a breakaway faction of the "[[Muslim League (Pakistan)|All Pakistan Muslim League]]" in 1949, within two years of the formation of Pakistan. The word [[Muslim]] was dropped in 1953.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

'''Alter-globalization''' (also known as '''alternative globalization''' or '''alter-mundialization'''—from the French alter-[[Mundialization|mondialisation]]—and overlapping with the [[global justice movement]]) is the name of a [[social movement]] whose proponents support global cooperation and interaction, but oppose what they describe as the negative effects of [[economic globalization]], considering it to often work to the detriment of, or not adequately promote, human values such as [[environmental protection|environmental]] and [[global warming|climate protection]], [[economic justice]], [[labor protection]], [[protection of indigenous culture]]s, [[peace]] and [[civil liberties]].

The name may have been derived from a popular slogan of the movement, namely "Another world is possible", which came out of the [[World Social Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hinkelammert |first=Franz Josef |authorlink= |author2=Ulrich Duchrow |editor= |others= |title=Property for People, Not for Profit: Alternatives to the Global Tyranny of Capital |origdate= |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year= 2004|month= |publisher=Progressio |location= |language= |isbn=1-84277-479-4 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=vii  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alter-globalization movement is a cooperative movement designed to "protest the direction and perceived negative economic, political, social, cultural and ecological consequences of [[neoliberal]] globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krishna-Hensel|first=Sai |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Global Cooperation: Challenges and Opportunities in the Twenty-first Century |origdate= |year=2006 |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |month= |publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=202  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many alter-globalists seek to avoid the "disestablishment of local economies and disastrous humanitarian consequences". Most members of this movement shun the label "[[anti-globalization]]" as pejorative and incorrect since they actively support human activity on a global scale and do not oppose economic globalization ''per se''. 

Instead they see their movement as an alternative to what they term [[neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] [[globalization]] in which international institutions (the [[World Trade Organization]], [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]] and the like) and major corporations devote themselves to enriching the developed world while giving little or no attention to what critics say are the detrimental effects of their actions on the people and environments of less developed countries, countries whose governments are often too weak or too corrupt to resist or regulate them. This is not to be confused with [[proletarian internationalism]] as put forth by  [[communism|communists]] in that alter-globalists do not necessarily oppose the [[free market]], but a subset of free-market practices characterized by certain business attitudes and political policies{{example needed|date=June 2018}} that they say often lead to violations of human rights.

== Etymology ==
The term was coined against accusations of [[nationalism]] by [[neoliberal]] proponents of  globalization, meaning a support of both [[humanism]] and [[universal value]]s but a rejection of the [[Washington consensus]] and similar neoliberal policies. ([[wikt:alter#Latin |"Alter"]] is Latin for "other", as in "alternative" and French "autre".) The "alter-globalisation" French movement was thus opposed to the "[[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]]" on the grounds that it only advanced neoliberalism and an [[Anglo-Saxon economy|Anglo-Saxon economic model]].

Originally developed in [[French language|French]] as ''altermondialisme'', it has been borrowed into English in the form of "altermondialism" or "altermondialisation".  It defines the stance of movements opposed to a [[neoliberal]] [[globalization]], but favorable to a globalization respectful of [[human rights]], the [[natural environment|environment]], [[national sovereignty]] and [[cultural diversity]].

Following the French usage of the word ''altermondialist'', the English counterpart "alter-globalist" may have been coined.

The term "alter-globalization" is derived from the term "anti-globalization", which journalists and others have used to describe the movement. Many French journalists in particular have since ceased using the term "anti-globalisation" in favor of "alter-globalisation". It is supposed to distinguish proponents of alter-globalization from different "anti-globalization" activists (those who are against any kind of globalization, namely [[Nationalism|nationalists]], [[Protectionism|protectionists]], [[Communitarianism|communitarians]] and so on).

== History ==
Economic integration via trade, financial flows, and investments had been occurring for many years, but the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] brought significant attention to the outcry against neoliberal economic integration through media coverage, support groups, and activists.{{how|date=June 2018}} Though this opposition first became highly popularized in the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests]], it can be traced back prior to the 1980s when the [[Washington Consensus]] became a dominant development in thinking and policy-making.&lt;ref name="bh713"&gt;{{cite book |last=Broad |first=Robin |authorlink= |author2=Zahara Heckscher |editor= |others= |title=Before Seattle: The Historical Roots of the Current Movement against Corporate-Led Globalisation |origdate= |date=August 2003 |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=713–728  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was later helped by Internet communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Russia, Lagin | title=Towards The Theory of Alter Globalism Ghost of Alter Globalization | url=http://bibliotecavirtual.clacso.org.ar/ar/libros/cuba/if/marx/documentos/22/Towards%20the%20theory%20of%20alter-globalism....pdf | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2009-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The 1970s and Southern resistance ====
The 1970s saw resistance to global expansion by both government and non-government parties. U.S. Senator [[Frank Church]] was concerned with the role multinational corporations were beginning to play in global trade, and created a subcommittee that reviewed corporate practices to see if they were advancing U.S. interests or not (i.e. exporting jobs that could be kept within the United States). The results prompted some countries in the [[Global South]] (ranging from Tanzania to the Philippines) to call for rules and collective action that would raise or stabilize raw material prices, and increase Southern exports.&lt;ref name="bh713"/&gt;

== Issues and activities ==
Alter-globalization activists fight for better treatment of developing countries and their economies, workers rights, fair trade, and equal human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Razsa, Maple.  ''Bastards of Utopia: Living Radical Politics After Socialism''.  Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They oppose the [[exploitation of labor]], outsourcing of jobs to foreign nations (though some argue this is a nationalistic rather than alter-globalist motive), pollution of local environments, and harm to foreign cultures to which jobs are outsourced. 

Aspects of the movement include:
# Attempts at an alter-globalization movement to reform policies and processes of the [[WTO]] include: "alternative principles of public accountability, the rights of people and the protection of the environment" through the theoretical framework of Robert Cox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paterson|first=William|authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Before Seattle: The Historical Roots of the Current Movement against Corporate-Led Globalisation |origdate= |date=December 2006|url=https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/dspace/handle/1893/186
 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |publisher=University of Stirling |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Labor movement and [[trade union]] initiatives have begun to respond to economic and political globalisation by extending their cooperation and initiatives to the transnational level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/35/1/63.abstract ''The Construction of a Trans-European Labour Movement'', Capital &amp; Class, February 2011, by Daniel Jakopovich]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Fair trade]] initiatives, corporate codes of conduct, and social clauses as well as a return to local markets instead of relying too heavily on global markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broad |first=Robin |authorlink= |author2=John Cavanagh|editor= |others= |title=Development Redefined: How the Market Met its Match |origdate= |origyear=|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Alter-globalization activists have promoted alternative water governance models through North-South red-green alliances between organized labor, environmental groups, women's groups, and indigenous groups" (spoken in response to the increase in privatization of the global [[water supply]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakker |first=Karen |authorlink= |year=2006 |month= |title=The Commons Versus the Commodity: Alter-globalization, Anti-privatization and the Human Right to Water in the Global South  |journal=Antipode |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages= |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.2007.00534.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "The first current of the alter-globalization movement considers that instead of getting involved in a global movement and international forums, the path to social change lies through giving life to horizontal, participatory, convivial and sustainable values in daily practices, personal life and local spaces. Many urban activists cite the way that, for example, the Zapatistas in Mexico and other Latin American indigenous movements now focus on developing communities' local autonomy via participatory self-government, autonomous education systems and improving the quality of life. They appreciate too, the convivial aspect of local initiatives and their promise of small but real alternatives to corporate globalization and mass consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pleyers|first=Geoffrey|authorlink= |date=March 2009 |title=WSF 2009: A generation's challenge  |journal=OpenSpaceForum|volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.openspaceforum.net/twiki/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=702 |accessdate=2009-04-09 |quote= }} {{cite journal|last=Pleyers|first=Geoffrey|authorlink= |date=December 2010 |title=Alter-Globalization  |journal=Polity Press|volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of alter-globalization have set up an online global news network, the [[Independent Media Center]], to report on developments pertinent to the movement. Groups in favor of alter-globalization include [[ATTAC]], an international trade reform network headquartered in France.

The largest forum for alter-globalization activity is the annual [[World Social Forum]]. The [[World Social Forum]] is intended as a democratic space organized in terms of the movement's values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scerri|first=Andy|title=The World Social Forum : Another World Might Be Possible|journal=Social Movement Studies: Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest|year=2013|volume=12|issue=1|pages=111–120|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.access.ewha.ac.kr/ehost/detail?sid=803dce68-26a6-473e-b8a2-544a813e17fc%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=10&amp;hid=108|doi=10.1080/14742837.2012.711522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brights Grove''' is a [[bedroom community]] in [[Sarnia]], [[Lambton County]], [[Ontario]], Canada,
on the shore of [[Lake Huron]].  It is the childhood home of [[PGA Tour|golf pro]] [[Mike Weir]], winner of the 2003 [[Masters Tournament|Masters]].

== The Owenite Project ==
Brights Grove was the site of Canada's first [[commune (intentional community)|commune]].&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Heritage Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829, Brights Grove was established along the model of [[Robert Owen]]'s [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]] project by [[Henry Jones (1776-1852)|Henry Jones]] (1776–1852). The colony was named 'Maxwell' and was a short-lived project. However, it has been argued by Canadian socialist historian Ian McKay that "[t]he builders of the short-lived colony named Maxwell that Jones planted near Sarnia may well have been the first people in [[North America]] to call themselves '[[socialists]]'."

In the 1970s, the Ontario Heritage Foundation erected an historical plaque recognizing the site with the following text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1829, Henry Jones of Devon, England, a retired purser in the Royal Navy, brought a group of more than 50 emigrants from the United Kingdom to this area where he established a settlement on a {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}} tract of land on Lake Huron.  An early supporter and dedicated follower of Robert Owen, the well-known British social reformer. [sic] Jones named the settlement "Maxwell" and organized the community on the basis of common ownership and collective living.  The settlers built a large log house with community kitchen and dining-room but separate rooms for each family. A school and storehouse were added. Within a few years, however, disappointing harvests and the burning of the log house led the colonists gradually to abandon the enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMABA Photograph of Ontario Heritage Foundation historical plaque]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Faethorne House ==

In 1875, Col. Robert F. Faethorne built what is now known as the Faethorne House.  Faethorne built the house on the most easterly of the five farms (the "East Range") into which the land grant of Henry Jones, Faethorne's father-in-law, had been divided.  Robert Faethorne had married Jones' daughter, Elizabeth, and farmed the East Range.  Faethorne was interested in race horses, imported trees to beautify his property and took an active part in the militia.  In 1862, he was promoted to full colonel to command the local military district until after the Fenian alarms of 1866 and 1868.

On Faethorne's death in 1897, the house was sold to Angus Jamieson.  In 1921, it was purchased by H.F. Holland who restored it and the grounds.  In 1934, it achieved notoriety when John Labatt, of the brewing family, who had rented it for the summer, was kidnapped on his way to London.   In 1938, the house was sold once more.  Under the name of Wildwood, it began a long career as a summer resort and golf club.  By 1978, it was badly in need of repairs when it passed into the hands of Sarnia Township.  It was restored to its present condition and started a new life as the Brights Grove library and Gallery in the Grove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery in the Grove, Bright's Grove, Ontario|url=http://galleryinthegrove.com/|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Big band era ==
Brights Grove hosted many top performers at the Kenwick dance hall.

In the late 1940s, Kenwick-on-the-Lake was open air in the round. The venue served as a Saturday night destination for passengers of the SS ''Noronic'' that stopped at Sarnia on its trip around the [[Great Lakes]] from [[Toronto]] until it burnt out alongside the quay in Toronto.
[[Swing era|Bands]] that performed at the dance hall include [[Duke Ellington]], [[Count Basie]], and [[Lionel Hampton]]. There was also boxing.

Later years saw [[Rock music|rock]] acts, such as [[Alice Cooper]].

The structure was destroyed by fire and is now a [[basketball]] court on the lakefront.

== Salmon fishery ==
Brights Grove has two creeks that attract [[salmon]] during the spring fishery. Cow Creek and Perch Creek. The Bluewater Anglers in Sarnia stock [[salmon]], [[rainbow trout]], and [[brown trout]] into [[Lake Huron]].

== Famous people ==
* [[PGA Tour|golf professional]] [[Mike Weir]].
* Poet [[Paul Vermeersch]]
* [[PGA Tour|golf professional]] [[Matt Hill (golfer)|Matt Hill]].
* [[Bluegrass (music)|Bluegrass]] [[harmonica]] player [[Mike Stevens (bluegrass harmonica)|Mike Stevens]]

== Lake Huron Waterfront Walking Trails ==
There are 8 kilometres of lakefront walking trails, half is on rural road and other on dedicated bike/walk path.

== Howard Watson Nature Trail ==
Brights Grove is located halfway on a 25&amp;nbsp;km nature trail from Sarnia to Camlachie. It is a good rail path, crosses numerous creeks (including Cow &amp; Perch Creek), and is well maintained. Visitors can do a loop of rail path and lakefront around Brights Grove of 20&amp;nbsp;km or more.

The '''Charlemagne Prize''' ({{lang-de|Karlspreis}}; full name originally ''Internationaler Karlspreis der Stadt Aachen'', '''International Charlemagne Prize of the City of Aachen''', since 1988 ''Internationaler Karlspreis zu Aachen'', '''International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen''') is a prize awarded for work done in the service of [[European unification]]. It has been awarded annually since 1950 by the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Aachen]]. It commemorates [[Charlemagne]], ruler of the [[Frankish Empire]] and founder of what became the [[Holy Roman Empire]], who resided and is buried at Aachen. Traditionally the award is given to the recipient on [[Ascension Day]] in a ceremony in the [[Aachen Rathaus|town hall of Aachen]]. In April 2008, the organisers of the Charlemagne Prize and the [[European Parliament]] jointly created a new [[European Charlemagne Youth Prize]], which recognises contributions by young people towards the process of European integration. [[Patronage#Charity|Patrons]] of the foundation are [[King Philippe of Belgium]], [[King Felipe VI of Spain]], and [[Henri,_Grand_Duke_of_Luxembourg|Henri, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.karlspreis.de/en/the-committees/patrons&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aachen BW 2016-07-09 11-56-24.jpg|thumb|The city hall of [[Aachen]]]]
On 19 December 1949, [[Kurt Pfeiffer]] presented to the reading group "Corona Legentium Aquensis", which he had founded, his proposals for the prize: "We have the honour of proposing annual presentation of an international prize for the most valuable contribution in the services of Western European understanding and work for the community, and in the services of humanity and world peace. This contribution may be in the field of literary, scientific, economic or political endeavour".

The sponsors of the prize, the City of Aachen, refer to Charlemagne as the "Founder of [[Western Culture]]", and assert that under his reign, the City of Aachen was once the spiritual and political centre of the whole of what is now [[western Europe]].

The first Charlemagne Prize was awarded to [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], the founder of the [[Pan-European Movement]].

Following the presentation of the award to the Italian Prime Minister [[Alcide De Gasperi|Alcide de Gasperi]] in 1952, the International Charlemagne Prize of the City of Aachen has repeatedly sent messages going far beyond Germany and promoting the "unity of Europe".

The award sponsors assert that the list of Charlemagne Prize winners reflects the history of the [[European unification|European process of unification]]. They continue that it has been awarded to the founding fathers of the [[United Europe]] such as [[Alcide de Gasperi|de Gasperi]], [[Robert Schuman|Schuman]], [[Jean Monnet|Monnet]] and [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]], and to those who have embodied hope for integration such as [[Edward Heath]], [[Konstantin Karamanlis]], and His Majesty [[Juan Carlos I]].

The sponsors promote that the Charlemagne Prize is not only an expression of gratitude for lasting services for the unity of Europe, but also an encouragement and an expression of hopes and expectations directed towards the future. They quote [[Kurt Pfeiffer]]: "the Charlemagne Prize reaches into the future, and at the same time it embodies an obligation - an obligation of the highest ethical value. It is directed at a voluntary union of the European peoples without constraint, so that in their newfound strength they may defend the highest earthly goods - freedom, humanity and peace - and safeguard the future of their children and children's children".

In April 2008, the organisers of the Charlemagne Prize and the [[European Parliament]] jointly created a new [[European Charlemagne Youth Prize]], which recognises contributions by young people towards the process of European integration.

{{About|the military rank|the honorific title of chivalric orders|Commander (orders)|other uses|Commander (disambiguation)}}
{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}
{{Military ranks|state=expanded}}
'''Commander''' is a common [[naval]] and [[air force]] [[officer rank]]. Commander is also used as a rank or title in other formal organisations, including several [[police]] forces. 

Commander is also a generic term for an officer commanding any armed forces unit, for example "platoon commander", "brigade commander" and "squadron commander". In the police, terms such as "borough commander" and "incident commander" are used.

==Commander as a naval and air force rank==
{{Navalranks}}
Commander is a rank used in navies but is very rarely used as a rank in [[army|armies]].  The title, originally "master and commander,"&lt;ref&gt;See also: ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; originated in the 18th century to describe naval officers who commanded ships of war too large to be commanded by a lieutenant but too small to warrant the assignment of a [[post-captain]] and (before about 1770) a sailing-master; the commanding officer served as his own Master. In practice, these were usually unrated [[sloop-of-war|sloops-of-war]] of no more than 20 guns. The [[Royal Navy]] shortened "master and commander" to "commander" in 1794; however, the term "master and commander" remained (unofficially) in common parlance for several years.&lt;ref name="NHC"&gt;{{Cite journal |publisher=Naval Historical Center |title=Why is the Colonel called a 'Kernal?' |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/trivia/triv4-5h.htm |year=1998 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224013131/http://www.history.navy.mil/trivia/triv4-5h.htm |archivedate=2011-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent American rank [[master commandant]] remained in use until changed to [[Commander (United States)#Naval rank|commander]] in 1838. A corresponding rank in some navies is [[Frigate Captain|frigate captain]]. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the rank has been assigned the [[Naval officer ranks#NATO Rank Codes|NATO rank code]] of OF-4.

Various functions of commanding officers were also styled ''Commandeur''. In the navy of the [[Dutch Republic]], anyone who commanded a ship or a fleet without having an appropriate rank to do so, could be called a Commandeur. This included ad hoc fleet Commanders and acting Captains (''Luitenant-Commandeur''). In the fleet of the [[Admiralty of Zeeland|Admiralty of Zealand]] however, ''commandeur'' was a formal rank, the equivalent of ''[[Schout-bij-nacht]]'' (Rear-Admiral) in the other Dutch admiralties. The Dutch use of the title as a rank lives on in the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], as the equivalent of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]].  In the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]], however, this rank is known by the English spelling of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] which is the Dutch equivalent of the British [[Air Commodore]].

=== Australia ===
The rank of commander in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) is identical in description to that of a commander in the British [[Royal Navy]]. RAN chaplains who are in Division 1, 2 and 3 (of five divisions) have the equivalent rank standing of commanders. This means that to officers and NCOs below the rank of commander, lieutenant colonel. or wing commander, the chaplain is a superior.

To those officers ranked higher than commander, the chaplain is subordinate. Although this equivalency exists, RAN chaplains who are in Divisions 1, 2 and 3 do not actually wear the rank of commander, and they hold no command privilege.

=== Canada ===
{{main|Commander (Canada)}}

=== Denmark===
{{main|Ranks and insignia of Royal Danish Army}}
In Denmark, the rank of commander exists as ''kommandørkaptajn'' ("Commander captain" or "commanding captain"), which is senior to captain (''kaptajn'') and ''kommandør'' ("commander", which is senior to ''kommandørkaptajn''..

=== France ===
[[File:French Navy-Rama NG-OF4.svg|thumb|right|60px|Shoulder insignia of a French ''capitaine de frégate'']]
{{main|Ranks in the French Navy}}
In France, the rank of commander exists as ''capitaine de frégate'' ("[[frigate captain]]"). It is senior to ''capitaine de corvette'' ("[[corvette captain]]"), and junior to ''capitaine de vaisseau'' ("[[ship-of-the-line captain]]").
{{-}}

=== Japan ===
The rank of commander was used in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and continues to be used in the modern [[Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force]]. Though the modern rank is translated as "commander" in English, its literal translation is "captain second rank." The rank is equivalent to that of a commander in the [[U.S. Navy]].

=== Malta ===
Commander is a rank in the [[Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem]], and is denoted by the post-nominal letters CLJ.

=== Poland ===
[[File:POL PMW pagon2 komandor porucznik.svg|thumb|right|100px|''Komandor porucznik'', Poland]]
The corresponding rank in the [[Polish Navy]] is ''komandor porucznik''.
{{-}}
=== Russia ===
{{see|Naval ranks and insignia of the Russian Federation}}
In the [[Russian Navy]] the equivalent rank to commander is "captain of the second rank."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt; {{lang-ru|капитан 2-го ранга}}; ''kapitan vtorogo ranga''; abbreviated "кавторанг"; ''kavtorang''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russian Empire====
The rank was introduced in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] by [[Peter the Great]] in 1722. From the introduction of the Russian [[Table of Ranks]] to its abolition in 1917, "captain of the second rank" was equal to a court councillor, at the sixth level out of 14 ranks. Until 1856 it was also conferred hereditary nobility on the holder.

====Soviet Navy====
The equivalent rank in the Soviet Navy from 1918 to 1935 was "[[first mate]]", (старпом корабля 1 ранга; ''starpom korablya pervogo ranga'').&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Russian word "старпом" (''starpom'') is an abbreviation of "старший помощник" (''starshy pomoshchnik''), literally "senior assistant". Thus "старпом корабля 1 ранга" (''starpom korablya pervogo ranga'') is literally the "senior assistant of the ship, 1st rank" - the first mate.&lt;/ref&gt; The rank returned to the Imperial Russian Navy form of '''''Captain 2nd rank''''' in 1935.

===Scandinavia===
Commander is a naval rank in Scandinavia (''Kommandør'' in Danish and Norwegian, ''Kommendör'' in Swedish) equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of captain. The [[Scandinavia]]n the rank of commander is immediately above "commander-captain" ({{lang-no|Kommandørkaptein}}, {{lang-sv|Kommendörkapten}}, {{lang-da|Kommandørkaptajn}}), which is equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpsotc.gr/dat/57FF3440/file.pdf |title=NATO grades / national ranks: Navy |publisher=Hellenic Multinational Peace Support Operations Training Center |format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810003156/http://www.mpsotc.gr/dat/57FF3440/file.pdf|archivedate=10 August 2017 |date= |accessdate=24 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
In the [[Spanish Navy]] the equivalent rank to commander is ''capitán de fragata''.

=== United Kingdom ===

====Royal Navy====
{{main|Commander (Royal Navy)}}
[[File:Generic-Navy-O5.svg|thumb|right|55px||Insignia of a Royal Navy commander]]
A commander in the Royal Navy is above the rank of [[lieutenant commander]], below the rank of [[captain (naval)|captain]], and is equivalent in rank to a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the army.  A commander may command a [[frigate]], [[destroyer]], [[submarine]], aviation squadron or shore installation, or may serve on a staff.

====Royal Air Force====
Since the British [[Royal Air Force]]'s mid-rank officers' ranks are modelled on those of the [[Royal Navy]], the term [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] is used as a rank, and this is the equivalent of a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the army or a commander in the navy. The rank of wing commander is above that of [[squadron leader]] and below that of [[group captain]].

In the former [[Royal Naval Air Service]], which was merged with the [[Royal Flying Corps]] to form the Royal Air Force in 1918, the pilots held appointments as well as their normal ranks in the Royal Navy, and they wore insignia appropriate to the appointment instead of the rank. A flight commander wore a star above a lieutenant's two rank stripes, squadron commander wore two stars above two rank stripes (less than eight years' seniority) or two-and-a-half rank stripes (over eight years seniority), and wing commander wore three rank stripes. The rank stripes had the usual Royal Navy curl, and they were surmounted by an eagle.

===United States===

{{main|Commander (United States)}}

===Vietnam===
Commander (''trung tá'') is a 2-star field grade officer of [[Vietnam People's Navy]]

==Commander as a military appointment==

For instance, as in various small colonial settlements (such as various [[Caribbean]] islands) commanding the [[garrison]] was the crux of the top job, the military title ''Commandeur'' could be used instead of a civilian gubernatorial style, not unlike the Portuguese [[Captain-major]].

===British Army===
In the [[British Army]], the term "commander" is officially applied to the [[non-commissioned officer]] in charge of a [[section (military unit)|section]] (section commander), vehicle (vehicle commander) or gun (gun commander), to the [[subaltern (rank)|subaltern]] or [[Captain (land)|captain]] commanding a [[platoon]] (platoon commander), or to the [[brigadier]] commanding a [[brigade]] (brigade commander). Other officers commanding units are usually referred to as the [[Officer Commanding|officer commanding]] (OC), [[Commanding Officer|commanding officer]] (CO), [[General Officer Commanding|general officer commanding]] (GOC), or [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief|general officer commanding-in-chief]] (GOC-C), depending on rank and position, although the term "commander" may be applied to them informally.

In the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] commander is a rank equivalent to [[major]].

=== Netherlands ===
''Commandeur'' as title of colonial office was the case on the island of [[Tobago]] in the Dutch colony of [[Nieuw Walcheren]] ('New Walcheren')

===New Zealand Army===
The usage is similar to the [[United States Army]], with the term "commander" usually applying to very senior officers only, typically at divisional level (major general).

===Spanish Armed Forces and Guardia Civil===
In the [[Spanish Army]], the [[Spanish Air Force]] and the [[Spanish Navy Marines|Marine Infantry]], the term commander is the literal translation of "comandante", the Spanish equivalent of a Commonwealth [[major]]. The [[Guardia Civil]] shares the Army ranks, and the officer commanding a house-garrison (usually a NCO or a lieutenant, depending on the size) is addressed as the "comandante de puesto" (post commander).

===United States Army===
In the [[United States Army]], the term "commander" is officially applied to the [[commanding officer]] of army units; hence, there are [[Company Commander|company commanders]], [[Battalion Commander|battalion commanders]], [[Brigade Commander|brigade commanders]], and so forth.  At the highest levels of [[U.S. military]] command structure, "commander" also refers to what used to be called [[commander-in-chief]], or CINC, until October 24, 2002, although the term CINC is still used in casual speech.

===United States Air Force===
In the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], the term "commander" (abbreviated "CC" in office symbols, i.e. "OG/CC" for "operations group commander") is officially applied to the commanding officer of an Air Force unit; hence, there are flight commanders, squadron commanders, group commanders, wing commanders, and so forth. In rank, a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] commander is typically a [[lieutenant]] or [[Captain (land)|captain]], a [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] commander is typically a [[major]] or [[Lieutenant Colonel|lieutenant colonel]], a [[Group (air force)|group]] commander is typically a [[colonel]], and a [[Wing (air force unit)|wing]] commander is typically a senior colonel or a [[brigadier general]].

==Commander as a non-military rank or title==

===NASA rank===
In NASA spacecraft missions since the beginning of [[Project Gemini]], one crew member on each spacecraft is designated as mission commander.  The commander is the captain of the ship, and makes all real-time critical decisions on behalf of the crew and in coordination with the Mission Control Center (MCC).

===Use in aviation ===
The title of aircraft commander is used in civil aviation to refer to the [[pilot in command]] (commonly referred to as "captain", which is technically an airline rank and not related to the commander's role on board the aircraft).

===British police rank===
[[File:ACC.svg|100px|right|thumb|Epaulette of a commander in the City of London Police or Metropolitan Police]]

Within the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British police]], commander is a [[Chief police officer|chief officer]] rank in the two police forces responsible for law enforcement within [[London]], the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] and [[City of London Police]]. In both forces, the rank is senior to [[Chief Superintendent#United Kingdom|chief superintendent]]; in the Metropolitan Police it is junior to [[deputy assistant commissioner]] and in the City of London Police it is junior to [[Assistant Commissioner#United Kingdom|assistant commissioner]]. In forces outside London, the rank equates to [[Assistant Chief Constable|assistant chief constable]] which bears the same insignia.

The Metropolitan Police introduced the rank in 1946, after the rank of deputy assistant commissioner was split in two, with senior DACs keeping that rank and title and junior DACs being regraded as commanders. The Metropolitan Police also used the rank of [[Deputy commander (Metropolitan Police)|deputy commander]], ranking just below that of commander, between 1946 and 1968.

Officers in charge of policing each of the [[London borough|London's boroughs]] are given the title "borough commander". However, most such officers do not hold the actual rank of commander but instead hold the rank of chief superintendent. An exception to this is the borough commander of [[Westminster]], who actually holds the rank of commander due to the size, complexity, and high-profile nature of the borough.

The Metropolitan Police Service announced that by Summer 2018 the rank would be phased out, along with that of [[chief inspector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.met.police.uk/news/met-police-to-modernise-its-rank-structure-191284 |title="Met police to modernise its rank structure", MPS website |access-date=2016-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019142734/http://news.met.police.uk/news/met-police-to-modernise-its-rank-structure-191284 |archive-date=2016-10-19 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2017 it was announced that the new [[Commissioner]] [[Cressida Dick]] had cancelled the plan to phase them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.policeoracle.com/news/HR_personnel_and_staff_development/2017/Aug/17/met-cancels-plans-to-abolish-two-ranks_95557.html|title=Met cancels plan to abolish two ranks|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825234448/https://www.policeoracle.com/news/HR_personnel_and_staff_development/2017/Aug/17/met-cancels-plans-to-abolish-two-ranks_95557.html|archive-date=2017-08-25|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rank badge worn by a commander or an assistant chief constable consists of crossed [[tipstaff|tipstaves]] within a [[wreath]]. Until the abolition of the rank of deputy commander in 1968, however, a commander wore the same badge of rank as a deputy assistant commissioner.

===Australian police rank===
In Australia, commander is a rank used by the Victorian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/retrievemedia.asp?Media_ID=21131 |title=Victoria Police Website |access-date=2009-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520132311/http://www.police.vic.gov.au/retrievemedia.asp?Media_ID=21131 |archive-date=2009-05-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasmanian, Western Australian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.police.wa.gov.au/Aboutus/Rankinsignias/tabid/1242/Default.aspx |title=Western Australia Police Website |access-date=2009-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106215520/http://www.police.wa.gov.au/ABOUTUS/RankInsignias/tabid/1242/Default.aspx |archive-date=2008-01-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; South Australian, and [[Australian Federal Police|Australian Federal]] police forces. The insignia consists of a crown over three bath stars in a triangular formation, equivalent to a [[brigadier]] in the army. In all four forces, it is junior to the rank of [[Assistant Commissioner|assistant commissioner]], and senior to the rank of [[Chief Superintendent|chief superintendent]], with the exception of Western Australia and Victoria where it is senior to the rank of [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]].

In New South Wales the position of commander is instated to officers (usually superintendents) in charge of a command or unit.

===United States police rank===
:''See: {{section link|Police ranks of the United States|Ranks}}.''
Some large police departments and sheriff's offices in the US have a commander rank. Most commonly, this is the next rank above captain. Examples of this include the [[Chicago Police Department]], [[Los Angeles Police Department]], [[San Francisco Police Department]], [[Hawai'i County Police Department]], [[Portland Police Bureau]] and [[Rochester Police Department]]. In others, such as the [[Phoenix Police Department]] and [[Saint Paul Police Department]], a commander rank is the next rank above lieutenant, and is equivalent to captain.

A commander in the LAPD is equivalent to an [[Inspector#United States|inspector]] in other large US departments (such as the [[NYPD]]); the LAPD rank was originally called inspector as well, but was changed in 1974 to commander after senior officers voiced a preference for the more [[military]]-sounding rank. The [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] also uses the rank of commander, which is a grade above inspector and two grades above captain.

The insignia worn is usually a gold oak leaf (equivalent to an army [[Major (United States)|major]]). It may alternatively be a silver oak leaf (equivalent to an army [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]]) or one or more stars.
Commander is also used as a title in certain circumstances, such as the commander of a squad of detectives, who would usually be of the rank of lieutenant.

===Canadian police rank===
The Montreal police force, [[Service de police de la Ville de Montréal]], uses the rank of commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spvm.qc.ca/en/carrieres/5_1_1_1_fonctions.asp|title=Positions|work=Service de police de la Ville de Montréal|accessdate=30 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504134724/http://www.spvm.qc.ca/en/carrieres/5_1_1_1_fonctions.asp|archive-date=2010-05-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incident Command System===
In the [[Incident Command System]] the incident commander is in charge of the response to an emergency. The title may pass from person to person as the incident develops.

===Chivalric orders===
{{main|Commander (orders)}}
The title of Commander is used in chivalric orders such as the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] for a member senior to a [[knight]].  The title of knight commander is often used to denote an even higher rank.  These conventions are also used by most of the continental orders of chivalry.  The United Kingdom uses different classifications.

In most of the British orders of knighthood, the grade of Knight (or Dame) Commander is the lowest grade of knighthood, but is above the grade of companion (which does not carry a knighthood). In the [[Royal Victorian Order]] and the [[Order of the British Empire]], the grade of Commander is senior to the grade of Lieutenant or Officer respectively, but junior to that of Knight or Dame Commander. In the British [[Venerable Order of Saint John]], a Commander ranks below a Knight.

===In common usage===
"Commander" may sometimes be used by laymen, usually applied to the person who is accountable for and holds authority over a group or the attempts of a group to achieve a common goal.

The '''Common Application Process''' (CAP) is a new England-wide scheme for course applications to schools and colleges after the ages of 14 and 16, via the internet.

==English state schools and colleges==
It is used, and will be used, by schools for admission to sixth forms or GCSE courses. Each Connexions area (usually one [[local education authority]] or an education partnership of two nearby LEAs) may have a separate '''Common Application Process''' (CAP) website. This standardises the application, and allows students to know the whole complement of choices available - not just those in their local town, or local school or college.

The name Common Application Process, using websites for each Connexions area (LEA), is applying the [[UCAS]] method (of applying for university courses) to school admissions - to widen knowledge of the scope of courses available. It makes it a more up-front and transparent method, less informal, of applying to further education and GCSE courses. It also saves time and duplication, by not ''re-inventing the wheel'' each time a school has to design an application system - it has been combined into one for each Connexions area. It has only been possible since improved access to the internet has made it viable.

It is aimed specifically at people at school or college ages 14 to 19 and is linked to the local [[Connexions (agency)|Connexions]] office ([[Connexions Centre]]) for that area. It is the infrastructure and interface for applications to education after 14, allowing easy access to the Area Wide Prospectus (AWP) for that Connexions area. It is a ''joined-up service'' of education application - Connexions itself is designed similarly as a ''joined-up service''.

Education of the age bracket from 14-19 was partly maintained by Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) before replaced by [[Young People's Learning Agency]] (YPLA). The provision of 14-19 education has now been placed much more in the hands of local education authorities. Education at the 14-19 level is planned by Area Strategy Groups (ASGs) within each Connexions area, which look after the relevant district council areas.

Where the term ''Common Application Process'' is used in the context of English schools, it denotes an unambiguous and uniform method of application across the Connexions area. It is the responsibility of the relevant area (LEA or similar) to provide a CAP for all the courses available after 14.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/_arc_Post16Learning/Page1/DCSF-00214-2009 DfE Action Plan for the 14-19 Prospectus and Common Application Process]&lt;/ref&gt;

However although it is a common application, access to more demanding academic courses after 16 will depend on exam success at 16, and therefore not available to all.

===Project history===
At the moment the CAP is being trialled in some LEAs (or partnerships). The fundamental intention of the vast government IT project is to attract more people to stay on for training after 16, if only by preventing ignorance.

'''Commonwealth''' is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the [[common good]]. Historically it has sometimes been synonymous with "[[republic]]". The noun "commonwealth", meaning "public welfare general good or advantage" dates from the 15th century. Originally a phrase (the common-wealth or the common weal – echoed in the modern synonym "public weal") it comes from the old meaning of "[[wealth]]", which is "well-being", and is itself a loose translation of the Latin [[res publica]] (republic). The term literally meant "common well-being". In the 17th century, the definition of "commonwealth" expanded from its original sense of "[[public welfare]]" or "[[wikt:commonweal|commonweal]]" to mean "a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or [[democracy|democratic state]]".

The term evolved to become a title to a number of political entities. Three countries – [[Australia]], the [[Bahamas]], and [[Dominica]] – have the official title "Commonwealth", as do four [[U.S. state]]s and two [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]]. More recently, the term has been used to name some fraternal associations of nations, most notably the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], an organization primarily of former territories of the [[British Empire]], which is often referred to as simply "the Commonwealth".

==Historical use==

===Rome===

Translations of Roman writers' works to English have on occasion translated "''[[Res publica]]''", and variants thereof, to "the commonwealth", a term referring to the Roman state as a whole.

===England===

The [[Commonwealth of England]] was the official name of the political unit (''de facto'' military rule in the name of parliamentary supremacy) that replaced the [[Kingdom of England]] (after the [[English Civil War]]) from 1649–53 and 1659–60, under the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and his son and successor [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. From 1653 to 1659, although still legally known as a Commonwealth, the republic, united with the former [[Kingdom of Scotland]], operated under different institutions (at times as a ''de facto'' monarchy) and is known by historians as the Protectorate. In a British context, it is sometimes referred to as the "Old Commonwealth".{{cn|date=July 2015}}

===Iceland===

The [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] or the [[Icelandic Free State]] ({{lang-is|Þjóðveldið}}) was the state existing in Iceland between the establishment of the [[Althing]] in 930 and the pledge of fealty to the [[King of Norway|Norwegian king]] in 1262. It was initially established by a public consisting largely of recent immigrants from [[Norway]] who had fled the unification of that country under [[King]] [[Harald Fairhair]].

===Philippines===
{{main|History of the Philippines (1898–1946)}}

The [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was the administrative body that governed the [[Philippines]] from 1935 to 1946, aside from a [[government in exile|period of exile]] in the [[Second World War]] from 1942 to 1945 when [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japan occupied the country]]. It replaced the [[Insular Government]], a [[territory of the United States|United States territorial]] government, and was established by the [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]].  The Commonwealth was designed as a transitional administration in preparation for the country's full achievement of independence, which was achieved in 1946.

===Poland–Lithuania===
{{Main|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}

''Republic'' is still an alternative translation of the traditional name of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Wincenty Kadłubek]] (Vincent Kadlubo, 1160–1223) used for the first time the original Latin term ''[[res publica]]'' in the context of Poland in his "Chronicles of the Kings and Princes of Poland". The name was used officially for the confederal country formed by [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] 1569–1795.

It is also often referred as "[[Golden Liberty|Nobles' Commonwealth]]" (1505–1795, i.e., before the union). In the contemporary political doctrine of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, "our state is a Republic (or Commonwealth) under the presidency of the King". The Commonwealth introduced a doctrine of religious tolerance called [[Warsaw Confederation]], had its own parliament ''[[Sejm]]'' (although elections were restricted to [[nobility]] and [[elected king]]s, who were bound to certain contracts ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'' from the beginning of the reign).

"A commonwealth of good counsaile" was the title of the 1607 English translation of the work of [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki]] "De optimo senatore" that presented to English readers many of the ideas present in the political system of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

===Catalonia===
{{Main|Commonwealth of Catalonia}}

Between 1914 and 1925, [[Catalonia]] was an autonomous region of Spain. Its government during that time was given the title ''[[mancomunidad]]'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''mancomunitat''), which is translated into English as "commonwealth". The [[Commonwealth of Catalonia]] had limited powers and was formed as a federation of the four Catalan provinces. A number of Catalan-language institutions were created during its existence.

===Liberia===
{{See also|History of Liberia#Colonization (1821–1847)}}

Between 1838 and 1847, [[Liberia]] was officially known as the "Commonwealth of Liberia". It changed its name to the "Republic of Liberia" when it declared independence (and adopted a new constitution) in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/liberia_1_commonwealth.htm The Commonwealth of Liberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use==

===Australia===

"Commonwealth" was first proposed as a term for a federation of the six Australian [[crown colony|crown colonies]] at the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)#1891 convention|1891 constitutional convention]] in [[Sydney]]. Its adoption was initially controversial, as it was associated by some with the republicanism of [[Oliver Cromwell]] ([[#England|see above]]), but it was retained in all subsequent drafts of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Irving. [http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/helen_irving,9939.html Australian Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000750/http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/helen_irving%2C9939.html |date=2015-07-15 }} – Civics and Citizenship Education. Retrieved 15 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was finally incorporated into law in the ''[[Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] 1901'', which established the federation. Australia operates under a federal system, in which power is divided between the federal (national) government and the [[States and territories of Australia|state governments]] (the successors of the six colonies). So, in an Australian context, the term "Commonwealth" (capitalized) refers to the [[Government of Australia|federal government]], and "Commonwealth of Australia" is the official name of the country.

===The Bahamas===

[[The Bahamas]] uses the official style ''Commonwealth of The Bahamas''.

===Dominica===

The small [[Caribbean]] republic of [[Dominica]] has used the official style ''Commonwealth of Dominica'' since 1970.

===Certain U.S. states and territories===

====States====
{{Main|Commonwealth (U.S. state)}}

Four [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]] officially designate themselves as "commonwealths". All four were part of [[British America|Great Britain's possessions]] along the Atlantic coast of North America prior to the formation of the United States of America in 1776. As such, they share a strong influence of English [[common law]] in some of their laws and institutions. The four are:
*[[Kentucky]] is designated a commonwealth by the [[Kentucky Constitution]] and is known constitutionally as the "Commonwealth of Kentucky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kentucky.gov |title=Kentucky.gov |publisher=Kentucky.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Massachusetts]] is a commonwealth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov |title=Mass.Gov |publisher=Mass.Gov |date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring itself as such in its constitution, which states: "[T]he body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals: it is a social compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution#cp00s00.htm |title=Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts |publisher=Malegislature.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pennsylvania]] uses the "Commonwealth of Pennsylvania" constitutionally and in its official title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pa.gov |title=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania &amp;#124; The Keystone State |publisher=Pa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Virginia]] has been known as the "Commonwealth of Virginia" since before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and is referred to as a commonwealth in its constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginia.gov |title=Home |publisher=Virginia.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Territories====
{{Main|Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)}}

Two [[Territories of the United States|organized]] but [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated]] U.S. territories are called commonwealths. The two are:
*[[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]], since 1952
*[[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]], since 1978

===International bodies===

====Commonwealth of Nations====

The [[Commonwealth of Nations]]—formerly the British Commonwealth—is a voluntary association or confederation of 53 independent sovereign states, most of which were once part of the [[British Empire]]. The Commonwealth's membership includes both republics and monarchies. The [[Head of the Commonwealth]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who also reigns as monarch directly in the 16 member states known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s.  

====Commonwealth of Independent States====

The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) is a loose [[military alliance|alliance]] or confederation consisting of 10 of the 15 [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Republics]], the exceptions being [[Turkmenistan]] (a CIS associate member), [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] left the CIS in August 2008 after [[2008 South Ossetia war|a clash]] with [[Russia]] over [[South Ossetia]]. Its creation signalled the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], its purpose being to "allow a civilised divorce" between the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]]. The CIS has developed as a forum by which the member-states can co-operate in [[economics]], [[Defence (military)|defence]], and [[foreign policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, Michalopoulos, and Tarr David. "The economics of customs unions in the Commonwealth of Independent States." Post-Soviet Geography and Economics 38, no. 3 (1997): 125-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed use==

===United Kingdom===

Labour MP [[Tony Benn]] sponsored a ''[[Commonwealth of Britain Bill]]'' several times between 1991 and 2001, intended to abolish the monarchy and establish a British republic. It never reached [[second reading]].

'''Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists''' ('''CPRM''') is a political party based in the [[Darjeeling District]] of the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]]. CPRM was formed in 1996 by [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] dissidents (a major group of the local CPI(M) leadership in [[Darjeeling]]) like former State Minister and Rajya Sabha MP Tamang Dawa Lama, Lok Sabha MP R.B. Rai and others, who were dissatisfied with the peace settlement the Left-Front government signed with the [[Gorkha National Liberation Front]] (GNLF). CRPM participates in the [[Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists]]. The youth organization of CPRM is called [[Democratic Revolutionary Youth Federation]] (DRYF).

CPRM struggles for a separate [[Gorkhaland]] state to be formed within India. It contested the [[Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council]] election in 1999 but won no seat. Before 1999, one CPRM member, Padam Lama, was a member of the DGHC. Ahead of the 1999 DGHC elections, CPRM was part of the United Front, an alliance consisting of CPRM,  [[Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League]] (ABGL), [[Indian National Congress]], [[Bharatiya Gorkha Janashakti]], [[Communist Party of India]], Bharatiya Nepali Bir Gorkha and Sikkim Rashtriya Mukti Morcha.

Since the failure of the United Front, CPRM formed the People's Democratic Front, as a united opposition to GNLF in the Darjeeling hills, together with Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League, Indian National Congress, [[Gorkha National Liberation Front (C.K. Pradhan)]] and [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].

CPRM is currently part of the Democratic Front, an alliance of the CPRM, ABGL, BJP and other parties. CPRM had earlier supported the [[Gorkha Janmukti Morcha]] (GJM), but when GJM agreed to the setting up of an Interim Setup in Darjeeling instead of a full-fledged state of [[Gorkhaland]], CPRM became opposed to it.

After unsuccessfully trying to put up consensus candidates in the three constituencies of Darjeeling with other parties, CPRM decided not to filed any candidates of its own after the other parties - GJM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110324/jsp/siliguri/story_13755435.jsp Morcha scraps consensus idea - Gurung outfit plans for Dooars Six]&lt;/ref&gt; and ABGL&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=363979&amp;catid=72 All eyes on Bharati Tamang]&lt;/ref&gt; - decided to fight the elections independently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-28/kolkata/29354012_1_darjeeling-gorkha-national-liberation-front-kalimpong-and-kurseong CPRM may field Ghising attacker' in Kalimpong]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110331/jsp/siliguri/story_13788787.jsp CPRM to keep off ‘drama’ polls]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Defence was created at the very first meeting of [[Dáil Éireann]] on 21 January 1919.  Over the years the role of the Department has remained exactly the same. The Department has been known simply as the Department of Defence since 1919, however on some occasions it has been coupled with the Marine portfolio.

==Structure==
The mission of the Department of Defence is to meet the needs of [[Irish government|Government]] and the public by providing value for money defence and [[Civil Defence Ireland|civil defence]] services and by co-ordinating and overseeing the emergency planning process via the [[Office of Emergency Planning (Ireland)|Office of Emergency Planning]] (OEP).  The Department is also concerned with ensuring the secure and stable environment necessary for economic growth and development in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The military budget was €1.005 Billion in 2007 (estimated) and €1.354 Billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;See updated [[List of countries by military expenditures]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 the budget had been cut to €885 Million and is projected to stay at that level until 2017 according to the latest [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]] report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url= http://budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/Part%20II%20Expenditure%20Allocations%202015%20-%2017.pdf |title=Government Budget Report - Expenditure Allocations 2015-17 |publisher=Department of Finance |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Department oversees the operations of the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Irish Defence Forces]] whose roles are:

*to defend the State against armed aggression; this being a contingency, preparations for its implementation will depend on an ongoing Government assessment of the security and defence environment
*to aid the civil power (meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, who have primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State)
*to participate in multinational peace support, crisis management and humanitarian relief operations in support of the United Nations and under UN mandate, including regional security missions authorised by the UN
*to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State’s obligations as a member of the [[European Union]]
*to carry out such other duties as may be assigned to them from time to time, e.g. search and rescue, air ambulance service, Ministerial air transport service, assistance on the occasion of natural or other disasters, assistance in connection with the maintenance of essential services, assistance in combating oil pollution at sea

The Department has also had responsibility for the [[Irish Red Cross]] since 1939.

When not engaged in military operations at home or overseas, most defence organisations concentrate on training and preparation and not on the provision of non-military services. The Defence Forces have achieved very high levels of training and preparation in recent years while also providing a wide range of services to other Government Departments and agencies. The Defence Forces Training Centre at the [[Curragh Camp]] is staffed by 1,300 soldiers and 300 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kildare.ie/defenceforces/goc.HTM Training numbers, 28 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Records are maintained by the [[Irish Military Archives]].

'''''Deutsche Physik''''' (literally: "German Physics") or '''Aryan Physics''' ({{lang-de|Arische Physik}})  was a [[nationalist]] movement in the [[Germany|German]] [[physics]] community in the early 1930s. A [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] movement, it nonetheless won the support of many eminent physicists in Germany. The term was taken from the title of a 4-volume physics textbook by Nobel Laureate [[Philipp Lenard]] in the 1930s.

''Deutsche Physik'' was opposed to the work of [[Albert Einstein]] and other modern theoretically based physics, which was disparagingly labeled as "Jewish physics" ({{lang-de|Jüdische Physik}}).

==Origins==
[[File:Lenard.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Philipp Lenard]], one of the early architects of the ''Deutsche Physik'' movement]]
{{Further|History of special relativity}}
This movement began as an extension of a [[German nationalism|German nationalistic]] movement in the physics community which went back as far as [[World War I]]. On 25 August 1914, during the [[Rape of Belgium|German invasion of Belgium]], German troops used petrol to set fire to the library of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dynamic Of Destruction, Culture and mass killing in the first world war |last=Kramer|first=Alan |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin |location=|isbn=9781846140136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gibson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibson |first=Craig |title=The culture of destruction in the First World War |journal=Times Literary Supplement |date=January 30, 2008 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article3277792.ece |accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF LOST MEMORY - LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES DESTROYED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY] ( {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905105742/http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF |date=5 September 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Wesley Koch. The University of Louvain and its library. J.M. Dent and Sons, London and Toronto, 1917. Pages 21–23. {{cite web|url=http://libcudl.colorado.edu/wwi/pdf/i73698027.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507045527/http://libcudl.colorado.edu/wwi/pdf/i73698027.pdf |archivedate=7 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} accessed 18 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The burning of the library led to a protest note which was signed by eight distinguished British scientists, namely [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], [[William Crookes]], [[Alexander Fleming]], [[Horace Lamb]], [[Oliver Lodge]], [[William Ramsay]], [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]], and [[J. J. Thomson]]. In 1915, this led to a counter-reaction in the form of an "appeal" formulated by [[Wilhelm Wien]] and addressed to German physicists and scientific publishers, which was signed by sixteen German physicists, including [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] and [[Johannes Stark]]. They claimed that German character had been misinterpreted and that attempts made over many years to reach an understanding between the two countries had obviously failed. Therefore, they opposed the use of the English language by German scientific authors, editors of books, and translators.&lt;ref&gt;For the full German text of Wilhelm Wien's ''appeal'' see: ''[[The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science]]'' ([[J. L. Heilbron]], ed.), [[Oxford University Press]], New York 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;419. The ''appeal'' states:

:"Because of the war the relations of scientific circles to the hostile foreign countries will experience a novel regulation. It will in particular concern our relation to England, after the anti-German declaration formulated without any understanding of German character by English scientists has been signed by eight well-known physicists too (Bragg, Crookes, Fleming, Lamb, Lodge, Ramsey, Rayleigh, J. J. Thomson).

:It is herewith proven that the attempts made over many years to reach a better mutual understanding with the English have failed and cannot be taken up again within a foreseeable future. The regards which we have taken in the interest of a greater familiarity of the scientific circles of both peoples are no longer justified. Therefore, it is advisable to remove again the unjustified English influence which has penetrated German physics.

:Of course, the purpose cannot be to reject English scientific ideas and stimulations. But the currently criticized predilection for things foreign has influenced also our science so much that it seems required to point this out.

:After this hint we constrain ourselves above all to propose that all physicists should ensure
:# that the mentioning of literature of the English should not, as has currently been the case, find stronger consideration than that of our fellow countrymen;
:# that German physicists no longer publish their treatises in English journals, with the exception of cases where replies are required;
:# that publishers accept only scientific works and translations written in German, and only then if according to the judgment of scientific experts the work is really outstanding;
:# that public money is not spent in order to sponsor translations.

Wiener."&lt;/ref&gt; A number of German [[physics|physicists]], including [[Max Planck]] and the especially passionate [[Philipp Lenard]], a scientific rival of J. J. Thomson,  had then [[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three|signed further "declarations"]], so that gradually a "war of the minds"&lt;ref&gt;Stephan L. Wolff: ''Physiker im Krieg der Geister'', Zentrum für Wissenschafts- und Technikgeschichte, München 2001, {{cite web|url=http://www.mzwtg.mwn.de/arbeitspapiere/Wolff_01.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610104542/http://www.mzwtg.mwn.de/arbeitspapiere/Wolff_01.pdf |archivedate=10 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; broke out. On the German side it  was suggested to avoid an unnecessary use of English language in scientific texts (concerning, e.g., the renaming of German-discovered phenomena with perceived English-derived names, such as "[[X-ray]]" instead of "[[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]] ray"). It was stressed, however,  that this measure should not be misunderstood as a rejection of British scientific thought, ideas and stimulations.

After the war, the perceived affronts of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] kept some of these nationalistic feelings running high, especially in Lenard, who had already complained about England in a small pamphlet at the beginning of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Lenard, ''England und Deutschland zur Zeit des großen Krieges'' - Geschrieben Mitte August 1914, publiziert im Winter 1914, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; When, on 26 January 1920, the former naval cadet Oltwig von Hirschfeld tried to assassinate German Finance minister [[Matthias Erzberger]], Lenard sent Hirschfeld a telegram of congratulation.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Eisgruber: ''Völkische und deutsch-nationale Führer'', 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1922 assassination of politician [[Walther Rathenau]], the government ordered flags flown at half mast on the day of his funeral, but Lenard ignored the order at his institute in Heidelberg. Socialist students organized a demonstration against Lenard, who was taken into protective custody by state prosecutor Hugo Marx (a Jew).&lt;ref&gt;''Der Fall Philipp Lenard - Mensch und "Politiker", ''Physikalische Blätter '''23''', No. 6, 262–267 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiment displayed by Lenard was not unique to physics or physicists; the blend of nationalism and perceived affront from foreign and internal forces was a key reason for the popularity of the rising [[Nazism|Nazi Party]] in the 1920s.

During the early years of the twentieth century, [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]] caused bitter controversy within the worldwide physics community. There were many physicists, especially the "old guard", who were suspicious of the intuitive meanings of Einstein's theories. While the response to Einstein was based in part on his concepts being a radical break from earlier theories, there was also an anti-Jewish element to some of the criticism. The leading theoretician of the ''Deutsche Physik'' type of movement  was [[Rudolf Tomaschek]], who had re-edited the famous physics textbook ''Grimsehl's Lehrbuch der Physik''. In that book, which consists of several volumes, the [[Lorentz transformation]] was accepted, as well as [[Old quantum theory|quantum theory]]. However, Einstein's interpretation of the Lorentz transformation was not mentioned, and Einstein's name was completely ignored. Many [[classical physics|classical physicists]] resented Einstein's dismissal of the notion of a [[luminiferous aether]], which had been a mainstay of their work for the majority of their productive lives. They were not convinced by the [[Tests of general relativity|empirical evidence for relativity]]. They felt that the measurements of the [[perihelion]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and the null result of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] might be explained in other ways, and the results of the [[Sir Arthur Eddington|Eddington]] [[eclipse]] experiment were experimentally problematic enough to be dismissed as meaningless by the more devoted doubters. Many of them were very distinguished experimental physicists, and Lenard was himself a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate in physics.

==Under the Third Reich==
[[File:Johannes Stark.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Johannes Stark]]]]

When the [[Nazis]] entered the political scene, Lenard quickly attempted to ally himself with them, joining the party at an early stage. With another [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics Nobel laureate]], [[Johannes Stark]], Lenard began a core campaign to label Einstein's Relativity as ''Jewish Physics''.

Lenard&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Lenard: Ideelle Kontinentalsperre'', München 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stark benefitted considerably from this Nazi support. Under the rallying cry that physics should be more "German" and "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]," Lenard and Stark embarked on a Nazi-endorsed plan to replace physicists at German universities with "Aryan Physicists." By 1935, though, this campaign was superseded by the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935.  There were no longer any Jewish physics professors in Germany, since under the [[Nuremberg Laws]], Jews were not allowed to work in universities. Stark in particular also tried to install himself as the national authority on "German" physics under the principle of  ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (literally, "coordination") applied to other professional disciplines. Under this Nazi-era paradigm, academic disciplines and professional fields followed a strictly linear [[hierarchy]] created along ideological lines.

The figureheads of "Aryan Physics" met with moderate success, but the support from the Nazi party was not as great as Lenard and Stark would have preferred. After a long period of harassment of [[Quantum physics|quantum physicist]] [[Werner Heisenberg]], including getting him labeled a "White Jew" in ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'', they began to fall from influence. Heisenberg was not only a pre-eminent physicist whom the Nazis realized they were better off with than without, however "Jewish" his theory might be in the eyes of Stark and Lenard, but Heisenberg had, as a young boy, attended school with SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]]. In a historic moment, Heisenberg's mother rang Himmler's mother and asked her if she would please tell the SS to give "Werner" a break. After beginning a full character evaluation, which Heisenberg both instigated and passed, Himmler forbade further attack on the physicist. Heisenberg would later employ his "Jewish physics," in the [[German nuclear energy project|German project to develop nuclear fission]] for the purposes of [[nuclear weapons]] or [[nuclear reactor|nuclear energy]] use.  Himmler promised Heisenberg that after Germany won the war, the SS would finance a physics institute to be directed by Heisenberg.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Padfield|Padfield, Peter]], ''Himmler'' New York:1990 Henry Holt&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenard began to play less and less of a role, and soon Stark ran into even more difficulty, as other scientists and industrialists known for being exceptionally "Aryan" came to the defense of Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. As historian Mark Walker puts it, "despite his best efforts, in the end his science was not accepted, supported, or used by the Third Reich. Stark spent a great deal of his time during the Third Reich fighting with bureaucrats within the National Socialist state. Most of the National Socialist leadership either never supported Lenard and Stark, or abandoned them in the course of the Third Reich."

==Effect on the German nuclear program==
It is occasionally put forth&lt;ref&gt;Einstein: His Life and Universe. Chapter 21: The Bomb&lt;/ref&gt; that there is a great irony in the Nazis' labeling modern physics as "Jewish science", since it was exactly modern physics&amp;mdash;and the work of many European exiles&amp;mdash;which was used to create the [[atomic bomb]].  Even if the German government had not embraced Lenard and Stark's ideas, the German [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] agenda was enough by itself to destroy the Jewish scientific community in Germany. Furthermore, the [[German nuclear energy project]] was never pursued with anywhere near the vigor of the [[Manhattan Project]] in the [[United States]], and for that reason would likely not have succeeded in any case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/germany/nuke.htm German Nuclear Weapons]&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement did not actually go as far as preventing the nuclear energy scientists from using quantum mechanics and relativity,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bernstein, ''Hitler's Uranium Club, the Secret Recordings at Farm Hall, 2001, Springer-Verlag''&lt;/ref&gt; but the education of young scientists and engineers suffered, not only from the loss of the Jewish scientists but also from political appointments and other interference.  In 1938, Himmler wrote to Heisenberg that he could discuss modern physics but not mention Jewish scientists such as [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and Einstein in connection with it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Powers, ''Heisenberg's War'', 1993, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3411">The Facial Recognition Technology (FERET) database is a dataset used for [[facial recognition system]] evaluation as part of the [[FERET (facial recognition technology)|Face Recognition Technology (FERET) program]]. It was first established in 1993 under a collaborative effort between Dr. Harry Wechsler at [[George Mason University]] and Dr. Jonathan Phillips at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]] in Adelphi, Maryland. The FERET database serves as a standard database of facial images for researchers to use to develop various algorithms and report results. The use of a common database also allowed one to compare the effectiveness of different approaches in methodology and gauge their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-technology-feret|title=Face Recognition Technology (FERET)|last=Flanagan|first=Patricia|date=January 25, 2011|work=NIST|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facial images for the database were collected between December 1993 and August 1996, accumulating a total of 14,126 images pertaining to 1199 individuals along with 365 duplicate sets of images that were taken on a different day. In 2003, the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] released a high-resolution, 24-bit color version of these images. The dataset tested includes 2,413 still facial images, representing 856 individuals. The FERET database has been used by more than 460 research groups and is managed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amVDaTdgKYcC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=Facial+Recognition+Technology+(FERET)+Database+%22army+research%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Tt16iR7RaF&amp;sig=dwm4keFmbDN21bjqybYQ4gu3EXQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi12LLQpOLbAhXwtlkKHZ4MAzA4ChDoAQhXMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Facial%20Recognition%20Technology%20(FERET)%20Database%20%22army%20research%22&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Face Recognition|last=|first=|publisher=Springer-Verlag London|year=2011|isbn=978-0-85729-931-4|editor-last=Li|editor-first=Stan|location=|pages=310-312|editor-last2=Jain|editor-first2=Anil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

'''Trịnh Thị Ngọ''' ({{IPA-vi|ṯɕïŋ˧ˀ˨ʔ tʰi˧ˀ˨ʔ ŋɔ˧ˀ˨ʔ|}}; 1931 – 30 September 2016), also known as '''Thu Hương''' and '''Hanoi Hannah''', was a [[Vietnam]]ese [[radio personality]] best known for her work during the [[Vietnam War]], when she made English-language broadcasts for [[North Vietnam]] directed at [[United States]] troops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/hanoi-hannah-vietnam-propaganda-dies-87-505704|title=Vietnam-era propagandist 'Hanoi Hannah' dies at 87|author=Jeff Stein|website=newsweek.com|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|date=3 October 2016|access-date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ngọ was born in [[Hanoi]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="VOV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vovnews.vn/Home/Nguoi-My-nghe-Tieng-noi-Viet-Nam/20061/23331.vov|title=Americans hear the 'Voice of Vietnam'|language=Vietnamese|work=[[Voice of Vietnam]]|date=28 January 2006|accessdate=24 June 2007|author=Thanh Minh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Trịnh Định Kính, was a successful businessman who owned the largest glass factory in [[French Indochina]].&lt;ref name="Shock and awe" /&gt; She later stated that she grew eager to learn English because of her desire to watch her favorite films such as [[Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'']] without subtitles. Her family provided her with private lessons in English. In 1955, when she was 24 years old, she joined the [[Voice of Vietnam]] radio station and was chosen to read the English language newscast aimed at listeners in Asia's English-speaking countries.&lt;ref name="Shock and awe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/features/?catid=10&amp;newsid=41272 |title=Shock and awe, Hannah Hanoi style. |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822082921/http://www.thanhniennews.com/features/?catid=10&amp;newsid=41272 |archivedate=22 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }} Thanhnien News.

==Career==
During the Vietnam War, Ngọ became famous among US soldiers for her propaganda broadcasts on [[Radio Hanoi]]. Her scripts were written by the [[North Vietnamese Army]] and were intended to frighten and shame the soldiers into leaving their posts. She made three broadcasts a day, reading a list of newly killed or imprisoned Americans, and playing popular US [[anti-war songs]] in an effort to incite feelings of nostalgia and homesickness, attempting to persuade US [[GI (military)|GI]]s that the [[US involvement in the Vietnam War]] was unjust and immoral.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; US Navy ships and personnel were also targeted in her broadcasts, with Ngọ reading out the names of crew members and saying that they were all going to die.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Choices Guide Life's Journey|last=Dickerson|first=Floyd F.|publisher=Publish America|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also received and played recorded messages from Americans who were against the war, saying later that she thought these messages were the most effective of all as "Americans will believe their own people rather than the adversary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azquotes.com/author/28563-Hanoi_Hannah|title=TOP 17 QUOTES BY HANOI HANNAH {{!}} A-Z Quotes|access-date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 1966 [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] article by Tom Tiede described the program:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hannah's shows are invariably the same. After the news is an editorial denouncing U.S. escalation of the war. Then a recording by an Asian soprano who sounds as if she's having her ears pierced. Then, Mailbag Time ('write us for the truth, friends').&lt;ref&gt;Tiede, Tom, Newspaper Enterprise Association, "'''Hanoi Hannah' Talks To GIs''", Playground Daily News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Thursday, 6 January 1966, Volume 19, Number 340, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of her typical broadcasts began as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How are you, GI Joe? It seems to me that most of you are poorly informed about the going of the war, to say nothing about a correct explanation of your presence over here. Nothing is more confused than to be ordered into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of what's going on.&lt;ref&gt;Hanoi Hannah, 16 June 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Few if any desertions are thought to have happened because of her propaganda work&lt;ref name="don north"&gt;[http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html The Search for Hanoi Hannah], by [[Don North]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the soldiers "hooted at her scare tactics".&lt;ref name="Shock and awe" /&gt; They were sometimes impressed, however, when she mentioned the correct location of their unit (when they would "give a toast to her and throw beer cans at the radio"), named US casualties and welcomed Navy ships into port with their correct arrival details and crew members' names.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="don north" /&gt; There were exaggerated legends of her omniscience, with rumors that she would give clues about everything from specific future North Vietnamese attacks to soldiers' girlfriends cheating on them at home.&lt;ref name="don north" /&gt; In reality, most of her information came from publications such as the US military newspaper, ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.&lt;ref name="Shock and awe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="don north" /&gt;

It has been claimed that US forces in Vietnam distrusted the U.S. Armed Forces Radio bulletins, and listened to Ngọ's bulletins for information from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factorialist.com/divas-propaganda-radio/|title=Their Voices Aroused G.I. Nightmares|date=9 September 2015|language=en-US|access-date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[war correspondent]] Don North: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;By zapping the truth through an ostrich-like policy of censorship, deletions, and exaggerations U.S. Armed Forces Radio lost the trust of many GIs when they were most isolated and vulnerable to enemy propaganda. It wasn't that Hanoi Hannah always told the truth - she didn't. But she was most effective when she did tell the truth and US Armed Forces Radio was fudging it.&lt;ref name="don north"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ngọ's broadcasts ran for a total of 8 years, with her final broadcasts airing in 1973, when most of the American forces were leaving.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/04/news/mn-35911|title='Hanoi Hannah' Fondly Remembers Her Role|last=LAMB|first=DAVID|date=4 April 1998|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews in later years, she consistently stated that she agreed with the purpose of the scripts and never deviated from them; she believed that America should not have sent troops to Vietnam and should have allowed the country to resolve its situation itself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Later years ==
In 1975, after the war, Ngọ moved to [[Saigon]] with her husband.&lt;ref name="don north" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was offered a job on [[Ho Chi Minh City Television|HCMC Television]], but she chose to stay at home and take care of her husband, who had suffered a [[stroke]]. She died in Ho Chi Minh City on 30 September 2016 at the age of 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/hanoi-hannah-vietnam-war-propaganda-radio-presenter-dies-aged-87 |title=''Hanoi Hannah, Vietnam war propaganda radio presenter, dies aged 85'' |author=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=4 October 2016|website=theguardian.com |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/world/asia/trinh-thi-ngo-hanoi-hannah-vietnam-war.html?_r=1 |title=Trinh Thi Ngo, Broadcaster Called 'Hanoi Hannah' in Vietnam War, Dies |author=Mike Ives |date=4 October 2016|website=nytimes.com |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Higgins''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] project dedicated to giving individuals more control over their personal identity, profile and social network data.

The project is organized into three main areas:
#'''Active Clients''' - An active client integrates with a browser and runs on a computer or mobile device.
#* Higgins 1.X: the active client supports the OASIS IMI protocol and performs the functions of an [[Information Card]] ''selector''.
#* Higgins 2.0: the plan is to move beyond ''selector'' functionality to add support for managing passwords and Higgins relationship cards, as well other protocols such as [[OpenID]]. It also becomes a client for the Personal Data Store (see below) and thereby provides a kind of dashboard for personal information and a place to manage "permissioning"—deciding who gets access to what slice of the user's data.
#'''Personal Data Store (PDS)''' is a new work area under development for Higgins 2.0. A PDS stores local personal data, controls access to remotely hosted personal data, synchronizes personal data to other devices and computers, accessed directly or via a PDS client it allows the user to share selected aspects of their information with people and organizations that they trust.
#'''Identity Services'''  - Code for (i) an IMI and SAML compatible Identity Provider and (ii) enabling websites to be IMI and OpenID compatible.

==History==
The initial code for the Higgins Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/higgins/ Eclipse Higgins Project] - home page&lt;/ref&gt; was written by [[Paul Trevithick]] in the summer of 2003. In 2004 the effort became part of [http://socialphysics.org/ SocialPhysics.org], a collaboration between Paul and Mary Ruddy, of [http://azigo.com Azigo], (formerly Parity Communications, Inc.), and [http://Meristic.com Meristic], and John Clippinger, at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]]. Higgins, under its original name '''Eclipse Trust Framework''', was accepted into the [[Eclipse Foundation]] in early 2005. Mary and Paul are the project co-leads. [[IBM]] and [[Novell, Inc.|Novell]]'s participation in the project was announced in early 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/19280.wss Open Source Initiative to Give People More Control Over Their Personal Online Information] - IBM press release&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2151060/ibm-backs-open-source IBM/Novell unveil rival to Microsoft Infocard]&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins has received technology contributions from [[IBM]], [[Novell, Inc.|Novell]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Computer Associates|CA]], Serena, [[Google]], [http://eperi.de/ eperi GmbH] as well as from several other firms and individuals. Version 1.0 was released in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20080221_higgins.php Eclipse press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16456">'''Holacracy''' is a method of decentralized management and organizational [[Corporate governance|governance]], in which authority and decision-making are distributed throughout a [[holarchy]] of self-organizing teams rather than being vested in a management hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rudd | first = Olivia | title = Business Intelligence Success Factors: Tools for Aligning Your Business in the Global Economy | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | date = 2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holacracy has been adopted by for-profit and non-profit organizations in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Röll|first=Martin|title=Organisations running on Holacracy|url=http://structureprocess.com/holacracy-cases|work=structureprocess.com|accessdate=23 January 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The Holacracy system was developed at [[Ternary Software]], an [[Exton, Pennsylvania]] company that was noted for experimenting with more democratic forms of organizational governance.&lt;ref name="Badal07"&gt;{{cite news |last=Badal |first=Jaclyne |date=April 23, 2008 |title=Can a Company Be Run as a Democracy? |url= |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ternary founder Brian Robertson distilled the company's best practices into an organizational system that became known as Holacracy in 2007.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robertson |first=Brian |last2= |first2= |date=June 2007 |title=Evolving Organization |url= |journal=Integral Leadership Review |publisher= |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages= |doi= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson later developed the "[http://holacracy.org/constitution Holacracy Constitution]", which lays out the core principles and practices of the system. In June 2015, he released the book ''Holacracy: The New Management System for a Rapidly Changing World,'' that details and explains his practices.

The term holacracy is derived from the term [[holarchy]], coined by [[Arthur Koestler]] in his 1967 book ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/895500921|title=Holacracy : the new management system for a rapidly changing world|last=J.|first=Robertson, Brian|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781627794282|edition= First|location=New York|pages=38|oclc=895500921}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holarchy is composed of [[Holon (philosophy)|holons]] (Greek: ὅλον, holon neuter form of ὅλος, holos "whole") or units that are autonomous and self-reliant, but also dependent on the greater whole of which they are part.&lt;ref name="Koestler67"&gt;{{cite book |last= Koestler|first= Arthur|year= 1967|title=The Ghost in the Machine |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a holarchy is a hierarchy of self-regulating holons that function both as autonomous wholes and as dependent parts.&lt;ref name="Koestler67" /&gt;

== Influences and comparable systems ==

Holacracy is one of several systems of [[flat organization]]. It has been compared to [[sociocracy]], a system of governance developed in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="steele12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steele |first=Robert David |date=June 5, 2012 |title=The Open-Source Everything Manifesto |url= |location= |publisher=North Atlantic Books | page = 47 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocracy had a significant early influence during the incubation of Holacracy,&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Brian Robertson on Holacracy (2006): https://web.archive.org/web/20060630101107/http://www.ternarysoftware.com/pages/downloads/BrianRobertsonInterview2006-02-08v3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; though Holacracy has increasingly differentiated away from it since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adeeperdemocracy.org/holacracy-sociocracy/ |title=Holacracy and Sociocracy |author= |year=2010 |website=http://www.adeeperdemocracy.org |publisher= |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocracy particularly inspired the development of the circle structure and governance processes (described in more detail later) within Holacracy. Holacracy is designed for organizations and fundamentally differentiates the roles of the organization from the people working in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://holacracy.org/resources/sociocracy-holacracy |title=Sociocracy &amp; Holacracy |author= |year=2013 |website=http://holacracy.org |publisher= |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its emphasis on iterative governance, adaptive processes, and self-organization, {{cnspan|text=Holacracy draws inspiration from [[agile software development]] principles and the [[lean manufacturing]] process|date=November 2015}}. Holacracy is highly compatible with [[stakeholder theory]] as its board structure allows for multiple stakeholders to be represented in the governance of an organization and for multiple organizations with shared interests to be linked at the governance level.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Essential elements ==

=== Roles instead of job descriptions ===
The building blocks of Holacracy's organizational structure are roles. Holacracy distinguishes between roles and the people who fill them, as one individual can hold multiple roles at any given time. A role is not a job description; its definition follows a clear format including a name, a purpose, optional "domains" to control, and accountabilities, which are ongoing activities to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy constitution, definition of a role|url=http://holacracy.org/constitution#art11|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roles are defined by each circle —or team— via a collective governance process, and are updated regularly in order to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the organization.

=== Circle structure ===
Holacracy structures the various roles in an organization in a system of self-organizing (but not self-directed) circles. Circles are organized hierarchically, and each circle is assigned a clear purpose and accountabilities by its broader circle. However, each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to best achieve its goals. Circles conduct their own governance meetings, assign members to fill roles, and take responsibility for carrying out work within their domain of authority. Circles are connected by two roles known as "lead link" and "rep link", which sit in the meetings of both their circle and the broader circle to ensure alignment with the broader organization’s mission and strategy.

=== Governance process ===
Each circle uses a defined governance process to create and regularly update its own roles and policies. Holacracy specifies a structured process known as "integrative decision making" for proposing changes in governance and amending or objecting to proposals. This is not a consensus-based system, not even a consent-based system, but one that integrates relevant input from all parties and ensures that the proposed changes and objections to those changes are anchored in the roles' needs (and through them, the organization's needs), rather than people's preferences or ego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy governance meetings|url=http://www.holacracy.org/governance-meetings|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational process ===
Holacracy specifies processes for aligning teams around operational needs, and requires that each member of a circle fulfill certain duties in order to work efficiently and effectively together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partner duties in Holacracy|url=http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Partner_Duties|work=wiki.holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Röll|first=Martin|title=Energizing Project Roles (Holacracy Basics, Part 1)|url=http://structureprocess.com/blog/energizing-roles/|work=structureprocess.com|accessdate=23 January 2015|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the governance process, which is collective and integrative, each member filling a role has a lot of autonomy and authority to make decisions on how to best achieve his or her goals. Some have described the authority paradigm in Holacracy as completely opposite to the one of the traditional management hierarchy; instead of needing permission to act or innovate, Holacracy gives blanket authority to take any action needed to perform the work of the roles, unless it is restricted via policies in governance or it involves spending some assets of the organization (money, intellectual property, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Work|title=Part 2: Permission Cultures|url=https://medium.com/about-holacracy/part-2-permission-cultures-738b20a8ce3c|work=medium.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy constitution, definition of a role|url=http://holacracy.org/constitution#art14|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holacracy is thus highly biased toward action and innovation: it defaults to autonomy and freedom, then uses internal processes to limit that autonomy when its use in a specific way turns out to be detrimental.

Holacracy specifies a tactical meeting process that every circle goes through usually on a weekly basis. This process includes different phases to report on relevant data, share updates on projects, and open discussions where any circle member can add to the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy tactical meetings|url=http://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular feature of this last phase, known as "triage", is to focus discussions on the concrete next steps needed by the individual who added the agenda item to address his or her issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Olivier|last=Compagne|title=One Thread at a Time|url=https://medium.com/about-holacracy/one-thread-at-a-time-7b297718bc59|work=medium.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention is to avoid large, unproductive discussions dominated by the louder voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristy|last=Meade|title=Holacracy: A Step Toward Equality|url=https://medium.com/@_Kristy_/holacracy-a-step-toward-equality-447898ae4c73|work=medium.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holacracy in contemporary practice ==
In the U.S., for-profit and not-for-profit organizations have adopted and practiced Holacracy. Examples include [[Zappos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Aimee | last =  Groth | title = Zappos is going holacratic: no job titles, no managers, no hierarchy | url = http://qz.com/161210/zappos-is-going-holacratic-no-job-titles-no-managers-no-hierarchy/ | work = Quartz | date = 2013-12-30 | accessdate = 2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[David Allen Company]], [[Precision Nutrition]], and nonprofit [[Conscious Capitalism (organization)|Conscious Capitalism]]. [[Medium (service)|Medium]] used Holacracy for several years before abandoning it in 2016.&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blog.medium.com/management-and-organization-at-medium-2228cc9d93e9#.80p0z3d3j |title=Management and Organization at Medium |last=Doyle |first=Andy |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Holacracy is claimed{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} to increase agility, efficiency, transparency, innovation and accountability within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Michelle |year=2012 |title=Navigating the New Work Paradigm |url= |location= |publisher=Center for Creative Emergence |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach encourages individual team members to take initiative and gives them a process in which their concerns or ideas can be addressed.&lt;ref name="Badal07" /&gt; The system of distributed authority reduces the burden on leaders to make every decision.

According to [[Zappos]]'s CEO [[Tony Hsieh]], Holacracy makes individuals more responsible for their own thoughts and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hsieh | first =Tony  | title =A Memo From Tony Hsieh | work =Zappos Insights| publisher =Zappos | date =April 8, 2015 | url =http://www.zapposinsights.com/blog/item/a-memo-from-tony-hsieh | accessdate = June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
[[Steve Denning]] warned against viewing Holacracy as a panacea, claiming that instead of removing hierarchy, decisions are funneled down from circle to circle in a clear hierarchy, with each subsequent circle knowing less about the big picture than the one above.&lt;ref name="Denning"&gt;{{cite web | first = Steve | last =  Denning | title = Making sense of Zappos and Holacracy | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/01/15/making-sense-of-zappos-and-holacracy/ | work = Forbes | date = 2014-01-15 | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the rules and procedures laid out in the founding documents of Holacracy such as Robertson's originating article&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt; are very detailed and focused on "administrivia."&lt;ref name="Denning"/&gt; Lastly, Denning added that the voice of the customer was missing from the Holacracy model, concluding that for agile and customer-focused companies such as [[Zappos]], Holacracy is a way to add administrative rigor, but that Holacracy would not necessarily work well in an organization that did not already have agility and passion for the customer.&lt;ref name="Denning"/&gt; HolacracyOne partner Olivier Compagne replied to those criticisms on the company's blog, claiming that Denning's criticisms misunderstand Holacracy, and explaining how the rules of Holacracy address or avoid those alleged pitfalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Olivier | last =  Compagne | title = Holacracy Is Not What You Think | url = https://medium.com/holacracyone-blog/67144c3adf8 | work = HolacracyOne's Blog | date = 2014-01-21 | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In moving away from Holacracy, ''Medium'' noted that "for larger initiatives, which require coordination across functions, it can be time-consuming and divisive to gain alignment" and that Medium believed that "the act of codifying responsibilities in explicit detail hindered a proactive attitude and sense of communal ownership". They also noted that the inaccurate media coverage of Holacracy created a challenge for recruitment.&lt;ref name="medium"/&gt;

At Zappos, about 14% of the company left voluntarily in 2015 in a deliberate attempt by Zappos to have only retain employees who believed in holacracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Aimee | last = Groth | title = Zappos has now lost 18% of its employees to its radical buyout offer | url = http://qz.com/590632/zappos-has-now-lost-18-of-its-employees-to-its-radical-buyout-offer/ | work = Quartz | date = 2016-01-13 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms include a "one-size-fits-all" approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Julia | last = Culen | title = Holacracy: not safe enough to try | url = https://pazifika.com/2016/04/03/holacracy-not-safe-enough-to-try/ | date = 2016-04-03 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; layers of bureaucracy and more psychological weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Aimee | last = Groth | title = Zappos is struggling with Holacracy because humans aren’t designed to operate like software | url = http://qz.com/849980/zappos-is-struggling-with-holacracy-because-humans-arent-designed-to-operate-like-software/ | work = Quartz | date = 2016-12-21 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Independence Party of America''' '''(IPA)''' was a [[political party]] in the [[United States]], founded on September 23, 2007 as a coalition of existing state parties bearing the Independence Party name.  Its National Chairman was Frank MacKay, chairman of the [[Independence Party of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midhudsonnews.com/News/IndParAm-24Sep07.html |date= September 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219035016/http://www.midhudsonnews.com/News/IndParAm-24Sep07.html |archivedate=December 19, 2007 |title= Independence Party of America formed |work= Mid-Hudson News |publisher= Mid-Hudson News Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Barkley]], a former [[United States Senator]] and [[Independence Party of Minnesota]] activist, agreed to play an advisory role with the new party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://weblogs.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/politics/blog/independence_party/ |title= Indie strategists are coming from LI local, trying US global |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231185036/http://weblogs.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/politics/blog/independence_party/ |date= October 16, 2007 |work= Newsday |archivedate= December 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Independence Party of Minnesota voted to affiliate with the new national party at its state convention on January 26, 2008, though it later disafilliated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ballot-access.org/2008/01/13/virginia-independent-green-party-affiliates-with-independence-party/ |title= Virginia Independent Green Party Affiliates with Independence Party |date= January 13, 2008 |work= Ballot Access News }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reform Party of Pennsylvania affiliated on October 22, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ballot-access.org/2007/10/23/pennsylvania-reform-party-affiliates-with-new-national-independence-party/ |work= Ballot Access News |title= Pennsylvania Reform Party Affiliates with new national Independence Party |date= October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Independent Green Party of Virginia]] affiliated on January 10, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090123232409/http://independencepartyofamerica.com/freedom/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=96&amp;Itemid=2 |url= http://independencepartyofamerica.com/freedom/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=96&amp;Itemid=2 |title= Independence Party of America, Bloomberg for President |work= Independence Party of America |archivedate= January 23, 2009 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's website was defunct in April 2013. The various state parties each went their separate ways; for example, in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], the Minnesota party endorsed [[Evan McMullin]] and the New York party cross-endorsed [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] nominee [[Gary Johnson]].

'''Indo-Tibetan Border Police (Water Wing)''' is a special unit of [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] of [[India]].

The Water Wing of ITBP was established on 30 August 2011, with an initial strength over 125 personnel led by a commandant.
It is responsible for patrolling riverine borders of Himalayan regions. This includes [[Pangong Lake|Pangong]] Lake and [[Indus]] River in Jammu and Kashmir, and [[Brahmaputra]] river in Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/199897/water-wing-flotilla-india-china.html |title=Water-wing flotilla for India-China border |publisher=Deccanherald.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israel Border Police''' ({{lang-he-n|מִשְׁמַר הַגְּבוּל}}, ''Mišmar Ha-Gvul'') is the [[gendarmerie]] and [[Border guard|border security]] branch of the [[Israel Police|Israel National Police]]. It is also commonly known by its Hebrew abbreviation '''Magav''' ({{Hebrew|מג"ב}}), meaning [[border guard]]; its members are colloquially known as ''Magavnikim'' ({{Hebrew|מג"בניקים}}). Border Guard is often used as the official name of the Israel Border Police in English. While its main task is securing Israel's borders, it has also been deployed in assisting the [[Israel Defense Forces]], and for [[counter-terrorism]] and [[law enforcement]] operations in the [[West Bank]], as well as in [[Jerusalem]].

The Israeli Border Police is renowned for including a large number of soldiers from minority backgrounds, being a particularly popular choice with [[Israeli Druze|Druze]] recruits, but also includes many soldiers from [[Circassians in Israel|Circassian]], [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] and [[Negev Bedouin|Bedouin]] background.&lt;ref&gt;Arab-Israeli Military Forces in an Era of Asymmetric Wars, Anthony H. Cordesman, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1 January 2006, page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Israel Border Police members in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Magavniks'' in [[Jerusalem]]]]
The Border Police was founded as the Frontier Corps ({{Hebrew|חיל הספר}}, ''Heil HaSfar''), a [[gendarmerie]] under the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] in 1949 with the task of providing security in rural areas and along the borders. In the course of the following years, it was gradually transferred to the command of the [[Israeli Police|Police]] and became the Border Police. During these years, it secured new settlements and countered infiltration of Palestinian [[Fedayeen#Palestinians|Fedayeen]], especially from [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]].

[[File:Israeli Border Guard Police.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Magavnik'' in the [[Muslim Quarter]] of Jerusalem's [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]].]]
[[File:Magavjeep.jpg|thumb|''Magavnikim'' with an Israel Border Police [[AIL Storm|Sufa]] jeep in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of Jerusalem's [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]].]]

During the [[1956 Suez War]], the Border Police was involved in the [[Kafr Qasim massacre]]. On the second day of the war, a curfew was imposed on the [[Israeli Arab]] village. Villagers who had worked in the village fields and were apparently unaware of the curfew were shot as they returned to the village,&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Literacy'', Joseph Telushkin, p. 595, Harper-Collins, 1991, {{ISBN|0-688-08506-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in 49 dead. This event raised a strong protest in the Israeli public and resulted in a landmark Supreme Court ruling on the obligation of soldiers to disobey manifestly illegal orders.

During the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the Border Police took part in the fighting alongside the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Following the war, it was deployed in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] and charged with maintaining law and order as part of the military administration. Since then, a significant portion of the Border Police's activity has been in these territories, especially during the years of the [[First Intifada]] and the [[Second Intifada|Second (al-Aqsa) Intifada]].

In 1974, the [[Counter-terrorism|counter-terror]] unit [[Yamam]] was established.

In the 2000 [[October Riots]], the Border Police were used as the main branch of the treatment in the events. During the Second Intifada, the Border Police took a large part in the security activity.

In 2005, the Border Police participated in the implementation of the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza]].

The Border Police heaviest area of operation is the city of Jerusalem. Virtually all "soldiers" that can be seen patrolling the streets of Jerusalem are actually Border Guard Police officers. Approximately 20% of all Border Guard personnel in the country are located in Jerusalem alone. Besides Jerusalem MAGAV also provides security, conducts military operations, raids and arrests on Palestinian people in cities like [[Jenin]], [[Nablus]], [[Jericho]], [[Qalqilya]], [[Tulkarm]], [[Ramallah]] and [[Hebron]].

The total number of Border Guards is believed to be about 6,000 soldiers and officers. 

==Minorities serving==
The Israeli Border Police is renowned for including a large number of soldiers from minority backgrounds, being a particularly popular choice with [[Israeli Druze|Druze]] recruits, but also includes many soldiers from [[Circassians in Israel|Circassian]], Arab Christian and [[Negev Bedouin|Bedouin]] background.&lt;ref&gt;Arab-Israeli Military Forces in an Era of Asymmetric Wars, Anthony H. Cordesman, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1 January 2006, page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Border Police is composed of professional officers on payroll and field policemen redirected from the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] (men and women at the age of 18 can choose to serve in the Border Police instead of the IDF, serving 3 years as a border policeman is equal to 3 years as an IDF soldier). All border policemen receive combat training and in addition are also trained for CT ([[counter-terrorism]]), [[riot control]] and policework. Excellent policemen can specialize in some profession and receive special training to become [[sniper]]s, buggie-drivers, dog operators, [[bomb squad]], etc.

Because of their combat training, border policemen are employed in unique areas, where there are greater risks for riots, violence and even terror. They serve mainly in the countryside, in Arab villages and towns (along with the regular police), near the borders and in the [[West Bank]].

The Border Police is also responsible for security of rural settlements inside Israel with its Rural Police (Hebrew: שיטור כפרי, ''shitur kafri'') units and community security coordinators (Hebrew: רב"ש, ''rabash''). Rural policemen are full-time professional officers and security coordinators are a mixture of full-time and volunteer officers.

==Memorial==

The "Border Police Memorial and Heritage Center"&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenberets.co.il/בית-מורשת-והנצחה/על-המוזאון-ויח-ההיסטוריה Hebrew website]&lt;/ref&gt; is located in the western Carmel mountains near Zomet Iron at road 65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenberets.co.il/בית-מורשת-והנצחה/מפת-הגעה Map]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Operations Units==
The Border Police has four [[Special forces]] units:

===Yamam===
{{main|Yamam}}
The '''Yamam''' (counter-terror and hostage rescue unit) record includes the capture of a terrorist group hidden in the Arab town of [[Tayibe]], the rescue of Eliyahu Goral, the killing of the [[Hamas]] head in [[Hebron]] and [[Members of Hamas called Qawasameh|Abbedullah Qawasameh]].

===Yamas===
{{main|Yamas (Israel Border Police unit)}}
[[File:Israeli-Police-Facebook--YAMAS-001.jpg|thumb|YAAS in training]]
The '''Yamas''' are the counter-terror undercover unit.

The Yamas are often expected to carry out complex missions with little or no preparation, often involving daylight raids in volatile areas. They do not follow regular military or police command structure and answer directly to the [[Shin Bet|Shabak]]. Their existence has until recently been denied by the IDF.

===Others===
* '''Samag''' (Tactical Counter-Crime and Counter-Terror Rapid Deployment Unit) and
* '''Matilan''' (Intelligence Gathering and Infiltrations Interception Unit).

==Volunteer Border Guard==
The Border Guard also deploys a large number of volunteer servicemen. These volunteer Border Guard members enlist as volunteers and serve in regular Border Guard units. The Border Guard relies on the volunteer soldiers in order to reinforce their manpower and help maintain the country's heavy security needs. The volunteer Border Guard are given special attention in sensitive places like Jerusalem where security threats are the highest and at times can double or even triple the manpower of full-time security forces in a given area.

Many of these special Border Guard volunteers are Jewish immigrants that have immigrated to Israel from all over the world from places like the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]], [[South America]], and the former [[Soviet Union]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelborderguardvolunteers.com/about.html About the Volunteers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713063447/http://www.israelborderguardvolunteers.com/about.html |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;!--now a Japanese language site--&gt; Retrieved on December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The volunteer Border Guard members leave behind jobs and families on a regular basis in order to serve in this special combat unit. Some come from cities like Beit Shemesh, Ofrah, Ashkelon, Ra'anana and even Haifa to serve in the Border Guard. The volunteers receive no pay for serving in the Border Guard units and serve in the Border Guard in their off work hours.

==Ranks==
The ranks in the Border Police are the same as those of the [[Israel Police]] and are similarly sworn in: the ranks of police officers and junior officers on the shirt collar, ranks of officers and senior officers on the cover. However in field uniforms Border Police officers wear rank insignia on a green background worn on epaulets on top of both shoulders or on green epaulets. Border Police branch insignia is worn on the cap or beret. Enlisted grades wear rank insignia on the sleeve, halfway between the shoulder and the elbow. The Border Police [[British Army]] style insignia are white with blue interwoven threads backed with the appropriate corps color.

==Uniforms==
The Border has several types of uniforms:

* Service dress (מדי אלף Madei Alef – Uniform "A") – the everyday uniform which is a variant of the khaki Navy and Air Corps uniform. A green lanyard is worn on the left shoulder with the Class A uniform&lt;ref&gt;Israeli Defense Forces since 1973 (pps L and 62/63) and by Sam Katz, Osprey Elite Series #8, Copywrite 1986 {{ISBN|0-85045-687-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Field dress ( מדי ב Madei Bet – Uniform "B") – worn into combat, training, work on base.

The first two resemble each other but the Madei Alef is made of higher quality materials in grey while the madei bet is in grey drab.

* Officers / Ceremonial dress (מדי שרד madei srad) – worn by officers, or during special events/ceremonies. Consists of a light yellow shirt and brown-gray trousers.

The service uniform for all Border Police personnel is grey. The uniforms consist of a two-pocket shirt, plain or combat trousers, sweater, jacket or blouse, and shoes or boots. The grey fatigues are the same for winter and summer and heavy winter gear is issued as needed. Women's dress parallels the men's but may substitute a skirt for the trousers.

Headgear included a service cap for dress and semi-dress and a field cap or bush hat worn with fatigues. Border Police personnel generally wear green beretsin lieu of the service cap.

Some units have small variations in their uniforms such as certain Security and Tactical units in Jerusalem who wear the standard IDF olive fatigues&lt;ref&gt;Israeli Defense Forces since 1973 (p62) and by Sam Katz, Osprey Elite Series #8, Copywrite 1986 {{ISBN|0-85045-687-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Weapons and Equipment==
The primary Border Police weapons are the CAR-15 and M-16 rifles. The Border Police also use standard IDF equipment such as vests and helmets. some of which are attached to the [[M-203 grenade launcher]] . Police officers and myself, as well as special units of fighters pistols type [[Glock 17]] , [[Glock 19]] , [[IWI Jericho 941|Jericho]] or [[Browning Hi-Power|FN HP]]. Some units, such as Jerusalem Patrol unit carrying a [[Beretta_M9#M9_22_Variant|Beretta M9-22LR]] .22LR pistol. Special units use a variety of other individual and individual weapons, ([[Ruger_10/22#10/22_Tactical|Ruger S22]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/10/21/israel-adopts-ruger-sr-22-in-less-lethal-sniper-role/&lt;/ref&gt;), sniper rifles, submachine guns and Shotguns.

The Border Police extensively use riot dispersal means such as batons and shields, tear gas canisters and [[stun grenade]]s, also [[rubber bullet]]s and [[water cannon]].

Businessman and founder [[Robert W. Welch, Jr.]] (1899–1985) developed an organizational infrastructure in 1958 of chapters nationwide.  Its main activity in the 1960s, said [[Rick Perlstein]], "comprised monthly meetings to watch a film by Welch, followed by writing postcards or letters to government officials linking specific policies to the Communist menace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rick Perlstein|title=Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DG3BE0C0VkAC&amp;pg=PA117|year=2001|publisher=Hill and Wang|page=117|isbn=0786744154}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an early rise in membership and influence, efforts by those such as conservative [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and ''[[National Review]]'' led the JBS to be identified as a fringe element of the conservative movement, mostly in fear of the radicalization of the [[Conservatism in the United States|American right]].&lt;ref name="Regnery2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Regnery|first=Alfred S.|title=Upstream: The Ascendance of American Conservatism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sag0i4r-Ic8C&amp;pg=PA79|date=February 12, 2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416522881|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapman2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Roger|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRY27FkGJAUC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2010|publisher=M.E.

Originally based in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], it is now headquartered in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author = Dan Barry |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/us/26Land.html |title = Holding Firm Against Plots by Evildoers |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = June 25, 2009 |accessdate = April 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with local chapters throughout the United States. The organization owns American Opinion Publishing, which publishes ''[[The New American]]''.&lt;ref name="newamerican"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.thenewamerican.com/ |title = The New American }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values==
The organization supports limited government and opposes [[wealth redistribution]] and [[economic interventionism]]. It opposes [[collectivism]], [[totalitarianism]], [[anarchism]] and [[communism]]. It opposes [[socialism]] as well, which it asserts is infiltrating U.S. governmental administration. In a 1983 edition of the political-debate television program ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'', Congressman [[Larry McDonald]] (a conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]), then the society’s newly appointed president, characterized it as belonging to the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] rather than the [[New Right]].&lt;ref name="Larry McDonald on the New World Order"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=326_1203084840 |title=Larry McDonald on the New World Order |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |publisher=[[Liveleak]] |date=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society opposed the 1960s [[civil rights movement]] and claimed the movement had Communists in important positions. In the latter half of 1965, the JBS produced a flyer titled "What's Wrong With Civil Rights?", which was used as a newspaper advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Benjamin R. |authorlink1= |last2=Forster |first2=Arnold |authorlink2= |title=Report on the John Birch Society, 1966 |url=|edition= |series= |year=1966 |publisher=Random House |location= |isbn= |oclc= |page=9 |at= |chapter= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |title=What's Wrong with Civil Rights? |year=1965 |publisher=American Opinion |location=Belmont, MA |oclc=56596124 |page=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the piece, one of the answers was: "For the civil rights movement in the United States, with all of its growing agitation and riots and bitterness, and insidious steps towards the appearance of a civil war, has not been ''infiltrated'' by the Communists, as you now frequently hear. It has been deliberately and almost wholly ''created'' by the Communists patiently building up to this present stage for more than forty years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The John Birch Society Asks: What's Wrong With Civil Rights? |author= |first= |last= |authorlink=|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u4syAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZbcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4291,7598936 |agency= |newspaper=The Post-Times |publisher= |location=West Palm Beach, FL |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id=|date=October 31, 1965 |page=A10 cols. 1–6 |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |language= |trans-title=|quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society opposed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], claiming it violated the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and overstepped individual states' rights to enact laws regarding [[civil rights]].

It opposes the [[United Nations]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA), the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), and other [[free trade agreement]]s. It argues the U.S. Constitution has been devalued in favor of political and [[economic globalization]], and that this alleged trend is not accidental. It cited the existence of the former [[Security and Prosperity Partnership]] as evidence of a push towards a [[North American Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020053033/http://jbs.org/node/5524 |archivedate=October 20, 2007 |title=The North American Union: Conspiracy Theory or Conspiracy Fact? |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |first=Brian |last=Farmer |publisher=The John Birch Society |date=September 17, 2007 |url=http://jbs.org/node/5524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The society was established in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], on December 9, 1958, by a group of 12 led by [[Robert W. Welch, Jr.]], a retired candy manufacturer from [[Belmont, Massachusetts]]. Welch named the new organization after [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], an American [[Baptist]] [[missionary]] and [[Military intelligence|military intelligence officer]] who was shot and killed by communist forces in [[China]] in August 1945, shortly after the conclusion of [[World War II]]. Welch claimed that Birch was an unknown but dedicated anti-communist, and the first American casualty of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Schoenwald1"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schoenwald | first=Jonathan M. | title=A Time for Choosing: The Rise of Modern American Conservatism | year=2002 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] (US) | isbn=0-19-515726-5 | chapter=3 – A New Kind of Conservatism: The John Birch Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jimmy Doolittle]], who met Birch after bailing out over China following the [[Doolittle Raid|Tokyo Raid]], said in his autobiography that he was certain that Birch "would not have approved" of that particular use of his name.&lt;ref&gt;Doolittle J and Glines CV.

A transcript of Welch's two-day presentation at the founding meeting was published as ''The Blue Book of the John Birch Society,'' and became a cornerstone of its beliefs, with each new member receiving a copy.&lt;ref name="Larry McDonald on the New World Order" /&gt; According to Welch, "both the U.S. and Soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists, greedy bankers, and corrupt politicians. If left unexposed, the traitors inside the U.S. government would betray the country's sovereignty to the United Nations for a collectivist [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]], managed by a 'one-world socialist government.{{Single double}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Welch | first = Robert E. | title = The Blue Book of the John Birch Society | publisher = American Opinion Books | year = 1961 | isbn = 0-88279-215-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PublicEye"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.publiceye.org/tooclose/jbs.html | title = John Birch Society | accessdate = 2008-07-18 | publisher = [[Political Research Associates]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welch saw [[collectivism]] as the main threat to [[western culture]], and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|American liberals]] as "secret communist traitors" who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism, with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a one-world socialist government. "There are many stages of [[welfarism]], socialism, and collectivism in general," he wrote, "but Communism is the ultimate state of them all, and they all lead inevitably in that direction."&lt;ref name="PublicEye" /&gt;

The society's activities include distribution of literature, pamphlets, magazines, videos and other material while sponsoring a Speaker's Bureau, which invites "speakers who are keenly aware of the motivations that drive political policy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbs.org/speakers-bureau/ John Birch Society Speakers Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first public activities of the society was a "Get US Out!" (of membership in the [[United Nations|UN]]) campaign, which claimed in 1959 that the "Real nature of [the] UN is to build a One World Government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1 = Matthew Lyons | author2 = Chip Berlet | title = Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort | publisher = The Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2000 | page = 179 | isbn = 1-57230-562-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Welch advised JBS members to: "Join your local [[P.T.A.]] at the beginning of the school year, get your conservative friends to do likewise, and go to work to take it over."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = French | first = William Marshall | title = American Secondary Education | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=180bAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = July 20, 2008 | year = 1967 | publisher = Odyssey Press | page = 477 | isbn = 0-7719-9198-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''One Man's Opinion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|1713996}}&lt;/ref&gt; a magazine launched by Welch in 1956, was renamed ''American Opinion,''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0003-0236}} {{OCLC|1480501}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the society's official publication.

===1960s===
By March 1961 the society had 60,000 to 100,000 members and, according to Welch, "a staff of 28 people in the Home Office; about 30 Coordinators (or Major Coordinators) in the field, who are fully paid as to salary and expenses; and about 100 Coordinators (or Section Leaders as they are called in some areas), who work on a volunteer basis as to all or part of their salary, or expenses, or both". According to [[Political Research Associates]] (a non-profit research group that investigates the far right), the society "pioneered grassroots lobbying, combining educational meetings, petition drives and letter-writing campaigns.&lt;ref name="PublicEye" /&gt; One early campaign against the second summit between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] generated over 600,000 postcards and letters, according to the society. In that same year Welch offered $2,300 in prizes to college students for the best essays on "grounds of impeachment" of [[Earl Warren|Chief Justice Warren]], a prime target of ultra-conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barck, Jr. and Blake|first=Oscar Theodore and Nelson Manfred|title=Since 1900 A History of the United States in Our Times|year=1969|publisher=Macmillan Company|location=New York|page=754}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 1964 society campaign to oppose [[Xerox]] corporate sponsorship of TV programs favorable to the UN produced 51,279 letters from 12,785 individuals."&lt;ref name="PublicEye" /&gt;

In 1962, [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], editor of the main conservative magazine, the ''National Review'', denounced Welch and the John Birch Society as "far removed from common sense" and urged the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] to purge itself of Welch's influence.&lt;ref name="G JB me"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/goldwater-the-john-birch-society-and-me/|title= Goldwater, the John Birch Society, and Me|work=Commentary |date=March 1, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2008|author=William F. Buckley, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s Welch insisted that the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson administration]]'s fight against communism [[Vietnam War|in Vietnam]] was part of a communist plot aimed at taking over the United States. Welch demanded that the United States get out of Vietnam, thus aligning the Society with the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2128280 | last1 = Stephen Earl | first1 = Bennett | year = 1971 | title = Modes of Resolution of a 'Belief Dilemma' in the Ideology of the John Birch Society | journal = [[Journal of Politics]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 735–772 | jstor = 2128280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The society opposed [[Water fluoridation controversy|water fluoridation]], which it called "mass medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Dion Lefler  |title=Fluoride fight has long roots, passionate advocates | newspaper=The Wichita Eagle | date=October 27, 2012 | accessdate=December 8, 2016 | quote=The John Birch Society was an active participant in Wichita's 1964 referendum that repealed fluoridation after the City Commission had voted to implement it. |url=http://www.kansas.com/news/article1101667.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=William Heisel | title =Does fluoride have lessons for the vaccine debate? | journal =Center for Health Journalism Newsletter | date =November 11, 2016 | access-date =December 8, 2016 |quote=From the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the John Birch Society were vocal opponents of water fluoridation. |url=http://www.centerforhealthjournalism.org/2016/11/10/does-fluoride-have-lessons-vaccine-debate }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=It's a Day of Decision | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=April 28, 1966 | page=3 | first=Paul | last=Coates}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The JBS was moderately active in the 1960s with numerous chapters, but rarely engaged in coalition building with other conservatives. It was rejected by most conservatives because of Welch's conspiracy theories. The philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] said in a 1964 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, "I consider the Birch Society futile, because they are not for capitalism but merely against communism&amp;nbsp;... I gather they believe that the disastrous state of today's world is caused by a communist conspiracy. This is childishly naïve and superficial. No country can be destroyed by a mere conspiracy, it can be destroyed only by ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ellensplace.net/ar_pboy.html | title = Who was Ayn Rand? – a biography, Playboy interview, 1964 | accessdate = July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth--836-The_Lost_Parts_Ayn_Rands_Playboy_Interview.aspx |title=The 'Lost' Parts of Ayn Rand's Playboy Interview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620073111/http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth--836-The_Lost_Parts_Ayn_Rands_Playboy_Interview.aspx |archive-date=June 20, 2010 |dead-url=yes |publisher=The Atlas Society |first=Don |last=Hauptman |date=March 1, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Eisenhower cabinet]] member [[Ezra Taft Benson]]—a leading Mormon—spoke in favor of the John Birch Society, but in January 1963 the LDS church issued a statement distancing itself from the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Prince | first1 = Gregory A. | year = 2004 | title = The Red Peril, the Candy Maker, and the Apostle: David O.

These opponents accused Welch of harboring feminist, [[ecumenical]], and evolutionary ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/NetLoss/NetLoss-Oliver.html | title = The John Birch Society – Exposed! | accessdate = July 18, 2008 | first = John | last = Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mormoninquiry.typepad.com/mormon_inquiry/2006/06/a_spectre_was_h.html | title = A Spectre Haunting Mormonism | accessdate = July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.watch.pair.com/belmont.html | title = The Belmont Brotherhood | accessdate = July 18, 2008 | first = Nicholas J. | last = Bove, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welch rejected these accusations by his detractors: "All we are interested in here is opposing the advance of the Communists, and eventually destroying the whole Communist conspiracy, so that Jews and Christians alike, and Mohammedans and Buddhists, can again have a decent world in which to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Welch | year=1963 | publisher=John Birch Society | page=20 | title=The Neutralizers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 Welch favored [[Barry Goldwater]] for the Republican presidential nomination, but the membership split, with two-thirds supporting Goldwater and one-third supporting [[Richard Nixon]], who did not run. A number of Birch members and their allies were Goldwater supporters in 1964&lt;ref name="G JB me"/&gt; and some were delegates at the [[1964 Republican National Convention]].

In April 1966, a ''[[New York Times]]'' article on [[New Jersey]] and the society voiced—in part—a concern for "the increasing tempo of radical right attacks on local government, libraries, school boards, parent-teacher associations, mental health programs, the Republican Party and, most recently, the ecumenical movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/04/20/archives/foes-of-rising-birch-society-organize-in-jersey-foes-of-rising.html | title=Foes of Rising Birch Society Organize in Jersey | work=The New York Times | date=April 20, 1966 | accessdate=May 2, 2018 | author=Sullivan, Ronald | pages=1}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then characterized the society as "by far the most successful and 'respectable' radical right organization in the country. It operates alone or in support of other extremist organizations whose major preoccupation, like that of the Birchers, is the internal Communist conspiracy in the United States."

===Eisenhower issue===
Welch wrote in a widely circulated statement, ''The Politician,'' "Could Eisenhower really be simply a smart politician, entirely without principles and hungry for glory, who is only the tool of the Communists? The answer is yes." He went on. "With regard to&amp;nbsp;... Eisenhower, it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted at [http://www.jbs.org/jbs-news-feed/1375-glenn-beck-talks-with-jbs-president-john-f-mcmanus "Glenn Beck talks with JBS President John F. McManus" Aug. 15, 2006], The John Birch Society {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112151401/http://www.jbs.org/jbs-news-feed/1375-glenn-beck-talks-with-jbs-president-john-f-mcmanus |date=January 12, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of ''The Politician''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Welch | first = Robert | title = The Politician | publisher = Western Islands | location = Boston | year = 1975 | isbn = 99908-64-98-5 | pages = cxxxviii–cxxxix | quote = At this point in the original manuscript, there was one paragraph in which I expressed my own personal belief as to the most likely explanation of the events and actions with this document had tried to bring into focus.

It does not seem so for an edition of the letter that is now to be published and given, probably, fairly wide distribution. So that paragraph, and two explanatory paragraphs, connected with it, have been omitted here. And the reader is left entirely free to draw his own conclusions. | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sensationalism of Welch's charges against Eisenhower prompted several conservatives and Republicans, most prominently Goldwater and the intellectuals of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William F. Buckley]]'s circle, to renounce outright or quietly shun the group. Buckley, an early friend and admirer of Welch, regarded his accusations against Eisenhower as "paranoid and idiotic libels" and attempted unsuccessfully to purge Welch from the Birch Society.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Judis, ''William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives'' (2001) pp. 193–200&lt;/ref&gt; From then on Buckley, who was editor of ''[[National Review]]'', became the leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives.&lt;ref name = "NewYorker"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/18/101018fa_fact_wilentz?printable=true Confounding Fathers: The Tea Party’s Cold War Roots] by historian [[Sean Wilentz]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley's biographer [[John B. Judis]] wrote that "Buckley was beginning to worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism ''National Review'' had promoted."&lt;ref name = "NewYorker" /&gt;

The booklet found support from [[Ezra Taft Benson]], Eisenhower's [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] who later became the 13th [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the LDS Church]]. In a letter to his friend FBI chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]], Benson asked "how can a man [Eisenhower] who seems to be so strong for Christian principles and base American concepts be so effectively used as a tool to serve the communist conspiracy?" Benson privately fought to prevent the bureau from condemning the JBS, which prompted Hoover to distance himself from Benson. At one point in 1971 Hoover directed his staff to lie to Benson to avoid having to meet with him about the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidson|first1=Lee|title=FBI files shed light on Ezra Taft Benson, Ike and the Birch Society|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=50349153&amp;itype=CMSID|accessdate=February 11, 2018|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
The society was at the center of a [[freedom of expression|free-speech]] law case in the 1970s, after ''American Opinion'' accused a Chicago lawyer, [[Elmer Gertz]], who was representing the family of a young man killed by a police officer, of being part of a Communist conspiracy to merge all police agencies in the country into one large force. The resulting [[slander and libel|libel]] suit, ''[[Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.]]'', reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], which held that a state may allow a private figure such as Gertz to recover actual damages from a media defendant without proving malice, but that a public figure does have to prove actual malice, according to the standard laid out in ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', in order to recover presumed damages or punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Haiman | first1 = Franklyn Saul | last2 = Tedford | first2 = Thomas L. | last3 = Herbeck | first3 = Dale | title = Freedom Of Speech In The United States | publisher = Strata Publishing | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-891136-10-0 | chapter = Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc | chapterurl = http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/gertz.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ordered a retrial in which Gertz prevailed.

Key society causes of the 1970s included opposition to both the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and to the establishment of diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China. The society claimed in 1973 that the regime of [[Mao Zedong]] had murdered 64 million Chinese as of that year and that it was the primary supplier of illicit [[heroin]] into the United States. This led to bumper stickers showing a pair of scissors cutting a hypodermic needle in half accompanied by the slogan "Cut The Red China Connection". The society also was opposed to transferring control of the [[Panama Canal]] from American to Panamanian sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Andrew | last = Guthrie | title = Is Panama Canal Falling Under Chinese Control? | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/1999/991124-prc1.htm | work = Voice of America | date = November 24, 1999 | accessdate = July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was organized into local chapters during this period. Ernest Brosang, a New Jersey regional coordinator, claimed that it was virtually impossible for opponents of the society to penetrate its policy-making levels, thereby protecting it from "anti-American" takeover attempts. Its activities included the distribution of literature critical of civil rights legislation, warnings over the influence of the United Nations, and the release of petitions to impeach United States Supreme Court Justice [[Earl Warren]]. To spread their message, members held showings of documentary films and operated initiatives such as "Let Freedom Ring", a nationwide network of recorded telephone messages.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

===After Welch===
[[File:USOutOfUN.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Political sign in white background advocating for removal of United States from the United Nations|A sign advocating America's withdrawal produced by the John Birch Society]]
By the time of Welch's death in 1985, the society's membership and influence had dramatically declined. The society continues to press for an end to United States membership in the United Nations. As evidence of the effectiveness of JBS efforts, the society points to the [[Utah State Legislature]]'s failed resolution calling for United States withdrawal, as well as the actions of several other states where the Society's membership has been active. Since its founding, the society has repeatedly opposed United States military intervention overseas, although it strongly supports the American military. It has issued calls to "Bring Our Troops Home" in every conflict since its founding, including [[Vietnam]]. The society also has a national speakers' committee called American Opinion Speakers Bureau (AOSB) and an anti-tax committee called TRIM (Tax Reform IMmediately).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/jbs/jbs2.html The Ross Institute].&lt;/ref&gt;

The second head of the Society was Congressman [[Larry McDonald]] (D) from Georgia, who was killed on September 1, 1983, when airliner [[KAL 007]] was shot down by a Soviet interceptor.

William P. Hoar has been active as a writer for the Society. He is noted for very strong attacks on mainstream politicians from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush. He publishes regularly in ''[[The New American]]'' and its predecessor ''American Opinion.'' He coauthored ''The Clinton Clique'' with Larry Abraham alleging that Clinton was part of the Anglo-American conspiracy supposedly ruled through the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and the [[Trilateral Commission]].

The Society has been active in supporting the auditing of, and aims to eventually dismantle, the [[Federal Reserve System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Reserve|work=Jbs.org|url=http://www.jbs.org/issues-pages/federal-reserve}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JBS holds that the United States Constitution gives only Congress the ability to coin money, and does not permit it to delegate this power, or to transform the dollar into a [[Fiat money|fiat currency]] not backed by [[gold standard|gold]] or [[Silver standard#United States|silver]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

JBS is opposed to modern-day efforts to call a [[convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenstein|first1=Robert|title=A constitutional convention could be the single most dangerous way to ‘fix’ American government|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/21/a-constitutional-convention-could-be-the-single-most-dangerous-way-to-fix-american-government/|accessdate=December 7, 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although membership numbers are kept private, the JBS has reported a resurgence of members during the Trump administration, specifically in [[Texas]]. The organization's goals in Texas include opposition to the UN's [[Agenda 21]] based on a conspiracy theory that it will "establish control over all human activity", and opposition to a bill that would allow undocumented migrants to pay in-state tuition for Texas state colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=John|title=The John Birch Society Is Back|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/16/the-john-birch-society-is-alive-and-well-in-the-lone-star-state-215377|accessdate=February 11, 2018|work=Politico|date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1961 the society was lampooned in a song named "The John Birch Society" by the [[Chad Mitchell Trio]].
* In 1962 [[Bob Dylan]] recorded "[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]", which poked fun at the society and its tendency to see Communist conspiracies in many situations. When he attempted to perform it on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1963, however, CBS's Standards and Practices department forbade it, fearing that lyrics equating the Society’s views with those of [[Adolf Hitler]] might trigger a defamation lawsuit. Dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song, but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice he would rather not appear at all. The story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed; Sullivan denounced the network's decision in published interviews.&lt;ref&gt;''Bob Dylan walks out on The Ed Sullivan Show.''

* Cartoonist [[Walt Kelly]] lampooned the John Birch Society in his comic strip ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'', with two of his less savory characters creating "The Jack Acid Society" to weed out anyone they suspected of being un-American. The strips, along with some original material, were collected and published in 1962 as ''The Jack Acid Society Black Book''.
* The 1973 song "[[Uneasy Rider]]", by [[Charlie Daniels]], contains the line "I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch", which is uttered (in the context of the song's story) by the "fella with green teeth", to contradict the statement by the protagonist that "He's a undercover agent for the FBI and he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan!".&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/The-charlie-daniels-band-uneasy-rider-lyrics "Uneasy Rider" lyrics].

'''Joseph Zen Ze-kiun''' [[Salesians of Don Bosco|SDB]] ({{IPA-wuu|zəɲ zəʔ tɕyəɲ|[[Shanghainese]]:}}, born 13 January 1932) is a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] of the [[Catholic Church]] from [[Hong Kong]], who served as the sixth [[Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong|Bishop of Hong Kong]]. He was made a cardinal in 2006, and has been outspoken on issues regarding human rights, [[Freedom (political)|political freedom]], and [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]], often attracting criticism from the [[Communist Party of China]].  He retired on 15 April 2009.

== Early life and career ==
Joseph Zen was born in [[Shanghai]] to [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] parents, Vincent Zen and Margaret Tseu. He studied in a church school during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], but was sent to an [[abbey]] after his father suffered a stroke.

Zen fled to Hong Kong from Shanghai to escape Communist rule at the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. After entering the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesians]] at the Hong Kong [[novitiate]], he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] on 11 February 1961 by Cardinal [[Maurilio Fossati]]. Zen obtained a [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|licentiate in theology]] (1961) and a doctorate in philosophy (1964) from the [[Salesian Pontifical University]] in Rome. After 1973, he taught in the Holy Spirit Seminary College of Hong Kong&amp;nbsp;– 1976 to 1978 of Macao Salesian School ([[Instituto Salesiano]]) （澳門慈幼中學） as principal. In 1978 he became the [[Provincial Superior]] of Salesians (which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), then resigned in 1983. He was a lecturer in the [[seminaries]] in China, centres of studies acknowledged by the Communist party, between 1989 and 1996. He was appointed the [[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong|Bishop of Hong Kong]] in 1996 by [[Pope John Paul II]].

===Advocacy for democracy===
After he succeeded as Bishop of Hong Kong on 23 September 2002, he led the Diocese in voicing reservations about the proposed anti-subversion laws, required under [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23 of the Basic Law]].  He was worried that these laws, if enacted without a thorough consultation process including a [[white paper]], could easily lead to future violations of basic [[civil right]]s.

On 1 July 2003, he took part in a prayer gathering at Victoria Park before the [[Hong Kong 1 July marches|1 July March]] began. Many Christians, including Catholics and those of other denominations, attended the demonstration.

On 3 June 2004, the diocese held a praying activity called ''Democratize China'' (民主中國). Zen said that Hong Kong was suffering from a ''bloodless [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|June Fourth Massacre]]'' without guns and tanks. He was criticized by the Financial Minister of [[People's Republic of China|PRC]].

On 1 July 2004, Zen attended a prayer gathering at [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]] before the second 1 July March, but did not take part in the demonstration. Still, many Catholics joined thousands of other citizens in the anti-government march.

On 3 November 2005, after returning from Vatican City, he said that the people of Hong Kong should be allowed to decide whether or not they wanted proposed constitutional reforms; he also said that the Government should conduct a "territory-wide public opinion survey" to allow the people to decide whether or not they wanted the constitutional reform package it was proposing. He was then known as the 'Voice' of Hong Kong because he successfully made six pan-democrats that tried to support the motion of the Government to announce opposition to the motion. He was openly criticized by Chief Secretary [[Rafael Hui]] after the defeat of the political reform package.

Cardinal Zen attended the 4 June 2006 Prayer gathering in memory of the victims of the 1989 massacre. He asked the Chinese government to let the Chinese people freely discuss the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/expressnews/20060604/20060604_55_314688.html |script-title=zh:陳日君 ： 不能讓六四不了了之 |publisher=RTHK |date=4 June 2006 |language=zh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531204359/http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/expressnews/20060604/20060604_55_314688.html |archivedate=31 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zen also led the 1 July Protest in 2007.

==="New Conscience"===
Zen has been described as the "new conscience of Hong Kong" for his defence of human rights, political freedom, and religious liberty in the face of criticism from China's communist government. He has called the Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in [[Tiananmen Square]] "a big mistake," and called on the government to "tell the truth" about those events. He was also an opponent of Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23, a since-shelved [[National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003|national security bill]], which in 2003 prompted an anti-government protest by half a million people. Zen is a vocal proponent of a push for [[universal suffrage]] in Hong Kong, telling his flock in a 2005 homily that "a path will appear when enough people walk on it." He has publicly called on officials in Hong Kong to support the aspirations of the people, rather than functioning as spokespersons for the central government in Beijing. At a personal level, he is described by John L. Allen Jr., a [[Vatican watcher]], as "a gracious, humble man, a moderate on most issues".

Zen was named the "Person of the Year 2002" by ''Apple Daily''.

===Retirement===
[[File:Bishop Joseph Zen-2002.jpg|thumb|Bishop Joseph Zen prayed with Catholics before the protest against Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 legislation]]

On 18 September 2005, he told Hong Kong newspaper ''Apple Daily'' reporters that he was willing to retire in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_4730000/newsid_4739500/4739586.stm |script-title=zh:香港主教陳日君獲任命為樞機主教 |publisher=BBC News |date=22 February 2006 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he wanted to be a teacher in either mainland China or in Africa, as there are teachers shortage in Africa. [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] ex-chairman [[Martin Lee]], also a Roman Catholic, stated that because Zen was still healthy for his age, the Pope may request him to stay in his position.  Legislative Council member [[Audrey Eu]] praised Zen for being braver than other religious leaders in Hong Kong in sharing his political views and also because "he carried out his ideas of fairness, equitableness, and philanthropy via actual efforts". On the other hand, some conservatives inside the church speculated that the strained relationship between Beijing and the [[Holy See]] will become more relaxed if Zen retires. Nonetheless, Zen wrote a letter to the Pope on 13 January 2006 and stated that he did want to retire from his position, though not because of his age. On 15 April 2009 Pope Benedict accepted Cardinal Zen's resignation and [[John Tong Hon]] became the Bishop of the [[diocese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/23712.php?index=23712&amp;lang=en]{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 22 October 2011 for three days Cardinal Zen went on [[hunger strike]] which was undertaken as an act of protest against losing a long-standing legal battle with the Hong Kong government over how aided schools should be run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Card.-Zen-ends-hunger-strike-for-freedom-of-Hong-Kong-Catholic-schools-22985.html |title=Card. Zen ends hunger strike for freedom of Hong Kong Catholic schools |publisher=Asianews.it |date= 22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote about his experiences in an open letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Card.-Zen:-My-struggle-and-that-of-Hong-Kong-for-Catholic-schools-23003.html |title=Card.

===Cardinalate===
[[Image:Coat of arms of Joseph Zen Ze-kiun.svg|thumb|Coat of Arms of Cardinal Zen. The motto is ''Ipsi cura est'' is from [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 5:7. In English it says: "He cares about you."]]

On 22 February 2006, the Vatican announced that Zen would be elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in the [[papal consistory|consistory]] on 24 March 2006. Zen, who was created [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Priest]] of [[Santa Maria Madre del Redentore a Tor Bella Monaca]], saw his elevation as indication of how much the Pope values the Church in China. He was named a member of the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]].

Bishop Zen's elevation was welcomed by Catholics in Hong Kong as it was seen as a recognition of the bishop's stance on social justice and as an honour for the church in Hong Kong. Vicar General Rev. [[Dominic Chan (priest)|Dominic Chan Chi-ming]] said that it would be an honour to have a cardinal to once again head the diocese. Rev. [[Louis Ha Ke-loon]] said it shows that the Pope feels that Bishop Zen should speak out. Democrat legislator Martin Lee added that it was good news because no matter whether he is a bishop or a cardinal, as a religious leader Zen speaks as moral voice of the people.

At the time of his elevation, Zen was the only Chinese cardinal eligible to participate in papal conclaves. His elevation can be seen as giving hope to the underground Catholic Church in China.

Cardinal Zen offered a [[Pontifical High Mass]] in the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Rite]] in May 2006, for which he was thanked by [[traditionalist Catholic]]s around the world.

Pope Benedict XVI named Cardinal Zen to write the meditations for the [[Way of the Cross|Stations of the Cross]] led by the Pope at the Roman [[Colisseum]] on [[Good Friday]], 21 March 2008.

===Relations with the People's Republic of China===
After the pope canonized several priests who died during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], Zen (as coadjutor bishop at the time) said that the priests were innocent and the Boxers guilty{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} angering the [[Central People's Government]], who banned him from visiting mainland China for six years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  On 3 May 2004, he visited mainland China for the first time since 1998 and was the first bishop of Hong Kong to visit China since the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] in 1997.

He has also been especially critical of Beijing's response to the [[Falun Gong]] spiritualist movement, which China's leaders have outlawed for "trying to overthrow" the Communist Party. He also criticized the mainland government when it requested the Standing Committee of the [[National People's Congress]] to re-interpret the Basic Law. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In April and May 2006, Cardinal Zen opposed the episcopal consecration of two bishops in China who belonged to the state-sanctioned [[Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association]]. The elevations were without the permission of the [[Holy See]], causing a controversy. In a February 2007 interview, Cardinal Zen referred the appointments without Vatican permission as a "declaration of war".

In October 2011, Zen admitted that, without the knowledge of the [[Holy See]], he had received HK$20 million from Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai since 2005, part of which went to helping the underground Church on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/I-received-millions-and-spent-them-for-the-Church-and-the-poor,-Card-Zen-says-22966.html |title=I received millions and spent them for the Church and the poor, Card Zen says |publisher=Asianews.it |date=20 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Cardinal Zen Ze-kiun asked Pope Francis not to visit China, saying the pontiff would be “manipulated”. In an interview he told the Italian newspaper [[Corriere della Sera]]: “I would tell him now, ‘Don’t come, you would be manipulated'. ...The few courageous [Catholics] could not meet [the Pope], and the Communist Party would show him the illegitimate bishops, including the three excommunicated ones.” The comments came as ties between the Vatican and China improved in the early days of the pontificate of Francis, with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs congratulating Francis on his election".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1545687/cardinal-zen-asks-pope-francis-not-visit-china|title=Hong Kong's Cardinal Joseph Zen asks Pope Francis not to visit China|date=2014-07-03|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Zen said he did not see signs of dialogue happening between the Catholic Church and China. “Even if under these conditions Beijing was to extend a hand, it would be a trick under these circumstances,” he said. “Our poor bishops are slaves, the Communist Party denies them respect, tries to take away their dignity.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In September 2014 as part of the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], Cardinal Zen addressed the protesters saying "It's high time we really showed that we want to be free and not to be slaves. ... We must unite together". During his speech protesters were fired on with tear gas and he asked them to disperse.&lt;ref name="Cardinal Zen addresses pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong" &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2018 interview Cardinal Zen, on Sino-Holy See relations, said “Pope Francis does not know the real Communist Party in China, but Parolin should know. He was there [in the Secretariat of State] so many years, so he must know. He may be happy to encourage the pope to be optimistic about the negotiations … but that’s dangerous. Pope Francis needs someone to calm him down from his enthusiasm.” Zen added that  “It seems the Secretary of State wants to have a solution anyway. He is so optimistic. That’s dangerous. I told the pope that he [Parolin] has a poisoned mind. He is very sweet, but I have no trust in this person. He believes in diplomacy, not in our faith.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2017/10/16/cardinal-says-popes-top-diplomat-poisoned-mind-china/|title=Cardinal says pope's top diplomat has 'poisoned mind' on China|date=2017-10-16|work=Crux|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2018/01/29/cardinal-zen-attacks-vatican-efforts-rehabilitate-government-appointed-chinese-bishops/Cardinal|title=cardinal|work=Crux|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
[[Image:A bill hung by an unknown person who hates Joseph Zen Ze-Kiun.JPG|thumb|A bill critical of Cardinal Zen.]]

===Education reform controversies===
{{Main|School-Based Management Policy}}
On 5 June 2005, Zen announced that if the Legislative Council passed a proposal to support the schools to create incorporated management committees on 8 July 2005, he would appeal against the decision to the court. The Education (Amendment) Bill 2002, once enacted, would likely play down the role of the Church in running Catholic schools and in promoting Catholic education.

However, after the Government gave up some argued points in the motion, the Diocese decided to support the motion, though the Diocese later announced plans to prosecute the Government on 28 September 2005.

After two teachers committed suicide in early January 2006, Zen said that these acts must be due to the educational reforms and he asked the government to halt new reforms. Then Permanent Secretary for Education and Manpower [[Fanny Law]] rejected causal connections, but provoked furor among teachers and the public when she questioned why only two teachers committed suicide because of the reforms.&lt;ref name="pressure"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WTO affairs===
On 18 December 2005, Zen visited protesters at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005|2005 WTO Ministerial Conference]] and tried to visit the detained South Korean Catholics, including two priests and a nun. He criticised the Hong Kong police for their treatment of the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/ArticleView/article_view.asp?no=264911&amp;rel_no=1 |title=... And They Call It Democracy |publisher=ohmynews.com |date=21 December 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624222412/http://english.ohmynews.com/ArticleView/article_view.asp?no=264911&amp;rel_no=1 |archivedate=24 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called the government a "child" for "doing something nonsensical.'" About one month later, several unions in [[Hong Kong Police Force]] decided to write a letter to the Pope to complain about Zen's speech. Zen replied that some policemen were "sycophantic to the senior officers inside the police force".

===Criticisms within the diocese===
Several local priests tried to persuade Zen not to participate in any protests before he led the 1 July Protest in 2007. Zen was only allowed to attend the prayer gathering before the protests against the educational reforms. Some Catholics criticized Zen for making the church like a "political party" and posted anti-Zen advertisements in newspapers and on the internet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In January 2006, Rev. Joseph Lee, Parish Priest of [[St Anthony's Church, Macau|St. Anthony's Church]], who, similar to Zen, was born and educated in Shanghai and is a Salesian, said in a television programme that "99% of Catholics disagree with the Bishop," while according to a survey more than 60% of Catholics agree with the Bishop. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} He also said that Zen seriously harmed the relationship between China and the Holy See.

In 2006 the Catholic official newspaper [[Kung Kao Po]] contained criticism and opinions by Rev. John B. Kwan Kit Tong against Zen. Four weeks later, Rev. Kwan claimed in the same newspaper that the criticism was not written directly against Zen and that his writing had been misinterpreted by local newspapers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The '''Kraybill Conflict Style Inventory''' (KCSI, also known by the book title ''Style Matters'') is a [[conflict style inventory]] developed in the 1980s by Dr. Ronald S. Kraybill.  Like the widely used [[Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument|Thomas Kilmann Inventory]] (TKI), it is built around the [[Managerial grid model|Mouton-Blake grid]] and identifies five styles of responding to conflict, in this case: directing, harmonizing, avoiding, cooperating, and compromising.

The Kraybill model takes into consideration conflict response styles when things are going well ("calm") and when conflict increases ("storm"). KCSI is different from predecessors in the Mouton-Blake tradition in encouraging users to consider options for [[cultural adaptation|cultural adaptability]], taking into account variation in participants' responses as appropriate to [[individualistic]] or [[collectivistic]] cultures.

Questions are in [[Likert Scale]] format, with users choosing a response on a scale of 1–7.  Interpretation pages give principles for interpretation and tips for maximizing effectiveness of each style.

According to the publisher's website, a PhD study in 2004 found it valid and reliable, however the research sample was small, less than a dozen subjects.  In a second larger study, researchers at [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania]] administered Style Matters to more than 300 subjects and rated the inventory well on validity and reliability, standard benchmarks of consistency and accuracy of measurement in testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=96th Annual Convention of the National Communication Association |location=San Francisco |date=October 2010 |title=Validation of the Kraybill Conflict Style Inventory |first1=M.E. |last1=Braz |first2=B. |last2=Lawton |first3=R.S. |last3=Kraybill |first4=K. |last4=Daly.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2015 doctoral thesis, "The Effect of Student-Generated Case Studies on Conflict Resolution Style Development", David Nemitz used the Style Matters inventory to assess the impact of conflict resolution training on graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2053&amp;context=doctoral|title = The Effect of Student-Generated Case Studies on Conflict Resolution Style Development"|last = Nemitz|first = David|date = 2015|website = Digital Commons, Liberty University|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Landlord Law &amp; Multi-housing Report''''' is a news service (or [[newsletter]]) produced in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] by [[CD Publications]]. It covers federal and state court decisions and [[Hud (housing)|HUD]] rulings on public, assisted, senior and disabled housing.

==History==
CD Publications began publishing housing-related [[newsletters]] in 1961, starting with ''[[Housing Affairs Letter]]''. ''Managing Housing Letter'' began publication in 1978, and ''Landlord Law Report'' was added in 1996. In late 2006, ''MHL'' was merged with ''LLR'' to form ''Landlord Law &amp; Multi-housing Report'', which still is referred to as ''LLR''.

===Current Coverage===
''LLR'' carries synopses of recent federal and state court decisions on [[fair housing]], premises liability, rent/lease issues, eviction, handicapped accessibility, building security, and Section 8 tenants, plus summaries of HUD rulings. Each article also includes a short "lesson" to be learned from the outcome of the case.

===Expansion===
In 2007, ''LLR'' was changed to a web-based format and, along with CD Publications' other housing news services, was moved onto the web portal '''HousingandDevelopment.com'''.

The '''Learning Disability Coalition''' is a group of fourteen organisations which campaigns to secure better funding for social care for people with [[learning disabilities]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mencap.org.uk/case.asp?id=133 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622175147/http://www.mencap.org.uk/case.asp?id=133 |archivedate=2008-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coalition was formed in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcuk.org.uk/999461/en/the+learning+disability+coalition.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It believes that better funding from the [[UK Government]] is required to help people with learning disabilities to secure a full range of rights and opportunities.  The LDC aims to provide a unified voice for people with learning disabilities to government and other key decision makers; to raise awareness of financial pressures on services, and achieve an evidence-based assessment of the long-term resource requirements for people with learning disabilities

==Protect the Frontline==

In 2010 the LDC launched its ‘Protect the Frontline’ campaign which is calling on politicians to keep to their promises and protect frontline services for people with a learning disability.  As part of the campaign, the LDC produced ‘Stories from the Frontline’,&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.learningdisabilitycoalition.org.uk/download/PFL_report_32pp_web.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; which included a series of diaries by people with a learning disability.  These diaries helped to show the importance of frontline social care and the difference that it makes to their lives and the lives of their families. 
The LDC has been monitoring cuts to social care through its cutswatch feature,&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.learningdisabilitycoalition.org.uk/cutswatch.asp)&lt;/ref&gt; and since the announcement of the [[Comprehensive Spending Review]], has been calling on local councillors &lt;ref&gt;(http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=78&amp;ea.campaign.id=8778&amp;ea.tracking.id=LDCweb)&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that social care spending is protected at a local level.

==Management==

The Coalition's Director is Anthea Sully and its Co-Chairs are Andrew Lee, Director of People First and Mark Goldring, Chief Executive of Mencap.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4950">[[Sudan]] is a multilingual country dominated by [[Sudanese Arabic]]. In the 2005 constitution of the Republic of Sudan, the official '''languages of Sudan''' are [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and [[English language|English]].

An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that it is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;

'''Marietta Peabody Tree''' (April 17, 1917 &amp;ndash; August 15, 1991) was an American [[socialite]] and political supporter, who represented the United States on the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], appointed under the administration of [[John F. Kennedy]].

==Early life==
'''Marietta Endicott Peabody''' was the only daughter of Malcolm Endicott Peabody, the rector of Grace Episcopal Church in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], and Mary Elizabeth Parkman. Her grandfather [[Endicott Peabody (educator)|Rev. Endicott Peabody]] was founder and first headmaster of [[Groton School]] where her four brothers Endicott, Samuel, George, and Malcolm were educated.&lt;ref name=treebio&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://nj.essortment.com/humansrightsco_rwkz.htm |title=Human Rights Commission &amp; Marietta Peabody Tree biography |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905100314/http://nj.essortment.com/humansrightsco_rwkz.htm |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although born into an old New England family, Tree's parents were strictly middle-class, and were among the old-line Yankees and [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalians]] in what was fast becoming the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] stronghold of Lawrence. Tree's mother Mary was an extensive charity worker, and encouraged her daughter to get involved with the community.

Tree attended [[St. Timothy's School]], where she excelled in athletics above studies. An effervescent, leggy blonde, she was an accomplished flirt and irresistible to men from an early age.&lt;ref name=treebook&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n1_v30/ai_20239566 |title=No Regrets: The Life of Marietta Tree. - book reviews |magazine=Washington Monthly |first=Sandra |last=McElwaine |year=1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228052221/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n1_v30/ai_20239566 |archivedate=2008-02-28}} {{cite magazine |title=[Page 2] |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n1_v30/ai_20239566/pg_2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624221042/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n1_v30/ai_20239566/pg_2/ |archivedate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; She undertook a grand tour of [[Europe]] and [[finishing school]] in [[Florence]] upon graduation to avoid college.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/09/reviews/971109.09brubact.html | work=The New York Times | title=Running Around in High Circles}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to predict her own future, she wrote down: "Parties, people, and politics."&lt;ref name=treebio/&gt;

Her father insisted that she, unlike many society girls of the time, attend college, and she enrolled at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1936. Although she withdrew from the Class of 1940, reflecting the era's skepticism of higher education for women,&lt;ref name=penn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/women/quote5.html |title=Quotations, 1940-1949, from Women at Penn, University of Pennsylvania Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; in later interviews she would exclaim: "I'll never stop being grateful to my father for forcing me to go to college. It changed my life."&lt;ref name=treebook/&gt; In 1964 she was presented with an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degree, and in 1971 with an honorary [[Bachelor of Arts]].&lt;ref name=penn/&gt; She is also an honorary member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] Sorority.

==Desmond FitzGerald==
During college, Marietta was courted by [[Harvard]] law graduate and [[New York City]] [[lawyer]] 
[[Desmond Fitzgerald (CIA officer)|Desmond FitzGerald]]. The couple married on September 2, 1939, and Marietta gave birth to a daughter [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]], who later became a noted [[journalist]] and [[historian]]. 

Marietta began a career as a fact checker despite having no college degree and no prior journalistic experience, and latterly writer for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. At night she partied with the [[Astor family|Astors]], [[William S. Paley|Paleys]], and [[Warburg family|Warburgs]], describing these years as "a fever of happiness."&lt;ref name=treebio/&gt;

Her ardent liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] views clashed with those of her [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] husband and created tensions in the marriage. After America entered the [[World War II|Second World War]] in December 1941, Marietta accepted a post as part of the American delegation assisting the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].

When Desmond left New York to fulfill a role in the war effort, Marietta started a passionate and intense affair with the film director [[John Huston]].&lt;ref name=treebio/&gt; Rumors, ones often perpetuated by Tree's daughters and friends, liked to paint Marietta as "the only woman Huston ever truly loved."

==Ronald Tree==
Although contemplating marriage with Huston, Marietta and FitzGerald were invited to [[Barbados]] by a colleague from the British Ministry of Information. [[Ronald Tree]], whose mother was the daughter of retail magnate [[Marshall Field]], was then a dollar billionaire; he himself was then [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Harborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Harborough]], [[Leicestershire]] and friend of [[Winston Churchill]]. Although both were married, Marietta and Tree began an affair.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

Although he was [[bisexual]] and twenty years older than Marietta,&lt;ref name=treebio /&gt; Tree and Peabody divorced their respective partners at the end of World War II and married on July 26, 1947. Marietta moved into Tree's home, [[Ditchley|Ditchley Park]], but found herself bored with English country life. Tree and most of his friends were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], and Democrat Marietta again found herself politically isolated. Their daughter [[Penelope Tree|Penelope]] was born in 1949.

For the first time in his life short of money, Ronald Tree sold Ditchley and agreed to return to [[New York City]] with Marietta, her daughter Frances Fitzgerald and their own daughter, future '60s fashion model Penelope Tree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Notable Kin - Surprising Connections #s 6 and 7: Boston Cousins of Queen Victoria and Yankee Ancestors of Mrs. Thomas Philip “Tip” O’Neill, Jr. |author=Gary Boyd Roberts |url=http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/NEXUS/Nexus_10.4.8.asp |publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society |website=NewEnglandAncestors.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032452/http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/NEXUS/Nexus_10.4.8.asp |archive-date=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his butler Collins.&lt;ref name=treebio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876373,00.html?iid=chix-sphere | work=Time | title=Diplomacy: Come to the Party | date=1964-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and Adlai Stevenson==
Marietta Tree immediately joined the Lexington Democratic Club, and two years later was elected the county chairwoman. She was elected to the Democratic State Committee in 1954.

In 1952, Tree became involved in the Presidential election campaign of [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]. After his defeat, the two became constant companions and lovers, but Ronald Tree was unfazed and even invited Stevenson to the couple's homes in New York, [[Barbados]] and London.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Marietta and Stevenson developed code names for each other – Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, and Mr. and Mrs. Richardson – and arranged trysts at various friends' houses that they considered safe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Tree was part of Stevenson's unsuccessful 1956 Presidential campaign, and upon his return to a legal career the pair continued their affair but became slightly more distant. Stevenson also took other lovers, keeping Marietta on edge, frequently disclosing his encounters by stockpiling in a drawer by his bed a number of poems and meditations of love that he would send and receive from various women.&lt;ref name=treebio/&gt;

This encouraged Tree's earlier lover, the film director John Huston, who even gave her a role in his 1960 movie ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]''. However, she was devoted to Stevenson, and although she refused to divorce Tree, she gladly accepted [[John F. Kennedy]]'s offer of becoming the [[United States Representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], aptly appointed under Stevenson as the head of the American delegation.&lt;ref name=treebook/&gt;  She served in this position from 1961 to 1964.

On July 14, 1965, Tree and Stevenson were walking in [[London]] when he suffered a [[heart attack]], and later died at [[St George's Hospital]]. That night in her diary, she wrote: "Adlai is dead. We were together."&lt;ref name=treebook/&gt;

==Later life==
Ronald and Marietta became virtually estranged. Ronald Tree died of a stroke on July 14, 1976, in London, while Marietta was in New York.

Ronald Tree left Marietta with little money, and she was forced to sell much of the couple's property to remain financially stable. She started an affair with [[England|English]] [[architect]] [[Richard Llewelyn-Davies]], and financed the married man's business expansion into the United States. But Davies died suddenly, and Tree was forced to cover some of the estate's debts.&lt;ref name=treebook /&gt;

Tree through her connections was able to obtain some well paid directorships, including the boards of [[CBS]], [[Pan Am]], and [[Lend Lease Corporation]] of Australia. She also served as women's trustee on the board of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/women/trustees.html Penn's Women Trustees, University of Pennsylvania Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These positions and incomes enabled her to not only support herself, but resist calls from her later publishing and political community lovers to write her memoirs, including lover Eben Pyne. She also served on the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial|Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 100th Anniversary]] Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Trescher_Centennial_records_b18234550.pdf Finding aid for the George Trescher records related to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial, 1949, 1960-1971 (bulk 1967-1970)]. [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 6 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 she appeared in the [[Danny Huston]] film ''[[Mr. North]]'', released about a month before John Huston died of [[emphysema]] on August 28, 1987. Her friends in the 1980s included [[Donald Trump]], [[Charles Wrightsman]] (who in 1986 bought the [[Lorenzo Lotto]] artwork ''[[Venus and Cupid (Lotto)|Venus and Cupid]]'' in her honour for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/eustn/hod_1986.138.htm Lorenzo Lotto: Venus and Cupid (1986.138) | Works of Art | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald]] and [[Nancy Reagan]], the latter of whom she was criticized for in the Democratic party,&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; which she worked for until 1990 when she was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]].

==Death==
Tree fought breast cancer hard, including undertaking a double [[mastectomy]], and told her friends she was suffering from [[influenza]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Tree died on August 15, 1991, at her home in New York. Her ashes were buried by her daughters.&lt;ref name=treebook /&gt;

==Character==
Tree was brought up in a strict household, whose requirements she transferred to her own daughters: they never had dolls when children. 

[[Isaiah Berlin]] characterized her political standing as, "a progressive, liberal figure who was mixed up with a lot of naive left-wing sympathizers." Like her contemporary [[Pamela Harriman]], Marietta attained through men what women of her time were forbidden to attain for themselves. As the [[feminist]] movement gained momentum in the 1960s, Marietta refused to support its cause, and in 1967 she angered her fellow female delegates to the New York state constitutional convention, by refusing to sign three resolutions pertaining to women's rights.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/09/reviews/971109.09brubact.html |title=Running Around in High Circles |date=November 9, 1997 |author=Holly Bruback |work=The New York Times |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910132123/http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/09/reviews/971109.09brubact.html |archive-date=2014-09-10 |department=Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose serves as a sector "development compass" that directs or guides the operations of the Ministry, the [[private sector]] (fisheries industry players), and putting together agencies in the development of the fisheries sector. The ultimate goal of this Plan is to "consolidate the sector gains made' for the period 2010-2013, and to fast track the contribution of the fisheries sector to national development and growth through the implementation of target-specific and growth inducing strategies and interpositions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also a "medium term road map" that is directed at guiding [[Government]] investment and Development Partner support to revamp the fisheries sector for 2014-2017 and the years ahead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mofad.gov.gh/about-mofad/mofad-at-a-glance/|title=MoFAD At-a-glance – Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development|website=www.mofad.gov.gh|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and Policy of the Ministry ==
{{Politics of Ghana}}
The destination of MOFAD is&amp;nbsp;promotion of accelerated Fisheries Sector Development as a viable economic segment&amp;nbsp;that will conduce to the total development of the economy of [[Ghana]] in line with Medium to Long term National Development Policy Frameworks of the [[country]].

The main objective of the Plan stated above&amp;nbsp; is to&amp;nbsp;enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency&amp;nbsp;of MOFAD and all Plan implementing partners towards the&amp;nbsp;achievement of stated sector policy objectives and time-bound targets, output and outcomes&amp;nbsp;of the fisheries sector that are in line with the total medium term [[evolution]] Goals and policy objectives of the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA II).

The ideas gained from the goals of the Ministry derived its&amp;nbsp;policy base&amp;nbsp;from the thematic focus areas and broad policy objectives and
strategies of (GSGDA II) that are&amp;nbsp;relevant&amp;nbsp;to the&amp;nbsp;mandate and functions&amp;nbsp;of MOFAD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In total, the Ministry is headed by a Sector Minister, and each agency or department has a director as an official head.In view of this, the Fisheries Commission is the implementing agency of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD) and is headed by the Director of the Fisheries Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mofad.gov.gh/about-mofad/leadership/|title=Leadership – Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development|website=www.mofad.gov.gh|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mofad.gov.gh/agencies/fisheries-commission/fisheries-commission-at-a-glance/|title=Fisheries Commission At-a-glance – Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development|website=www.mofad.gov.gh|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mofad.gov.gh/agencies/fisheries-commission/director-of-fisheries-commission/|title=Director of Fisheries Commission – Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development|website=www.mofad.gov.gh|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions of Fisheries Commission ==
The Fisheries Commission has five (5) active divisions:

'''A.'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Marine Fisheries Management Division (MFMD)

'''B.'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Inland Fisheries Management Division (IFMD)

== National Premix Secretariat ==
The National Premix Committee (NPC) was constituted by the government of Ghana in July 2009 to oversee the administration and distribution of premix fuel, a hugely subsidised [[petroleum]] product in the country.

Landing Beach Committees (LBCs) were established at the various landing beaches to empower the [[Fisherman|fishermen]] to operate premix fuel stations at the landing beaches. Each LBC was required to choose an Oil Marketing Company to supply them with premix fuel. Proceeds from the sale of premix fuel at the landing beaches are to be used in developing the fishing communities in the country.

A National Premix Secretariat (NPS) was formed to service the NPC. The allotment and distribution of premix fuel is undertaken by the NPS. Requests made weekly for the distribution of premix fuel are sent to the Tema Oil Reﬁnery (TOR). TOR refines and loads the product into tankers of the assigned Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for distribution to the various Landing Beach Committees.

=== Mandate ===

The NPC’s responsibility is to supervise the efficient and effective administration and distribution of premix fuel. Since premix fuel is highly subsidized by the government, the NPC makes sure that monitoring is enforced to avoid diversion or inappropriate distribution. The NPC are tasked to ensure that the proceeds from the sale of premix fuel are being used to develop the fishing communities in the country. Diverse developmental projects were undertaken by majority of the LBCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mofad.gov.gh/agencies/national-premix-secretariat/|title=National Premix Secretariat – Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development|website=www.mofad.gov.gh|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Office of the Auditor General for the Federation''' (OAuGF) is a constitutional body and the Supreme Audit Institution of [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;https://oaugf.ng/about-oaugf/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2017/03/03/ayine-steps-in-as-auditor-general-of-the-federation-unveils-agenda/&lt;/ref&gt;

It derives its mandate from the 1999 [[Constitution of Nigeria|Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria]], as amended (Sections 85 and 86).

The Auditor General is empowered to undertake audits of all income and expenditure of the Federal Government of Nigeria. However, the Constitution prohibits the Auditor-General from auditing the accounts of “government statutory corporations, commissions, authorities, agencies, including all persons and bodies established by an Act of the National Assembly.” As a result, the Office of the Auditor General for the Federation cannot audit the financial statements of parastatal organizations, although it can undertake periodic checks in such state owned entities. The meaning of periodic checks in the context of the Constitution has not been properly defined since no accounting /auditing book has ever defined what a periodic check represents.

The mandate of the Office of the Auditor General for the Federation is also restricted to the audit of Federal bodies. Each of the 36 states of Nigeria has two Auditors-General, one for the audit of state institutions and the other for the audit of local governments within the state. In total, there are 73 Auditors-General in Nigeria, more than the whole of the rest of Africa put together. However nothing in the present legislation precludes the Auditor General for the Federation from tracing Federal public monies to any state of the Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Office of the Auditor General For the Federation Nigeria|title=An Introduction and History|date=2016|url=https://oaugf.ng/images/downloads/office%20of%20the%20Auditor%20General%20%20History%20and%20introduction%20book.pdf|accessdate=10 Sep 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditor General==
According to mandatory written and oral interviews set out for the position by the [[Nigerian Civil Service]], the Auditor General for the Federation is appointed by the [[President of Nigeria|President]] . The current Auditor General, Mr. [[Anthony Ayine]], was appointed on Jan 12, 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12349">'''Open-source political campaigns,''' '''open-source politics,''' or '''Politics 2.0''', is the idea that [[social networking]] and [[e-participation]] technologies will revolutionize our ability to follow, support, and influence political campaigns. [[Netroots]] evangelists and web consultants predict a wave of [[popular democracy]] as fundraisers meet on [[MySpace]] or [[Facebook]], [[YouTuber]]s crank out attack ads and bloggers do [[opposition research]].

Typically these terms describe short-term limited-life efforts to achieve a specific goal.  Longer term projects involving embedded institutions (of journalism, parties, government itself) are more often called "[[open source governance|open-source governance]]" projects.  All [[open politics]] share some very basic assumptions however including the belief that [[online deliberation]] can improve decisions.

==Origins of the term==
In print, open-source politics was first used by political operatives in the lead-up to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 United States elections]]. The earliest reference to the term in major media was a September 5, 2003 story in Salon.com in which supporters of the [[Wesley Clark|Draft Clark]] campaign and of Vermont Governor [[Howard Dean]] both claimed that their campaigns represented the ideals of "open-source politics."{{citation needed|date=October 2007}} The term was meant as a reference to [[open-source software]] such the [[Linux]] operating system, which is designed to allow users to alter its code to make improvements. The idea was that new technologies would allow similar participation and the attendant benefits in the political realm.  The story omitted the fact that Dean's campaign had actually begun to employ these tools only by the initiative of the [[Meetup.com]] bot, a simple string-matching algorithm that began to schedule meetings "about Howard Dean" when the number of people listing this string in their interests hit a critical mass.

The term was further refined in its current usage by a story in ''[[The Nation]]'' by Micah Sifry which appeared days after the 2004 election.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Nation]]: ''[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20041122/sifry The Rise of Open-Source Politics].'' November 4, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Sifry wrote that open-source politics means "opening up participation in planning and implementation to the community, letting competing actors evaluate the value of your plans and actions, being able to shift resources away from bad plans and bad planners and toward better ones, and expecting more of participants in return. It would mean moving away from egocentric organizations and toward network-centric organizing." Since Sifry's article, the term has appeared on numerous blogs and print articles.

Since the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 United States elections]], the internet has become much more participatory and interactive with the popularization of [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as [[Myspace]], [[YouTube]], [[Second Life]] and [[Wikipedia]]. This participation, the idea goes, lends new currency to the notion that these technologies can be employed to allow citizens to "reprogram" politics. One example is the way that the [[Macaca video]] spread virally through the internet on YouTube and contributed to the electoral defeat of Sen. [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] of Virginia during the 2006 U.S. midterm elections. The old "source code" of politics allowed candidates to get away with making off-the-cuff comments if journalists did not pick up on them, but services such as YouTube have changed that, and now politicians must be more careful not to say things that will come back to haunt them. In short, the idea is that citizen can rewrite the old codes of politics by using these new technologies to promote change. The term "open-source politics" was heavily employed in this context in the July/August 2007 issue of the magazine ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]],'' where the definition appeared in a format that was modeled on a [[Wikipedia]] article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]: ''[https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/07/fight_different.html Politics 2.0: Fight Different].'' June 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar terms==
A similar term, "[[open source governance|open-source governance]]," refers to overhauling or replacing existing government institutions in order to allow direct citizen input into the government.  The narrower term "[[open politics]]" refers to a specific theory derived from those of [[Bernard Crick]] and others advocating development of [[political virtues]], and strict adherence to human rights law.

By contrast, open-source politics is a term favored by technologists, and is often used interchangeably with the term "politics 2.0." Politics 2.0 has been covered by leading sites [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]], the [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 5 Live]]: ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/podsandblogs/2007/03/american_politics_20.shtml American Politics 2.0].'' 24 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[GigaOM]],&lt;ref&gt;[[GigaOM]]: ''[http://gigaom.com/2007/03/19/web-20-gives-birth-to-politics-20/ Web 2.0 gives birth to Politics 2.0].'' March 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[TechCrunch]]&lt;ref&gt;[[TechCrunch]]: ''[https://techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/when-will-politics-20-happen/ When will Politics 2.0 happen?].'' December 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and [[techPresident]],&lt;ref&gt;[[techPresident]]: ''[http://www.techpresident.com/node/1526 No More Blog, Blog, Blog!]'' June 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

==Objections to and usage of the term==
Some people, especially from the software engineering industry, dislike the term open-source politics because they feel that the technologies that the term references are not open source.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]: ''[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/06/interview-nicco-mele-co-founder-echoditto-former-webmaster-howard-dean Interview with Nicco Mele: Co-founder of EchoDitto, Former Webmaster for Howard Dean].'' June 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For example, YouTube and MySpace do not operate under an open-source licence. Proponents of the term argue that "open-source politics" is a preferable term to "[[open politics]]" because the term "open source" is an artful way to reference the idea that it is technology that is making politics more participatory.  Opponents are concerned that use of the term "open source" in this context causes unnecessary confusion, and it has been suggested that the term "[[open politics]]" or politics 2.0 be used instead.

==Impact of open-source politics==
===Optimistic view===
Those who believe that open-source politics will have a major impact on elections and government include many former staffers of Gov. Howard Dean's political campaign, many political bloggers, and members of the [[New Politics Institute]], the [[Personal Democracy Forum]], and the [[Center for Politics, Democracy and the Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]: ''[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/06/crashing-system?page=2 Crashing The System].'' June 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet entrepreneur [[Jimmy Wales]] was asked by ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' about his thoughts on the potential impact of open-source politics on old models of political campaigning such as polling and TV attack ads. He said this:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]: ''[https://www.motherjones.com/interview/2007/07/jimmy_wales.html Interview with Jimmy Wales: Wikipedia Founder].'' June 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hopefully, you start to see a little bit of diminished effectiveness when people can talk back to attack ads. In the past, when you'd see a vicious attack ad, you might find it distasteful, but you might also wonder if that person did that horrible thing. Online, you begin to see some of those things start to unravel, and people responding and saying, "Yeah, this is an attack ad, and this is what really happened." Then you get a more interesting dialogue around that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of the polling that goes on is push polling, in that the questions being asked are being framed to get answers they want. Those kinds of things get harder to sustain when you have a large body of people who can push back and put out an alternative point of view.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rise in the use of social media for revolutionary purposes and political activism has been shown in academic literature and surpasses previous forms of political activism in terms of popularity and influence. World leaders are taking notice of social media driven activism and British Prime Minister David Cameron was even quoted during the Tottenham riots as saying, “Everyone watching these horrific events will be struck by how they were organized via social media”.&lt;ref&gt;Fuch 383 as qtd. in the Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; This exemplifies the power that social media and Web 2.0 platforms are capable of having to advance social change and political change. Historically, social and political activism has been organized and pursued through traditional means, such as posters, word of mouth, and the various forms of media. Social media revolutions include the use of numerous social media platforms that make up the “Web 2.0”. Twitter is at the heart of social activism and can be used proactively to accomplish many different end goals.

We can look to Chander and Fuch’s research for evidence of technological change, as both cases being studied took place around 2011. Although 2011 was only four years ago, technology has the tendency to advance so quickly that once a certain technology is on the market, new technology is already being developed to replace the existing technology. This may hold many different potential futures for social media driven activism, whether for the greater good of citizens or perhaps giving state governments more power to fight activism or potential activism before it even starts.

Information Communication Technologies (ICT) encompass a wide range of technological means that give access to various forms of media, the Internet, social media, and other technologies. The complexity of ICTs around the world differs greatly between the Global North and Global South, as access to funds to purchase ICTs in the Global South is limited. The Global South has a large number of radios compared to the rest of the world due to their wide availability, ease of use, and limited technology needed to operate. Global South states often do not have the technological advancements in place to support more complex technology, although the use of mobile phones to access the Internet is growing.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin 376&lt;/ref&gt; Without these technologies available to citizens in states around the globe, with the most notable being Global South countries, the citizens are being put at a disadvantage from the start. Political problems such as corrupt governments, authoritarian regimes, and limited democratic functionalities, also hinder citizen participation in Global South states’ political activism because of the lack of technology available.

===Skeptics===
Some people discount the potential impacts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]: ''[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/06/masters-their-domain?page=2 Masters of Their Domain].'' June 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics include many people on the American political right, among them the lobbyist [[Grover Norquist]] of Americans for Tax Reform. Others include [[Nicholas Lemann]], Dean of the Columbia School of Journalism, who has said open-source politics may eventually be co-opted by political parties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]: ''[https://www.motherjones.com/interview/2007/07/nicholas_lemann.html Interview with Nicholas Lemann: Dean of the Columbia School of Journalism].'' June 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''planned economy''' is a type of [[economic system]] where [[investment]] and the allocation of [[capital good]]s take place according to economy-wide economic and production [[plan]]s. A planned economy may use [[Centralization|centralized]], [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized]] or [[Participatory economics| participatory]] forms of [[economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alec Nove]] (1987), "Planned Economy," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, p. 879.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Devine| first= Pat | title= Democracy and Economic Planning | publisher= Polity |date= July 26, 2010 |isbn= 978-0745634791 |page = |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''command economy''' or '''administrative command economy''' is any of the nominally-planned economies of the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;k - these terms highlight the central role of hierarchical administration in guiding the allocation of resources in these economic systems as opposed to planned coordination.&lt;ref name="The Soviet Union Has an Administered, Not a Planned, Economy, 1985"&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Soviet Union Has an Administered, Not a Planned, Economy |last= Wilhelm |first= John Howard |year= 1985 |journal= [[Europe-Asia Studies |Soviet Studies]] |pages= 118–30 |volume= 37 |issue= 1 |doi= 10.1080/09668138508411571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellman |first= Michael |chapter= The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning |title= Transition and Beyond: Essays in Honour of Mario Nuti |editor1-first= Saul |editor1-last= Estrin |editor2-first= Grzegorz W. |editor2-last= Kołodko |editor3-first= Milica |editor3-last= Uvalić |location= New York |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |year= 2007 |isbn= 0-230-54697-8 |page= 22 |quote= In the USSR in the late 1980s the system was normally referred to as the 'administrative-command' economy.

The traditional conception of [[socialism]] involves the integration of [[Social ownership| socially-owned]] economic enterprises via some form of planning with direct calculation substituting [[factor market]]s.

==Planned versus command economies==
{{Main|Economic planning}}

Planned economies contrast with ''command'' economies. A planned economy is "an economic system in which the government controls and regulates production, distribution, prices, etc."&lt;ref name="reference1"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/planned%20economy planned economy]. Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. (accessed: May 11, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; but a command economy, while also having this type of regulation, necessarily has substantial public ownership of industry.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/command%20economy command economy]. In Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (2008) (accessed May 11, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, command economies are planned economies, but not necessarily the reverse.

Most of a command economy is organized in a top-down administrative model by a central authority, where decisions regarding investment and production output requirements are decided upon at the top in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], with little input from lower levels. Advocates of economic planning have sometimes been staunch critics of these command economies. For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] believed that those at the top of the chain of command, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and who understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and therefore would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Writings 1932–33 |page= 96 |first= Leon |last= Trotsky }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historians have associated planned economies with [[Marxist-Leninist]] states and the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet economic model]], some argue{{weasel-inline|date=January 2018}} that the Soviet economic model did not actually constitute a planned economy in that a comprehensive and binding plan did not guide production and investment; therefore the further distinction of an ''administrative command economy'' emerged as a more accurate designation for the economic system that existed in the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern bloc]], highlighting the role of centralized hierarchical decision-making in the absence of popular control over the economy.&lt;ref name="The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellman |first= Michael |chapter= The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning |title= Transition and Beyond: Essays in Honour of Mario Nuti |editor1-first= Saul |editor1-last= Estrin |editor2-first= Grzegorz W. |editor2-last= Kołodko |editor3-first= Milica |editor3-last= Uvalić |location= New York |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |year= 2007 |isbn= 0-230-54697-8 |page= 22 |quote= Realization of these facts led in the 1970s and 1980s to the development of new terms to describe what had previously been (and still were in United Nations publications) referred to as the 'centrally planned economies'. In the USSR in the late 1980s the system was normally referred to as the 'administrative-command' economy. What was fundamental to this system was not the plan but the role of administrative hierarchies at all levels of decision making; the absence of control over decision making by the population...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a digital planned economy was explored in Chile in 1971-1973 with the development of [[Project Cybersyn]] and by {{ill|Alexander Kharkevich|ru|Харкевич, Александр Александрович}}, head of the Department of Technical Physics in Kiev in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csef.ru/en/politica-i-geopolitica/223/mashiny-kommunizma-pochemu-v-sssr-tak-i-ne-sozdali-svoj-internet-6983 Machine of communism. Why the USSR did not create the Internet]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kharkevich|first1= Aleksandr Aleksandrovich|title= Theory of information. The identification of the images. Selected works in three volumes. Volume 3|date= 1973|publisher= Moscow: Publishing House "Nauka", 1973. - Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

Another key point is that command economies are inherently authoritarian, whereas economic planning in general can be either [[Participatory economics| participatory and democratic]] or authoritarian. [[Indicative planning]] is a form of planning in market economies that directs the economy through incentive-based methods. Economic planning can be practiced in a decentralized manner through different government authorities. For example, in some predominately market-oriented and mixed economies,{{which?|date=September 2018}} the state utilizes economic planning in strategic industries such as the aerospace industry. Mixed economies usually employ [[macroeconomics | macroeconomic]] planning, while micro-economic affairs are left to the market and price system.

Note too the utilization of [[dirigisme]], or government direction of the economy through non-coercive means, as practiced in France and in Great Britain after the [[Second World War]]. The Swedish government planned public-housing models in a similar fashion as [[urban planning]] in a project called [[Million Programme]], implemented 1965-1974.

== History ==
{{sectstub|date=September 2018}}
In the [[Hellenistic period | Hellenistic]] and post-Hellenistic world, "compulsory state planning was the most characteristic trade condition for the [[Hellenistic Egypt | Egyptian]] countryside, for [[Indo-Greek Kingdom | Hellenistic India]], and to a lesser degree the more barbaric regions of the [[Seleucid Empire | Seleucid]], the [[Kingdom of Pergamon | Pergamenian]], the southern [[Arabia]]n, and the [[Parthian Empire | Parthian]] empires [...]."&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet-style planned economy started with [[war communism]] (1918-1921). The Soviet government founded [[Gosplan]] in 1921, but the period of the [[New Economic Policy | NEP]] intervened before regular [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union | Five-year plans]] started in 1928.

==Advantages of economic planning==

The government can harness land, labours, and capital to serve the economic objectives of the state. Consumer demand can be restrained in favor of greater capital investment for economic development in a desired pattern. In international comparisons, state-socialist nations compared favorably with capitalist nations in health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy, although the statistics concerning infant mortality are self-reported and based on varying standards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Ellman]] (2014). ''Socialist Planning.'' [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|1107427320}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4L2ZBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA372#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 372.]&lt;/ref&gt; The state can begin building a heavy industry at once in an underdeveloped economy without waiting years for capital to accumulate through the expansion of light industry, and without reliance on external financing. This is what happened in the Soviet Union during the 1930s when the government forced the share of GNP dedicated to private consumption from eighty percent to fifty percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Kennedy |title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=1987 |isbn=0-394-54674-1 |pages=322–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Soviet Union experienced massive growth in heavy industry, with a concurrent massive contraction of its agricultural sector, in both relative and absolute terms.

==Disadvantages of economic planning==

===Inefficient resource distribution: surplus and shortage===
Critics of planned economies argue that planners cannot detect consumer preferences, shortages, and surpluses with sufficient accuracy and therefore cannot efficiently co-ordinate production (in a market economy, a [[free price system]] is intended to serve this purpose). This difficulty was notably written about by economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], who referred to subtly distinct aspects of the problem as the "[[economic calculation problem]]"&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book
|title= Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth
|accessdate=2008-09-08
|last= Von Mises
|first= Ludwig

|year= 1990

|publisher= [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]
|url= http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Ludwig%20von%20Mises/Economic%20Calculation%20in%20the%20Socialist%20Commonwealth.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[local knowledge problem]]"&lt;ref name="AER519-30"&gt;Friedrich A. Hayek, "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society|The Use of Knowledge]]", ''American Economic Review''. XXXV, No. 4. pp. 519-30 (1945).&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Whereas the former stressed the theoretical underpinnings of a market economy to subjective value theory while attacking the labor theory of value, the latter argued that the only way to satisfy individuals who have a constantly changing hierarchy of needs, and are the only ones to possess their particular individual's circumstances, is by allowing those with the most knowledge of their needs to have it in their power to use their resources in a competing marketplace to meet the needs of the most consumers, most efficiently. This phenomenon is recognized as [[spontaneous order]]. Additionally, misallocation of resources would naturally ensue by redirecting capital away from individuals with direct knowledge and circumventing it into markets where a coercive monopoly influences behavior, ignoring market signals. According to Tibor R. Machan, "Without a market in which allocations can be made in obedience to the law of supply and demand, it is difficult or impossible to funnel resources with respect to actual human preferences and goals."&lt;ref name=tibor2001&gt;{{cite book |last=Machan |first=R. Tibor |url=http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817929428_xi.pdf |title=Liberty and Research and Development: Science Funding in a Free Society |chapter=Some Skeptical Reflections on Research and Development |publisher=Hoover Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8179-2942-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression of economic democracy and self-management===
Economist [[Robin Hahnel]] notes that, even if central planning overcame its inherent inhibitions of incentives and innovation, it would nevertheless be unable to maximize economic democracy and self-management, which he believes are concepts that are more intellectually coherent, consistent and just than mainstream notions of economic freedom.&lt;ref name="Hahnel, Robin 2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hahnel |first=Robin |title=The ABC's of Political Economy |location=London |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-7453-1858-4 |page=262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Says Hahnel, "Combined with a more democratic political system, and redone to closer approximate a best case version, centrally planned economies no doubt would have performed better. But they could never have delivered economic self-management, they would always have been slow to innovate as apathy and frustration took their inevitable toll, and they would always have been susceptible to growing inequities and inefficiencies as the effects of differential economic power grew. Under central planning neither planners, managers, nor workers had incentives to promote the social economic interest. Nor did impeding markets for final goods to the planning system enfranchise consumers in meaningful ways. But central planning would have been incompatible with economic democracy even if it had overcome its information and incentive liabilities. And the truth is that it survived as long as it did only because it was propped up by unprecedented totalitarian political power."&lt;ref name="Hahnel, Robin 2002"/&gt;

===Economic instability===
Studies of Eastern European planned economies in the 1950s and 1960s by both American and Eastern European economists found that, contrary to the expectations of both groups, they showed greater fluctuations in [[Output (economics)|output]] than market economies during the same period.&lt;ref name="Economic Reforms in Polish Industry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zielinski |first=J. G. |title=Economic Reforms in Polish Industry |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1973 |isbn=0-19-215323-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with socialism==
{{Main|Socialism}}
While socialism is not equivalent to economic planning or to the concept of a planned economy, an influential conception of socialism involves the replacement of capital markets with some form of economic planning in order to achieve [[ex-ante]] coordination of the economy. The goal of such an economic system would be to achieve conscious control over the economy by the population, specifically, so that the use of the [[surplus product]] is controlled by the producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feinstein|first= C.H. |title= Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth: Essays Presented to Maurice Dobb |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 1975|isbn=0-521-29007-4 |page= 174|quote=We have presented the view that planning and market mechanisms are instruments that can be used both in socialist and non-socialist societies...It was important to explode the primitive identification of central planning and socialism and to stress the instrumental character of planning.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific forms of planning proposed for socialism and their feasibility are subjects of the [[socialist calculation debate]].

== Computational economic planning ==
In their book ''Towards a New Socialism'' (1993) the computer scientist [[Paul Cockshott]] from the [[University of Glasgow]] and the economist Allin Cottrell from the [[Wake Forest University]] claim to demonstrate, in detail, how a democratically planned economy built on modern computer technology is possible and drives the thesis that it would be both economically more stable than the free market economies and also morally desirable.

In 1971, when the development of computer technology was still its early stages, the socialist [[Salvador Allende|Allende]] administration of Chile launched [[Project Cybersyn]] to install a telex machine in every corporation and organisation in the economy for the communication of economic data between firms and the government. The data was also fed into a computer simulated economy for forecasting. A control room was built for realtime observation and management of the overall economy. The prototype-stage of the project showed promise when it was used to redirect supplies around a trucker's strike&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eden Medina|title=Designing Freedom, Regulating a Nation: Socialist Cybernetics in Allende’s Chile|journal=J. Lat. Amer.

==Fictional portrayals of planned economies==
The 1888 novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' by [[Edward Bellamy]] depicts a fictional planned economy in a United States around the year 2000 which has become a socialist utopia.

[[The World State]] in Aldous Huxley's ''[[Brave New World]]'' and [[Airstrip One]] in George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' are both fictional examples of command economies, albeit with diametrically opposed aims: The former is a [[consumer economy]] designed to engender productivity while the latter is a [[shortage economy]] designed as an agent of totalitarian social control. Airstrip One is organised by the euphemistically named Ministry of Plenty.

Other literary portrayals of planned economies were [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', which was an influence on Orwell's work. Like ''Nineteen Eighty Four'', [[Ayn Rand]]'s dystopian story ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was also an artistic portrayal of a command economy that was influenced by ''We''. The difference is that it was a [[primitivist]] planned economy, as opposed to the advanced technology of ''We'' or ''[[Brave New World]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48196">'''Radio propaganda''' is [[propaganda]] aimed at influencing attitudes towards a certain cause or position, delivered through radio broadcast. The power of radio propaganda came from its revolutionary nature. The radio, like later technological advances in the media, allowed information to be transmitted quickly and uniformly to vast populations. Internationally, the radio was an early and powerful recruiting tool for propaganda campaigns.

Before [[television]], radio was by far the most effective way to prevent or promote social change. In many areas, it still is. Radio propaganda can be broadcast over great distances to a large audience at a relatively low cost. Through radio, a propagandist can bring his voice and all the persuasive power of his emotions to millions of people.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is used in every war employing radio propaganda: aside from convincing those on the home front of the necessity of war, a different kind of propaganda must be directed towards the enemy. Radio became a powerful [[propaganda]] tool because it ignored national borders and made enemy lines more accessible. One of the most common ways hosts got the civilian and enemy populations to listen to their broadcasts was by dropping leaflets from hot air balloons or airplanes. Most programs were broadcast on selected stations at certain times of the day; the dropped leaflets explained exactly when and where the broadcasts could be heard.

==World War II==
The use of radio as a wartime propaganda tool was made famous during World War II by broadcasting organizations such as [[Voice of America]] and by shows such as [[Tokyo Rose]], [[Axis Sally]], and [[Lord Haw Haw]].

=== Nazi Germany ===
The radio was an important tool of the [[Nazi propaganda]] efforts and it has been argued that it was the Nazis who pioneered the use of what was still a relatively new technology. A few months after the break out of World War II, German propagandists were transmitting no less than eleven hours a day of programs, offering most of them in English as well.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year of Nazi propaganda programming, broadcasters attempted to destroy pro-British feeling rather than arouse pro-German sentiment. These propagandists targeted certain groups, including capitalists, Jews, and selected newspapers/politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, pg. 207&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1940, the Nazis had abandoned all attempts to win American sympathy and the tone of German radio broadcasts towards the [[United States]] had become critical.

German propaganda minister, [[Joseph Goebbels]], was well aware of the necessity to seize every opportunity to benefit and promote the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester, pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Goebbels claimed the radio was the "eighth great power" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Propaganda Archive|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb56.htm|work=The Radio as the Eight Great Power|publisher=Joseph Goebbels|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he, along with the Nazi party, recognized the power of the radio in the propaganda machine of Nazi Germany. Recognizing the importance of radio in disseminating the Nazi message, Goebbels approved a mandate whereby millions of cheap radio sets were subsidized by the government and distributed to German citizens. It was Goebbels' job to propagate the anti-Bolshevik statements of Hitler and aim them directly at neighboring countries with German-speaking minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pg. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In Goebbels' "Radio as the Eighth Great Power" speech, he proclaimed:

: “It would not have been possible for us to take power or to use it in the ways we have without the radio...It is no exaggeration to say that the German revolution, at least in the form it took, would have been impossible without the airplane and the radio…[Radio] reached the entire nation, regardless of class, standing, or religion. That was primarily the result of the tight centralization, the strong reporting, and the up-to-date nature of the German radio.”

As well as domestic broadcasts, the Nazi regime used the radio to deliver its message to both occupied territories and enemy states. One of the main targets was the [[United Kingdom]] to which [[William Joyce]] broadcast regularly, gaining him the nickname “[[Lord Haw-Haw]]” in the process. Broadcasts were also made to the [[United States]], notably through [[Robert Henry Best]] and 'Axis Sally', [[Mildred Gillars]].

===Great Britain===
British propaganda during the [[First World War]] set a new benchmark that inspired the fascist and socialist regimes during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]; Marshal Paul von Hindenburg stated, “This English propaganda was a new weapon, or rather a weapon which had never been employed on such a scale and so ruthlessly in the past.”&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; It was clear that large numbers of civilians could be mobilized for a massive war effort through persuasive techniques derived from the emerging disciplines of behavioral psychology and social sciences.

An example of effective radio propaganda by the [[United States]] for [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] is the news reports of [[Edward R. Murrow]]. When the United Kingdom stood alone to face the German onslaught in the autumn of 1940, Murrow covered the [[Battle of Britain]] and particularly the nightly [[The Blitz|bombing raids]] on [[London]]. His reports described the falling of the bombs, their impact, and the destruction they brought.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Murrow developed his own inimitable style, known for its colourful, vivid imagery. Neither melancholy nor soapy, his reports were so rich in detail and description that listeners could almost smell the fumes from the fires burning in the streets of London and feel the heat emanating from the smoldering ruins. Without question, this was radio reporting at its best, and there was also no doubt about its impact. As he described his approach to a London newspaper in 1941, “The official news is perhaps less important than the more intimate stories of life, work, and sacrifice.”&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Murrow kept his focus squarely on the common man and how to reach him. He wanted to let the world know that the United Kingdom was fighting a “people’s war,” not a war for its colonies, as the American isolationists charged.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted Americans to know that the UK was standing tall, united in its cause and protecting Western liberties and European civilisation. He wanted Americans to see the UK as their natural ally and hurry to extend a helping hand. Because of his reputation and impact, Murrow’s role evolved into much more than that of a broadcaster. Many say he had far greater influence than the American ambassador to London; “He was an ambassador, in a double role, representing Britain in America as well as America in Britain.... He was a diplomat without a portfolio, a spokesman for a cause.” &lt;ref&gt;Horten&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Historians believe the moment when American radio made its debut as the preeminent means of foreign news was the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938. Early that month, Hitler began implementing his plans to dominate Europe by demanding self-determination for Germans living in a region of Czechoslovakia known as the [[Sudetenland]]. He left few doubts that he meant to annex the Sudetenland as part of an enlarged [[German Reich]]. High-level negotiations ensued, during which Britain’s Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], journeyed to Germany three times in less than three weeks in a desperate attempt to save the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Fearful that a European war would once again entangle them, Americans became glued to their radios for daily and sometimes hourly updates and interpretations of the latest developments of the crisis. Within a couple of days, American listeners were bombarded with news programs, special news bulletins, and expert commentary on the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg.22&lt;/ref&gt;

America’s first real venture into international broadcasting was in 1940 after Nazi victories in Europe, when the Roosevelt administration was becoming increasingly concerned about the effects of Nazi propaganda, both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1940, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order establishing the Office of Coordination of Commercial and Cultural Relations to promote the use of government/private radio, and the [[Office of the Coordinator of Information]]. By 1942, the most famous radio program airing overseas became known as the “[[Voice of America]].” Even before the [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], the U.S. government's Office of the Coordinator of Information began providing war news and commentary to commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Walter|title=The Voice of America:Origins and Recollections|year=2009|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular government wartime radio show, performed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], was known as "fireside chats". Two of the most famous programs on the radio show were entitled "On National Security" and "On the Declaration of War with Japan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fireside Chats|url=http://www.history.com/topics/fireside-chats|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The Arsenal of Democracy” was a slogan coined by President Roosevelt during his national security radio broadcast delivered on December 29, 1940. Roosevelt promised to help [[Great Britain]] fight Nazi Germany by providing them with military supplies in a program known as [[Lend-Lease]], while the United States stayed out of the actual fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Arsenal of Democracy|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrarsenalofdemocracy.html|publisher=American Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement was made a year before the attacks on [[Pearl Harbor]], at a time when Germany had occupied much of Europe and threatened Great Britain. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt delivered his famous [[Infamy Speech]] to the [[United States]], which was broadcast to the American people. The President called for a formal declaration of war on the [[Empire of Japan]]. The Infamy Speech was brief, running to just a little over seven minutes, and Roosevelt made a point of emphasizing that the United States and her interests were in grave danger. In so doing, he sought to end the [[isolationist]] stance the United States had previously been advocating concerning involvement in the war. The overall tone of the speech was one of determined [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. Roosevelt made no attempt to glaze over the extensive damage that had been caused to the American armed forces, noting the number of American lives lost in the attack. However, he emphasized his confidence in the strength of the America to face the challenge posed by Japan.

[[File:FDRfiresidechat2.jpg|thumb|right|FDR "fireside" chats.]]

:“Yesterday, December 7th, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy - the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.”

:“As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense, that always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.”

:“Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our interests are in grave danger. With confidence in our armed forces, with the un-bounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph. So help us God.”

:President Franklin D. Roosevelt - December 8, 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For a Declaration of War|url=http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/fdr-infamy.htm|publisher=The History Place: Great Speeches Collection|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this declaration of war, radio became part of the propaganda campaign. Throughout the war, the attack on Pearl Harbor was frequently used in [[American propaganda]]. Direct wartime programming began shortly after the United States entry into the war. The first live broadcast to Germany, called ''Stimmen aus Amerika'' ("Voices from America") took place on Feb 1, 1942. It was introduced by "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" and included the pledge: "Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war.... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Walter|title=The Voice of America: Origins and Recollations|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html|publisher=American Diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] created a number of radio shows for American GIs stationed overseas.  The most popular of these "mosquito networks" was [[GI Jive]].  In Agra, India, [[Virginia C. Claudon Allen]] broadcast nightly to counter [[Tokyo Rose]].

===Famous radio shows===
During [[World War II]], American [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] in both the Pacific and European theaters of war heard anonymous voices on the radio playing carefully selected American music and extolling the virtues of Japanese and Nazi causes. The [[Disc jockey|DJs]] continuously encouraged GIs to stop fighting and constantly made false claims of American defeats and Japanese or Nazi victories. They frequently referred to specific American units and individuals by name, and in rare cases mentioned the names of loved ones back home. GIs dubbed the voice from Japan "[[Tokyo Rose]]"; two popular voices from Germany were "Axis Sally" and “[[Lord Haw-Haw]]”.

"Tokyo Rose": After being stranded in Japan while visiting her sick aunt after the United States refused to let her reenter the country after the attack on Pearl Harbor, [[Iva Toguri]] wound up at [[Radio Tokyo]] as a typist, preparing English-language scripts drafted by Japanese authorities for broadcast to the Allied troops in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Radio Tokyo, Toguri met captured Australian Major Charles Cousens and his associates, American Captain Wallace Ince and Filipino Lieutenant Normando Reyes. A supporter of the Allies in the war, she was delighted to meet soldiers who had been fighting for her side. Put off by her overt friendliness and pro-Americanism, the POWs initially suspected her of being a [[Kempeitai]] spy, but over the next few months they eventually came to trust her. When Radio Tokyo directed Cousens to include a woman DJ in his Zero Hour program, he asked for Toguri by name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their capture and conscription into Radio Tokyo, the Allied POWs had waged a covert campaign to sabotage the Japanese propaganda effort through the use of on-air innuendos, satire, and sarcastic, rushed or muffled readings. Now they had to bring a fourth party into the conspiracy, and the only person they could trust to support their efforts was Toguri. She was dubbed with the name "Tokyo Rose" and listeners came to know her by that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iva Toguri mug shot.jpg|thumb|right|Iva Toguri "Tokyo Rose".]]

After the war, the Army Counter Intelligence Corps, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and the press continued to refer to Toguri by that name as she was taken into custody and brought to trial. Those defending Toguri stated that she was clearly "forced" to broadcast for the Japanese and was always a loyal American, shown by her many attempts to return home, which were continuously rejected. They also pointed to the lack of "tangible" evidence; American investigators never discovered any Japanese documents with the name "[[Tokyo Rose]]" because "[[Tokyo Rose]]" was a name coined by American GIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the [[United States Constitution]], [[treason]] is the act of providing "aid and comfort" to an enemy. It does not say that force, loneliness, trickery, coercion, or fright are mitigating factors in favor of traitors. On October 6, 1949, Toguri was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $10,000. She served less than half that time and was pardoned by President [[Gerald Ford]].

"Axis Sally" was the pseudonym of [[Mildred Gillars]], an American broadcaster employed by the [[Third Reich]] in Nazi Germany to proliferate propaganda during World War II. By 1941, the [[U.S. State Department]] advised American nationals to return home, but Gillars chose to stay in Germany after her fiancé, a German citizen named Paul Karlson, refused to marry her if she returned to the United States. Shortly afterwards, Karlson was sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], where he died in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axis Sally: The American behind the Alluring Voice|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Richard Lucas|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 she obtained work as an announcer with the ''Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft'' (RRG), German State Radio. On December 7, 1941, Gillars was working in the studio when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was announced. She broke down in front of her colleagues and announced her allegiance to the East. However, since she decided to stay in Germany, Gillar was faced with the prospect of joblessness or prison, so she produced a written oath of allegiance to Germany and returned to work, her duties being limited to announcing records and participating in chat shows. She soon acquired several names amongst her GI listeners, including Berlin Bitch, Berlin Babe, Olga, and Sally, but the one that became most common was “Axis Sally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axis Sally: The American behind the Alluring Voice|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Richard Lucas|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AxisSallyMugshot.jpg|thumb|right|Mildred Gillars "Axis Sally".]]

Her most successful show was known as ''Home Sweet Home''. ''Home Sweet Home'' attempted to exploit the fears of American soldiers about the home front. The broadcasts were designed to make the soldiers cast doubt on their mission, their leaders, and their prospects after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axis Sally, "The Greatest Generation," and Generation Y|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Ann Elizabeth Pfau|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another show was known as ''Midge at the Mike'', broadcast to late fall 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Axis Sally|journal=FoIA record|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillar played American songs interspersed with defeatist propaganda and anti-Semitic rhetoric, as well as ''G.I.’s Letter box and Medical Reports'' in 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Axis Sally|journal=FoIA record|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Gillars used information on wounded and captured U.S. airmen to cause fear and worry in their families. She was convicted of treason by the United States in 1949 following her capture in post-war Berlin. Her arrest came about after the U.S. attorney general specially dispatched prosecutor Victor C. Woerheide to Berlin to find and arrest Gillars. He only had one solid lead: Raymond Kurtz, a B-17 pilot shot down by the Germans, recalled that a woman who had visited his prison camp seeking interviews was the broadcaster. Gillars was indicted on September 10, 1948, and charged with 10 counts of treason, but only eight were presented at her trial, which began on January 25, 1949. The prosecution relied on the large number of her programs recorded by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to demonstrate her active participation in propaganda activities against the United States. It was also shown that she had made an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=True to the Red, White, &amp; Blue|journal=TIME Magazine|date=Mar 7, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

"Lord Haw-Haw" was a pseudonym for [[William Joyce]], German radio's most prominent English-language speaker. He hosted a propaganda show on a radio program called ''Germany Calling'', broadcast by Nazi German radio to audiences in Great Britain on the station
''Reichssender Hamburg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M.|first=Doherty|title=Nazi Wireless Propaganda: Lord Haw-Haw and British Public Opinion in the Second World War|year=2000|publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program started on September 18, 1939 and continued until April 30, 1945, when [[Hamburg]] was overrun by the British Army. Through his broadcasts, the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] attempted to discourage and demoralize British, Canadian, Australian, and American troops and the British population within radio range to suppress the effectiveness of the Allied war effort through propaganda and to motivate the Allies to agree to peace terms leaving the Nazi regime intact and in power. The Nazi broadcasts prominently reported on the shooting down of Allied aircraft and the sinking of Allied ships, presenting discouraging reports of high losses and casualties among Allied forces. Although listening to his broadcasts was highly discouraged, many Britons did indeed tune into them. In 1940, at the height of his influence, Joyce had an estimated 6 million regular and 18 million occasional listeners in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weider History Group|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Axis Sally: The Americans Behind That Alluring Voice|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war, Joyce was captured by British forces at [[Flensburg]], near the German border with [[Denmark]]. Spotting a dishevelled figure resting from gathering firewood, intelligence soldiers engaged him in conversation, asked if he was Joyce, and when he reached in his pocket for his false passport, the soldiers, believing he was armed, shot him in the buttocks, leaving four wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Martin|title=Geoffrey Perry|year=2009|publisher=The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce was charged on the basis that, even though he had misstated his nationality to gain possession of a British passport, until it expired this entitled him to British diplomatic protection in Germany, and therefore he owed allegiance to the King of England at the time he commenced working for the Germans. Joyce was convicted and sentenced to death on September 19, 1945.

==Cold War==
By 1946, it became clear to the United States that the [[Soviet Union]] did not share the American vision of postwar collaboration for peace in Europe. Soviet authorities began to install Communist regimes in liberated territories of [[Eastern Europe]], a direct violation of the provisions in the [[Teheran Conference|Teheran]] and [[Yalta Conference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The radio became crucial in the propaganda war between the two blocs and was the main concern of both participants’ information agencies as the “war of ideas” began. In 1948, the Soviet Union organized the Communist Information Bureau ([[Cominform]]), which was formed to unite the Communist states in forthcoming struggle against “Anglo-American Imperialism.” &lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest responses in Europe was known as [[Radio in the American Sector]] (RIAS). RIAS was established in 1946 to serve the American sector in [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The station's importance was magnified during the 1948 Berlin blockade, when it carried the message of Allied determination to resist Soviet intimidation. In East Germany, broadcasts included news, commentary, and cultural programs that were unavailable in the controlled media of the [[German Democratic Republic]]. The management of RIAS developed many of the techniques later used to develop [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The RIAS broadcasts concentrated on the idea of democracy and the importance of the breakdown of the international communications barriers erected by the Communists. The programming was generally geared towards “special groups” within the East German population, including youth, women, farmers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcast became known as the “bridge” from West to East Germany over the [[Berlin Wall]].

Aside from RIAS, [[Voice of America]] (VOA) began broadcasting in 1947 in the Soviet Union for the first time as a part of U.S. foreign policy to fight the propaganda of the Soviet Union and other countries. Initially, there was only one hour per day of news and other features broadcast on the pretext of countering "more harmful instances of Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union responded by initiating aggressive, electronic jamming of Voice of America broadcasts on April 24, 1949. This led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. However, after the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cold War Impact of VOA Broadcasts|journal=Hoover Institution and the Cold War International History Project of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many acknowledged the importance of propaganda as an instrument of foreign policy, it was primarily the Cold War that institutionalized propaganda as a permanent instrument of U.S. foreign policy. The Soviets suddenly increased the tempo of the war, by taking over Czechoslovakia and attempting to take complete control of Berlin. Realizing there was no further hope of considering the Soviet Union as an ally, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] was formed in April 1949, establishing the policy of containment of Communism as the organization's priority. The escalation of the Cold War intensified America’s interest in broadcasting and information policy.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The world was entering into a new era of foreign relations; therefore, the [[United States National Security Council]] produced a study in 1949 that concluded that there was a need for the United States to have a major information program to counter Soviet aggression. The council issued document 10/2, approved by President Truman in June 1948, authorizing a comprehensive program of clandestine warfare, including [[black propaganda]], [[psychological warfare]], [[subversion]], assistance to underground resistance movements, paramilitary operations, and [[economic warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous form of anti-Soviet propaganda was the development of Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL), which broadcast to Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  The stations' purpose, above all, was fighting a political mission against [[Communism]] and Sovietism, against the representatives of the terrorist regimes. Its job was to mask Communist plans and expose all of those who were propagandist of Communist ideology. While other countries established international broadcasting entities, RFE/RL’s purpose was to change the form of government in foreign nations by airing news not about the country from which the broadcasts originated, but about the countries that were the targets of the broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

President Harry Truman announced in 1950 that the United States would launch an information program known as the “Campaign of Truth.” The name was strategically picked to avoid any connotation of propaganda. The goals of the campaign included:
:1) Establish a “healthy international community” with confidence in American leadership.
:2) Present America fairly and counter “all the misrepresentations.”
:3) Discourage further Soviet encroachment by showing that American is desirous of peace but is prepared for war.
:4) Help “to roll back Soviet influence” by all means short of force, making captive people feel that they can identify with the West, weakening the morale of the Soviet military personnel, and encouraging non-Communist forces.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1950, RFE/RL began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, becoming more than a "mouthpiece for exiles."&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Teams of journalists were hired for each language service and an elaborate system of intelligence gathering provided up-to-date broadcast material. Most of this material came from a network of well-connected [[émigrés]] and interviews with travelers and defectors. The Communist regimes devoted considerable resources to countering Western broadcasts. They organized radio jamming on a massive scale, spending more on jamming than the West did on broadcasting. They placed spies in Western radio stations in an attempt to disrupt information sharing and organize [[counterpropaganda]], while also attempting to gain access to top level officials who could provide them with information controlled by [[Western media outlets]] or intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;Parta, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; These countermeasures by foreign regimes significantly drained domestic resources, and failed to neutralize Western broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Parta, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, the practice of propaganda became inextricably tied to the practices of [[psychological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, psychological warfare was largely seen as an accessory to military operations, but during the Cold War psychological warfare was utilized to influence public opinion and advance foreign policy interests. Psychological warfare became, in essence, a synonym for the Cold War. It reflected the belief that the Cold War was an ideological, psychological, and cultural contest for hearts and minds that would be won or lost on the plain of public opinion. When President John F. Kennedy took office, his administration had a greater interest in the U.S. information effort than any other president up until that time.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; With Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]’s address to the Soviet Central Committee in 1961, U.S. leaders believed the Soviet Union would be ready to seek a more limited form of conflict, emphasizing their winning of hearts and minds. The United States saw this as a good sign to use psychological resources to their advantage. However, these components of propaganda were put on hold with the [[Bay of Pigs]] scandal, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and the abrupt end of the Kennedy Administration.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnam==
The first Vietnamese-language radio transmission was made on September 2, 1945, when [[Ho Chi Minh]] read out the Declaration of Independence. Prior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the French colonial government, which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s. Vietnam's national radio station, now called the Voice of Vietnam, started broadcasting from [[Hanoi]] the week after declaration of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], stating, "This is the Voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.” During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of [[North Vietnam]]. Following reunification, all radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.

"Hanoi Hannah" or Trịnh Thị Ngọ, was a Vietnamese radio personality best known for her work during the Vietnam War, when she made English-language broadcasts for North Vietnam directed at U.S. troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for Hanoi Hannah|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html|work=Don North|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, Ngo became famous among U.S. soldiers for her [[propaganda]] broadcasts on Radio Hanoi. She made three broadcasts a day, reading the list of the newly killed or imprisoned Americans, attempting to persuade U.S. GIs that the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral and playing popular U.S. anti-war songs in an attempt to incite feelings of nostalgia and homesickness amongst U.S. troops. Although she used the alias Thu Huong, the GIs usually called her "[[Hanoi Hannah]]" or "the Dragon Lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for Hanoi Hannah|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html|work=Don North|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few were believed to have been influenced by her propaganda work and the soldiers often mocked her tactics, but they were also impressed by her military intelligence, especially when she mentioned the location of their own unit or listed specific U.S. casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for Hanoi Hannah|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html|work=Don North|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, she returned to live in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] with her husband where her voice was better known in the U.S. than in her own country.

==Iraq and Afghanistan==
The United States took the lead in broadcasting [[psychological operations]] due to its superior technology and its ability to use aircraft to broadcast AM, FM and shortwave radio from directly above target audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBSNEWS|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-533414.|work=U.S. Propaganda Push in Iraq|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; America had dropped battery or crank-powered radios on third-world nations like [[Haiti]] so that the populace could hear U.S. broadcasts. In the more recent struggles in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], the United States distributed various battery and solar-powered satellite radios so that its story could be heard. The U.S. also dropped leaflets to inform Afghans about the attacks of September 11 and the Taliban, and to infiltrate Iraq with information on anti-Saddam radio programs that would be broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBSNEWS|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-533414.|work=U.S. Propaganda Push in Iraq|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Navy 030313-N-0000X-002 Coalition aircraft have been dropping leaflets encouraging Iraqis to listen for news broadcasts on special radio channels.jpg|thumb|right|Leaflets dropped by aircraft encouraging Iraqis to listen for news broadcasts on special radio channels.]]

In the 2001 [[invasion of Afghanistan]], [[psychological operations]] (PSYOP) tactics were employed to demoralize the [[Taliban]] and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six [[EC-130E Commando Solo]] aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages even before the United States invaded Afghanistan. The primary PSYOP objectives were used to counter adversarial propaganda, to discourage interference with humanitarian affairs activities, to support objectives against state and non-state supporters and sponsors of terrorism, and to disrupt support for and relationships among terrorist organizations. In Afghanistan, the U.S. military has long conducted propaganda campaigns to try to sway public opinion against insurgents. Today (2013), the U.S. is teaching Afghan army units how to counter Taliban propaganda, especially with local radio broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Current News Early Bird|url=http://214.14.134.30/ebird2/ebfiles/e20121105910138.html|work=U.S. Handoff In Afghanistan Includes Radio Training|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is to counter the Taliban-sponsored stations, so called "Mullah Radios," that operate mainly in the tribal areas along the Pakistani border and broadcast propaganda that helps turn public opinion against foreign troops and the pro-Western Afghan government. Radio is key to reaching the majority of Afghans; with only limited access to television, newspapers, and the Internet, most depend on radio programs for information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston.com|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2010/09/17/us_radio_takes_on_taliban_in_afghan_propaganda_war/|work=U.S. Radio takes on Taliban in Afghan Propaganda War|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Iraq War]], the U.S. implemented "[[black propaganda]]" by creating false radio personalities who disseminated pro-American information, but were supposedly supporters of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Radio Tikrit was a radio station in Iraq that broadcast programs that reflected strong support for the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and his government. The station's name is also the name of the Iraqi town where Saddam and other members of his government were born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schleifer|first=Ron|title=Reconstructing Iraq: Winning the Propaganda War in Iraq|year=2005|publisher=Middle East Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tone of Radio Tikrit's programs began to change dramatically; one show reportedly described Iraqis as being so poor that they had to sell their windows and doors. Another broadcast reported to have encouraged Iraqi soldiers to refuse the "orders of the tyrant" and to "be brave before it is too late,” suggesting that the United States may have infiltrated the station. The U.S. was also successful with the Voice of America efforts once the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Sol|title=A Strategic Failure: American Information Control Policy in Occupied Iraq|year=2008|publisher=Military Review|pages=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice of America==
[[File:Voice of America Logo.svg|thumb|right|Official logo for Voice of America.]]

Voice of America, The Voice, or VOA is the official external broadcast institution of the United States federal government, sponsoring programming for broadcast on the radio, television, and the Internet outside of the U.S. in 43 languages. Currently, VOA produces about 1,500 hours of news and feature programming each week to global audience in order, "to promote freedom and democracy and to enhance understanding through multimedia communication of accurate, objective, and balanced news, information and other programming about America and the world to audiences overseas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Board of Governors|url=http://www.bbg.gov/about-the-agency/|work=About the Agency: Our Mission|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under § 501 of the [[Smith–Mundt Act]] of 1948, the Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens until July 2013&lt;ref name=chuck_nbc_2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/20/19502580-taxpayer-money-at-work-us-funded-foreign-broadcasts-finally-available-in-the-us|title=Taxpayer money at work: US-funded foreign broadcasts finally available in the US|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck|publisher=NBC News|date=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was repealed in the ''Smith-Mundt Modernization Act'' provision of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013|National Defense Authorization Act for 2013]].&lt;ref name="smma"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hudson|first=John|title=U.S. Repeals Propaganda Ban, Spreads Government-Made News to Americans|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/12/us_backs_off_propaganda_ban_spreads_government_made_news_to_americans|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the legislation was to protect the American public from [[propaganda]] actions by its own government.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 1976, the principles were signed into law by President [[Gerald Ford]]:
:“The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts:
:1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive.
:2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.
:3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.”

Today, the VOA operates shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at one site in the [[United States]] close to Greenville, North Carolina. The 44 languages that [[Voice of America]] currently broadcasts in include (TV broadcasts are marked with an asterisk):

From 1942 to 1945, VOA was part of the [[Office of War Information]], from 1945 to 1953, a function of the [[State Department]], and in 1953 it was placed under the [[U.S. Information Agency]]. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, the VOA was placed under the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), where the control remains today. The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference.

In 1994, Voice of America became the first broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet in English and 44 other languages, using more than 20,000 servers across 71 countries. Since many listeners in Africa and other areas still receive much of their information via radio and have only limited access to computers, VOA continues to maintain regular shortwave-radio broadcasts.

==Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty==
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is a broadcaster funded by the [[United States Congress]] that provides news, information, and analysis to countries in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], and the [[Middle East]]  "where the free flow of information is either banned by government authorities or not fully developed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://www.rferl.org/section/FAQ/777.html#section5|work=Fast Facts|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RFE/RL is supervised by the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]], alongside [[Voice of America]].

Founded as an anti-Communist propaganda source during the Cold War, RFE/RL was headquartered in [[Munich]], Germany, from 1949 to 1995. In 1995, the headquarters were moved to [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]], where operations have been significantly reduced since the end of the Cold War. In addition to the headquarters, the service maintains 20 local bureaus in countries throughout their broadcast region, including a corporate office in [[Washington, D.C.]] RFE/RL broadcasts in 28 languages to 21 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://flashvideo.rferl.org/Flashmaps/en-US/coverageOneWin/default.htm|work=Fast Facts|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Iraq]].

RFE/RL was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; American policymakers such as [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]] and [[John Foster Dulles]] acknowledged that the Cold War was essentially a “war of ideas”.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]], acting through the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], funded a long list of projects to counter the Communist appeal in Europe and the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The missions of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] were separate from [[Voice of America]] in the sense that VOA was meant to be the voice of America, reflecting American foreign policy and disseminating world news from an official American viewpoint, whereas RFE/RL has the mission of captivating people and stimulating non-cooperation in Communist countries.

The '''Third Socialist Workers' Congress of France''' was held in [[Marseille]], France, in 1879. At this congress the socialist leaders rejected both cooperation and anarchism, both of which would allow the existing regime to continue, and adopted a program based on collectivism. The congress also adopted a motion that women should have equal rights to men, but several delegates felt that essentially woman's place was in the home. The congress has been called a triumph of [[Guesdism]] and the birthplace of French Marxist [[socialism]], but both claims are open to question.
The attendees soon split into rival groups with disparate beliefs.

==Location==

The Third Socialist Workers' Congress was held in Marseille on 20–31 October 1879.{{sfn|Fortescue|2017|p=87}}
It was held in the Salle des Folies-Bergères.{{sfn|Frader|2008|p=304}}{{efn|Block 12 in the Rue de la République, Marseille, was built in 1866 by the architects Hilaire Curtil and Eric Buyron to house a casino, and later became the Folies Bergères music hall. After being rented to the Third National Workers Congress in 1879, in 1883 it was transformed into the Palace of Industry. In 1988 it became a multi-level indoor parking garage. The staircase has survived.{{sfn|Ilot 12 de la rue de la République}} }}
The Marseilles Congress followed the Congress of Lyon of 1878, and was the most important socialist congress in France before 1889 in terms of attendance, resolutions and its effect on the socialist party's constitution.{{sfn|Lafargue|1897|pp=445–458}}
The congress was followed by the 1880 Congress of Le Havre.{{sfn|Mayeur|Rebirioux|1987|p=74}}

==Collectivism==
[[File:Jules Guesde, by Nadar.jpg|thumb|[[Jules Guesde]]  could not attend in person, but his motion was adopted.]]
[[Jules Guesde]] was a former anarchist who had converted to Marxism in 1876.{{sfn|Gildea|2014|p=34}}
Guesde was sick and bedridden in Paris at the time of the congress, but was represented by two jewelry workers, Jean Lombard of Marseille and Eugène Fournière of Paris.{{sfn|Willard|1991|p=34}}
A motion composed by Guesde was moved by the delegates from Paris and carried by a large majority.{{sfn|Lafargue|1897|pp=445–458}}
It was:
{{quote|Property is the one social question. Seeing that the present system of property is opposed to those equal rights that will condition the society of the future; that it is unjust and inhuman that some should produce everything and others nothing, and that it is precisely the latter who have all the wealth, all the enjoyment, and all the privilege; seeing that this state of affairs will not be put an end to by the good-will of those whose whole interest lies in its continuance; the Congress adopts as its end and aim the collective ownership of the soil, the subsoil, the instruments of labour, raw materials, and would render them for ever inalienable from that society to which they ought to return.{{sfn|Lafargue|1897|pp=445–458}} }}
The congress adopted a Marxist program and supported collectivism by 73 votes to 27.{{sfn|Mayeur|Rebirioux|1987|p=74}}
The collectivists rejected efforts to found cooperatives as being petty bourgeois and covert capitalism.{{sfn|Monthoux|1993|p=205}}
The delegates were also opposed to cooperation and to anarchism, both of which left the status quo undisturbed, and declared themselves in favor of political action.{{sfn|Lafargue|1897|pp=445–458}}
The congress has been described as a triumph of Guesdism, but in fact was a triumph of collectivism, which Guesde's opponents [[Paul Brousse]] and [[Benoît Malon]] also supported.{{sfn|Wright|2017|p=117}}

==Foundation of the Socialist Party==

The suppression of the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871 was a severe blow to socialism in France, and for several years afterwards workers were reluctant to get involved in politics.
At the congresses of Paris (1876), Lyon (1878) and Marseille (1879) only working men could speak and vote, and discussion of politics was banned.
However Guesde wanted to organize a political party.
He claimed that unlike conventional parties the new party would serve the interests of the workers rather than the ambitions of the party leaders.{{sfn|Gildea|2014|p=34}}
The congress decided that the proletariat should separate itself from all the bourgeois parties and form a new party.{{sfn|Lafargue|1897|pp=445–458}}
At first the party represented artisans such as hatters and shoemakers, but not weavers, miners or foundry workers.{{sfn|Gildea|2014|p=34}}
The new party had to compete for the attention of the workers with the [[Blanquism|Blanquist]]s, the [[Anarchism|Anarchist]]s, after 1881 with the [[Possibilism (politics)|Possiblist]]s, and after 1890 with the [[Jean Allemane|Allemanist]]s.{{sfn|Bury|2003|p=135}}

Although the launch of the Parti Ouvrier (Party of Labour) by the 1879 congress has been treated by socialist and communist historians as the date when Marxist socialism was born in France, the new "party" was a loosely defined movement dominated by anti-political anarchists and anti-socialist radicals, with few members with recognizably Marxist views. It was only between the congress and the 1882 split that Guesde and Lafargue developed hardline Marxist positions.{{sfn|Stuart|2002|p=32}}
The party suffered from internal disagreements from the start.
Anarchists such as [[Jean Grave]] disliked political involvement of any type, while Brousse was suspicious of Guesde's Marxist authoritarianism and thought the nationalization program would lead to a socialist dictatorship.{{sfn|Gildea|2014|p=34}}{{efn|There is disagreement among the sources about the sequence of events.
[[Robert Gildea]] writes that the  [[French Workers' Party]] (POF: Parti Ouvrier Français) was launched at the 1879 congress, and that Brousse won a majority against the Guesdists at the 1882 party conference and founded the [[Federation of the Socialist Workers of France]] (FTSF: Fédération des travailleurs socialistes de France).{{sfn|Gildea|2014|p=34}}
[[Julian Wright (academic)|Julian Wright]] states that the split was formalized at the 1882 congress, which was controlled by Malon, when the Guesidists left to set up their separate group.{{sfn|Wright|2017|p=117}}
[[Rudolf Rocker]] writes that the Fédération des Travailleurs came into being from the 1879 congress, controlled by the collectivists.
The movement split at the Congress of Saint Étienne in 1883 with Guesde's followers forming the Parti Ouvrier Français supported by the Fédération Nationale des Syndicats and Brousse's followers forming the Parti Ouvrier Révolutionaire Socialiste Français supported by the Fédération des Bourse du Travail de France. The Allemanists later broke away from the Broussists.{{sfn|Rocker|2004|p=89}}
Other groups were the Blanquists of the [[Central Revolutionary Committee]] (CRC: Comité Révolutionaire Central) and Malon's Independent Socialists.{{sfn|Rocker|2004|p=90}} }}

==Women's rights ==
[[File:Les Contemporains N 15 Hubertine Auclerc.jpg|thumb|Hubertine Auclerc attacking the fortress of Men's Rights, by Alfred Le Petit from ''Les Contemporains'' (1881)]]
Some of the delegates defended the concept of the family wage, and argued against women's wage labour.{{sfn|Frader|Rose|1996|p=152}}
One delegate said "woman's place is in the home, where so many daily concerns call her, and not in a factory or workshop ... The young girl should never learn any trade except those which, later, when she has become a wife and a mother, she can carry out in the home."{{sfn|Walsh|2017|p=93}}
[[Isidore Finance]], who represented the building painters of Paris, urged "tough-fisted and hardheaded workingmen ... to demand a wage that is not simply the equivalent to the product of their labours, but sufficient to keep women and the aged at home."{{sfn|Frader|Rose|1996|p=152}}

[[Hubertine Auclert]] made passionate pleas for women's rights, but argued that they needed economic independence due to their "natural" motherhood.{{sfn|Frader|Rose|1996|p=152}}
Auclert was on a special committee to consider the equality of women, and was given an hour to speak to the congress on this subject.
After her speech she was invited to head a committee to prepare a statement on women's rights.
This statement, which said women should have the same social, legal, political and working rights as men was approved by the congress.{{sfn|Fortescue|2017|p=87}}

{{Taxation}}
A '''steering tax''' (Often an ''Ecological incentive tax'') is a tax which aims to change the behaviour of the tax payer, as defined by lawmakers, and not particularly to increase tax revenue. The term is not sharply definable because many tax related laws influence buyer behaviour which is not always a wanted effect ([[Price elasticity of demand|compensation reaction]]). The [[Pigovian tax]] is a special case of a steering tax to avoid [[Negative externalities|negative Externality]]. An [[ecological tax reform]] is often understood to refer to the introduction of a steering tax on energy use, according to the [[Polluter pays principle]].&lt;ref name="Lenkungsabgaben_2007"&gt;René L. Frey, (2007). [http://www.bafu.admin.ch/publikationen/publikation/00047/index.html?lang=de "Grundzüge eines ressourcenoptimalen Steuersystems für die Schweiz - Lenkungsabgaben"] Umwelt-Wissen Nr. 0710. [[Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications]] – Bundesamt für Umwelt (Nummer UW-0710-D), Bern. (35 pages, German text, abstracts in English, French and Italien).&lt;/ref&gt;

In other languages incentive taxes (or fees) are known as "''[[:de:Lenkungsabgabe (Schweiz)|de:Lenkungsabgabe]]''" or "''Lenkungs-Steuer''" (Switzerland).  Some of the [[Ecotax|eco-taxes]] ("Ökosteuer") in Germany and Austria are also steering taxes, in the sense of the originally intended [[Eco-social market economy]].

The [[vehicle Excise Duty]] in Germany is an example of a steering tax. It is formulated in such a way that there is an incentive to invest in a new car which is as low polluting as possible. Cars with larger pollutant emissions pay a high tax compared to less polluting cars. [[Electric car]]s are tax free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kraftstg/__3d.html "Kraftfahrzeugsteuergesetz § 3d"], vehicle Excise Duty in Germany (German language).&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany and Switzerland it is legally clarified that the tax revenues should be used to promulgate, or "steer", the targeted behaviour change. The increase of earnings may be as long secondary aim as the rule has an objective earning relevance. This means that the tax may be as long be valid as a tax earning can be expected to take place and therefore the steering effect is justified.

If the aim of steering the payer's behaviour is successful, this means that the aim to increase tax revenues will be unsuccessful. The yield of tax revenue is reduced if the tax payers behave in the targeted way. For example, the consumption of cigarettes was quickly significantly reduced in Germany in 2004 by the increase of the tobacco tax.

== Redistribution of steering taxes to consumers and economy ==
There are also steering taxes like the [[:de:VOC-Abgabe|de:Swiss VOC-fee]] (''Incentive Tax on [[Volatile Organic Compounds]]''),
&lt;ref name="Incentive Tax on VOCs"&gt;The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation (12 November 1997). [http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/814_018/index.html "Incentive Tax on Volatile Organic Compounds", SR 814.018],  status 1 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RIO+20 VOC-incentive-tax"&gt;[http://www.uncsd2012.org/index.php?page=view&amp;type=99&amp;nr=156&amp;menu=20 "Incentive Tax on Volatile Organic Compounds"], United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development ([[Rio+20]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
which will be completely distributed amongst the population.&lt;ref name="Redistribution of VOC-tax"&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/814_018/a23.html "Distribution of VOC-Tax-Revenues to the Swiss population"], Art. 23 of SR 814.018, The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt;
In this case there is no aim to increase tax revenues at all. The ideal goal of such a refund is the creation of positive incentives: People will be rewarded when they behave in the wanted way. If, for example they reduce the emission of greenhouse gases or environmentally dangerous pollutants and reduce their [[Ecological footprint]], they get back an ecological bonus (German: ''Ökobonus''), because with the consumption of non-taxed environmentally friendly products, they pay less eco-taxes than the Green-Cheque is per capita: The amount of the eco-bonus is independent from the energy consumption of the individual recipients. In the words of a publication of the [[European Environment Agency]]: “A Swiss study (INFRAS/ECOPLAN, 1998), which investigated the economic and social impacts of different energy tax schemes, showed that redistributing revenues in the form of a ''per capita bonus'' is the most [[progressive tax|progressive]] option for an Environmental-tax-reform and creates the most beneficial social effects, although it leads to slightly negative effects on economic development.”&lt;ref name="EEA-2011"&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-tax-reform-in-europe "Environmental tax reform in Europe: implications for income distribution"], European Environment Agency, Technical report No 16/2011, (retrieved 13 June 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
The repayment of steering taxes is often named fiscal subsidy. If this is accurate depends if one believes a steering tax is used solely as a direct transfer of public funds to private persons, or if they are seen as a relinquishment of state earnings to realize [[Fiscal neutrality]] for this [[Market-based environmental policy instruments#Taxes|market-based environmental policy instrument]]. The official wording of the German federal government for such a revenue abstinence is "subsidy related matters of fact".
&lt;ref&gt;"19. Subventionsbericht der Bundesregierung", [http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/15/016/1501635.pdf Bundestagsdrucksache 15/1536] (PDF; 2,6&amp;nbsp;MB), S. 16) (German).&lt;/ref&gt;
“The recycling [or redistribution of steering tax-] revenues is especially important for the acceptability, and equity of the tax reforms.” But a difficulty for the political system is, that Opinion polls have shown that the redistribution aspect of eco-taxes “is very poorly understood by a large majority of the population.“&lt;ref name="EEA-2011"/&gt;

[[File:TRS-80-SR.jpg|thumb|Supreme Ruler running on a TRS-80 Model 4P microcomputer]]
'''''Supreme Ruler''''' is a [[Computer game|computer]] [[Strategy video game|strategy game]] in which a player controls a region's [[government]] and attempts to conquer a fictional world of fragmented [[Nation state|states]].  The game simulates raising funds through taxes and spending on agriculture, government services, and the military.  Up to 9 regions play at once, either human [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] or AI controlled, and all actions are resolved simultaneously at the end of each turn.  The design of Supreme Ruler was influenced by earlier nation-state simulations such as [[Hamurabi|Sumer]], though the concept is taken further with the addition of multiplayer, military battles, and a more sophisticated design.

The game was created by George Geczy and produced and published by [[JMG Software International]], released for the [[TRS-80]] microcomputer system in October 1982.  An updated and expanded version, '''''Supreme Ruler Plus''''', was released in May 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moby Games|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/trs-80/supreme-ruler-plus|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Ruler Series==

The original '''''Supreme Ruler''''' games were the inspiration for George Geczy and David Thompson to create a new, modern version of the game, for the Windows PC platform.  This project began in January 2000 with the formation of [[BattleGoat Studios]] and culminated with the release of [[Supreme Ruler 2010]] in May 2005, followed by sequels [[Supreme Ruler 2020]] in June 2008, [[Supreme Ruler Cold War]] in July 2011, [[Supreme Ruler 1936]] in May 2014, [[Supreme Ruler Ultimate]] in October 2014, and [[Supreme Ruler The Great War]] in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Ruler Ultimate on Steam|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/314980/|website=Steam|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developer Diary on Gamespy|url=http://www.gamespy.com/devdiary/september01/sr20101/index.shtm|accessdate=16 June 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040315152533/http://www.gamespy.com/devdiary/september01/sr20101/index.shtm|archivedate=15 March 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''To each according to his contribution'''" is a principle of distribution considered to be one of the defining features of [[socialism]]. It refers to an arrangement whereby individual compensation is reflective of one's contribution to the social product (total output of the economy) in terms of effort, labor and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gregory and Stuart |first= Paul and Robert |title= Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First |publisher= South-Western College Pub |year= 2003|month= |isbn= 0-618-26181-8|page = 118|quote=Under socialism, each individual would be expected to contribute according to capability, and rewards would be distributed in proportion to that contribution. Subsequently, under communism, the basis of reward would be need.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is held in contrast to the method of distribution and compensation in [[capitalism]], where those who own private property receive [[unearned income]] in the form of interest, rent, or profit by virtue of ownership irrespective of their contribution to the social product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= O'Hara|first= Phillip |title= Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher= [[Routledge]]|date=September 2003|isbn= 0-415-24187-1|page = 1135|quote=Property income is, by definition, received by virtue of owning property. Rent is received from the ownership of land or natural resources; interest is received by virtue of owning financial assets; and profit is received from the ownership of production capital. Property income is not received in return for any productive activity performed by its recipients.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept also formed the basic definition of socialism for its [[Pre-Marx socialists|pre-Marxist]] proponents, including [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]], classical economists, and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]].

==Definition and purpose==
''To each according to his contribution'' was a concept espoused by many members of the socialist and [[labor movement]]. Examples of this can be found from [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]'s and [[Eugen Dühring]]'s statements to [[Leon Trotsky]]'s writings. However, it was [[Vladimir Lenin]], inspired by Marx's writing on the subject in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'', who claimed the principle to be a fundamental element of socialism within Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm#s3 Vladimir Lenin, ''The State and Revolution'' Chapter 5, Section 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Libertarian socialist]] thinkers, such as American anarchist [[Benjamin Tucker]], defined socialism as a system whereby the laborer receives the full product of his labor through the elimination of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and accrual of [[unearned income]] to a [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist class]].

The term means simply that each worker in a socialist society receives compensation and benefits according to the [[Marginal product of labor|quantity and value of the labor]] that he or she contributed. This translates into workers of high productivity receiving more wages and benefits than workers of average productivity, and substantially more than workers of low productivity. An extension of this principle could also be made so that the more difficult one's job is—whether this difficulty is derived from greater training requirements, job intensity, safety hazards, etc.—the more one is rewarded for the labor contributed. The purpose of the principle, as [[Trotsky]] would later state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/ch03.htm#ch03-1|title=''The Revolution Betrayed'' Chapter 3, Part 1|author=Leon Trotzky|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to promote productivity. This is done by creating incentives to work harder, longer, and more productively. The principle is ultimately a stowaway from capitalism that, according to Marx, will vanish as work becomes more automated and enjoyable, and goods become available in abundance.

==Elaboration by Marx==
{{Marxism}}
The principle has its roots in the way that [[capitalism]] manages its affairs. That is, each is rewarded according to how much he produces. Remuneration increases as the amount of labor contributed increases. However capitalism can lead to a situation where the [[means of production]] are owned by a small minority who do not produce, but rather live off the labor of others. Socialism is said to remedy this by putting the means of production in common hands and rewarding individuals according to their contributions.

In the ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'', while criticizing [[Ferdinand Lassalle|Lassalle's]] ideas, Marx elaborates on the theory. According to Marx's analysis of the Programme, Lassalle suggests that "the proceeds of labor belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society". While agreeing that the citizens of a workers' society should be rewarded according to individual contributions, Marx claims that giving them the "full product" of their labor is impossible as some of the proceeds will be needed to maintain infrastructure and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm, Karl Marx, ''The Critique of the Gotha Programme'']&lt;/ref&gt; He then explains the nature of a communist society in its lower phase (''socialist society''), which does not emerge from its own foundations "but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges". And so, "accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society — after the deductions have been made — exactly what he gives to it". He explains this as: 
{{Quotation|What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. [[Labour voucher|He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds)]]; and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. '''The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.'''}}
In the paragraph immediately following Marx continues to explain how this system of exchange is related to the capitalist system of exchange:
{{Quotation|Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as '''this is exchange of equal values.''' Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: '''a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form.'''}}

Marx says that this is rational and necessary, and that once society advances from the lower phase of communist society and work becomes life's prime want, distribution will occur along different lines. During the higher phase of communism, the standard shall be "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]".

==Use by Bolsheviks and Marxist-Leninists==
Lenin wrote ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' to answer all the burning questions of the movement, and to prevent Marxism from becoming tainted by "opportunists" and "reformists", as he called them. The work is very important as it categorizes the "first phase of communist society" as socialism, with the higher phase being communism proper. The pamphlet also answers all questions and concerns of the Marxists of his time by utilizing the [[Classical Marxism|classic works of Marxism]].

When he is set to describe socialism and its economic features he turns to the authority of Marx, especially the ''Critique of the Gotha Programme''. Lenin claims that socialism will not be perfect since, as Marx said, it has emerged from the womb of capitalism and which is in every respect stamped with the birthmarks of the old society. This society, socialism, will be unable to provide people with total equality, precisely because it is still marked by capitalism. He also explains the difference between the old society and the new as: {{Quotation|The means of production are no longer the private property of individuals. The means of production belong to the whole of society. Every member of society, performing a certain part of the socially-necessary work, receives a certificate from society to the effect that he has done a certain amount of work. And with this certificate he receives from the public store of consumer goods a corresponding quantity of products. After a deduction is made of the amount of labor which goes to the public fund, '''every worker, therefore, receives from society as much as he has given to it.'''}}

Lenin states that such a society is indeed socialism as it realizes the two principles of socialism "[[he who does not work, neither shall he eat]]" and "an equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor".&lt;ref&gt;[http://marx.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm#s3, Vladimir Lenin, ''The State and Revolution'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]  both mentioned the term in their works.

*Stalin's most famous use of the concept is in his [[1936 Soviet Constitution]]. He writes that "''The principle applied in the U.S.S.R. is that of socialism:'' '''From each according to his ability, to each according to his work.'''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/36cons01.html ''1936 Soviet Constitution'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially noteworthy that he says the principle of socialism and not full communism. 
*Trotsky's mention is in his famous ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]''. He says that "''Capitalism prepared the conditions and forces for a social revolution: technique, science and the proletariat. The communist structure cannot, however, immediately replace the bourgeois society. The material and cultural inheritance from the past is wholly inadequate for that.''" He goes on to defend his position by saying that "''in its first steps the workers’ state cannot yet permit everyone to work "according to his abilities" – that is, as much as he can and wishes to – nor can it reward everyone "according to his needs''", regardless of the work he does." And he presents the principle as the method that socialism will use by saying: "''In order to increase the productive forces, it is necessary to resort to the customary norms of wage payment – that is, to'' '''the distribution of life's goods in proportion to the quantity and quality of individual labor.'''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://marx.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/ch03.htm, Leon Trotsky, ''The Revolution Betrayed'' Chapter 3]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Independents''' were a [[Centrism|centrist]] oriented [[Local government|local body]] electoral [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The group was formed in 1953 by combining a selection process for council candidates backed by several civic interest groups and lobby groups opposed to a proposed sewerage scheme. Its main ambition was to control the balance of power on the [[Auckland City Council]] and stop the sewerage scheme.

==History==
The United Independents group traces its origins back to a group of grassroot locals voicing their opposition to a council proposal to discharge Auckland's sewage into [[Waitemata Harbour]], known as the 'Brown's Island' scheme. Lobbying tactics proved ineffective to stopping the scheme and so opponents turned to political action in order to dissuade local politicians. The most noted public opponent to Brown's Island, [[Dove-Myer Robinson]], used his local renown from the issue and won an [[Auckland City Council]] by-election in 1952 and thereby gained membership to the Auckland Metropolitan Drainage Board and continued to criticize Brown's Island from within.&lt;ref name="DNZB Robinson"&gt;{{DNZB|Edgar|John|5r19|Robinson, Dove-Myer|19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead up to the 1953 municipal elections he helped form the United Independents, candidates who were independent of each other on all issues except Brown's Island on which they were all united.{{sfn|Edgar|2012|pp=}} The United Independents won five seats and held the balance of power between the long established [[Citizens &amp; Ratepayers]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= |title=Council Seats Spread Among Three Groups |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=2 November 1953 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Independents also endorsed [[John Luxford]]'s candidacy for Auckland's Mayoralty. Luxford defeated incumbent Mayor [[John Allum]], who was a supporter of the Brown's Island scheme. By allowing the Citizens &amp; Ratepayers to appoint their preferred candidates to committee chairmanships they desired, the United Independents were in turn able to seize control of the Drainage Board and halt Brown's Island development.{{sfn|Edgar|2012|pp=}} The United Independents then proposed an alternative scheme for [[Sewage treatment|oxidation ponds]] to be built in [[Manukau Harbour]] near [[Mangere]] which would break down the sewage naturally, a new technique pioneered in [[California]], which was approved.&lt;ref name="POND"&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/Auckland/AucklandPlaces/16/en Robbie's Ponds] (from [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]. Accessed 6 June 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1956 municipal elections had less success for the United Independents. The group had fallen out with Luxford, who now stood for the Citizens &amp; Ratepayers Association.{{sfn|Edgar|2012|pp=}} The United Independents viewed Luxford as a traitor and gave their endorsement to Auckland's former Town Clerk [[Thomas Ashby (mayor)|Thomas Ashby]], who defeated Luxford. However the United Independents themselves fared less successfully, losing two seats on the council and their hold on the balance of power. Further setbacks occurred when Ashby died suddenly. The United Independents did not contest the ensuing Mayoral by-election which saw Citizens &amp; Ratepayers candidate [[Keith Buttle]] defeat Labour's [[John Stewart (New Zealand politician)|John Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Details of Voting For City Council Members |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=19 November 1956 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1959 the United Independents had merged with the Labour ticket and jointly contested that years municipal elections under the new '''Civic Reform''' banner. Robinson successfully contested the Mayoralty as an Independent, with informal support from Civic Reform.&lt;ref name="DNZB Robinson" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2022">'''Urdish''', a [[portmanteau]] of [[Urdu]] and [[English language|English]], is the [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] hybrid use of English and [[Urdu]] in [[Pakistan]], involving [[code-switching]] between these languages whereby they are freely interchanged within a sentence or between sentences.

Many bilingual or multi-lingual Urdu speakers, being familiar with both Urdu and English, display [[code-switching]] in certain localities and between certain social groups.

On 14 August 2015, the [[Government of Pakistan]] launched the ''Ilm'' Pakistan movement, with a uniform curriculum in Urdish. [[Ahsan Iqbal]], Federal Minister of Pakistan, said, "Now the government is working on a new curriculum to provide a new medium to the students which will be the combination of both Urdu and English and will name it Urdish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Learning In ‘Urdish’|url=http://nation.com.pk/editorials/16-Aug-2015/learning-in-urdish|accessdate=10 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117144040/http://nation.com.pk/editorials/16-Aug-2015/learning-in-urdish|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yousafzai|first1=Fawad|title=Govt to launch ‘Ilm Pakistan’ on August 14: Ahsan|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/14-Aug-2015/govt-to-launch-ilm-pakistan-on-august-14-ahsan|accessdate=10 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117140424/http://nation.com.pk/national/14-Aug-2015/govt-to-launch-ilm-pakistan-on-august-14-ahsan|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mustafa|first1=Zubeida|title=Over to ‘Urdish’|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1201758|accessdate=10 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017025911/http://www.dawn.com/news/1201758|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''X-Road''' software is a "centrally governed distributed integration layer between information systems", with its first iteration developed and launched by [[Estonia]]'s Information System Authority (RIA) in 2001. The source codes of its central components were released on October 3, 2016 under an [[MIT License]],&lt;ref name="VRT_2016_MIT_XRoad"/&gt; X-Road is a [[Data Exchange Layer]] (DXL) "solution that enables organizations to exchange information over the Internet." X-Road "provides a standardized and secure way to produce and consume services".&lt;ref name="RIA_2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ria.ee/en/introduction-to-xroad-part1.html|title=Introduction to X-Road (part 1)|last=|first=|date=August 8, 2016|website=Information System Authority |location=Estonia|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 7, 2018, Finland's and Estonia's data exchange layers were connected to one another.&lt;ref name="VRK_Data_Exchange"/&gt; In 2017 Finland and Estonia established the [[Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions]] (NIIS) to continue the development of the X-Road core.&lt;ref name="NIIS"/&gt;

==Features==
According to their web page, "The X-Road is an open source data exchange layer solution that enables organizations to exchange information over the Internet. The X-Road is a centrally managed distributed integration layer between Information Systems that provides a standardized and secure way to produce and consume services. The X-Road ensures confidentiality, integrity and interoperability between data exchange parties."&lt;ref name="NIIS_Kivimäki_2018"/&gt;

==History==

The Information System Authority (RIA) at the Ministry of Economy and Communications, developed X-Road and launched the first version in 2001&lt;ref name="RIA_2016" /&gt; and holds the registered trademark, X-Road.&lt;ref name="RIA_XRoad_2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ria.ee/en/x-road.html|title=Data Exchange Layer X-Road|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=Information System Authority, Estonia|language=en|access-date=March 17, 2018 |quote="X-Road, the data exchange layer for information systems, is a technological and organizational environment enabling a secure Internet-based data exchange between information systems"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2016 the "source codes" of central components of X-Road" were released under an [[MIT License]],&lt;ref name="VRT_2016_MIT_XRoad"&gt;{{cite web |title=Source codes released to central components of X-Road used by Estonia and Finland |date=October 3, 2016 |access-date=August 14, 2018 |url=https://vrk.fi/en/artikkeli/-/asset_publisher/viron-ja-suomen-hyodyntaman-x-roadin-keskuskomponenttien-lahdekoodit-julkaistu |work=Population Register Centre |location=Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 7, 2018, Finland's and Estonia's data exchange layers were connected to one another.&lt;ref name="VRK_Data_Exchange"/&gt; "X-Road is used nationwide in the Estonian public administration (X-tee) and in the Suomi.fi Data Exchange Layer (Suomi.fi-palveluväylä) service.

==Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS)==
{{main|Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions}}
The [[Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions]] (NIIS) was founded jointly in June 2017 by Finland and Estonia, with a mission "to develop e-governance solutions...with the X-Road technology used nationwide in the Estonian X-tee and in the Finnish Suomi.fi Data Exchange Layer services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= NIIS 2017 Yearbook |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The NIIS manages, develops, verifies, and audits X-Road's source code; administers documentation, business and technical requirements; conducts development; develops and implements principles of licensing and distribution; provides second-line support for members, and engages in international cooperation.&lt;ref name="NIIS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niis.org|title=Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions|last=|first=|date=|website=Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS)|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-Road and blockchain==

By April 2018, a number of articles erroneously stated that X-Road is a "blockchain-based technology or it utilizes blockchain internally".&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]'' |title=Estonia, the Digital Republic |first=Nathan |last=Heller |date=December 18, 2017 |access-date=December 19, 2017 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/18/estonia-the-digital-republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/e_estonia/status/997394359023816704 |date=May 18, 2018 |access-date=August 14, 2018 |work=e-Estonia via Twitter |title=Recently there have been multiple writings about the X-Road }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an April 18, 2018 article by [[Petteri Kivimäki]] the CTO of the [[Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions]] (NIIS),&lt;ref name="mydata2018_speakers"/&gt; "There is no blockchain technology in the X-Road."&lt;ref name="NIIS_Kivimäki_2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.niis.org/blog/2018/4/26/there-is-no-blockchain-technology-in-the-x-road |title=There is no blockchain technology in the X-Road |first=Petteri |last=Kivimäki |date=April 26, 2018 |access-date=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kivimäki "was the technical lead of X-Road implementation project in Finland and was coordinating the joint open source development of the X-Road solution between Finland and Estonia."&lt;ref name="mydata2018_speakers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mydata2018.org/speakers/petteri-kivimaki/ |title=Petteri Kivimäki |series=Speakers' profiles |date=nd |access-date=August 14, 2018 |work=MyData 2018 |location=Helsinki, Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
