The '''Bambukic''' {{aka}} '''Yungur–Jen languages''' form a branch of the provisional [[Savanna languages]], a reduced form of the Waja–Jen branch of the old [[Adamawa languages]] family (G7, G9, G10). They are spoken in eastern [[Nigeria]].

The [[Waja languages]] were once thought to belong to this group, but are now placed with the [[Kam language (Nigeria)|Kam language]]. (See [[Adamawa languages]].)

'''Belizeans''' are people associated with the country of [[Belize]] through citizenship or descent. Belize is a multiethnic country with residents of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Amerindian]], [[Europe]]an and [[Asia]]n descent or any combination of those groups.

[[Colonisation]], [[slavery]], and immigration have played major roles in affecting the ethnic composition of the population and as a result, Belize is a country with [[Multiculturalism|numerous cultures]], [[Multilingualism|languages]], and [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Volz, Joe and Coy, Cissie, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070826115642/http://www.aarp.org/travel/destinations/americas/belize_mayan_past.html "Belize: Central American Jewel,"] aarp.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Vicki (18 February 2007), [http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070218/news_lz1t18belize.html "Belize beckons with unspoiled Caribbean isles, friendly faces, rich marine life,"] ''The San Diego Union-Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Link, Matthew R. (2002), [http://www.budgettravel.com/print/2551/ "Central America's perfect, penny-pinching blend of island beaches, virgin rain forest, and Maya mysteries"], ''Budget Travel'', January/February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maya and early settlers==

The Maya are thought to have been in Belize and the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] region since the second millennium BC; however, much of Belize's original Maya population was wiped out by disease and conflicts between [[tribe]]s and with Europeans. The [[Belizean Maya]] consists of three Maya groups now inhabit the country: The [[Yucatec]] (who came from Yucatán, Mexico to escape the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]] of the 1840s) mostly live in Corozal, Orange Walk and Cayo District, the [[Mopan people|Mopan]] (indigenous to Belize but were forced out by the British; they returned from Guatemala to evade slavery in the 19th century) Mostly live in Toledo, and [[Q'eqchi' people|Kek'Chi]] (also fled from slavery in Guatemala in the 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;Cho, Julian (1998).&amp;nbsp;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100203235635/http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProjectsResources/MayanAtlas/MayaAtlas/mayahome.htm Maya Homeland]. University of California Berkeley Geography Department and the Toledo Maya of Southern Belize. Retrieved 4 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The later groups are chiefly found in the Toledo District.

==Kriols==

{{Main article|Belizean Creole people}}
{{Main article|Baymen}}

Kriols make up roughly 21% of the Belizean population and about 75% of the [[Belizean American|Diaspora]]. They are descendants of the [[Baymen]] slave owners, and [[slavery|slaves]] brought to Belize for the purpose of the logging industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belizenet.com/bzeguat/intro.html |title=Belize-Guatemala Territorial Issue – Chapter 1 |publisher=Belizenet.com |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These slaves were mostly Black (many also of [[Miskito people|Miskito]] ancestry) from [[Nicaragua]] and born Africans who had spent very brief periods in Jamaica and [[Bermuda]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 2003 pp. 598"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Johnson, Melissa A.|title=The Making of Race and Place in Nineteenth-Century British Honduras|journal=Environmental History|volume=8|issue=4 |year=2003|pages=598–617|jstor=3985885|doi=10.2307/3985885}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caracoles|Bay Island]]ers and more Jamaicans came in the late 19th century, further adding to these already varied peoples, creating this ethnic group.

For all intents and purposes, Kriol is an ethnic and linguistic denomination. Some natives, even those blonde and blue-eyed, may call themselves Kriols.  The designation is more cultural than racial, and is not limited to some certain physical appearance.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2003 pp. 598"/&gt;

The [[Belizean Creole language|Kriol]] language was invented in slavery, and historically only spoken by them.  However, this ethnicity has become synonymous with the '''Belizean''' national identity, and as a result it is now spoken by about 75% of Belizeans.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2003 pp. 598"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2000 Belize Census"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Kriols are found all over Belize, but predominantly in urban areas such as Belize City, coastal towns and villages, and in the Belize River Valley.

Belize Kriol, also written as Belize Creole, is derived mainly from English. Its [[substratum|substrate languages]] are the Native American language [[Miskito language|Miskito]], and the various [[West African]] and [[Bantu languages]] which were brought into the country by slaves. These include [[Akan language|Akan]], [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Ga language|Ga]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Kikongo language|Kikongo]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kriol.org.bz/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garinagu==

{{Main article|Garifuna people}}
The Garinagu (singular ''Garifuna'') are a mix of West/Central African, [[Arawaks|Arawak]], and [[Island Caribs|Carib]] ancestry.  Though they were captives removed from their homelands, they were never documented as slaves.  The two prevailing theories is that in 1635, they were either the survivors of two recorded shipwrecks, or somehow took over the ship they came on.&lt;ref name="www2.ku.edu"&gt;Crawford, M.H. 1997 [http://www2.ku.edu/~lba/courses/articles/Crawford%20Carib.pdf Biocultural adaptation to disease in the Caribbean: Case study of a migrant population] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105001105/http://www2.ku.edu/~lba/courses/articles/Crawford%20Carib.pdf |date=2012-11-05 }}. Journal of Caribbean Studies. Health and Disease in the Caribbean. 12(1): 141–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history they have been incorrectly labelled as ''Black Caribs''. When the British took over [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, they were opposed by French settlers and their Garinagu allies. The Garinagu eventually surrendered to the British in 1796. The British separated the more African-looking Garifunas from the more indigenous-looking ones.  5,000 Garinagu were exiled from the Grenadine island of [[Baliceaux]].  However, only about 2,500 of them survived the voyage to [[Roatán]], an island off the coast of [[Honduras]]. The [[Garifuna language]] belongs to the [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan language family]], but has a large number of loanwords from Carib languages and from English.

Because [[Roatán]] was too small and infertile to support their population, the Garinagu petitioned the Spanish authorities of Honduras to be allowed to settle on the mainland coast. The Spanish employed them as soldiers, and they spread along the Caribbean coast of Central America. The Garinagu settled in Seine Bight, [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]] and Punta Negra, Belize by way of Honduras as early as 1802. However, in Belize 19 November 1832 is the date officially recognised as "[[Garifuna Settlement Day]]" in Dangriga.&lt;ref name="2000 Belize Census" /&gt;  According to one genetic study their ancestry is on average is 76% Sub Saharan African, 20% Arawak/Carib and 4% European.&lt;ref name="www2.ku.edu"/&gt;

==Emigration, immigration, and demographic shifts==

Kriols and other ethnic groups are emigrating mostly to the United States, but also to the United Kingdom and other developed nations for better opportunities. Based on the latest [[U.S. Census]], the number of Belizeans in the United States is approximately 160,000 (including 70,000 legal residents and naturalised citizens), consisting mainly of Kriols and Garinagu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov "Diaspora of Belize"]. Council on Diplomacy, Washington, D.C. and Consulate General of Belize.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[The World Factbook|estimates by the CIA]] in 2009, Belize's [[total fertility rate]] currently stands at approximately 3.6 children per woman. Its birth rate is 27.33 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 5.8 deaths/1,000 population.

'''William Weisband, Sr.''' (August 28, 1908 – May 14, 1967) was an Ukrainian-American [[Codebreaking|cryptanalyst]] and  [[NKVD]] agent (code name 'LINK'), best known for his role in revealing U.S. decryptions of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] diplomatic and intelligence codes to [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet intelligence]].

==Background==
Weisband was born in [[Odessa]], Russia, in 1908. He emigrated to the United States in the 1920s and became a [[United States citizenship#Naturalized citizens|naturalized United States citizen]] in 1938. He was drafted into the [[United States Army]] in 1942, and was assigned to signals intelligence duties.

==Espionage career==
From 1941 to 1942, Weisband was the NKVD [[Agent handling|agent handler]] for [[Jones Orin York]], who worked at the [[Northrop Corporation]].  After joining the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[Signals Intelligence Service]] (SIS) in 1942, he performed signals intelligence and communications security duties in North Africa and Italy, where he made some important friends before returning to the "Russian Section" at [[Arlington Hall]], where SIS had established its headquarters in June 1942. Although not a [[cryptanalyst]] himself, as a "linguist adviser" who spoke fluent [[Russian language|Russian]], Weisband worked closely with cryptanalysts. The gregarious and popular Weisband had access to all areas of Arlington Hall's Soviet work. The codebreaker [[Meredith Gardner]] recalled that Weisband had watched him extract a list of Western atomic scientists from a December 1944 NKVD message.

The Soviets apparently had monitored Arlington Hall's "Russian Section" since at least 1945, when Weisband joined the unit. Weisband notified the Soviets that the [[Venona Project]] was on the verge of success. To make sure that the [[FBI]] was unaware that they knew that the code was about to be broken, they continued to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/William_Weisband.htm|title=William Weisband|author=John Simkin|work=Spartacus Educational}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "operatives" were instructed "every week to compose summary reports or information on the basis of press and personal connections to be transferred to the Center by telegraph." As [[Allen Weinstein]] pointed out, "Soviet intelligence's once-flourishing American networks, in short, had been transformed almost overnight into a virtual clipping service." &lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Allen. ''The Hunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America'' (1999&lt;!--publisher &amp; place?--&gt;), p.286.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1948 a Soviet official wrote an internal memorandum about the work of Weisband. &lt;blockquote&gt;For one year, a large amount of very valuable documentary material concerning the work of Americans on deciphering Soviet ciphers, intercepting and analyzing open radio-correspondence of Soviet institutions (the Venona project), was received from (Weisband). From these materials, we came to know that, as a result of this work, American intelligence managed to acquire important data concerning the stationing of the USSR's armed forces, the productive capacity of various branches of industry, and work in the field of atomic energy in the USSR... On the basis of Weisband's materials, our state security organs carried out a number of defensive measures, resulting in the reduced efficiency of the American deciphering service. This has led to the considerable current reduction in the amount of deciphering and analysis by the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Bruslov, memorandum on William Weisband (February, 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Weisband's role as a Soviet agent was not discovered by counterintelligence officers until 1950, by which time the damage had been done. Where Weisband had sketched the outlines of U.S. cryptanalytic success, [[Great Britain|British]] liaison officer [[Kim Philby]] received actual translations and analyses on a regular basis after he arrived for duty in [[Washington, D.C.]], in autumn 1949. Until a thorough review of Soviet [[KGB]] archives is made, the full scope of Weisband's role as a Soviet spy will probably not be known.

In 1950 Jones Orin York told the FBI that he had passed secrets to the Soviets and that his handler was Bill Weisband. The Venona messages do not hold a definite reference to Weisband. Nevertheless, three messages mention a "ZVENO" (the Russian word for "link") and one of them suggests procedures for the [[London]] residency to use in contacting ZVENO, who was awaiting a transfer to [[England]]. ZVENO, according to one message, had spent the last four weeks in an Italian-language course in [[Virginia]] and would leave for Britain by mid-July. In fact, Weisband spent that June honing his skills in a language (probably Italian) at Arlington Hall, shipped out on 17 July, and arrived in London by 29 July.

While suspended from SIS on suspicion of disloyalty, Weisband failed to appear for a [[Grand jury|federal grand jury]] hearing on the [[Communist Party USA]], for which he had received a summons. As a result, in November 1950 Weisband was convicted of [[Contempt of court|contempt]] and sentenced to a year in prison. Weisband escaped prosecution for espionage, as authorities feared that a trial would divulge yet more information to Soviet intelligence on U.S. intelligence "sources and methods". Weisband never revealed his status as an NKVD agent to anyone, and he remained in the United States, living quietly, and working as an insurance salesman until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/venona-soviet-espionage-and-the-american-response-1939-1957/preface.htm |title=CSI |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
He died suddenly of a heart attack in 1967. His son describes his death:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[My] It was Mothers Day, May 14th 1967 my father was taking me and my sisters to the Smithsonian Institute [sic] for a traditional Sunday afternoon outing. We were driving down the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], and he had a massive cardiac arrest. He literally died driving the car. It was horrifying, I grabbed the wheel and pulled the car over to the side of the road, an old '56 Pontiac, and turned the key off. I stood out in the middle of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and stopped traffic, I ran in between the two lanes knocking on windows and doors looking for a doctor or someone to help. Two men helped pull my father out of the car, they laid him on the ground and tried to resuscitate him. An ambulance arrived on the scene and took my father to the hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival. My father was a great father and I've missed him very much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/venona/fami_weisband.html |title=Bill Weisband, Jr. |accessdate=2008-07-19 |quote= |publisher=[[Nova (TV series)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Born alive rule|"Born alive" laws]] in the [[United States]]''' are [[fetal rights]] laws which extend various [[criminal law]]s, such as [[homicide]] and [[assault]], to cover unlawful death or other harm done to a [[fetus]] [[in utero]] (unborn child) or to an infant that is no longer being carried in pregnancy and exists outside of its mother. The basis for such laws stems from advances in medical science and social perception which allow a fetus to be seen and medically treated as an individual in the womb and perceived socially as a person, for some or all of the pregnancy.

Such laws overturn the [[common law]] legal principle that until physically born, a fetus or unborn child does not have independent legal existence and therefore cannot be the victim of such crimes. They often provide for [[transferred intent]] (sometimes called "transferred malice") so that an unlawful act which happens to affect a pregnant woman and thus harm her fetus can be charged as a crime with the fetus as a victim, in addition to crimes against any other people.

== History of born alive law ==
{{main|Born alive rule|Transferred intent|Murder in English law}}

=== Common law ===
The born alive rule was originally a principle at [[common law]] in England that was carried to the United States and other former colonies of the British Empire. First formulated by [[William Staunford]], it was later set down by [[Edward Coke]] in his [[Institutes of the Laws of England]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a woman be quick with childe, and by a potion or otherwise killeth it in her wombe, or if a man beat her, whereby the child dyeth in her body, and she is delivered of a dead childe, this is great misprision, and no murder; but if he childe be born alive and dyeth of the potion, battery, or other cause, this is murder; for in law it is accounted a reasonable creature, in rerum natura, when it is born alive.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [http://feministlawprofs.law.sc.edu/?p=1901 "The New "Fetal Protection": The Wrong Answer to the Crisis of Inadequate Health Care for Women and Children"], Linda Fentiman, 2006, note 119, (abstract and download link)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase "a reasonable creature, in rerum natura" as a whole is usually translated as "a life in being", i.e. where the [[umbilical cord]] has been severed and the baby has a life independently of the [[mother]].&lt;ref name="AG 3 1994"&gt;''Attorney General's Reference  No  3  of  1994'' {{cite BAILII

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Reasonable" here is used as in the 16th century, meaning "something that may reasonably be considered [a living creature]". In [[English law]] this meant that until born, the fetus was not accounted a person under criminal law, nor a separate person from its mother, and could not have the capacity to be the subject of an ''[[actus reus]]'' ('wrongful act') &amp;ndash; a prerequisite for a criminal offense in the absence of any [[statute]] to the contrary.

=== Subsequent developments ===
In the 19th century, some began to argue for legal recognition of the moment of conception as the beginning of a human being, basing their argument on growing awareness of the processes of [[pregnancy]] and [[fetal development]].&lt;ref name=Meredith&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing Pregnancy: The Law And Ethics of Obstetric Conflict|author=Sheena Meredith|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-4412-X|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connolly&gt;{{cite book|title=One Life: How the U.S. Supreme Court Deliberately Distorted the History, Science and Law of Abortion|author=William M. Connolly|year=2002|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=1-4010-3786-0}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They succeeded in drafting laws which criminalized abortion in all forms and made it punishable in secular courts.

Advances in the state of the art in medical science, including medical knowledge related to the [[fetal viability|viability of the fetus]], and the ease with which the fetus can be observed in the womb as a living being, treated clinically as a human being, and (by certain stages) demonstrate neural and other processes considered as [[human]], have led a number of jurisdictions &amp;ndash; in particular in the United States &amp;ndash; to supplant or abolish this common law principle.&lt;ref name=Meredith /&gt;

Changes to the law proceed piecemeal, from case to case and from statute to statute, rather than wholesale. One such landmark case with respect to the rule was ''Commonwealth vs. Cass'', in the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]], where the court held that the stillbirth of an eight-month-old fetus, whose mother had been injured by a motorist, constituted [[vehicular homicide]].  By a majority decision, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held that a viable fetus constituted a "person" for the purposes of [[vehicular homicide]] law. In the opinion of the justices,

{{quote|We think that the better rule is that infliction of perinatal injuries resulting in the death of a viable fetus, before or after it is born, is homicide.&lt;ref name=Seymour&gt;{{cite book|title=Childbirth and the Law|author=John (John A.) Seymour|pages=140–143|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-826468-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several courts have held that it is not their function to revise statute law by abolishing the born alive rule, and have stated that such changes in the law should come from the [[legislature]]. In 1970 in ''Keeler v. Superior Court of Amador County'', the [[California Supreme Court]] dismissed a murder indictment against a man who had caused the stillbirth of the child of his estranged pregnant wife, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he courts cannot go so far as to create an offense by enlarging a statute, by inserting or deleting words, or by giving the terms used false or unusual meanings [...] Whether to extend liability for murder in California is a determination solely within the province of the Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Criminal Law|author1=David C. Brody |author2=James R. Acker |author3=Wayne A. Logan |chapter=Criminal Homicide|year=2001|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|isbn=0-8342-1083-5|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several legislatures passed laws to explicitly include deaths and injuries to fetuses in utero. The general policy has been that an attacker who causes the stillbirth of a fetus should be punished for the destruction of that fetus in the same way as an attacker who attacks a person and causes their death. Some legislatures have simply expanded their existing offences to explicitly include fetuses in utero. Others have created wholly new, and separate, offences.&lt;ref name=Seymour /&gt;

== Federal laws ==
The [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act]] ("BAIPA" {{USStatute|107|207|116|926|2002|08|05}}, {{USC|1|8}}) extends legal protection to an [[infant]] [[Live birth (human)|born alive]] after a failed attempt at [[abortion|induced abortion]]. It passed into law on August 5, 2002.&lt;ref name="govetrack BAIPA"&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h107-2175&lt;/ref&gt; The law defines a "born alive" infant as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord, breath, or voluntary muscle movement, regardless of circumstances of birth or severance of the [[umbilical cord]], and provides rights{{Which|date=January 2012}} for such infants.

The [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]] (Public Law 108-212) recognizes a "child in utero" as a legal victim, if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes of violence.  The law defines "child in utero" as "a member of the species ''Homo sapiens'', at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/Unborn_Victims/UVVAEnrolled.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106071132/http://nrlc.org/Unborn_Victims/UVVAEnrolled.html# |date=2012-01-06 }} Text of Unborn Victims of Violence Act.&lt;/ref&gt; It applies only to certain offenses over which the [[United States]] government has jurisdiction, including certain crimes committed on [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] properties, against certain federal officials and employees, and by members of the military, as well as certain crimes (including some acts of [[terrorism]]) which count as [[federal offense]]s even if outside the United States. The act explicitly provides that it may not "be construed to permit the prosecution" of any person in relation to consensual [[abortion]], medical treatment of a mother or her fetus, or any woman with regard to her own fetus. It passed into law on April 1, 2004 and is [[Codification (law)|codified]] under two sections of the [[United States Code]]: Title 18, Chapter 1 (Crimes), §1841 (18 USC 1841), and the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]: Title 10, Chapter 22 §919a (Article 119a). The law was both hailed and vilified by legal observers who interpreted the measure as a step toward granting legal [[personhood]] to human fetuses.

== List of laws by state ==

=== California ===
§187 of the California Penal Code was amended to redefine murder to include the unlawful killing of a fetus. The term "fetus" was not initially defined.

In ''People v. Smith'' (1976)&lt;ref&gt;129 Cal. Rptr. 498 (Ct. App. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; the court qualified this as signifying a viable fetus, holding that until the capability for independent existence is attained by a fetus "there is only the expectancy and potentiality for human life".  They reasoned that the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] had implicitly stated in various cases dealing with abortion, that destruction of a nonviable fetus did not constitute taking a human life. As homicide was the unlawful destruction of a human life, proof was required that the unlawful destruction of a human life had in fact occurred. Thus it was held that the defendant was guilty of abortion, but not homicide.&lt;ref name=Seymour /&gt;

In ''People v. Davis'' (1994), the [[California Supreme Court]] examined this and concluded fetal viability was ''not'' essential for rights to exist. They reasoned that abortion cases such as ''[[Wade v. Roe]]'' discuss where to draw the line for legitimate state interest in situations where the interests of fetus and mother conflict. Such cases do not discuss, and do not preclude, a legitimate state interest in protecting the potentiality of human life perhaps arising at a different time in situations where the rights of the fetus do ''not'' have to be set against the rights of the mother.

===Minnesota===
''Vehicular homicide'', ''death to an unborn child'', and ''injury to an unborn child'' are three separate offences, under the umbrella of ''criminal vehicular operation''.&lt;ref name=ClearyCox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dps.state.mn.us/ots/crashdata/2003%20Impaired%20Facts/IDF03FLawOverviewVer10.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Minnesota Department of Public Safety|title=A Brief Overview of Minnesota’s DWI Laws: Minnesota Statutes Chapter 169A and Related Laws|author1=James Cleary  |author2=Joseph Cox |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Minnesota Impaired Driving Facts Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption is rife in [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG).&lt;ref name="CorruptionPNG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nri.org.pg/publications/Recent%20Publications/2010%20Publications/PNG%20Corruption%20Discussion%20Paper%2037.pdf | title=CORRUPTION IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA: TOWARDS AN UNDERSTANDING OF ISSUES | author=The National Research Institute | publisher=The National Research Institute | date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to ''[[The Economist]]'', “PNG's governments are notorious for corruption, and ever run the risk of turning the state into a fully-fledged [[kleptocracy]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2011/08/papua-new-guinea-and-australia | title=Papua New Guinea and Australia: Near neighbours, worlds apart | author=J.F. | work=The Economist| date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2016 [[Corruption Perceptions Index|Corruption Perception Index]] ranks the country 136th place out of 176 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results/#CountryResults

Papua New Guinea is below the satisfactory levels set by the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] ([[UNCAC]]), according to a report submitted by Transparency International Papua New Guinea (TIPNG) in 2011. TIPNG’s report found that in many cases, anti-corruption bodies in PNG were restricted by shortcomings in financial resources.&lt;ref name="UNODC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session4/NGO/V1186434e.pdf | title=Conference of the States Parties to the United  Nations Convention against Corruption | author= Transparency International Papua New Guine | publisher= Transparency International Papua New Guinea | date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and commercial corruption==

Political corruption in Papua New Guinea is largely enforced by political nepotism and the patronage system of governance. Elected leaders are inclined to seize and distribute resources amongst their electorates in order to secure and maintain popular support. This system of governance is embedded in Melanesian traditions, where the credibility and popularity of a leader amongst his electorate is defined, in part, by the wealth he is able to distribute and the power he is able to wield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Corruption in Papua New Guinea (Mimeograph)|author1=Kavanamur, David  |author2=Okole, Henry |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem has been compounded, in PNG, by the model of 'politician-turned-businessman' which has dominated the post-1975 political landscape and has muddied the distinctions between business and politics, allowing politicians to divert public monies into their personal accounts. A review of medium-sized businesses in PNG showed that the majority are owned or part-owned by current or former politicians.&lt;ref name="CountryReport"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inapng.com/study_report_png_080703.pdf| title=TI  Country Study Report Papua New Guinea  2003| author=National Integrity Systems| publisher=National Integrity Systems| year=2003| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320021506/http://www.inapng.com/study_report_png_080703.pdf| archivedate=2013-03-20| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Misappropriation by public officials was highlighted in a leaked cable by the US Embassy in [[Port Moresby]], which observed that government revenues from industry had “served more to enrich the political elite than to provide social services or infrastructure. There are no large-scale local businessmen, but numerous politicians are relatively well off”.&lt;ref name="PNGVisit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cablesearch.org/cable/view.php?id=08PORTMORESBY222&amp;hl=%22political+elite%22+%22social+services%22  | title=08PORTMORESBY222: CORRECTED COPY: PAPUA NEW GUINEA SCENESETTER FOR THE VISIT| author=Embassy Port Moresby| publisher=Wikileaks| date=5 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PNG has enormous resource potential through its natural endowments in mineral deposits, petroleum, forestry, fishing and tourism. However, a 2010 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] found that in PNG national revenues from the extractive industries had been widely dissipated through official corruption, without leaving any discernible positive impact on the wider population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/png0211webwcover.pdf | title=Gold’s Costly Dividend| author=Human Rights Watch| publisher=Human Rights Watch| year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict between Melanesian traditions of ‘sharing and caring’,&lt;ref name="CountryReport" /&gt;
and anti-bribery legislation is often brought into relief during the election cycle. One candidate in the 2002 elections, Allan Bird, published an open letter documenting his experiences: “I was shattered by the attitude of people on my side of the river whose sole drive in life appears to be to live off government or MP freebies for the rest of their lives… I have even had many individuals tell me in no uncertain terms that if I wanted to be an MP, I must pay (bribe) the voter because that ‘is the way we do things around here’”.&lt;ref name="CorruptionPNG" /&gt;

A leaked diplomatic cable titled “Ponzi Politics” by the US Embassy in [[Port Moresby]] provided a critical forecast on the likelihood of corruption in the 2007 elections: “Now it’s election time (May 2007) and the politicians are dusting off their bottles of snake oil. Viewed from afar, or from a national perspective, it’s an appalling spectacle of disregard for governance.”&lt;ref name="PonziPolitics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cablesearch.org/cable/view.php?id=06PORTMORESBY274&amp;hl=%22ponzi+politics | title=06PORTMORESBY274: PONZI POLITICS | author=Embassy Port Moresby | publisher=Wikileaks| date=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In further commentary on the election process, the US Embassy in [[Port Moresby]] noted that each “election cycle has brought 12 months of budget imbalances and a time of seeming national fecklessness”.&lt;ref name="PonziPolitics" /&gt;



In 2012, Prime Minister [[Peter O'Neill]], when introducing in parliament a twenty-year corruption strategy, cited the following common corrupt acts by government officials and bureaucrats:

* Paying bribes to acquire preferential service or treatment;
* Theft of public money and illegal acquisition of assets by abusing a position of authority;
* Breaching procurement processes;
* Conflict of interest in decision making;
* Nepotism resulting in the recruitment and retention of unqualified staff.

Because of prevalent corruption, and despite a budget surplus, the national wealth has failed to flow down to the people.&lt;ref name="MillionsLost" &gt;{{cite web|url= http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2012/January/01-19-19.htm | title= PNG MINISTER: $467 MILLION LOST TO CORRUPTION | author= PACIFIC ISLANDS REPORT | publisher= PACIFIC ISLANDS REPORT | date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary===

The [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary]] (RPNGC) has become “ineffective, corrupt and often abusive” according to a leaked diplomatic cable from the US Embassy in [[Port Moresby]].&lt;ref name="PNGVisit" /&gt; One report by National Integrity Systems reported gifts and favours being offered to the police in order for cases to be ‘swept under the carpet’.&lt;ref name="CountryReport" /&gt; In 2011 the Police Commissioner took the unusual step of asking the public not to offer bribes to police officers. The Commissioner referred to the common practice of paying police officers to avoid fines for minor offences, and urged the public to let themselves be charged instead of contributing to the culture of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-18/png-bribery-police/2799424| title= PNG top cop says not to bribe police| author= Liam Fox| publisher=ABC Bews| date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land and logging corruption====

In August 2011, the government of PNG launched a Commission of Inquiry (COI) to investigate improper leasing through Special Purpose Agricultural and Business Leases (SPABLS). The COI was launched following an early warning letter from the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (UNHCHR), sent on 11 March 2011. The findings of the COI have been delayed, but are expected to be tabled in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/18b32963#/18b32963/28| title=Divers of SABLs | author=Paul Winn| publisher=Greenpeace Australia Pacific| date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to a report published by [[Greenpeace]] in 2012, over 5 million hectares of customary land had been improperly leased between 2003 and 2011 through SPABLs. The land equates to over 11% of the country and over 16% of accessible commercial forests. According to the report, 3.9 million hectares are controlled by foreign-owned companies and of these, Malaysian and Australian firms hold at least 3 million hectares. The evaluation and granting of SPABLs is managed by the Department of Lands and Physical Planning (DLPP), which is described in the Greenpeace report as “grossly incompetent and entirely corrupt”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/18b32963#/18b32963/14
| title=Introduction | author=Paul Winn | publisher= Greenpeace Australia Pacific | date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, [[Transparency International]] responded to Prime Minister [[Peter O'Neill]]'s post-election promise to “stamp out corruption wherever it occurs” by recommending that responding to the COI findings must be a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/20120808_papua_new_guinea_government_must_back_its_word_to_fight_corruption| title=PAPUA NEW GUINEA: GOVERNMENT MUST BACK ITS WORD TO FIGHT CORRUPTION| author=Transparency International Papua New Guinea| publisher=Transparency International| date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[April Salome Forest Management Area]] is a pilot project for [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|REDD]] initiative  by [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenational.com.pg/april-salome-all-set-for-carbon-trading/ April-Salome all set for carbon trading.] ''The National'' June 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is also mishandling and corruption showcase.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lang [https://redd-monitor.org/2009/06/07/anatomy-of-a-deal-the-april-salome-redd-project-in-papua-new-guinea/ Anatomy of a deal: The April Salome REDD project in Papua New Guinea.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="filer"&gt;Colin Filer ''[http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183q3k6.13.

==Government anti-corruption efforts==

===The National Anti-Corruption Authority===

The [[National Anti-Corruption Authority]] (NACA) was established in April 2004 and is chaired by the Police Commissioner.{{cn|date=March 2017}} There are nine public sector agencies which work with the NACA with the objective of combating corruption in the public sector: [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary]], [[Office of the Public Prosecutor]], [[Ombudsman Commission of Papua New Guinea]], [[Office of the Auditor-General (Papua New Guinea)|Office of the Auditor-General]], [[Office of the Solicitor General (Papua New Guinea)|Office of the Solicitor General]], [[Department of Treasury (Papua New Guinea)|Department of Treasurer]], [[Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs]], [[Internal Revenue Commission (Papua New Guinea)|Internal Revenue Commission]], and the [[Department of Personnel Management]].&lt;ref name="CorruptionPNG" /&gt;

Though government agencies have conducted investigations into the misappropriation of public funds, little has been done to effectively address corruption.&lt;ref name="MillionsLost" /&gt; A number of commentators have stated that the police are too under-resourced to make any in-roads into fighting corruption. For example, the police’s Financial Intelligence Unit does not have sufficient staff to halt money laundering and fraud involving public funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=62240| title=PNG think tank says corruption fighting agencies need more resources| author=Radio New Zealand International| publisher=Radio New Zealand International| date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A US Embassy cable reported that a deficit of police resources was reflected in the lack of criminal investigations that are brought to trial.

===The Ombudsman Commission===

The [[Ombudsman Commission of Papua New Guinea]] is an independent institution mandated to provide a means of redress for citizens suffering from administrative injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawandjustice.gov.pg/www/html/118-the-ombudsman.asp |title=The Ombudsman Commission of Papua New Guinea |author=Law and Justice Sector |publisher=Government of Papua New Guinea |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207074056/http://www.lawandjustice.gov.pg/www/html/118-the-ombudsman.asp |archivedate=2011-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the right to refer cases involving allegations of misconduct by government officials to the Public Prosecutor, who may subsequently refer the matter to the [[Leadership tribunal|Leadership Tribunal]].&lt;ref name="Speech"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.paclii.org/pg/OC/Speeches/Speech2.htm| title=PNG - Ombudsman Commission - Speeches| author=OMBUDSMAN – PNG| publisher=PacLII| date=27 April 2005| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324031236/http://www.paclii.org/pg/OC/Speeches/Speech2.htm| archivedate=24 March 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Ombudsman Commission stated that of the cases reviewed involving allegations of misconduct by public officials, 80 percent related to misappropriation of funds and 20 percent related to cases of ‘personal benefit’.&lt;ref name="Speech" /&gt; A review of the 34 cases referred to the Leadership Tribunal between 1976 and 1997 showed that 20 resulted in guilty verdicts. Of these cases, 17 resulted in the dismissal, suspension or resignation of the Leader from office.&lt;ref name="CountryReport" /&gt;

===Anti-corruption strategy of O'Neill administration===

In 2012 the Public Service Minister Bart Philemon estimated that PGK1 billion [US$467 million] of public funds is lost every year due to corruption. Prime Minister [[Peter O'Neill]] said that PNG could no longer afford to pay for the cost of corruption.&lt;ref name="MillionsLost" /&gt;

Upon his appointment as Prime Minister in August 2011 Peter O'Neill launched a much publicised anti-corruption drive. As part of this, he announced the future formation of an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the formation of an elite anti-corruption investigative team, called [[Task Force Sweep]].&lt;ref name="UNODC" /&gt;  When Task Force Sweep found there was evidence supporting allegations of corrupt behavior by Mr O'Neill, Mr O'Neill ordered the team shut down.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2015/s4174033.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACSTF)===

Following his re-appointment as Prime Minister in the 2012 General Elections, O’Neill announced the formation of another anti-corruption agency, the National Anti-Corruption Strategy Task Force (NACSTF). According to an announcement made in August 2012, the primary role of the NACSTF is to implement the National Anti-Corruption Strategy 2010 -2030, which had been ratified by the UNAC in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvariety.com/regional-news/palaupacific-news/48918-png-cabinet-approves-anti-corruption-taskforce.php| title=PNG cabinet approves anti-corruption taskforce | author=Marianas Variety| publisher=Marianas Variety| date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to O’Neill, the task force will draw membership from key government departments including the departments of the Prime Minister, Justice, Police, Treasury, the Ombudsman Commission, Auditor General and the Public Prosecutor’s office. The task force has been given a fund of PGK500,000 (US$235,000) for its formation. The NACSTF’s tasks will include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=29618/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl | title=PNG Cabinet approves Anti Corruption taskforce | author=Islands Business| publisher=Islands Business| date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Establishing a National Integrity Commission or the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC); 
* Developing legislation to protect whistle-blowers;
* Developing a Freedom of Information (FOI) Act; and
* Implement outstanding COI recommendations such as those made into SPABLs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11308">'''Cycling advocacy''' consists of activities that call for, promote or enable increased adoption and support for cycling and improved safety and convenience for cyclists, usually within [[urbanized areas]] or semi-urban regions. Issues of concern typically include policy, administrative and [[Bicycle law|legal changes]] (the consideration of cycling in all governance); advocating and establishing better [[cycling infrastructure]] (including road and junction design and the creation, maintenance of bike lanes and [[Segregated cycle facilities|separate bike paths]], and bike parking); public education regarding the health, transportational and environmental benefits of cycling for both individuals and communities, cycling and motoring skills; and increasing public and political support for bicycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are many organisations worldwide whose primary mission is to [[advocate]] these goals. Most are non-profit organisations supported by donations, membership dues, and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Cycling advocacy around the world==

===Internationally===
In 2018 the United Nations General Assembly designated 3 June as [[World Bicycle Day]], after it had been proposed by [[World Cycling Alliance]].

===Europe===

====Bicycle embassies====
In Europe, '''Bicycle embassies''' have been set up to communicate established [[body of knowledge|bodies of knowledge]] concerning [[cycling infrastructure]], bicycle promotion and cycling advocacy techniques to other national, state and municipal governments.

Established bicycle embassies include, the [http://www.dutchcycling.nl/ Dutch Cycling Embassy], the [[Cycling Embassy of Denmark]] and the [http://www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/ Cycling Embassy of Great Britain].

====Copenhagenization====
[[File:Bikecultureincopenhagen.jpg|thumb|250px|Rush hour cycle traffic in [[Copenhagen]]]]
[[File:A Short History of Traffic Engineering.png|thumb|250px|Copenhagenize advocacy poster]]
'''Copenhagenization''' is a design strategy in which [[urban planning]] and [[Urban design|design]] are  centered on making a city more accessible to bicyclists and pedestrians, and less car dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/on-your-bike-what-the-world-can-learn-about-cycling-from-copenhagen-1803227.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=2009-10-18 | title=On your bike: What the world can learn about cycling from Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/12/14/us-climate-copenhagenisation-idUSTRE5BD2GK20091214 | agency=Reuters | title=Bicycle-friendly Copenhagen a model for big cities | date=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was popularised by [[Danish people|Danish]] [[urban design]] consultant [[Jan Gehl]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/10/a-danish-urban-planning-guru-vs-moscow.html A Danish Urban-Planning Guru vs. Moscow], New Yorker, Sally McGrane, 8 Oct 2012&lt;/ref&gt; who has been instrumental in the promotion and implementation of the policy in [[Copenhagen]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For more than 40 years, Mr. Gehl has systematically studied public spaces to see how they really work, using [[Strøget]] and Copenhagen as a laboratory for his research. He has advised cities around the world, including Melbourne, London and New York, on how to improve the quality of urban life -- in his words, how to "Copenhagenize" their cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=d47ee45e-4f47-4b2b-b947-ab95578e2e8a The Strøget Solution – Ottawa Citizen, Canada.com March 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Independently of Gehl, [[Danish people|Danish]] [[urban design]] consultant [[Mikael Colville-Andersen]] coined and popularized the phrase the term in this meaning to a broader audience, starting in 2007 with the ''Copenhagenize.com blog'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenize.com/2011/01/copenhagenize-origins.html|title=Copenhagenize.com  - Bicycle Culture by Design: Copenhagenize Origins|author=Mikael Colville Andersen|work=copenhagenize.com|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that highlights how the bicycle can be an important tool in the creation of liveable cities. The term has since spread to Britain, to Europe, and elsewhere internationally. The ''Copenhagenize.com'' blog has inspired the creation of other blogs with the same focus for cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Lisbon]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/on-your-bike-what-the-world-can-learn-about-cycling-from-copenhagen-1803227.html|title=On your bike: What the world can learn about cycling from Copenhagen|work=The Independent|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/transport/interview-eu-give-cities-strong-tools-sustainable-mobility/article-166734 Interview: 'EU must give cities strong tools for sustainable mobility' | EU – European Information on Transport &amp; Services – EurActiv.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===North America===
In North America the term ''Bicycle Ambassador'' arose to describe cycling advocates tasked with promoting bicycling in a community. Such advocates can be employed by the national, provincial or city government and their tasks include [[Business networking|networking]] extensively with other municipal offices whose activities effect cycling.

Early ''Bicycle Ambassador'' programs began in [[Cycling in Toronto|Toronto]] in the late 1990s. Other cities picked it up over the following decade, [[Cycling in Chicago|Chicago]] being the largest. [[Portland, Oregon]], [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], [[Seattle, Washington]], [[Arlington, Virginia]] also have programs. [[Philadelphia]], [[Washington, D.C.]] and New York City began programs most recently. Some programs are entirely youth focused, while others become a de facto part of the city [[Department of Transportation]] or other government agency.

===Latin America===
The [[World Bike Forum]] was organized in 2012 after the [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass events in Porto Alegre]] in which an automobile driver deliberately collided and injured around 20 cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruggs|first1=Greg|title=A Critical Mass Tragedy Sparks a Bicycle Boom in Brazil|url=http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/critical-mass-tragedy-sparks-a-bicycle-boom-in-brazil-porto-alegre|website=Next City|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Forum bicycle-based urban mobility is discussed and strategies to spread the use of bicycles in the hosting city are promoted.

The Forum has taken place in  the [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] cities of [[Porto Alegre]] (2012 and 2013), [[Curitiba]] (2014), as well as [[Medellín]], [[Colombia]] (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.bikeelegal.com/noticia/1101/medellin-sediara-forum-mundial-da-bicicleta-em-2015|title =Medellín sediará Fórum Mundial da Bicicleta em 2015|publisher=Msn.com|author =Willian Cruz – Bike é Legal |language=Portuguese |date= February 17, 2014|accessdate= September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.elmundo.com/portal/opinion/columnistas/medellin_capital_ciclista.php|title =Medellín, capital ciclista|language=Spanish|publisher=Elmundo.com|author =Carlos Cadena Gaitan |date= February 24, 2014|accessdate= September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mexico City in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fmb6.net/|title=FMB6 World Bike Forum|publisher=fmb6.net|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The decriminalization of sex work''' is the removal of criminal penalties for [[sex work]].&lt;ref name="All Women"&gt;{{cite web |title=All Women, All Rights: Sex Workers Included |url=http://www.genderhealth.org/files/uploads/change/publications/All_Women_Alll_Rights_Sex_Workers_Included_Report.pdf |publisher=Center for Health and Gender Equity}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, sex work, the consensual provision of sexual services for money or goods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Overs|first1=Cheryl|title=Sex Workers: Part of the Solution|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/vct/sw_toolkit/115solution.pdf|website=World Health Organization |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is criminalized. It is claimed that removing criminal prosecution for sex workers creates a safer and healthier environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Aziza|title=Feminism, power, and sex work in the context of HIV/Aids: consequences for women's health |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol341/225-258.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Gender|date=1 January 2011|volume=34|issue=1|page=225 |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows them to live with less social exclusion and stigma.

===Prohibitionism===
All aspects of prostitution are criminalised. Often the sex trade is seen as a violation of human dignity, moral or religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[Russia]]&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution – which stance to take?|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11596&amp;Lang=EN|website=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=7 March 2018|date=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Also known as "Criminalization".)&lt;ref name="All Women"/&gt;

===Abolitionism===
Whilst prostitution itself is legal, 3rd party involvement is generally prohibited. Solicit ion is also often prohibited. Whilst this model recognises prostitutes may chose work in the trade, it is morally wrong. Laws are designed to stop prostitution affecting the public.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[England]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

===Neo-abolitionism===
Neo-abolitionists believe there is no free choice for people entering prostitution, it violates their human rights and that prostitution is the sale and consumption of human bodies. Whilst prostitutes themselves commit no crime, clients and any third party involvement is criminalised.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[Sweden]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; (Also called the "Swedish model" or "Nordic model".)&lt;ref name="catwa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lse" /&gt;

===Legalization===
Whilst prostitution is not prohibited, there is legislation to control and regulate it.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The extent and type of control varies from country to country and may be regulated by work permits, licensing or tolerance zones.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. The [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; (also called "regulationist".)&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;

===Decriminalization===
Decriminalization is the removal of criminal penalties for sex work, and sex workers receive equal protection and recognition as workers in other industries.&lt;ref name="All Women"/&gt; e.g. [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

==Negative effects of criminalization==

===Health===
According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), sex workers are considered one of the key populations at risk for [[HIV]] infection,&lt;ref name="Sex work"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex work|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/sex_work/about/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sex workers who inject drugs are at even more risk due to unprotected sex, syringe sharing, alcohol or drug dependence, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61042-4/abstract |last1=Rusakova|first1=Maia|author2=Aliya Rakhmetova|author3=[[Steffanie A. Strathdee]]|title=Why are sex workers who use substances at risk for HIV|journal=The Lancet|date=17 January 2015|volume=385|issue=9964|pages=211–212 |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 October 2016 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61042-4|pmid=25059944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stigma, poverty, and exclusion from legal social services have increased their vulnerability to HIV infection.&lt;ref name="Sex work"/&gt;  Health risks and transmission of HIV as well as other [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) are increased in incidences where condom usage and accessibility is limited or used to identify and criminalize sex workers.  Many sex workers are managed by 'gatekeepers' who may be brothel owners, clients, or law enforcement figures, who often dictate condom usage.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.who.int/gender/documents/sexworkers.pdf |last=World Health Organization|title=Violence against sex workers and HIV prevention|journal=Information Bulletin Series|series=3 |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cambodia, a survey showed that 30% of sex workers who refused to put on condoms were sexually coerced. Fear of law enforcement and incarceration also discourages possession of condoms since they provide evidence for officers to prosecute and arrest.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"/&gt; Evidence suggests that HIV risk can be sharply reduced when sex workers are able to negotiate safer sex.&lt;ref name="New WHO guidelines"/&gt; Decriminalization of sex work decreases the risk of HIV infection by breaking down stigma  and increasing access to health services, reducing the risk of HIV/AIDS and STIs.&lt;ref name="New WHO guidelines"/&gt;

===Discrimination and stigma===

Sex workers experience significant stigma and discrimination as a result of criminalization.&lt;ref name="To Live Freely in This World"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mgabko|first1=Chi Adanna|title=To Live Freely in This World|date=January 2016|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781479849062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they consider sex work a legitimate income-generating activity, sex workers are viewed as immoral, deserving of punishment, and thus excluded from healthcare, education, and housing.&lt;ref name="New WHO guidelines"/&gt;&lt;ref name="To Live Freely in This World"/&gt; Criminalization laws exclude sex workers from health systems that provide access to preventative care such as condoms and regular HIV or STI testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global HIV/AIDS Response: Epidemic update and health sector progress towards Universal Access|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/progress_report2011/en/|publisher=World Health Organization, UNAIDS, UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights abuses===
Sex workers, as a population that suffers disproportionately from HIV/AIDS, are often denied many human rights such as the right to freedom from discrimination, equality before the law, the right to life, and the right to the highest attainable standard of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Right to Health|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Factsheet31.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203205100/http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/Factsheet31.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2016 |accessdate=29 October 2016 |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amnesty International publishes policy and research on protection of sex workers' rights|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/amnesty-international-publishes-policy-and-research-on-protection-of-sex-workers-rights/|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in more than 11 countries by [http://swannet.org Sex Workers' Rights Advocacy Network] (SWAN) concluded that more than 200 sex workers have experienced violence and discrimination.&lt;ref name=Violence&gt;{{cite book|last=Crago|first=Anna-Louise|title=Arrest the Violence|year=2009|publisher=Sex Workers' Rights Advocacy Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acts of violence toward sex workers often include abuse, rape, kidnappings, and sexual violence. Sex workers also face extortion and unlawful arrests and detention, which profoundly impact their mental, physical, and social wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scorgie|first1=Fiona|author2=Katie Vasey|author3=Eric Harper|author4=Marlise Richter|author5=Prince Nare|author6=Sian Maseko|author7=Matthew F Chersich|title=Human rights abuses and collective resilience among sex workers in four African countries: a qualitative study|journal=Globalization and Health|date=2013|volume=9|issue=33|pages=1–13 |deadurl=no |doi = 10.1186/1744-8603-9-33|pmid = 23889941|pmc=3750273}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult for sex workers to seek criminal justice when it is reported that many police officers are partaking in the sexual and violent abuse.  In Macedonia, police violence towards sex workers is particularly high: 82.4 percent of sex workers were assaulted by police in 2007.&lt;ref name="Violence"/&gt; Criminalization laws such as bans on buying, solicitation, and the general organization of sex work perpetuate an unsafe environment for sex workers, provide impunity for abusers, and prevent sex workers from reporting crime to the police.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

==Decriminalization and criminalization==
{{main article|Prostitution by region}}

===Canada===
Canada's prostitution law was challenged in 2012 by Terri-Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch, and Valerie Scott in the [[Bedford v. Canada]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sexworklawreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/canada_vs_bedford_140322.pdf|title=Canada v. Bedford: The Importance of the SCC Decision|last=Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They claimed that the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' prohibits sex workers from their labor rights because it permits sexual acts in exchange for money but criminalizes sex workers and their clients from communicating the exchange in a public setting. The plaintiffs argue that this is a violation of their constitutional right to freedom of expression and liberty and threatens their safety.   The case has now reached the Supreme Court of Canada and is supported by sex workers who believe it will eradicate the "whore stigma" that is often associated with sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Crystal|title=Why Decriminalizing Sex Work is Good for All Women|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/11/01/why-decriminalizing-sex-work-is-good-for-all-women/|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedford case had the impact of shifting Canada’s legal framework towards decriminalization, as the court recognized that these prohibitive criminal laws increase harm toward sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sexworklawreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/after_bedford_140322.pdf|title=AFTER BEDFORD: Developing a health and safety framework for sex workers and Canadian communities|last=Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url= |archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In 1999, Sweden passed a law that banned prostitution and criminalizes buyers.  Since the implementation of the law, supporters of this approach have claimed the number of prostitutes has decreased. Pye Jakobsson, a spokeswoman for the [http://www.rosealliance.se Rose Alliance] and a representation for sex workers, believes that this reduction in numbers may not particularly mean less prostitution, and that "You can't talk about protecting sex workers as well as saying the law is good, because it's driving prostitution and trafficking underground, which reduces social services' access to victims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hazel|last=Thompson|title=Prostitution: why Swedes believe they got it right|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/11/prostitution-sweden-model-reform-men-pay-sex |accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish example is often cited as a form of partial criminalization, rather than decriminalization, since the purchasing of sex remains a crime.&lt;ref name="All Women"/&gt; Both the Swedish Government and sex workers agree that this model has increased stigma against sex workers, however the Swedish Government views this as a positive outcome – arguing that sending a message about sex work is more important. Sex workers have reported a number of human rights violations as a direct result of these laws, including the deportation of sex workers (even EU citizens), increased evictions and vulnerability to homelessness and high rates of discrimination from authorities including police and social services. 

===Denmark===
In Denmark, prostitution was decriminalized in 1999, allowing for both selling and buying of sex to be legal as long as both participants are above the age of 18.  Brothels and pimping, however, still remain illegal in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Countries and Their Prostitution Policy|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000772#denmark |publisher=ProCon.org |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, sex workers were permitted to work as long as it was not their only source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dane fights for state-funded sex|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4309012.stm|accessdate=16 December 2013 |newspaper=BBC News|date=5 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nevada, USA===
The legalization of brothels in Nevada has shown that sex workers are better protected and are in less danger of health risks.&lt;ref name=nevada&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brents|first=Barbara G.|author2=Hausbeck, Kathryn|title=Violence and Legalized Brothel Prostitution in Nevada|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=March 2005|volume=20|issue=3|pages=270–295|url=http://esplerp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Violence-and-Legalized-Brothel-Prostitution-in-Nevada.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2013 |doi=10.1177/0886260504270333 |pmid=15684138|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.7766}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of precautions are taking to ensure the safety of the sex workers, such as a voice-recorded documentation of the negotiation that establishes the amount and payment before any trade occurs.  Many brothels also have a panic button that will alert the manager which is located in an accessible location, often above at the head or side of the bed.  Furthermore, the brothels in Nevada have established an ally relationship with law enforcement in cases where back-up was needed for troublesome customers.&lt;ref name=nevada /&gt;

===New South Wales, Australia===
Laws covering sex work in Australia are state and territory based, with different regulations in different places. New South Wales decriminalised sex work in 1995, after the Wood Royal Commission into Police Corruption showed that police were inappropriate regulators of the sex industry.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/laws/nsw/ NSW: Decriminalisation since 1995]". Scarlet Alliance, Australian Sex workers Association.&lt;/ref&gt; A governmental review in 2016 resulted in continuing support of decriminalisation of sex work "as the best way of protecting sex workers and maintaining a more transparent sex work industry".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/media/News_Item.2016-05-10.1825 WORLD RENOWNED, BEST PRACTICE MODEL OF SEX WORK DECRIMINALISATION TO REMAIN IN NSW 10 May 2016]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{See|Education in Ghana}}

Primary and junior secondary school education is tuition-free and mandatory. Since 1987, the Government of Ghana has increased its education budget by 700%. Basic education's share has grown from 45% to 60% of that total. 

Students begin their 6-year primary education at age six. They pass into a junior secondary school system for 3 years of academic training combined with technical and vocational training. Those continuing move into the 3-year senior secondary school program. Entrance to one of the five Ghanaian universities is by examination following completion of senior secondary school.

==Demographic trends==

Ghana's first postindependence population census in 1961 counted about 6.7 million inhabitants.&lt;ref name=population&gt;Owusa-Ansah, David. "Population". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ghtoc.html A Country Study: Ghana]'' (La Verle Berry, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (November 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1965 and 1989, a constant 45 percent of Ghana total female population was of childbearing age.&lt;ref name=population/&gt; 

The crude death rate of 18 per 1,000 population in 1965 fell to 13 per 1,000 population in 1992. Life expectancy rose from a 1992 average of forty-two years for men and forty-five years for women to fifty-two and fifty-six years in 2002. The fertility rate averaged two children per adult female in 2013.&lt;ref name=population/&gt;

== Demographic history ==
===Population distribution===

Population density increased steadily from thirty-six per square kilometer in 1970 to fifty-two per square kilometer in 1984. In 1990 sixty-three persons per square kilometer was the estimate for Ghana's overall population density. These averages did not reflect variations in population distribution. For example, while the Northern Region, one of ten administrative regions, showed a density of seventeen persons per square kilometer in 1984, in the same year Greater Accra Region recorded nine times the national average of fifty-two per square kilometer.&lt;ref name=distribution&gt;Owusa-Ansah, David. "Population Distribution". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ghtoc.html A Country Study: Ghana]'' (La Verle Berry, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (November 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

As was the case in the 1960 and 1970 figures, the greatest concentration of population in 1984 was to the south of the [[Kwahu Plateau]]. The highest concentration of habitation continued to be within the Accra-Kumasi-Takoradi triangle, largely because of the economic productivity of the region. All of Ghana's mining centers, timber-producing deciduous forests, and cocoa-growing lands lie to the south of the Kwahu Plateau. The Accra-Kumasi-Takoradi triangle is linked to the coast by rail and road systems—making this area an important magnet for investment and labor.&lt;ref name=distribution&gt;Owusa-Ansah, David. "Population Distribution". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ghtoc.html A Country Study: Ghana]'' (La Verle Berry, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (November 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A large part of the [[Volta Basin]] is sparsely populated. The far north is heavily populated. The population density of the Upper East Region is well above the national average. This may be explained in part by the better soil found in some areas.&lt;ref name=distribution/&gt;

===Urban-rural disparities===

Localities of 5,000 persons and above have been classified as urban since 1960. The 1960 urban population totalled 1,551,174 persons, or 23.1 percent of total population. By 1970 the urban percentage had increased to 28 percent. That percentage rose to 32 in 1984 and was estimated at 33 percent for 1992.&lt;ref name=urd&gt;Owusa-Ansah, David. "Urban-Rural Disparities". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ghtoc.html A Country Study: Ghana]'' (La Verle Berry, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (November 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban areas in Ghana have customarily been supplied with more amenities than rural locations. Consequently, Kumasi, Accra, and many settlements within the southern economic belt attracted more people than the savanna regions of the north; only Tamale in the north has been an exception. The linkage of the national electricity grid to the northern areas of the country in the late 1980s may help to stabilize the north-to-south flow of internal migration.&lt;ref name=urd/&gt;

Ghana has continued to be a nation of rural communities. Rural residency was estimated to be 67 percent of the population in 1992. In the 1970s, 72 percent of Ghana's population lived in rural areas.&lt;ref name=urd/&gt; The "Rural Manifesto," which assessed the causes of rural underdevelopment, was introduced in April 1984. Development strategies were evaluated, and some were implemented to make rural residency more attractive. The Bank of Ghana established more than 120 rural banks to support rural entrepreneurs, and the rural electrification program was intensified in the late 1980s. The government presented its plans for district assemblies as a component of its strategy for rural improvement through decentralized administration.&lt;ref name=urd/&gt;

The '''Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research''' is given annually by [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] to honor the work of an active scientist in academia, industry or a scientific institute in the field of biomedical research. It was established in 2004 and perpetuates the memory of [[Paul Janssen]], the founder of [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]], a Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://www.pauljanssenaward.com/| title=The Paul Janssen Award |publisher=Janssen Global Services|accessdate= 24 November 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== The Award ==
The Dr. Paul Janssen Award includes a $200,000 prize and acknowledges the work of an individual who has made a significant, transformational contribution toward the improvement of human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pauljanssenaward.com/about-the-award |title=About the Award |website=Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research |access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] created the award in 2004 with the following goals:
* To honor the memory of Janssen, his dedication to excellence and his leadership of young scientists
* To promote, recognize and reward passion and creativity in biomedical research
* To underscore [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]'s commitment to scientific excellence in the advancement of healthcare knowledge, while fulfilling its responsibility in the community

== Paul Adriaan Jan Janssen (1926 - 2003) ==
Known to his colleagues as “Dr. Paul,” Janssen was the founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V., a pharmaceutical research laboratory based in [[Beerse]], [[Belgium]], and a physician-scientist who helped save millions of lives through his contribution to the discovery and development of more than 80 medicines.  His work was responsible for many breakthroughs in several fields of disease, including [[pain]] management, [[psychiatry]], [[infectious disease]] and [[gastroenterology]].  In addition, he has more than 100 patents to his name.

== Selection Process ==
The award recipients are selected by an independent committee of scientists from leading academic and scientific institutions, whose own research contributions have resulted in critical advances in improving human health. The 2010 Selection Committee includes past Nobel Laureates, members of the National Academy of Sciences and previous winners of The Dr. Paul Janssen Award.
 
The Selection Committee chooses a scientist in basic or clinical research, who:
* Has made a significant contribution to research that has impacted, or has strong potential to impact, human health through the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of disease
* Exhibits the standards of innovation, insight and leadership that Janssen exemplified during his career
* Provides a living example that the study of science and technology can enable or has the potential to enable extended, healthy, productive life
* Displays a set of ethical values consistent with the [http://www.jnj.com/connect/about-jnj/jnj-credo/ Johnson &amp; Johnson Credo] and those values that guide [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]

The  award can be given to a scientist in academia, government, industry, a private research institution or medical or clinical practice.  It typically will recognize an individual scientist, but can be shared if the contributions of the nominees are considered to have similar importance.

'''Finland-Swedish Sign Language''' (FinSSL) is a moribund Deaf [[sign language]] in [[Finland]]. It is now used only in private settings by older adults who attended the only Swedish school for the deaf in Finland (in [[Porvoo]]/Borgå), which was established in the mid 19th century but closed in 1993. Some 90 persons have it as their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Westerlund, Elin | title= Det finlandssvenska teckenspråket är utrotningshotad | newspaper=Hufvudstadsbladet | date=3 August 2018 | pages=8–11 | url=http://www.hbl.fi/artikel/det-finlandssvenska-teckenspraket-utrotningshotat/ | language=Swedish | url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; FinSSL is said to be a distinct language; however, "Finland-Swedish Deaf have few problems understanding [[Finnish Sign Language|Finnish signers]]".&lt;ref name="Londen 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Londen|first1=Monica|title=Communicational and educational choices for minorities within minorities: The case of the Finland-Swedish deaf|date=2004|publisher=Helsinki University Press|isbn=952-10-0812-1|url=http://www.cultura-sorda.eu/resources/Londen_Communicational_educational_minorities_case_Finland_Swedich_deaf_2004.pdf|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been, moreover, continuous input from [[Swedish Sign Language]] over its history.

==Sources of data==
During the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial period]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] colonial officials conducted [[censuses]] in some of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that included enumerations by race.&lt;ref name="census5"&gt;U.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, Bicentennial Edition, Part 2, Series Z 1–19. [http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/CT1970p2-13.pdf Chapter Z: Colonial and Pre-Federal Statistics].  Washington, D.C., 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[tax]] lists and other [[reports]] provided additional data and information about the racial demographics of the Thirteen Colonies during this time period.&lt;ref name="census5"/&gt;

People have been enumerated by race in every [[United States Census]] since [[U.S. Census, 1790|the first one in 1790]].&lt;ref name=WorkingPaper56&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |title=Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States |first=Campbell |last=Gibson |author2=Kay Jung |publisher=Population Division,  U.

==Historical trends==
The Black (African American) population was non-existent in 1610, but increased rapidly after 1620 with the implementation of the [[slave trade]] in colonial areas which later became parts of the United States.&lt;ref name="census5"/&gt; African Americans ([[Black people|Blacks]]) made up almost one-fifth of the United States population in 1790, but their percentage of the total U.S. population declined in almost every U.S. census until [[U.S. Census, 1930|1930]].&lt;ref name="census1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/tab01.pdf |title=Table 1.

a{{note|BlackPop}} These population estimates include a small number of Native Americans/[[Amerindians|Indians]] as part of the Black/Negro population throughout this time period (1610–1780).&lt;ref name="census5"/&gt;&lt;!-- The source indicates that a few numbers for "Negro" population (not "Black") for a minority of the colonies included some "Indians" (not Native Americans). Further, it indicates that some "Indians" were counted as such, again in a minority of the colonies. A further wrinkle that ought to be noted is that mulattoes were sometimes enumerated separately in colonial censuses, sometimes included with Negroes, and sometimes not mentioned (so researchers can't tell how they were classified.) --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
b{{note|NatAmPop}} While all Native Americans in the United States were only counted as part of the (total) U.S. population since 1890, the U.S. Census Bureau previously either enumerated or made estimates of the non-taxed Native American population (which was not counted as a part of the U.S. population before 1890) for the 1860–1880 time period. The combined taxed and non-taxed Native American population in the United States was 339,421 in [[United States Census, 1860|1860]], 313,712 in [[United States Census, 1870|1870]], and 306,543 in [[United States Census, 1880|1880]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/summer/indian-census.html |title=Native Americans in the Census, 1860–1890 |publisher=Archives.gov |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
c{{note|Multiracial}} Data on race from the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Censuses are not directly comparable with those from the 1990 census and previous censuses due, in large part, to giving respondents the option to report more than one race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/census2000/raceqandas.html |title=Questions and Answers for Census 2000 Data on Race |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black population as a percentage of the total population by U.S. region and state (1790–2010)==
Many Southern U.S. states historically had African Americans compose 35% or more of their total population(s), with three of them (Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina) even having an African American majority at certain periods in their history. In contrast, the African American percentage of the total population in other parts of the U.S. (outside of the South) was historically almost always in the single digits (0.0% to 9.9%). Even after the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], no or almost no U.S. state outside of the Southern U.S. has ever had an African American percentage of its total population be greater than 16%.

===Free Blacks as a percentage out of the total Black population by U.S. region and U.S. state between 1790 and 1860===
In 1865, all enslaved Blacks (African-Americans) in the United States were emancipated as a result of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. However, some U.S. states had previously emancipated some or all of their Black population. The table below shows the percentage of free Blacks as a percentage of the total Black population in various U.S. regions and U.S. states between 1790 and 1860 (the blank areas on the chart below mean that there is no data for those specific regions or states in those specific years).

==Mexican (1910–1930) and Hispanic/Latino (1940–2010) population as a percentage of the total population by U.S. region and state==
Historically, the U.S. states with the largest Mexican/Hispanic/Latino populations were primarily located in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern states]], [[Texas]], and [[Florida]]. However, the percentage of the Hispanic/Latino population has dramatically increased in many U.S. states both inside and outside the Southwest in recent decades.

====White (non-Hispanic)====
The natural increase is slightly smaller than shown for non-Hispanic whites and slightly different for non-Hispanic blacks because the birth figures shown refer to mothers of that race, not the children. Most non-white babies of non-Hispanic white mothers are either Hispanic or black, and non-Hispanic black mothers occasionally have Hispanic children. On the other hand, all children born to Hispanic mothers, even if the mothers are white Hispanic, are counted as Hispanic.&lt;br&gt;

=== ''Hispanics'' (of all racial groups) ===
*Notes: Estimates for the population of each race by year (available starting in 2000) do not include multiracial individuals which have been "bridged" to the single-race categories for the purposes of calculating the birth and fertility rates.
New Hampshire did not start reporting Hispanic origin until 1993, and Oklahoma until 1991, so data from those states are excluded before then.&lt;br&gt;

[[File:Abandoned homeless shelter Mawson Canberra.JPG|thumb|Abandoned homeless shelter [[Mawson, Australian Capital Territory|Mawson, ACT]]]]
'''Homelessness in Australia''' is a social issue concerning the number of people in Australia that are considered to be homeless. There are no internationally agreed upon definitions of homelessness, making it difficult to compare levels of homelessness across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homelessness, the homeless, and integrated social services|year=2015|pages=111–164|doi=10.1787/9789264233775-7-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of people experiencing [[homelessness]] long-term in [[Australia]] are found in the large cities of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Perth]]. It is estimated that on any given night approximately 105,000 people will be homeless&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/ceos-brave-cold-to-help-homeless-20100617-yjx7.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Leah | last=McLennan | title=CEOs brave cold to help homeless | date=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many more are living in insecure housing, "one step away from being homeless".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.homelessnessaustralia.org.au/index.php/42-news/146-homelessness-week-homelessness-counts |title=#HomelessnessCounts during Homelessness Week 2016, 1-7 August |access-date=2017-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319112754/http://www.homelessnessaustralia.org.au/index.php/42-news/146-homelessness-week-homelessness-counts |archive-date=2017-03-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who does not obtain any shelter is often described as sleeping 'rough'.

A person is considered to be homeless in Australia if they:
*do not have access to safe, secure adequate housing, or, if the only housing they have access to damages, or is likely to damage, their health.
*are in circumstances which threaten or adversely affect the adequacy, safety, security, or affordability of their home.
*have no security of tenure – that is, they have no legal right to continued occupation of their living area.

==2011 census homelessness figures==
There were 105,237 people experiencing homelessness in Australia on [[census]] night in 2011. This equated to 1 in 200 Australians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/2049.0|title=2049.0 -  Census of Population and Housing: Estimating homelessness, 2011|work=abs.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and represented an increase of 17% from the 2006 census, with the rate of homelessness increasing from 45 per 10,000 to 49 per 10,000.

People who are homeless in Australia are classified into one of six categories. These are:
*improvised dwellings, tents, sleepers out
*supported accommodation
*people staying with other households
*boarding houses
*other temporary lodgings 
*severely overcrowded dwellings.

56% of people experiencing homelessness on census night were male and 44% female. Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islands|Torres Strait Islander]] Australians were over-represented in homelessness data making up 25% of the homeless population, compared to 2.5% of the Australian population. 30% of those experiencing homelessness were born overseas above the % of the Australian population.

From 2006 to 2011 the number of people sleeping 'rough' decreased from 9% of the homeless population to 6%. There was also a significant increase (23%) in the number of people staying in homelessness services.
==2016 census homelessness figures==
The number of homeless people in Australia jumped by more than 14,000 — or 14 per cent — in the five years to 2016, according to census data. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said 116,000 people were homeless on census night in 2016, representing 50 homeless people per 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-14/homelessness-in-australia-jumps-14pc-over-five-year-period/9547786&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many causes of homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homelessness is a Human Rights Issue|url=http://humanrights.gov.au/human_rights/housing/homelessness_2008.html#3|publisher=Australian Human Rights Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forell|first=S |author2=McCarron, E |author3=Schetzer, L |title=No home, no justice?

Some other reasons for homelessness are: addictions,
exiting care (foster care system or prison system), barriers facing refugees, debt, disability, unemployment, lack of support, blacklisting, poverty, and being kicked out of home.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Some of the current homeless population in Australia were previously in large-scale residential institutions for the mentally ill.  [[Deinstitutionalisation]] of people with mentally illnesses began in Australia during the 1980s, and most now live in the general community.

===Costs===
It has been estimated that a single homeless person costs the government $30,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Natasha. “Homelessness hits top suburbs as housing affordability takes its toll.” The Australian. September 23, 2014. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/homelessness-hits-top-suburbs-as-housing-affordability-takes-its-toll/news-story/a163948db06b8e4c45c71ca48f154691 (Retrieved February 3, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Road Home focuses future effort and investment into three strategies:

# Turning Off the Tap: Early intervention services to prevent homelessness. 
# Improving and expanding services which aim to end homelessness: Ensuring that Services are more connected, integrated and responsive to achieve sustainable housing, improve social and economic participation and end homelessness for their clients. 
# Breaking the Cycle: Ensuring that people who become homeless are able to quickly move through the crisis system into stable housing with the support they need so that homelessness does not recur.

===Affordable housing===
The Council of Australian Governments (COAG)'s National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA) subject to provisions of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations, defines and measures housing and homelessness services for the Commonwealth and the States and Territories.&lt;ref name=NAHAaummary&gt;{{cite report|title=National Affordable Housing Agreement|publisher=The Council of Australian Governments|url=http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/47884/National_Affordable_Housing_Agreement.pdf|format=PDF|date=|access-date=2013-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102104/http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/47884/National_Affordable_Housing_Agreement.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-27|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Rudd announced that NAHA would "deliver more longer-term housing for Australians who are homeless, more public and community housing and build and renew run down and overcrowded housing for Indigenous Australians living in remote areas."&lt;ref name=RoadHome2008 /&gt; NAHA's manadate includes a) social housing; assistance to people in the private rental market; support and accommodation for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness; and home purchase assistance; b) (b) working towards improving coordination across housing related programs to make better use of existing stock and under-utilised Government assets and achieve better integration between housing and human services, including health and disability services; and c) reducing the rate of homelessness."&lt;ref name=NAHAaummary /&gt;

===National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness (NPAH)===
Since 2008, the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness (NPAH) was formed to allow the Commonwealth Government to provide matching funding to hundreds of homelessness services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coag.gov.au/housing_and_homelessness |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020000627/http://www.coag.gov.au/housing_and_homelessness |archivedate=2016-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the federal funding, states and territories typically match the Commonwealth’s contribution. The total annual NPAH funding is around $250 million per year which is directed to around 800 homelessness services around Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dss.gov.au/housing-support/programmes-services/national-partnership-agreement-on-homelessness|title=National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness - Department of Social Services, Australian Government|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, homelessness services across Australia began a #SaveNPAH campaign to ensure the Australian Government renews the funding package past 2017. The services stated that without the funding, services would be forced to cut back on essential programs and thousands of Australians would become homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savenpah.org/|title=NPAH Campaign|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/11/03/tsunami-of-homelessness-feared-as-sector-pleads-for-more-cash/|title='Tsunami Of Homelessness' Feared As Underfunded Services Plead For More Cash|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vinnies.org.au/page/News/National_Media_Releases/St_Vincent_de_Paul_Society_calls_for_certainty_and_strengthening_of_homelessness_funding/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220230255/https://www.vinnies.org.au/page/News/National_Media_Releases/St_Vincent_de_Paul_Society_calls_for_certainty_and_strengthening_of_homelessness_funding/ |archivedate=2016-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The #SaveNPAH campaign succeeded in part, with the Australian government committing to a one year extension of funding.&lt;ref&gt;http://chp.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NPAH-extension-media-release-161209.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/09/coag-agenda-turnbull-gives-ground-on-homelessness-and-family-violence|title=Coag agenda: Turnbull gives ground on homelessness and family violence|first=Paul|last=Karp|date=8 December 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State Government initiatives===
In South Australia, the State Government of Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) committed substantial funding to a series of initiatives designed to combat homelessness. Advised by Social Inclusion Commissioner [[David Cappo]] and the founder of New York's Common Ground program, [[Rosanne Haggerty]] , the Rann Government established Common Ground Adelaide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commongroundadelaide.org.au|title=Common Ground|work=commongroundadelaide.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; building high quality inner city apartments (combined with intensive support) for "rough sleeping" homeless people. The government also funded the Street to Home program and a hospital liaison service designed to assist homeless people who are admitted to the Emergency Departments of Adelaide's major public hospitals. Rather than being released back into homelessness, patients identified as rough sleepers are found accommodation backed by professional support. Common Ground and Street to Home now operate across Australia in other States.

===Ask Izzy===
Ask Izzy is a mobile website which connects people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. They provide  essential services such as meals, housing, support and counseling. The website was developed by Infoxchange in partnership with Google, REA Group and News Corp. &lt;ref&gt;GILLETT, CHRISTOPHER.

==Youth homelessness==
{{See|Youth homelessness}}
In the mid-1970s, evidence began to emerge that the traditional homelessness population predominantly consisting of middle aged or older males was changing. Instead, younger people began emerging in surveys of the homeless population. This change is attributed to the disproportionately high unemployment rates among young people at the time, inadequate unemployment benefits (particularly for teens who had left school), burgeoning inflation rates and increasing housing and rent costs. This change in demographic increased the demands made on the non-government welfare sector to accommodate homeless youth.&lt;ref&gt;Fopp, Rodney. [https://acys.takeflight.net.au/documents/332/NYARS_Long_term_Accommodation_for_Young_People_OCR.pdf "Long-term accommodation for young people."] ''National Youth Affairs Research Scheme''. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Census in Australia#2006|2006 census]], there were over 44,000 young people experiencing homelessness. This means that about 43% of the Australian homeless population are infants, children or youth under the age of 25.  A particularly common form of youth homelessness in Australia is "couch surfing" whereby the person experiencing homelessness relies on the support of friends to sleep on their couch or floor.&lt;ref name="TheSydneyMorningHerald_13April2010_couch-surfing-risky-for-homeless-youth"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/couch-surfing-risky-for-homeless-youth-20100413-s74y.html |title= Couch Surfing Risky for Homeless Youth|last=Morello|first=Vincent|date=2010-04-13|publisher=www.smh.com.au [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Relationship breakdown and family conflict are often cited as common instigators of youth homelessness.&lt;ref name="OnLineOpinion_9April2010_the-young-and-the-homeless"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=10256|title= The Young and the Homeless|last=Seymour|first=George|date=2010-04-09|publisher=www.onlineopinion.com.au [[On Line Opinion]]|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Youth Homelessness Matters Day]] is an annual event run across Australia that highlights youth homelessness and associated issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthhomelessnessmatters.net/|title=Welcome from NYCH|work=youthhomelessnessmatters.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth refuges===
Youth refuges started appearing in Australia in the 1970s as a community based response to youth homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;Barratt, Sam. "Youth refuge: Towards diversity and specialisation?." Parity 25, no. 3 (2012): 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

* New South Wales &amp;ndash; In 1979 eighteen youth refuges in NSW, including [[Caretakers Cottage]], [[Taldumande Youth Services]], [[Detour House|Young People's Refuge]] among others, founded a peak body organisation to represent themselves to government. The peak body was named the [[Yfoundations|Youth Refuge Action Group]] (YRAG) (later the name was changed several times over the years, including YRA, YRAA, YAA, and presently, Yfoundations).&lt;ref name=coffey1&gt;Coffey, Michael.

[[Republic of the Congo|The Republic of the Congo]] (ROC) is a destination and transit country for children subjected to [[human trafficking|trafficking in persons]] for the purposes of [[forced labor]] and [[forced prostitution]]. Most sources agree that up to 80 percent of all [[Trafficking of children|trafficked children]] originate from Benin, with girls comprising 90 percent of that group.&lt;ref name="dos" /&gt; [[prostitution in Togo|Togo]], [[prostitution in Mali|Mali]], [[prostitution in Guinea|Guinea]], [[prostitution in Cameroon|Cameroon]], [[Prostitution in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[prostitution in Senegal|Senegal]] are also sources of victims found in the Congolese Republic. Internally trafficked children represent 10 percent of all child victims, the majority of which originate from the Pool region. Many child victims are subjected to forced labor, including in [[domestic work]], market vending and fishing; girls are also exploited in the [[sex trade]]. Child victims generally experience harsh treatment, long work hours, and almost no access to education or [[health services]]; they receive little or no remuneration for their work. Other village children, however, live voluntarily with extended relatives in cities, attend school, and do housework in exchange for food, in a traditional cultural and familial pattern that does not entail [[child abuse|abuse]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The [[Government of the Republic of the Congo]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. The [[Senate of the Republic of the Congo|Senate]] passed the Child Protection Code in August 2009, which prescribes penalties for trafficking offenders; this law is pending [[President of Congo|Presidential]] signature. The government also developed and began implementation of a national anti-trafficking action plan, and the Ministry of Labor investigated nine new cases of child trafficking in 2009. However, eight [[prosecution]]s based on child trafficking charges filed one or two years ago remained pending and did not come to conclusion or result in [[conviction]]s. The government did not identify trafficking victims in 2009. Most of the government’s anti-trafficking activities remain dependent on international donor funding.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Republic of the Congo". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. State Department]]'s [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 3"]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of the ROC demonstrated minimal [[law enforcement]] efforts to combat trafficking during the reporting period. The government neither prosecuted trafficking offenses nor convicted trafficking offenders in 2009. The Child Protection Law, which prohibits and prescribes punishment for child trafficking, was passed by the Senate in August 2009, but is still pending Presidential signature. Chapter 2 Article 60 of this [[law]] prohibits the trafficking, [[Sale of children|sale]], trading, and [[child exploitation|exploitation of children]], and Article 115 prescribes penalties of [[hard labor]] and a fine of between approximately $1,978 and $19,790. [[Pimp]]ing of children is punishable under Penal Code Article 344, but its weak prescribed penalty of up to two years’ imprisonment and a fine is neither sufficiently stringent nor commensurate with penalties prescribed by Congolese law for other serious [[crime]]s, such as [[rape]]. The trafficking of adults is not covered under Congolese law. The Ministry of Labor investigated, but did not prosecute, nine new cases of child trafficking in 2009. Eight prosecutions based on child trafficking charges filed one or two years ago remained pending, and none resulted in a conviction. The Ministry of Social Affairs sustained partnerships with local NGOs and [[UNICEF]] to provide training to 40 of the ministry’s investigators on recognizing victims of trafficking and to support judicial clinics. In addition, the government partnered with UNICEF to provide training to an unknown number of police officers during the year to recognize cases of trafficking. The government showed no evidence of involvement in or tolerance of trafficking on any level.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The ROC government provided minimal protection services to trafficking victims, and did not identify any victims during the reporting period. Investigators employed by the Ministry of Social Affairs reportedly utilized a formal identification and registration process to assist victims of trafficking. The government did not ensure that victims were provided access to care facilities, except through funding of the shelter, Espace Jarot, which provided care for a small number of at-risk children, including trafficking victims; in practice, few victims had access to care facilities. In partnership with representatives of the consulates of Benin, Togo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, police and other law enforcement officials formed a working group to identify trafficking patterns and to facilitate the return of trafficked children to their home countries, but have not yet utilized the group to [[repatriation|repatriate]] any child victims. Foreign victims had the same access to the center as Congolese nationals, though there was no access to legal, [[medical care|medical]], or [[psychological counseling|psychological services]]. Some legal services were available to trafficking victims through six child judicial clinics hosted by staff from the Ministries of Social Affairs, [[Ministry of Justice (Republic of Congo)|Justice]], and Health; trafficking victims may file administrative claims against their alleged traffickers at these clinics. Though there is at least one clinic located in each region run by government civil servants and lawyers, they are neither open on a regular basis nor operate with regular business hours; it is unknown whether these clinics provided legal services to child trafficking victims during the year. The government offers foreign trafficking victims [[temporary residency]] status as an alternative to immediate repatriation, but is not known to have used these provisions in 2009. Trafficking victims were not usually jailed or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Some victims, however, were detained, [[arrest]]ed, or held in [[protective custody]], and did not benefit from any formal referral process to institutions offering short or long-term care. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, but many elected not to participate in these law enforcement actions due to fear of possible [[Revenge|retribution]] from traffickers or because they did not consider their offenders as guilty. The government did not provide services for repatriated Congolese victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government maintained its efforts begun in 2008 to raise awareness and build support for combating human trafficking in the Brazzaville and Pointe Noire areas. In 2009, the Ministry of Health (MOH), in partnership with UNICEF, launched an anti-trafficking public awareness campaign in Pointe Noire involving not only government officials, but also security and diplomatic staff from the consulates of neighboring countries and leaders from local Muslim and Christian communities. Organizers made full use of banners – the most common advertising medium – to stress the point that human trafficking is illegal and will be punished. In April 2010, the Minister of Social Affairs and Humanitarian Action co-hosted with UNICEF a conference in Pointe Noire to highlight the problem of trafficking in children. Also during the reporting period, the MOH, with support from UNICEF, also began implementation of the government’s 2009–2010 National Plan of Action. Under this plan, UNICEF trained MOH representatives to serve as trainers; these trainers then presented anti-trafficking workshops to local NGOs. The government did not monitor [[International migration|migration]] patterns for trafficking, and it did not take measures to reduce the demand for [[commercial sex acts]] during the reporting period. The ROC is not a party to the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|2000 UN TIP Protocol]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The '''Kapampangan people''' ({{lang-pam|Taung Kapampangan}}), also known as '''Pampangueños''' or '''Pampangos''', are the fifth largest [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnolinguistic group]] in the [[Philippines]], numbering about 2.89 million. They live mainly in the [[provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] of [[Pampanga]], [[Bataan]] and [[Tarlac]], as well as [[Bulacan]], [[Nueva Ecija]] and [[Zambales]].

==Overview==
[[File:Tarik Sulayman.png|thumb|left|[[Tarik Sulayman]], a prominent Kapampangan leader from [[Macabebe, Pampanga|Macabebe]] who fought against the Spanish in the [[Battle of Bankusay Channel]] in June 1571.]]
[[File:Rufino J. Cardinal Santos Portrait.jpg|thumb|Rufino Cardinal Santos: the first Filipino to be named cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.]]The [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Pampanga]] is traditional homeland of the Kapampangans. Once occupying a vast stretch of land that extended from [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]]&lt;ref&gt;Loarca, Miguel de, ''Relación de las Yslas Filipinas'', Blair and Robertson volume 5, page 34–187&lt;/ref&gt; to the rest of [[Central Luzon]], huge chunks of territories were carved out of Pampanga so as to create the provinces of Bulacan, Bataan, Nueva Ecija, Aurora and Tarlac.&lt;ref name="Henson"&gt;Henson, Mariano A. 1965. ''The Province of Pampanga and Its Towns: A.D. 1300-1965''. 4th ed. revised. Angeles City: By the author.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Kapampangans now populate a region that extends beyond the political boundaries of the small province of Pampanga. In the province of [[Tarlac]], the indigenous population of [[Tarlac City]] and the municipalities of [[Bamban]], [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]] and [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]] are Kapampangans, while the municipalities of [[Victoria, Tarlac|Victoria]], [[La Paz, Tarlac|La Paz]], have a significant Kapampangan population. In [[Bataan]], Kapampangans populate the municipalities of [[Dinalupihan]] and [[Hermosa, Bataan|Hermosa]], and the [[barangay]]s of [http://www.tageo.com/index-e-rp-v-07-d-m3356371.htm?Mabatang Mabatang] in [[Abucay]] and [http://travelingluck.com/Asia/Philippines/Bataan/_1709737_Calaguiman.html#local_map Calaguiman] in [[Samal, Bataan|Samal]]. Kapampangans can be found scattered all across the southern barrios of Cabiao in the province of [[Nueva Ecija]] and in the western section of the province of [[Bulacan]]. Kapampangan enclaves still exist in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] and other parts of the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]]. Kapampangans have also migrated to [[Mindoro]], [[Palawan]] and [[Mindanao]] and have formed strong Kapampangan organizations called '''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090208213940/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Pampangan/aguman aguman]''' in [[Davao City]] and [[General Santos City]]. Agumans based in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] are active in the revival of the Kapampangan language and culture. California-based organizations promoted Kapampangan language and culture and raised funds for charitable and cultural projects in California and in Pampanga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.andropampanga.com/profile.htm | title=Recipient of the PHS Centennial Outstanding Alumnus Award in the Field of Accountancy 2008 Recipient of the City of San Fernando, Pampanga's Outstanding Fernandino Award in the Field of Culture 2011 | publisher=andropampanga | accessdate=February 19, 2014 | author=Camiling Alejandro S. | pages=1st page on the 6th paragraph | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100106150849/http://www.andropampanga.com/profile.htm | archivedate = January 6, 2010 | dead-url = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kapampangans have produced many Rajahs, Datus, four Philippine presidents, three chief justices, a senate president, the first Filipino cardinal, one Huk Supremo, many Huk Commanders and NPA cadres and many personalities in public service, education, diplomacy, journalism, the arts and sciences, entertainment and business.

The oldest artifact ever found in the Province of Pampanga is a 5000-year-old stone adze found in Candaba. It is said to be a tool used in building boats. Earthenware and tradeware dating back to 1500 BC have also been found in Candaba and Porac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/feature/2011/07/30/early-kapampangan-civilization-traced-candaba-169944 | title=Early Kapampangan civilization traced in Candaba | publisher=sunstar publication | date=July 30, 2011| accessdate=February 19, 2014 | author=Mapiles Herbert P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farming and fishing were the main industries of the Kapampangan people.

Kapampangans have played a dynamic yet conflicting role in Philippine history. It was the Kapampangans of [[Macabebe]] who were formerly Muslim were the first to defend the Luzon Empire from Spanish domination in 1571.&lt;ref name="Gaspar de San Agustin"&gt;Gaspar de San Agustin, ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas 1565-1615'', Translated by Luis Antonio Mañeru, 1st bilingual ed [Spanish and English], published by Pedro Galende, OSA: Intramuros, Manila, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it was the Kapampangans that the Spaniards relied on to defend their new colony from the Dutch. It was at this time that "one Castillan plus three Kapampangans" were considered as "four Castillans" as long they gallantly served in the colonial armed forces. Such behaviour earned them the stereotype of being quislings in exchange for personal wealth and self-aggrandisement all throughout the archipelago.&lt;ref name="Gaspar de San Agustin"/&gt; After their successful battle against the Dutch in 1640, only Kapampangans were allowed to study side by side with the Spaniards in exclusive Spanish academies and universities in Manila, by order of Governor-General Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera.&lt;ref name="Henson"/&gt; In 1896, Kapampangans were one of the principal ethnic groups to push and fuel the Philippine revolution against Spain. Yet it was also the Kapampangans of Macabebe that fiercely defended the last Spanish garrison against the revolutionaries.

With the outbreak of World War II, Japanese planes invaded the main province of Pampanga and attacked the United States Air Base at Clark Field in Angeles, Pampanga on December 8, 1941. Later Japanese soldiers entered the province of Pampanga on 1942 and the Japanese Occupation formally began.

Many Kapampangans joined a group of stronghold soldiers that survived the invasion and officially trained under the 31st Infantry Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army. [[USAFFE]] was stationed in [[Pampanga]] on July 26, 1941 before the surrender by the Japanese to April 9, 1942. After the Battle of Bataan in 1942, some Kapampangan soldiers of the [[31st Division (Philippines)|USAFFE 31st Infantry Division]] fought four years of battles against Japanese troops. After the fall of Bataan on April 9, 1942, many Kapampangan soldiers of the USAFFE 31st Division surrendered to the Japanese and then participated in the Death March of Bataan Death March from [[Mariveles, Bataan]] to [[Capas, Tarlac]].

Many Kapampangans joined the guerrilla resistance fighters of the Hukbalahap Communist resistance. Many Kapampangan guerrillas and [[Hukbalahap]] communist groups fought four years of insurgency during the Japanese Occupation and also fought side by side with allied forces in the main province of Pampanga, helping local troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and incoming Philippine Constabulary 3rd Constabulary Regiments stationed at the general headquarters in Pampanga in operations in [[Central Luzon]] from 1942 to 1945 against the Imperial Japanese troops. After the insurgency, many Kapampangan guerrillas and Hukbalahap resistance groups about the retreating by the Japanese and before the liberation on 1945 from the combined Allied forces and guerrillas.

==Culture and cuisine==
{{Main article|Kapampangan cuisine}}
[[File:Sisig wikipedia.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sisig]]'', a very popular Kapampangan dish.]]
[[File:Oxtail kare-kare 1.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Kare-kare]]'']]
Many Kapampangan festivals display an indigenous flavor unique only to the Kapampangan people. Consider the ''Curaldal'' or "street dancing" that accompanies the Feast of Santa Lucia in [[Sasmuan]] or the ''Aguman Sanduk'' were men cross-dress as women to welcome the New Year in [[Minalin]] or the Batalla Festival to re-enact the battle between the native Muslim Moor and the new colonist Native Capampangan Christians, the historical battle between the two religious native Kapampangans. They start the battle in ''Ugtung-aldo'' or afternoon and they end it in ''Sisilim'' or sunset with the tune of what Macabebeanons and Masantuleñios called BATTALA [[Masantol]], [[Macabebe]] and [[Lubao, Pampanga|Lubao]].

The ''Pistang Danum'' of the barrios of Pansinao, Mandasig, Lanang and Pasig in [[Candaba]], where food is served on floating banana rafts on the waters of the Pampanga River was originally a non-Christian holiday that is now made to coincide with the baptism of Christ. The Kapampangan New Year or ''Bayung Banwa'' that welcomes the coming of the monsoons and the start of the planting season is made to coincide with the feast of [[John the Baptist]]. The colourful ''Apung Iru'' fluvial procession of [[Apalit]], once a thanksgiving celebration in honour of the river, has become the feast of [[Saint Peter]].

The most dramatic festivals can be witnessed during the ''Mal ay Aldo'', which is the Kapampangan expression of the [[Holy Week]]. These include the erection of a temporary shrine known as the ''puni'' where the [[pasyon|''pasion'']] or the story of Christ's suffering is chanted in archaic Kapampangan. The melody of the Kapampangan ''pasion'' was said to have been taken from their traditional epic, whose original words were lost and replaced by the story of Christ. The highlight of the ''Mal ay Aldo'' celebration is the procession of the ''magdarame'' or ''sasalibatbat'' penitents covered in blood from self-flagellation. Some of them even have themselves crucified every [[Good Friday]] at the dried up swamp of barrio Cutud in [[San Fernando City, Pampanga|San Fernando]].

[[Kapampangan cuisine]], or ''Lutung Kapampangan'', has gained a favourable reputation among other Philippine ethnic groups, which hailed Pampanga as the "Culinary Capital of the Philippines". Some popular Kapampangan dishes that have become mainstays across the country include ''[[sisig]]'', ''[[kare-kare]]'', [[tocino]] or ''pindang'' and their native version of the [[Chorizo|longaniza]].

Other Kapampangan dishes, which are an acquired taste for the other ethnic groups include buru (fish fermented in rice), ''betute tugak'' (stuffed frogs), ''arobung kamaru'' (mole crickets sauteed in vinegar and garlic), ''estofadong barag'' (spicy stewed monitor lizard), sisig, ''kalderetang asu'' (spicy dog stew), sigang liempu, ''dagis a tinama'' (marinated rats), laman panara and bobotu.

Kapampangans are mostly [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christians]], a majority of which are [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholics]], [[Philippine Independent Church|Aglipay]], [[Philippines Central Conference (United Methodist Church)|Methodists]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).

{{History of Mexico |Second Republic}}
'''''La Reforma''''' ({{Lang-en|The Reform}}) or the  '''Liberal Reform''' was initiated in Mexico following the ousting of centralist president [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] by a group of liberals under the 1854 [[Plan de Ayutla]]. From the liberals' narrow objective to remove a dictator and take power, they expanded their aims to a comprehensive program to remake Mexico governed by liberal principles as embodied by a series of [[Reform laws]] and then the [[Constitution of 1857]].  The major goals of this movement were to undermine the power of the Catholic Church in Mexico, [[Separation_of_church_and_state|separate church and state]], reduce the power of the Mexican military, and integrate Mexico's large indigenous population as citizens of Mexico and not a protected class. Liberals envisioned secular education as a means to create a Mexican citizenry. The liberals' strategy was to sharply limit the traditional institutional privileges (''fueros'') of the Catholic Church and the army. The law prohibiting the ownership of land by corporations targeted the holdings of the Catholic Church and indigenous communities - confiscating Church land.  Indigenous community lands were held by the community as a whole, not as individual parcels.  Liberals sought to create a class of yeoman farmers that held land individually. No class of individualistic peasants developed with the Liberal program emerged, but many merchants acquired land (and tenant farmers). Many existing landowners expanded their holdings at the expense of peasants, and  some upwardly mobile ranch owners, often mestizos, acquired land previously held by communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Michael Joseph|author2=Timothy J. Henderson|title=The Mexico Reader: History, Culture, Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1PVxAwz32oC&amp;pg=PA239|year=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|page=239ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the promulgation of the liberal Constitution of 1857, conservatives refused to swear allegiance to it and, instead, formed a conservative government. The result was a civil war known as the [[Reform War]] or Three Years' War, waged between conservatives and liberals for three years, ending with the defeat of the conservatives on the battlefield. Victorious liberal president [[Benito Juárez]] could not implement the envisioned reforms due to a new political threat. Conservatives had sought another route to regaining power, resulting in their active collaboration with [[Napoleon III]]'s plans to turn the Mexican Empire into the main American ally of the French empire. Mexican conservatives offered the crown of Mexico to Hapsburg archduke Maximilian. The French invasion and republican resistance to the [[French Intervention in Mexico]] lasted from 1862-67. With the defeat of the conservatives and the execution of Maximilian, Juárez again took up his duties as president.  In this period from 1867 to 1876, often called the "Restored Republic" liberals had no credible opposition to their implementation of the laws of the Reform embodied in the 1857 Constitution.

== History ==
[[File:Benito_Pablo_Juárez_García.png|thumb|left|[[Benito Juárez]], a Zapotec Indian who became president of Mexico during the Reform.]][[File:Alegoría de la Constitución de 1857.jpg|right|thumbnail|''Alegoría de la Constitución de 1857'' shows a dark complected Mexican woman clutching the liberal constitution of 1857. The 1869  painting by Petronilo Monroy was completed after the expulsion of the French in 1867.]]

The Liberal Reform is usually considered to have begun with the overthrow and exile of President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] in the [[Revolution of Ayutla]] in 1854-55. There is less consensus about the ending point of the Reform. Common dates are 1861, after the liberal victory in the [[Reform War|War of the Reform]], 1867, after the Republican victory of the [[French intervention in Mexico]] and 1876 after the [[Plan of Tuxtepec|Rebellion of Tuxtepec]] in which [[Porfirio Díaz]] overthrew president [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]]. Many historians have called the period following the ouster of the French as the "Restored Republic," with Benito Juárez as president, and then, following his death in 1872 of natural causes, his successor, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. Although the Díaz regime was nominally liberal and it looked to the memory of heroes of the Liberal Reform for its legitimacy, the [[Porfiriato]] (1876-1911) is generally identified as a separate period of Mexican history.

Notable liberal politicians in the reform period include [[Benito Juárez]], [[Juan Álvarez]], [[Ignacio Comonfort]], [[Miguel Lerdo de Tejada]], [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]], [[Melchor Ocampo]], [[José María Iglesias]] and [[Santos Degollado]].

== Reforms ==
{{Main|Reform laws}}
The most noteworthy reforms of the Reforma were: 
# the ''[[Ley Lerdo]]'', abolishing clerical and communal properties.
# the ''Ley Juárez'', abolishing separate military and religious courts
# the ''[[Iglesias law|Ley Iglesias]], regulating ecclesiastical fees
# the [[Mexican Constitution of 1857]], guaranteeing many civil and political liberties including [[freedom of religion]]
# the 'Reform Laws' in which the liberal government of [[Veracruz]] during the civil war against the conservatives proclaimed complete [[separation of church and state]].

== Paseo de la Reforma  ==

[[Mexico City]]'s main avenue is the [[Paseo de la Reforma]] which received its current name after the Reforma. It was originally known as the ''Paseo de la Emperatriz'' after [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlota]], the [[Queen consort|consort]] of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] who created the avenue for her.

'''Lorraine Franconian''' (Lorraine Franconian: ''Plàtt'', ''lothrìnger Plàtt''; {{lang-fr|francique lorrain, platt lorrain}}; {{lang-de|Lothringisch}}) is an ambiguous designation for [[dialect]]s of [[West Central German]] ({{lang-de|Westmitteldeutsch}}), a group of [[High German languages|High German]] dialects spoken in the [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]] department of the former north-eastern [[France|French]] region of [[Lorraine]] (See [[Linguistic boundary of Moselle]]).

== Description ==
The term ''Lorraine Franconian'' has multiple denotations. Some scholars use it to refer to the entire group of West Central German dialects spoken in the French Lorraine region. Others use it more narrowly to refer to the [[Moselle Franconian]] dialect spoken in the valley of the river [[Nied]] (in Pays de Nied whose largest town is [[Boulay-Moselle]]), to distinguish it from the other two [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] dialects spoken in Lorraine, [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] to the west and [[Rhine Franconian]] to the east.

In 1806 there were 218,662 speakers of Lorraine Franconian in [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]] and 41,795 speakers in [[Meurthe (department)|Meurthe]].&lt;ref&gt;Sébastien Bottin, ''Mélanges sur les langues, dialectes et patois'', Paris, 1831.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part from the ambiguity of the term, estimates of the number of speakers of Lorraine Franconian in France vary widely, ranging from 30,000&lt;ref&gt;Auburtin&lt;/ref&gt; to 400,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150214054523/http://www.languesregionales.org/Nombre-de-locuteurs-dans-les Langues régionales.org (Platt lorrain)]&lt;/ref&gt; (which would make it the third most-spoken regional language in France, after [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]).

The most reliable data comes from the ''Enquête famille'' carried out by [[INSEE]] (360,000 in the 1962 census) as part of the 1999 [[census]], but they give a somewhat indirect picture of the current situation (see [[Languages in France#Statistics|Languages in France]] for a discussion of this survey). Approximately 78,000 people were reported to speak Lorraine Franconian, but fewer than 50,000 passed basic knowledge of the language on to their children. Another statistic illustrating the same point is that of all adult men who used Franconian regularly when they were 5, less than 30% use (or used) the language regularly with their own children.&lt;ref&gt;Héran&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Makli Necropolis''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|مکلی کا شہرِ خموشاں}}}}; {{lang-sd|مڪلئَ جو مقام}}) is one of the largest [[necropolis|funerary sites]] in the world, spread over an area of 10 square kilometres near the city of [[Thatta]], in the [[Pakistan]]i province of [[Sindh]]. The site houses approximately 500,000 to 1 million&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite web|title=Makli Hill|url=https://archnet.org/sites/1751|website=ArchNet|publisher=Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; tombs built over the course of a 400 year period.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Makli Necropolis features several large funerary monuments belonging to royalty, various [[Sufi]] saints, and esteemed scholars. The site was inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1981 as an "outstanding testament" to Sindhi civilization between the 14th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/143 Historical Monuments at Makli, Thatta] UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Retrieved 10 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Overview of Makli Hills.jpg|thumb|The site is located on the outskirts of [[Thatta]].]]
Makli Necropolis is located in the town of Maklia, which is located on a plateau approximately 6 kilometres from the city of [[Thatta]],&lt;ref name=arch/&gt; the capital of lower [[Sindh]] until the 17th century.&lt;ref name=WJ/&gt; It lies approximately 98&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Karachi]], near the apex of the [[Indus River Delta]] in southeastern Sindh. The southernmost point of the site is approximately 5 miles north of the ruins of the medieval ''Kallankot'' Fort.

==Etymology==
The site, and nearby hills, are said to derive their name from a legend in which a [[Hajj]] pilgrim stopped at the site and erupted into spiritual ecstasy, declaring the site to be [[Makkah]] for him. The [[Sufi]] saint Sheikh Hamad Jamali is then said to have named the site "Makli", or "Little Makkah", after hearing the story of the pilgrim.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

The Sufi saint, poet and scholar Shaikh Jamali established a ''[[khanqah]]'', or Sufi gathering site, at Makli and was eventually buried there.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The 14th century Trakhan ruler, [[Jam Tamachi]], venerated the saint and wished to be interred near the saint, beginning the tradition of using Makli as a funerary site.

The site rose to prominence as a major funerary site during under the rule of the Samma dynasty, who had made their capital near Thatta.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Qureshi|first1=Urooj|title=In Pakistan, imposing tombs that few have seen|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20140730-in-pakistan-imposing-tombs-that-few-have-seen|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=BBC Travel|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most architecturally significant tombs at the site date from around the time of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era, between 1570 and 1640 CE.&lt;ref name=WJ&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furnival|first1=WJ|title=Leadless Decorative Tiles, Faience, and Mosaic: Comprising Notes and Excerpts on the History, Materials, Manufacture &amp; Use of Ornamental Flooring Tiles, Ceramic Mosaic, and Decorative Tiles and Faience, with Complete Series of Recipes for Tile-bodies, and for Leadless Glazes and Art-tile Enamels, Volume 1|date=1904|publisher=W.

==Layout==
Makli Necropolis occupies 10 square kilometres, housing at least 500,000 tombs.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Monuments at Makli, Thatta|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/143|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretches from ''Pir Patho'' at the southern end of the Makli Hills, northward in a roughly diamond shape.&lt;ref name=aha/&gt; Its eastern edge is formed by the Makli Hills ridge. The largest monuments are generally found at the southern edge of the site, though the Samma tombs are found in the north.

==Architectural evolution==
[[File:Makli Tombs1.jpg|thumb|Many of the tombs feature carved decorative motifs.]] [[File:Makli Architecture 02.jpg|thumb|]]
The funerary architecture of the largest monuments synthesizes Muslim, Hindu, Persian, Mughal, and Gujarati influences,&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; in the style of Lower Sindh that became known as the ''Chaukhandi'' style, named after the [[Chaukhandi tombs]] near [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name=malik&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malik|first1=Iftikhar|title=Culture and Customs of Pakistan|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313331268|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQTABKAGaVgC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Makli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEgPiks4_VAhWLwYMKHeJ8Af4Q6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Makli&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chaukhandi'' style came to incorporate slabs of sandstone that were carefully carved by stonemasons into intricate and elaborate designs.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt;

The earliest tombs displayed three to six slabs of stone stacked on top of one another into the shape of a small pyramid.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; Evolving funerary architecture then incorporated small [[plinth]]s.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt;

[[File:Beautifully architecture pillars.jpg|thumb|Some monuments feature corridors with roofs supported by intricately carved sandstone.]]
By the 15th century, decorated rosettes and circular patterns began to be incorporated into the tombs.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; More complex patterns and Arabic calligraphy with biographical information of the interred body then emerged.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt;  Larger monuments dating from later periods included corridors and some designs inspired by cosmology.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; 
[[File:Close_to_grave.jpg|thumb|Many cenotaphs are intricately carved.]]
Pyramidal structures from the 16th century feature the use of minarets topped with floral motifs in a style unique to tombs dating from the Turkic [[Trakhan dynasty]].&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; Structures from the 17th century at the ''Leilo Sheikh'' part of the cemetery feature large tombs that resemble [[Jain]] temples from afar,&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; with prominent influence from the nearby region of [[Gujarat]].

Several of the larger tombs feature carvings of animals, warriors, and weaponry - a practice uncommon to Muslim funerary monuments.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; Later tombs at the site are sometimes made entirely of brick, with only a sandstone slab.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;

The largest structures in the most archaetypal ''Chaukhandi'' style feature domed yellow sandstone canopies that were plastered white with wooden doorways,&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; in a style that reflects Central Asian and Persian influences.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; The size of the dome denoted the prominence of the buried individual,&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; with undersides embellished with carved floral patterns.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; The underside of some canopies feature [[lotus flower|lotus]] flowers, a symbol commonly associated with Hinduism.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Some tombs came to feature extensive blue tile-work typical of Sindh.&lt;ref name=malik/&gt; The use of funerary pavilions eventually expanded beyond lower Sindh, and influenced funerary architecture in neighbouring Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hasan|first1=Shaikh Khurshid|title=The Islamic Architectural Heritage of Pakistan: Funerary Memorial Architecture|date=2001|publisher=Royal Book Company|isbn=9789694072623|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lPLVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Makli&amp;dq=Makli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizicvHs4_VAhVLxYMKHXj0D3k4ChDoAQgpMAE|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal mausolea==
[[File:Makli 8.jpg|thumb|Some mausolea feature strong architectural influences from Central Asia.]] 
The impressive royal mausolea are divided into two major clusters: those from the [[Samma Dynasty|Samma]] period form their own cluster, while those from the [[Tarkhan]], [[Arghun]],  and [[Mughals]] periods are clustered together.

===Samma cluster===
Tombs dating from the [[Samma Dynasty]] are clustered together in a 5 acre section at the northern end of the necropolis. The Samma were [[Rajput]] princes, who seized control of Thatta in 1335.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Samma tombs are strongly influenced by Gujarati styles, and incorporate Muslim and Hindu decorative elements.

[[File:Tomb of Sultan Jam Nizamuddin.jpg|thumb|[[Jam Nizamuddin II]]'s tomb features a ''jharoka'' that displays Gujarati influences.]] 
The tomb of the King [[Jam Nizamuddin II]], completed in 1510, is an impressive square structure measuring 11.4 metres on each side.&lt;ref name=aha/&gt; It was built of sandstone and decorated with floral and geometric medallions. The cuboid shape of the tomb may be inspired by the [[Ka'aba]] in Makkah.&lt;ref name=aha&gt;{{cite web|title=Makli Necropolis|url=http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/sid/885/pakistan/thatta/makli-necropolis|publisher=Asian Historical Architecture|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its dome was never built, thus leaving the interior exposed to the elements.&lt;ref name=aha/&gt; The monument features a large and intricately carved Gujarati-style ''jharoka'', or balcony, and a small peak atop it, which make the tomb resemble a temple.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The exterior features 14 bands of decorative motifs that feature both Quranic verses and Hindu symbols,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; though in keeping with Islamic tradition, all decoration takes the form of geometric patterns, with the sole exception of a frieze depicting local ducks.&lt;ref name=aha/&gt;

The tomb of Jam Nizamuddin's adoptive son, Darya Khan, resembles a [[Rajasthan]]i fort, and was built after his death in 1521 &lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Darya Khan had been born a slave, but rose to prominence as a general after defeating an Arghun army in battle. He was granted the title "Hero of Sindh," and was eventually made ''Madrul Muham'', or Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

===Arghun, Trakhan, and Mughal cluster===
The tomb of Isa Khan Tarkhan I, who ruled from 1554 to 1565, represents a departure from the funerary architecture of the Sammas.&lt;ref name=aha/&gt; The tomb features a distinctly new [[cenotaph]]-style, and is laid out in a rectangular shape with its inner walls entirely covered with Quranic verses.&lt;ref name=aha/&gt; The tomb also has an area dedicated for the graves of 5 of his royal ladies.&lt;ref name=aha/&gt;

[[File:Sadsad.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Isa Khan Hussain II is one of the most notable monuments at the site.]]
The mausoleum of Isa Khan Hussain II Tarkhan (d. 1651) features a two-story stone building with cupolas and balconies. The tomb is said to have been built during Isa's lifetime. Upon completion, legend states that Isa ordered the hands of the craftsmen to be cut off so that they would not be able to make another monument to rival his own.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
[[File:Mirza Baqi Uzbek 2.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Mirzaa Baqi Uzbek features a Central Asian style ''[[iwan]]''.]]
The tomb of Jan Beg Tarkhan (d. 1600), is an octagonal brick structure whose dome is covered in blue and turquoise glazed tiles. Pavilion or canopy tombs (''chattri maqbara'' or umbrella tomb) are another typical Indo-Islamic architectural feature, as well as enclosure tombs.

The Mughul period is represented by many tombs on the southern side of the necropolis, including the mausoleum of Mirza Jani and Mirza Ghazi Baig, that of Nawab Shurfa Khan, the enclosure of Mirza Baqi Baig Uzbek and of Mirza Jan Baba as well as the impressive restored tomb of Nawab Isa Khan Tarkhan the Younger.

==Conservation==
[[File:Makli Tombs9.jpg|thumb|Several tombs are badly damaged.]]
Makli Necropolis was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. The site's structural integrity has been affected by siltation, encroachment, poor site management, vandalism, and solid waste.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; The [[2010 Pakistan floods]] further compounded the site's deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;''Damage Assessment Mission to the Necropolis of Makli'', Heritage Foundation, supported by the Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development, Karachi (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36790">'''Membership discrimination in California social clubs''' has been based on sex, race, religion, political views and social standing. In the late 1980s a successful effort was made in many of the clubs to open up membership first to  racial or religious minorities and then to women. Strictly private clubs not open to the public and for which tax exemptions are not claimed maintain their right to discriminate on the basis of sex or race, and all clubs can discriminate on the basis of social standing.

A state law against discriminating in the service of private businesses was gradually made applicable to social clubs that engaged in commercial activities. Rules against discrimination were also applied where clubs were the beneficiaries of government in any way, notably through taxes or subsidies.
{{TOC right}}

==The first clubs==

The [[Bohemian Club]] was founded in  San Francisco in 1872 as a journalists' social group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1345191272&amp;sid=2&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=3266&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Days and Nights in OId Bohemia," ''San Francisco Chronicle,'' July 18, 1897, page 5] &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but it grew to become a refuge for some of the most powerful men in American business and politics. The similarly august [[California Club]] was founded in Los Angeles in 1888 when "at least 12 of the 125 founding members were Jews." But "as the original Jewish members died off, this power center became off limits to Jews." The [[Jonathan Club]], a likewise prestigious social group,  was established in Los Angeles in 1894.&lt;ref name=BarriersThwartCareers/&gt;

==Legislative measures==

The [[Unruh Civil Rights Act]], adopted in 1959, and as subsequently amended, outlaws discrimination based on age, ancestry, color, disability, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation and similar characteristics. The law applies to all businesses, including housing and public accommodations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/DFEH/Publications/unruhDescr.aspx Unruh Civil Rights Act Description, California Department of Fair Employment and Housing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120162725/http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/DFEH/Publications/unruhDescr.aspx |date=2011-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 125.6 of the state's Business and Professions Code, which took effect on January 1, 1976, threatened disciplinary action against "any holder of a state liquor license who discriminates on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, ancestry or national origin," but it specifically exempted private clubs with "discriminatory membership policy."&lt;ref name=GentlemanAgreement1976/&gt; The State Franchise Tax Board has forbidden business tax deductions for fees and expenses incurred at discriminatory private clubs.&lt;ref name=DoorsSlightlyAjar1989/&gt;

Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] on May 28, 1987, signed a bill sponsored by Council Member [[Joy Picus]] to ban discrimination at most of the city's large private clubs, based on "sex, sexual orientation, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin or disability." It applied to any club with more than 400 members that "takes payments for meetings attended by non-members."&lt;ref name="BradleySignsLaw1987"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Kenneth|title=Bradley Signs Law Banning Bias by L.A.'s Private Clubs|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-29/local/me-2011_1_private-clubs|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=29 May 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities may force large private clubs to admit minorities and women. It said that "clubs which serve meals and rent facilities to outsiders are more like business establishments than intimate social groups and therefore have no right to escape anti-discrimination laws."&lt;ref name=DoorsSlightlyAjar1989/&gt;

==Minority groups==

===1960s===

In 1965, the Jonathan Club was charged with "anti-Negro" and "anti-Jew" bias and a complaint was raised that the membership dues of Mayor [[Sam Yorty]] were being paid by city taxpayers to support such discrimination. Yorty told a news conference he knew nothing about such a circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=483864832&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP Richard Bergholz, "Yorty Hits Roosevelt on Campaign Spending," ''Los Angeles Times,'' March 11, 1965, page 11] &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] said that in 1962 twelve of the "leading country clubs" and eight of the "most prestigious city clubs" in the Greater Los Angeles area were open only to Christians, but by 1969 those figures had dropped to eleven and five. Six of the city and country clubs that discriminated in 1969 were listed in Los Angeles, five in Pasadena, two in  Glendale and one each in La Habra, Long Beach and Upland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=510147292&amp;sid=23&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Anti-Semitism Found Waning in Private Clubs," ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 21, 1967, page 3]  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1969, there were no Jewish members in the [[California Club]] but "at least one Jew" in the [[Jonathan Club]], yet the latter club hadn't "taken in any Jewish members for at least two decades," Neil C. Sandberg regional director of the [[American Jewish Committee]], told [[Jack Smith (columnist)|Jack Smith]] of the ''Los Angeles Times.''&lt;ref name=BarriersThwartCareers&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=655698682&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Clubs' Barriers Thwart Careers, Study Discloses," ''Los Angeles Times,'' July 3, 1969, page A-1]  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith wrote that a campaign had been going on for ten years to "quietly but unrelentingly" persuade "what has been called the 'last bastion' of anti-Semitism in America — the downtown men's clubs of the nation's big cities" to allow Jews to become members. Led by the American Jewish  Committee, "with the active aid of the [[Anti-Defamation League|Antidefamation League]], [[American Jewish Congress]] . . . and other Jewish organizations," the campaign was successful in the case of the Stock Exchange Club, the University Club and the Chancery Club, but the Jonathan and the California clubs remained closed. The campaign was publicized upon the report of a seven-year study made at [[UCLA]] by Reed M. Powell, a sociologist.&lt;ref name=BarriersThwartCareers/&gt;

===1970s===

====Examples of prejudice====

In May 1975, a touring choir from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] decided not to give a proposed concert at the Jonathan Club because Academy officers had been informed that the club had a policy against hosting blacks.&lt;ref name=PressuresMount1976/&gt;

Loretta Thompson-Glickman, member of the Pasadena city [[City council#United States and Canada|Board of Directors]], recalled that when first elected to the board in 1977, she and Jo Heckman, the only other female director, had to enter the University Club in that city through a side door. Attorney Candis Ipswich said she applied for membership the same year and was rejected because "I was the wrong sex."&lt;ref name=AllMaleUniversityClubRelents1986/&gt;

J. Peter Dunston, a Washington, D.C., businessman who was spending a year in Los Angeles, was "surprised" in February 1978 to find "how directly" the prejudices of the Jonathan Club were expressed when he applied for membership and was interviewed by the membership committee. He was told that "Jews and blacks were not welcome in the club." One of the committee members later "denied everything," but the other said, "We explained it to him in a different way. We didn't use the word discriminate. 'Invite' was the word."&lt;ref name=PrideAndPrejudice1978&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=648189382&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP Barry Siegel, "Pride and Prejudice: A Progress Report," ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 8, 1978, page F-1]  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aljolsoncoolidge.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Calvin Coolidge|President Coolidge]] with actor [[Al Jolson]] at the Hillcrest Country Club in 1924]]
In 1978 there was still only one Jew in the [[Jonathan Club]] and none in the [[Los Angeles Country Club]]. The two clubs were known for their discrimination against Jews.  Yet the [[Hillcrest Country Club (Los Angeles)|Hillcrest Country Club]] in Beverly Hills was the "Jewish" counterpart to the Los Angeles Country Club, and [[Lew Wasserman]], chairman of the board of the [[Music Corporation of America]], told  ''Times'' reporter [[Robert Scheer]] that the Hillcrest club "has consistently discriminated against non-Jewish members."
&lt;ref name=ScheerStory&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=654265192&amp;sid=21&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP  "Line Drawn Between Two Worlds," ''Los Angeles Times,'' January 30, 1978, page B-1] &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]] had admitted blacks as members since the early 1960s, but it was discovered in 1975 that the club was admitting blacks "on a slower, more regulated basis than whites, in an effort not to offend or lose white men."  The club quickly changed its policies after complaints were made.&lt;ref name=PressuresMount1976/&gt;

Los Angeles bookseller [[Jake Zeitlin]] claimed in 1980 that many clubs, such as his city's [[Zamorano Club]], an organization of [[bibliophiles]], used a refusal to admit communists as a pretext for excluding Jews; he said he was denied admission for more than forty years under those circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Zeitlin, ''Books and the Imagination'', as told to Joel Garner (Los Angeles: Oral History Program, University of California, Los Angeles, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Outside pressure====

By 1976 some businesses were deciding not to reimburse executives for the dues they paid to clubs that discriminated against minorities. [[Wells Fargo Bank]] banned meetings at discriminatory clubs in October 1975, and [[Bank of America]] was also one of the first, announcing moreover that it would not itself maintain such memberships, nor would it sponsor events anywhere "unless all business guests who should attend can attend." Mayor Tom Bradley's office announced that he would no longer attend meetings at either the Jonathan or the California clubs. But a survey made by the ''Wall Street Journal'' in May 1976 "indicated that most companies felt any rules could be dodged," primarily by giving employees a salary increase instead of paying their club fees.&lt;ref name=GentlemanAgreement1976/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=642325132&amp;sid=25&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "B of A Breaks With Discriminatory Clubs," ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 3, 1976, page E-10] &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BohemianClubOwl2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Bohemian Club owl]]
Responding to letters from the [[Jewish Federation]] Council, California Club president Luther Anderson wrote in September 1975 that the club "has no membership policy of any sort, and that individual decisions are made by an autonomous admissions committee over which the board of directors has no control." A year later, on October 1, 1976, the council mailed letters to top officials at 160 major corporations in Southern California, urging them not to hold meetings or functions at the California Club and to "reconsider" their policies of paying club membership dues for their executives.&lt;ref name=PressuresMount1976/&gt;

In July 1978, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that [[Glenn Dumke]], chancellor of the [[California State University]] system, belonged to the California Club and the Bohemian Club, while [[Paul F. Romberg]], president of [[San Francisco State University]], was a member of the Bohemian Club and [[Alistair W. McCrone]], president of [[Humboldt State University]], belonged to the [[Ingomar Club]]. Dumke and Romberg paid their membership fees with privately donated money, but McCrone used state money for his fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=670198302&amp;sid=10&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP Don Speich, "11 State University-College Officials in Private Clubs," ''Los Angeles Times,'' July 31, 1978] &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Policy changes ====

The Bohemian Club did make a push in 1970 for blacks to join up. Some, like [[Ernest J. Gaines]], the first black to be awarded a creative writing fellowship at Stanford University, declined to join because he was "just sort of tired of being the first to go into things," and he doubted he "would have found people with whom he could discuss [Ernest] Hemingway."  [[Cecil F. Poole|Cecil Poole]], who was a black federal appeals judge, also would not join.&lt;ref name=BohemianClubUnyielding1987/&gt;

[[File:Harold Brown photo portrait standing.jpg|thumb|upright|Harold Brown was admitted to the California Club in 1976.]]
In 1976 the California Club admitted a Jew,  [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], the United States secretary of defense and former president of the [[California Institute of Technology]], "several years after he was first nominated for membership" by [[Franklin David Murphy|Franklin Murphy]], chairman of the board of the Times-Mirror Company, and after "a protracted struggle among club members."&lt;ref name=PressuresMount1976&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=681676602&amp;sid=8&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP Barry Siegel, "Pressures Mount Against Discrimination," ''Los Angeles Times, December 6, 1976, page F-1]  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews were admitted to membership about 1966 in the Los Angeles Chancery Club, for attorneys, and in 1976 there was one black Chancery Club member — [[Samuel L. Williams|Sam Williams]], president-elect of the County Bar Association.&lt;ref name=PressuresMount1976/&gt;

Warner Heineman, vice chairman of Union Bank, who was Jewish, was admitted to membership in the Jonathan Club in October 1977. He said the action was "something of a breakthrough. . . . I personally feel I am a whole citizen now. I can't explain what it means for someone who was persecuted in  Germany to still be denied membership in a club of his peers. . . . I feel emancipated." Jonathan Club president Robert Brimberry said in February 1978 that "In recent years certain restrictions have been changing. . . . we are accepting and considering all applications on their merit, including those of minorities and women."&lt;ref name=PrideAndPrejudice1978/&gt;

Also in fall 1977, two Jewish men were admitted as members of the  [[Los Angeles Country Club]] — [[Sherrill C. Corwin|Sherrill Corwin]], head of the Metropolitan Theaters chain, and [[Si Ramo]], an executive at [[TRW Inc.]]&lt;ref name=PrideAndPrejudice1978/&gt;

===1980s===

The membership of  [[William French Smith]], President Ronald Reagan's choice for [[United States Attorney General|U.S. attorney-general]] in the discriminatory California and Bohemian clubs became an issue for him before Smith's nomination was approved by the Senate in January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=656206832&amp;sid=10&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP Barry Siegel, "Smith's Membership in Two Clubs May Be Confirmation Issue," ''Los Angeles Times,'' January 15, 1981, page B-3]&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 the Board of Governors of the [[State Bar of California]] voted to ban from participating in the annual Conference of Delegates any local bar association that patronized any private discriminatory club which excluded people from membership or use of its facilities because of their "race, color, creed, national ancestry, sex or sexual preference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Myrna|title=State Bar Bans Units That Use Private Clubs|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-12/news/mn-1222_1_local-bar|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=12 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other controversies in the 1980s included those in:

====Avalon====

In November 1988, [[Avalon, California|Avalon]] city officials on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]] asked the city attorney to investigate the all-male [[Tuna Club of Avalon|Tuna Club]] after City Council Member Irene Strobel said she had " twice accepted invitations to visit the club in her role as a council member, but she refused to enter by the side or back doors that women are supposed to use. Instead, she went through the front door."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Adrianne|title=Avalon Launches Inquiry of All-Male Tuna Club|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-03/local/me-631_1_tuna-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=3 November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After "months of inquiry," city officials  agreed that the Tuna Club did not discriminate against women. A March 14 letter from the club said it "does not and will not discriminate . . . on the basis of sex, race, religion and national origin." The club, founded in 1898, leased its facilities from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Adrianne|title=Avalon Takes Tuna Club's Word on Discrimination|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-20/news/hl-4972_1_club-officials|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=20 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Los Angeles====

In 1982, the city's [[Urban renewal#.22Urban renewal.22 as .22community development.22|Community Redevelopment Agency]] "barred its employees from conducting any business" at the Jonathan Club, and law firms, banks and government agencies adopted policies boycotting the club.&lt;ref name="CoastalCommissionHorvath1985"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horvath|first1=Adam Z.|title=Club Told to Halt Bias or Give Up Expansion|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-07-26/local/me-5055_1_club-member|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=26 July 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October of the same year, Prince Philip of Great Britain, on a visit to Los Angeles to inspect equestrian sites for the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]], turned down an invitation to an evening at the California Club when he discovered that his host, Mayor Tom Bradley, refused to attend because the club "prohibits women and has no black members."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925801,00.html Richard Stengel, "People," ''Time'' magazine, October 4, 1982] {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 1986, [[Lodwrick Cook|Lodwrick M. Cook]], chief executive officer of the oil giant [[ARCO|Arco]], sent a memo announcing that the firm would no longer reimburse executives for memberships in "discriminatory private clubs." The order affected "about 30" people who belonged to the California and Jonathan clubs in Los Angeles and the Dallas Petroleum Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=David|title=Arco Takes Stand on Discrimination in Clubs|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-05/local/me-9433_1_california-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=5 June 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillcrest Country Club president Mark B. Levey said in April 1987 that the club had taken steps to recruit non-Jewish members and had "about two dozen" at that time.&lt;ref name=HillcrestRecruitsGentilesAndWomen1987&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Kenneth|title=Leading Jewish Country Club OKs Regular Membership for Women|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-28/local/me-2419_1_hillcrest-country-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=28 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1988, the California Club admitted its first black member in the person of [[Joseph L. Alexander]], 58-year-old surgeon and former Army colonel. The club also approved [[Ivan J. Houston]], the chief executive officer of the predominantly black [[Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company]]. A "number of Jews" were said to have been admitted in recent years as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Kenneth|title=First Black California Club Member Signs Up|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-01/local/me-26848_1_club-members|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=1 February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Santa Monica====

[[File:Santa Monica Beach (195729371).jpg|thumb|Santa Monica Beach]]
At the beginning of 1985 the Santa Monica Planning Commission "grudgingly approved" a permit from the Jonathan Club to expand the club's facilities on the [[Santa Monica Beach|Santa Monica beach]]. The council also voted to send a letter to the state's [[California Coastal Commission|Coastal Commission]] stating that the club's membership policies might affect "the public's right to beach access." "Previous councils had refused to act on the matter because of the club's alleged discriminatory policies... Councilwoman Cheryl Rhoden told a club official 'not one grain of sand' would be given to the club until it changed its membership policies."&lt;ref name=JonathanExpansionOKd1985&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stambler|first1=Lyndon|title=Membership Policy Probe Asked :  Expansion Plan by Jonathan Club OKd|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-10/news/we-9329_1_membership-policies|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=10 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 1985, the Coastal Commission did order the club to adopt nondiscriminatory policies before it could expand its recreational use onto state-owned beach property.&lt;ref name=CoastalCommissionHorvath1985/&gt;

The decision was upheld by the state Supreme Court in May 1988 even though the Jonathan Club had said that it did not bar women or minorities as members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hager|first1=Philip|title=Jonathan Club Loses Bias Appeal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-06/local/me-2898_1_jonathan-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=6 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women==

In March 1986, the Rotary clubs' federation [[Rotary International]] was ordered by a state appellate court to reinstate the Rotary Club of [[Duarte, California|Duarte]] it had ousted in 1983 for admitting three women members, and three years later the University Club in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] decided also to admit women. The all-male club had voted against the idea twice before — in 1977 and 1980.&lt;ref name=AllMaleUniversityClubRelents1986&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hastings|first1=Deborah|title=All-Male Club of 60 Years Finally Relents|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-19/local/me-12128_1_male-only-clubs|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=19 June 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John M. Robinson, president of the California State Club Association, wrote in a 1987 newsletter that "Clubs are under broad attack nationwide."&lt;ref name=ClubsUnderAttack1987&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Kenneth|title=Defends 'Right . . . to Discriminate' :  Private Clubs Spokesman Assails Attack on Exclusivity of Groups|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-05/local/me-4065_1_private-clubs|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=5 May 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proponents of anti-club measures consist principally of a relatively small group of strident professional women in metropolitan centers, the anti-Establishment news media, vote-seeking politicians, a few minority leaders, do-gooders, the radical left, and social engineers who would restructure our social system according to their own ideas. , , , the essence of a club is its exclusiveness. Unless the right to select desired members and to exclude unwanted members is unrestricted, the objective of compatibility and congeniality of members cannot be accomplished. The right thus to select and exclude necessarily includes the right to discriminate on any basis whatsoever. An organization to which everyone has the right to belong ceases to be a club in the traditional sense."&lt;ref name=ClubsUnderAttack1987/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Beverly Hills===

The [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills|Friars Club]], a 700-member club consisting mostly of people in show business or the movies, had four women members by February 1988, including attorney [[Gloria Allred]], who in that month engaged in a "very heated meeting" with club officials over her demand that women be allowed to use the health facilities of the club.&lt;ref name=AllredFriars1988&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Kenneth|title=Allred, Friars Wrestle Over Access Issue|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-10/local/me-28263_1_friars-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=10 February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Reich of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Friars Club dispute is uncommon only in that it involves one of the nation's most celebrated exponents of women's rights. Dispute over the new — if less well-known — members of such facilities as dining rooms, golf courses and health clubs has also marked the integration of other clubs in Los Angeles and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=AllredFriars1988/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Eureka===

[[File:Carson Mansion Eureka California.jpg|thumb|Carson Mansion]]
In 1974, [[Ellen Stern Harris]], vice chairman of the [[California Coastal Commission]], was not allowed to join her fellow commissioners for an informal tour of the [[Carson Mansion]] in [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] because the private [[Ingomar Club]], housed there, admitted women "only on specified days."&lt;ref name=GentlemanAgreement1976&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=642443082&amp;sid=26&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP Barry Siegel, "Gentlemen's  Agreement vs. the Law," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 8, 1976, page H-1] &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The state attorney-general's office filed suit against the club in July 1974 after the Ingomar board of directors decided not to change the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=668985602&amp;sid=6&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Ingomar Club Is Charged With Bias," ''Los Angeles Times,'' July 25, 1974, page G-10]&lt;/ref&gt; It was settled in early 1978 with the club agreeing that women have the right to enter "for any business, civic or political function." It did not involve membership, though, "since state law does not prevent a private social club from barring members on the grounds of sex, religion or race."&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=648355922&amp;sid=9&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP "Women Win Guest Rights at Male Club," ''Los Angeles Times,'' March 3, 1978, page B-2] &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles===

In 1975 "neither the Los Angeles Country Club nor any other major country club" had changed "the traditional policy that bans single women as full members, and limits all women to specific starting times on the golf course.&lt;ref name=PrideAndPrejudice1978/&gt;  And neither the California nor the Jonathan club admitted women as members. Women guests were "limited to certain floors, dining rooms and entrances" but they "can now use the main elevator and lobby" at the Jonathan Club, a member told the ''Times'' in 1976, adding that  "We no longer have a women's elevator."&lt;ref name=PressuresMount1976/&gt;

====Brentwood Country Club====

The city sued the [[Brentwood Country Club]] in August 1987 to force it to stop barring women from its "Men's Grill" and golf course during part of the day. It dropped the suit when the club agreed "to admit women to the restaurant at all hours and make the rules less restrictive to women golfers."&lt;ref name=SuitAboutGrills1988/&gt;

====California Club====

In June 1987 the California Club took a vote on changing its bylaws and decided  by a 4-1 margin to admit women. Club president [[Donald E. Butler]] said the decision was made by "a group of rational individuals trying to do the right thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Kenneth|title=Jonathan Club's Members Vote 4 to 1 to Admit Women|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-30/news/mn-2840_1_jonathan-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=30 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a vociferous campaign by the losers, the club scheduled another vote on the same issue, and in March 1988, the regular members voted 728 to 297 to accept women members. In a separate category of non-resident members, the vote was 149 to 38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local News in Brief :  Club Will Admit Women|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-19/local/me-1103_1_club-membership|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=19 March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first new members admitted under the new policy were E. Camron Cooper, senior vice president and treasurer of the [[Atlantic Richfield Company]], and Linda Hartwick, a partner in the Korn/Ferry International executive-search firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local News in Brief :  California Club Admits 2 Women|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-26/local/me-1097_1_california-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=26 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hillcrest Country Club====

The Hillcrest Country Club changed its bylaws in April 1987 to provide for women as members and to allow daughters and wives, as well as sons,  to inherit the memberships of deceased members.&lt;ref name=HillcrestRecruitsGentilesAndWomen1987/&gt;

====Jonathan Club====

In 1977 the Jonathan Club "voted overwhelmingly" to admit women to membership. But Betty Bryant Morris, associate counsel at [[Union Bank N.A.|Union Bank]], found treatment of her membership application "raised suspicions among some that the club has no real intention" of taking a woman as a member. Directors at first wanted to delay her nomination for one year, but, after pressure, they changed their mind and sent Morris's application to the membership committee.&lt;ref name=WomanTries1977&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=653465552&amp;sid=28&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP Barry Siegel, "Woman Tries to Join All-Male Jonathan Club," ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 6,. 1977, page F-1] &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Library card required&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, however, "about a dozen women" had joined the club, one of whom was [[Brooke Knapp]], an aviator who was the first pilot to circle the Earth at the poles in a private jet, but they were forbidden to enter the men's library, grill and bar. The city attorney in January of that year was preparing a suit against the club to end that practice. Knapp said she opposed the suit because it might "engender a backlash that will slow women's progress."&lt;ref name=SuitAboutGrills1988&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Santiago|title=City Will Sue Club to Allow Women Into Bar, Library|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-07/local/me-33895_1_city-attorney|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=7 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Kenneth|title=Woman Member Hits Jonathan Club Suit|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-09/local/me-8883_1_jonathan-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=9 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Club attorney John R. Shiner said in June 1989 that the Jonathan would thenceforth serve women in the bar and grill, "no questions asked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Kim|title=Jonathan Club Opens Grill to Women|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-27/local/me-4416_1_jonathan-club-opens-grill-members-of-private-clubs-club-s-announcement|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=27 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====University Club====

The University Club had been in the forefront of taking in blacks and Jews as members, and another breakthrough came in February 1975, when it became the first major downtown Los Angeles club to admit women.&lt;ref name=PrideAndPrejudice1978/&gt;
As late as 1976, though, it required "unaccompanied women guests" to wait in a "ladies' lounge ... and before 5 p.m. [they] must enter and leave the club through a specified door." &lt;ref name=PressuresMount1976/&gt;

===Newport Beach===

In February 1989, twenty-five of the ninety single women belonging to the [[Newport Beach Country Club]] sued, alleging that they had to pay $8,500 more for memberships than single men. [[Gloria Allred]] was their attorney.&lt;ref name=DoorsSlightlyAjar1989/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lichtblau|first1=Eric|title=Newport Beach Club Sued for Alleged Discrimination|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-08/local/me-1321_1_private-clubs-women-members-gloria-allred|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=8 April 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Francisco===

====Bohemian Club====

Two state [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] members, women lawyers' groups and a law firm called on the state [[California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control|Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission]] in July 1987 to revoke the liquor license of the Bohemian Club because it excluded members on the basis of race or sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Group Urges State to Cancel Bohemian Club Liquor License|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-03/news/mn-1069_1_bohemian-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=3 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the city of San  Francisco had passed an ordinance "aimed at forcing the 115-year-old club to admit women." A Superior Court judge declined to overturn it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bohemian Club Fails in Bid to Keep Women Out|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-12/news/mn-6768_1_bohemian-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=12 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the club continued to insist that "since the club does not accept money from outside businesses, it is not subject to the court ruling."&lt;ref name=DoorsSlightlyAjar1989/&gt; It fought bitterly, and successfully,  to keep from admitting women as members. Women, including political office holders, "must enter via a side door and stay in the downstairs banquet rooms."&lt;ref name=BohemianClubUnyielding1987&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morain|first1=Dan|title=Bohemian Club Unyielding :  Bastion of the Powerful Clings to Male Mystique|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-26/news/mn-2818_1_bohemian-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=26 May 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Morain of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A few men have quit, some will not join and some groups no longer use it for social functions. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, for one, quietly stopped holding its annual party there in 1979 after several judges, including a black, a Jew and a few women appointed by President Jimmy Carter, protested that it was a symbol of discrimination . . .&lt;ref name=BohemianClubUnyielding1987/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Gloria Allred asked former California Governor [[Pat Brown|Edmund G. (Pat) Brown]] for a membership application for the Bohemian Club, "I turned her down," he said. "I think she's a fine lawyer, but there are a lot of women's clubs she could join where they talk about sewing and raising babies."&lt;ref name=DoorsSlightlyAjar1989/&gt; Former U.S. Senator [[S.I. Hayakawa]] said women should not be allowed to join for the same reason he didn't "want to go to women's clubs and join a sewing circle, or a ladies' bridge club." &lt;ref name=BohemianClubUnyielding1987/&gt;

===Yorba Linda===

Jan Bradshaw, an interior designer, sued the [[Yorba Linda Country Club]] in 1988 when she discovered  that women could play golf only in the afternoons. On Sundays there was only a single time for women's play "I've received death threats on the phone and nasty, anonymous letters," she said. Gina Walthall, president of the women's board of directors, said that Bradshaw's suit "would ruin it for everyone else so we'll just have an open tee-time. And then you might as well belong to a public course." Bradshaw was represented by Gloria Allred.&lt;ref name=DoorsSlightlyAjar1989&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGraw|first1=Carol|title=Welcoming Women :  Club Doors Still Only Slightly Ajar|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-15/news/mn-2955_1_friars-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=15 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lichtblau|first1=Eric|title=Woman Golfer Tees Off at Club's Policies|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-17/local/me-3066_1_yorba-linda-country-club|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=17 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16666">{{History of the Philippines}}
There have been several '''models of early human migration to the Philippines'''. Since [[H. Otley Beyer]] first proposed his wave migration theory, numerous scholars have approached the question of how, when and why humans first came to the Philippines.

The question of whether the first humans arrived from the south (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei as suggested by Beyer) or from the north (Yunnan via Taiwan as suggested by the Austronesian theory) has been a subject of heated debate for decades. As new discoveries have come to light, past hypotheses have been reevaluated and new theories constructed.

== Beyer's Wave Migration Theory ==
The most widely known theory of the prehistoric peopling of the Philippines is that of [[H. Otley Beyer]], founder of the Anthropology Department of the University of the Philippines. Heading that department for 40 years, Professor Beyer became the unquestioned expert on Philippine prehistory, exerting early leadership in the field and influencing the first generation of Filipino historians and anthropologists, archaeologists, paleontologists, geologists, and students the world over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaide|1999|p=32}}, citing Beyer Memorial Issue on the Prehistory of the Philippines in ''Philippine Studies'', Vol. 15:No. 1 (January 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Beyer, the ancestors of the Filipinos came in different "waves of migration", as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaide|1999|pp=32–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:# "Dawn Man", a cave-man type who was similar to [[Java man]], [[Peking Man]], and other Asian ''[[Homo erectus]]'' of 250,000 years ago.
:# The aboriginal pygmy group, the [[Negrito]]s, who arrived between 25,000 and 30,000 years ago via [[land bridge]]s.
:# The seafaring tool-using [[Indonesia]]n group who arrived about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago and were the first immigrants to reach the Philippines by sea.
:# The seafaring, more civilized Malays who brought the [[Iron age]] culture and were the real colonizers and dominant cultural group in the pre-Hispanic Philippines.

There is no definite evidence, archaeological or historical, to support this migration theory, and the passage of time has made that more unlikely. Key issues with this theory include Beyer's reliance on 19th-century theories of [[progressive evolution]] and migratory diffusion{{clarify|date=July 2014}} that have been shown in other contexts to be overly simplistic and unreliable and his reliance on incomplete archaeological findings and conjecture.&lt;ref name=sexyzaide&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaide|1999|pp=34–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His claims that the Malays were the original settlers of the lowland regions and the dominant cultural transmitter now seem untenable, no subsequent evidence has emerged to support his "Dawn Man",&lt;ref name=sexyzaide/&gt; and improved [[bathymetry|bathymetric]] soundings have established that there was almost certainly not a [[land bridge]] to [[Sundaland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|pp=1 and Map 2 in Frontispiece}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most of the islands were connected and could be accessed across the [[Mindoro Strait]] and [[Sibutu Passage]]. Writing in 1994, Philippine historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Scott]] concluded that "it is probably safe to say that no anthropologist accepts the Beyer Wave Migration Theory today."&lt;ref&gt;Scott, William H. [https://books.google.com/?id=15KZU-yMuisC&amp;pg=PA11 ''Barangay: Sixteenth-century Philippine Culture and Society'', p.&amp;nbsp;11]. Manila University Press (Manila), 1994. {{ISBN|971-550-135-4}}. Accessed 14 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A German scientist who has studied the Philippines, Fritjof Voss, has even argued that the present soundings are probably a generous overestimate of the earlier situation, as the Philippines have steadily risen over known geologic history.

==Core Population Theory==
[[Image:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|450px|thumb|The [[Sahul Shelf]] and the Sunda Shelf today. The area in between is called "[[Wallacea]]".]]

A less rigid version of the earlier wave migration theory is the Core Population Theory first proposed by anthropologist [[Felipe Landa Jocano]] of the [[University of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="antonio"/&gt; This theory holds that there weren't clear discrete waves of migration. Instead it suggests early inhabitants of Southeast Asia were of the same ethnic group with similar culture, but through a gradual process over time driven by environmental factors, differentiated themselves from one another.&lt;ref name=Halili&gt;{{Cite book

Jocano contends that what fossil evidence of ancient men show is that they not only migrated to the Philippines, but also to [[New Guinea]], [[Borneo]], and [[Australia]]. He says that there is no way of determining if they were [[Negritos]] at all. However, what is sure is that there is evidence the Philippines was inhabited tens of thousands of years ago. In 1962, a skull cap and a portion of a jaw, presumed to be those of [[Tabon Man|a human being]], were found in [[Tabon Cave]] in Palawan.&lt;ref name="sagmit"/&gt;

The nearby [[charcoal]] from cooking fires have been dated to {{circa|lk=no|22,000}} [[Before Present|years ago]]. While Palawan was connected directly to [[Sundaland]] during the [[last glacial period|last ice age]] (and separated from the rest of the Philippines by the [[Mindoro Strait]]), [[Callao Man]]'s still-older remains {{nowrap|({{circa|lk=no|67,000}} [[Before Present|B.P.]])}} were discovered in northern [[Luzon]]. Some have argued that this may show settlement of the Philippines earlier than that of the [[Malay Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="sagmit"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosario S. Sagmit  |author2=Nora N. Soriano |lastauthoramp=yes |title =Geography in the Changing World|publisher =Rex Bookstore, Inc.|year =1998|page=68|isbn=978-971-23-2451-2|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=qFCfgkZBYDIC&amp;pg=PA68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jocano further believes that the present Filipinos are products of the long process of cultural evolution and movement of people. This not only holds true for Filipinos, but for the Indonesians and the Malays of Malaysia, as well. No group among the three is culturally or genetically dominant. Hence, Jocano says that it is not correct to attribute the Filipino culture as being Malayan in orientation.&lt;ref name="antonio"/&gt;

According to Jocano's findings, the people of the prehistoric islands of [[Southeast Asia]] were of the same population as the combination of human evolution that occurred in the islands of Southeast Asia about 1.9 million years ago. The claimed evidence for this is fossil material found in different parts of the region and the movements of other people from the Asian mainland during historic times. He states that these ancient men cannot be categorized under any of the historically identified ethnic groups (Malays, Indonesians, and Filipinos) of today.&lt;ref name="antonio"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio|title =Turning Points I|publisher =Rex Bookstore, Inc.|year =2007|page=65|isbn=978-971-23-4538-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Lb8a7P_2InIC&amp;lpg=RA2-PA3-IA5&amp;dq=Jocano%20theory&amp;pg=RA2-PA3-IA5#v=onepage&amp;q=Jocano%20theory&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent anthropologists like [[Robert Bradford Fox]], [[Alfredo E. Evangelista]], Jesus Peralta, [[Zeus A. Salazar]], and Ponciano L. Bennagen agreed with Jocano.&lt;ref name="tan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mendoza"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Lisa C. Bower |editor2=David Theo Goldberg |author=S.

Arsenio Manuel]].&lt;ref name="tan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel K.

==Diffusion of Austronesian languages==
Another, more contemporary theory based on the study of the evolution of languages suggests that starting 4000–2000 BC, [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] groups descended from [[Yunnan Plateau]] in China and settled in what is now the [[Philippines]] by sailing using ''[[balangay]]s'' or by traversing [[land bridge]]s coming from [[Taiwan]]. Many of these Austronesians settled on the Philippine islands and became the ancestors of the present-day Filipinos and later colonizing most of the Pacific islands and Indonesia to the south.

The Cagayan valley of northern [[Luzon]] contains large [[stone tool]]s as evidence for the hunters of the big game of the time: the [[elephant]]-like [[stegodon]], [[rhinoceros]], [[crocodile]], [[tortoise]], [[pig]] and [[deer]]. The Austronesians pushed the Negritos to the mountains, while they occupied the fertile coastal plains.

===Solheim's hypothesis===

Anthropologist [[Wilhelm Solheim II]] posited an alternative model based on maritime movement of people over different directions and routes. It suggests that people with distant origins from 50,000 years ago in the area of present-day coastal eastern Vietnam and Southern China had moved to the area of the [[Bismarck Islands]] south and east of [[Mindanao]] and developed Pre-Austronesian. Proto-Austranesian then later developed and spread among seafarers from the area to the rest of Island Southeast Asia and areas along the South China Sea. In support of this idea Solheim notes there is little or no indication that Pre- or Proto Malayo-Polynesian was present in Taiwan.  According to Solheim, "The one thing I feel confident in saying is that all native Southeast Asians are closely related culturally, genetically and to a lesser degree linguistically."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://web.kssp.upd.edu.ph/linguistics/plc2006/papers/FullPapers/I-2_Solheim.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728044257/http://web.kssp.upd.edu.ph/linguistics/plc2006/papers/FullPapers/I-2_Solheim.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-28|title=Origins of the Filipinos and Their Languages|last=Solheim II|first=Wilhelm G.|authorlink=Wilhelm Solheim|date=January 2006|accessdate=2011-03-03|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New developments==
The "out of Taiwan" model based on Austronesian linguistic evidence that had become the mainstream explanation is in turn being challenged by newer findings.  Studies based on mitochondrial DNA show greater genetic diversity in southern regions than in northern ones suggesting that a significant migration wave was in a south-to-north direction.  Older populations entered Southeast Asia first following the coastal regions from Africa then slowly spread north to populate East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news130761648.html New DNA evidence overturns population migration theory in Island Southeast Asia].

The '''Nanai language''' (also called '''Gold''', '''Goldi''', or '''Hezhen''') is spoken by the [[Nani people|Nanai]] people in [[Siberia]], and to a much smaller extent in China's [[Heilongjiang]] province, where it is known as Hezhe.  The language has about 1,400 speakers out of 17,000 ethnic Nanai, but most (especially the younger generations) are also fluent in [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and mostly use one of those languages for communication.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2009 ([http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gld Nanai])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
In China, the language is referred to as ''hè zhé yǔ'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|赫哲语}}). The Nanai people there variously refer to themselves as /na nio/, {{IPA|/na bəi/}}, /na nai/ (which all mean "local people"), {{IPA|/ki lən/}}, and {{IPA|/χə ɖʐən/}}, the last being the source of the Chinese ethnonym ''Hezhe''.&lt;ref&gt;An 1986, p1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The language is distributed across several distantly-located areas:
* Middle/lower Amur dialects (Naykhin, Dzhuen, Bolon, Ekon, etc.): the areas along the Amur River below Khabarovsk (Nanai, Amursk, Solnechny, and [[Komsomolsk-na-Amure|Komsomolsk]] districts of [[Khabarovsk Krai]]);
* Kur-Urmi dialect: the area around the city of [[Khabarovsk]] (the [[Kur River (Khabarovsk Krai)|Kur]] and [[Urmi River|Urmi]] rivers, and the Khabarovsk District of [[Khabarovsk Krai]]); probably not Nanai or even Southern Tungusic (see [[Kili language]])
* Bikin dialect: Pozharsky District of [[Primorsky Krai]] (near the middle [[Ussuri River]])&lt;ref name="Sem 1976, p24"&gt;Sem 1976, p24&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sungari dialect: boundary areas of the Ussuri River in China&lt;ref name="Stolyarov 1994"&gt;Stolyarov 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that in Russia, the Nanai language has been best preserved in the Nanai District of Khabarovsk Krai, because of the active Nanai-speaking community there, which has been active in working on the publication of books in Nanai, as well as textbooks on the language, and also because of the ethnic autonomous status of the Nanai District. According to Stolyarov's data, the worldwide Nanai population is 11,883, of whom 8,940 live in rural localities of Khabarovsk Krai. However, only 100-150 native speakers of the language remain there.&lt;ref name="Stolyarov 1994"/&gt; The [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Census]] recorded 12,194 Nanai people who claimed to speak  [[Russian language|Russian]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russian Census (2002)]], [http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/TOM_04_03.xls Table 4.3]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Struck this translated statement because it doesn't match census data: In the entire area, not more than 30% can speak the language at all. --&gt; Three ethnic Nanai villages remain, those being Dzhuen, Ulika, and Dada; in the remaining populated areas, the proportion of Nanais among local residents is much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Trade and Economic Development, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in Russia, the situation for language preservation is not favorable: the carriers of language are scattered in different villages and often isolated from each other. The Nanai language continues to be used in the sphere of everyday contact among people older than 40. In their contact with people their age or younger, they prefer the Russian language, using Nanaian only for contact with elderly people aged 70 or older. On the whole, the Nanai language has been superseded by Russian in almost all spheres of communication; drastic measures are required for language preservation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Scholars in China have traditionally presented less fine-grained dialect classifications; An identified only two, Hezhen and Qile'en, the former referring to all varieties of the language spoken in [[Russia]]. He conducted his studies in Jiejinkou, Bacha, And Sipai villages in Heilongjiang; at the time of his survey in 1982, the youngest fluent speaker was 55, and the oldest 72.&lt;ref&gt;An 1986, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical dialect classifications ===

There are several classifications of Nanai dialects. Early classifications tended to be areal and paid less attention to criteria for the differentiation of dialects. Lipskoy-Val'rond's classification, which distinguishes seven dialects, is one example of this; he distinguished the [[Songhua River|Sungari]], Upper [[Amur River|Amur]], [[Ussuri]], [[Urmi River|Urmi]], [[Kur River (Khabarovsk Krai)|Kur]], Central Amur, and Lower Amur dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Sem 1976: 21. Initially published in Дальневосточной энцинклопедии, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the period of initial studies of the Nanai language, the area of settlement of the Nanai people was more extensive than at present; many dialects, which had not yet been classified by researchers, later disappeared, and remain unnamed.

The next period of studies did not begin until after a 20-year interruption, at the end of the 1940s; by then, the number of dialects had grown, and subsequent classifications distinguished as many as ten. Also, the distribution of the Nanai language had sharply narrowed; many Lower [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri]] dialects remained unstudied. According to Sunik's classification, which emphasizes morphological and phonetic features,&lt;ref&gt;Sunik 1962, p23&lt;/ref&gt; "Nanaian language forms two groups, which are decomposed into a number of dialects".&lt;ref&gt;«нанайский язык образует два наречия, распадающиеся на ряд говоров»&lt;/ref&gt;

# Upper Amur: Sakachi-Alyan, Naykhin, Bolon, Dzhuen, Garin
# Central Amur: Kur-Urmi, Bikin, Right-bank Amur, Sungari, Ussuri

Avrorin divided the language into three varieties: Sungari (aka Upper Amur), (Lower) Amur, and Kur-Urmi, further subdividing them into a number of dialects. The basic difference with Sunik's classification concerns the Amur and Upper Amur groups: Avrovin considered Bolon and Dzhuen under Naykhin, while separating Kur-Urmi as its own group, while Sunik viewed Kur-Urmi as a dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Avrovin 1955, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Sem, in contrast, classified Nanai into Upper, Central, and Lower Amur groups, each divided into a number of dialects; he counted a total of ten dialects.&lt;ref name="Sem 1976, p24"/&gt;

# Upper Amur: Right-bank Amur, Sungari, Bikin (Ussuri), Kur-Urmi
# Central Amur: Sakachi-Alyan, Naykhin, Dzhuen
# Lower Amur: Bolon, Ekon, Gorin

&lt;!--- penultimate paragraph is redundant, I'm not gonna bother --&gt;
It should be noted that among the contemporary carriers of Nanaian language (middle and lower Amur dialects), [[dialect levelling]] and mixing has occurred due to extensive population migrations and the system of teaching of Nanai language (based on the Naykhin dialect); therefore it is difficult to differentiate the dialects in contemporary language data.

==Pedagogy==
The Nanai language is taught in secondary schools in Russia, mainly in Nanai villages in [[Khabarovsk Krai]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
The duration of instruction and weekly contact hours vary; a standard curriculum used in 7 villages. Furthermore, in the villages of Belgo, Nizhnie Khalby (Lower Khalby), and Verkhnyaya Ekon (Upper Ekon), there is an experimental teaching programme in Nanaian language with a greater number of contact hours. Normally there are one to two contact hours per week; in different schools, the duration of instruction varies from 4 to 10 years, beginning from the first year. In the schools with the experimental program, the language is taught from years 1 through 9 with a larger number of contact hours.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Textbooks on the Nanai language, fairy tales, and artistic literature are used in Nanai language teaching. Sometimes teachers took the initiative to use oral folklore as well. However, there is a shortage of teaching and auxiliary materials, as well as difficulty in motivating students. Nanai language textbooks follow the model of Russian language textbooks aimed at native speakers, rather than emphasising instruction in the language itself, and in the theoretical/practical grammar. This model is not adequate for the situation of [[heritage speaker|heritage language]] preservation. Moreover, the existing language teaching materials are oriented predominantly (or only) towards the development of reading habits; however, the number of publications in the Nanaian language does not exceed one-two ten, mostly collections of folklore or artistic works of the historical-biographical genre, publishing in limited print runs. Instruction in spoken language is not conducted sufficiently and is not reinforced by teaching aids.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In China, the Nanai (Hezhe) people use Chinese for writing. The number of speakers has been in continual decline for decades; by the 1980s, the use of the language was restricted to special situations and communication with family members.&lt;ref&gt;He and Wu, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to reverse this decline, a text book for Hezhe schoolchildren discussing the Hezhe language was published in 2005 (in [[pinyin]] transcription).&lt;ref&gt;Li, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthography ==
The first books in the Nanai language were printed by Russian Orthodox missionaries in the late 19th century in a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] orthography. In the 1920s-30s, after several false starts, the modern written form of the Nanai language was created by a team of Russian linguists led by [[Valentin Avrorin]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Nanai language uses the same alphabet as the [[Russian alphabet]].

=== Vowels and vowel harmony ===
The Nanai language has seven phonemic vowels: {{IPA|/i, u, y, o, œ, a, ə/}}. There are twelve allowed [[diphthong]]s: {{IPA|/ai, ao, əi, əo, ia, iə, io, iu, ua, ui, uo, oi, ya, yə/}}; there are also two allowed [[triphthong]]s: {{IPA|/iao, uai/}}. Phonemic vowels change as follows based on surrounding consonants:&lt;ref&gt;An 1986, p8-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|[i]}} becomes {{IPA|[]}} after {{IPA|[dz, ts, s]}}&lt;!-- Print quality too poor for me to see what is written!!!  --&gt;
* {{IPA|/i/}} becomes {{IPA|[ɪ]}} after {{IPA|/ɖʐ, ʈʂ, s/}}
* {{IPA|/i/}} becomes {{IPA|[i̟]}} after {{IPA|/m, n, l, d/}}
* A glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is inserted before {{IPA|/i/}} when it begins a syllable and precedes {{IPA|/dz, s, tɕ, ɕ, l, m, ŋ/}}.
* {{IPA|/ɘ/}} may optionally become {{IPA|[ɯ]}} in non-initial syllables
* A vowel in a final syllable is [[nasalization|nasalised]] when it precedes {{IPA|/n/}}

The following table summarises the rules of vowel harmony.

Phonemic consonants may optionally change as follows:&lt;ref&gt;An 1986, p11-13&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/s ɕ χ/}} become {{IPA|[z ʑ ʁ]}} (respectively) between two vowels
* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} to {{IPA|[ɣ]}} in syllable-final position, before {{IPA|[d]}} in the following syllable

=== Dialects ===
Phonology of the various dialects of Nanai has been influenced by surrounding languages. Tolskaya specifically noted several phonological peculiarities of Bikin dialect which may indicate influence from [[Udege language|Udege]], including monopthongisation of diphthongs, denasalisation of [[nasal vowels]], deletion of reduced final vowels, [[epenthetic vowel]] preventing consonant final words, and the deletion of intervocalic {{IPA|[w]}}.&lt;ref name="Tolskaya 2001, p24"&gt;Tolskaya 2001, p24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexicon ==

An noted a variety of [[loanword]]s from Chinese in his survey, such as {{IPA|[ʐili]}} "calendar" from Chinese 日曆 ([[Pinyin]]: ''rìlì''); a few also came from other languages, such as [pomidor] (tomato), almost certainly from [[Russian language|Russian]] помидор, though the exact route of transmission is not attested and it may have been reborrowed from other neighbouring languages rather than directly from Russian.&lt;ref&gt;An, p7-11&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some vocabulary shared with [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and the [[Turkic languages]], such as:
* {{IPA|[sal]}} ("beard"; [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] {{IPA|[sahɘl]}}, [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] {{IPA|[saqal]}})
* {{IPA|[tœqo]}} ("chicken"; [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] {{IPA|[tahia]}}, [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] {{IPA|[toχo]}}, [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] {{IPA|[tawuq]}})
* {{IPA|[χonin]}} ("sheep"; [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] {{IPA|[χœŋ]}}, [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] {{IPA|[qoi]}})
These too are likely loanwords, though proponents of the [[Altaic hypothesis]] may take these as evidence of a [[Genetic (linguistics)|genetic relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;An, p17&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Nanai language itself has also contributed some loanwords to the [[Udege language]], supplanting Udege vocabulary:
* {{IPA|[banixe]}} (thank you), from Nanai {{IPA|[banixa]}}, instead of Udege {{IPA|[usasa]}}
* {{IPA|[dœlbo]}} (work), from Nanai {{IPA|[dœbo]}}, instead of Udege {{IPA|[etete]}}
* {{IPA|[daŋsa]}} (book) from Nanai {{IPA|[daŋsa]}}, itself a loanword from Chinese 單子 ([[Pinyin]]: dānzi), which actually means "list"
A large degree of mutual assimilation of the two languages has been observed in the [[Bikin]] region;&lt;ref name="Tolskaya 2001, p24"/&gt; the Udege language itself only has 230 speakers left.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2009, [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ude Udihe]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25325">Dockworkers (also known as waterfront workers) in the United States city of [[New Orleans]] at the turn of the 20th century often coordinated their unionization efforts across racial lines.  The nature of that coordination has led some scholars to conclude that the seeming interracial union activity was in fact bi-racial: a well-organized plan of parallel concerted activity with coordination and support between the groups, but with a clear divide along racial lines.  Under this framework, cooperation was seen less a matter of ideological interracial solidarity among the working class and more a matter of pragmatism so that the working conditions of each distinct group would improve.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Arnesen, "Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'', ed. Calvin Winslow, University of Illinois Press, Chicago (1998) (p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed below, several factors may have allowed bi-racial union efforts to succeed at the [[port of New Orleans]], including (a) the independent strength of the black&lt;ref&gt;For the sake of consistency throughout, this Article uses the racial descriptors "black" and "white."  Other possible descriptors for those groups include Black, African-American, White, and Caucasian. No implication or inference should be drawn as a result of the terms chosen in this Article.&lt;/ref&gt; unions that compelled whites to enter into collaborative agreements with them; (b) the prior history of racial division or segmentation of labor; (c) the relative power of employers to control jobs; and (d) overall employment relations.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 47).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because dock work was generally unskilled (with the notable exception of [[New Orleans Dock Workers and Unionization#Screwmen|screwmen]]) and of a short-term contractual nature, an employer could readily replace workers who refused to bend to the employer's terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nystrom|first1=Justin|title=The Vanished World of the New Orleans Longshoreman|journal=Southern Spaces|date=March 5, 2014|url=http://southernspaces.org/2014/vanished-world-new-orleans-longshoreman|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black laborers were both numerous and available for work. In this type of competitive market, blacks and whites were pitted against each other by ship owners in an effort to keep wages down: if whites would not work for a lower wage, owners would look to blacks who would.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 26).&lt;/ref&gt;   Following this reasoning, "[o]nly control of the labor supply and solidarity across trade and racial lines could reduce this possibility.  That meant that alliances between unions and, most importantly, between black and white unions, were essential to reducing competition between different groups for jobs."&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 26).&lt;/ref&gt;   Alliances between the groups allowed both to exercise more control over the terms and conditions of their work, including wage rates and production expectations.  Union leaders of both races recognized the difference that an alliance made in those terms and conditions, prompting a pragmatic continuation of the biracial system.

==50-50 or Half-and-Half==
New Orleans dockworkers maintained a long-standing tradition known as "50-50" or "half-and-half."  Under this arrangement, both black and white workers insisted that any work crew hired by ship owners be 50% black and 50% white.  Workers would labor side by side, performing the same work for the same pay.  This was generally seen as a way to prevent employers from undermining one group by playing to the other: both black and white union leaders recognizes that when blacks and whites were hired in alternating groups as they were in the mid-1890s, unions weakened and race riots or other tensions could – and did – flare up.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Daniel, ''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' SUNY Press, Albany (1988) (pp. 69, 71); Arnesen, Eric, ''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans: Race, Class, and Politics'' Oxford University Press, New York (1991) (pp. 143-44).&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1901 the separate black and white unions created a Dock and Cotton Council that overarched unions of black and white screwmen, longshoremen, teamsters, loaders, and other work classifications at the waterfront.  Leadership positions on the Council were generally divided according to the 50-50 system, with the presidency and financial secretary position held by white workers and the vice-presidency and corresponding secretary position held by black workers.  Committee positions were similarly assigned.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p.73).&lt;/ref&gt;   By 1903, the Council oversaw eight separate unions of black and white dockworkers with a total of approximately 10,000 members and helped ensure that all unions adhered to the 50-50 rule.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 74).&lt;/ref&gt;   Over time, it also assisted the member unions in negotiations with employers and were kept informed of the unions' organizational and racial relationships.  As the overarching union body, the Council was also empowered to call for a general port strike.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 74).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits On Racial Cooperation==
Both black and white unions insisted that they had no interracial equality or ideological leanings.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt;   Black workers announced that they wanted a stable waterfront, not social equality with white men, and did not want to be used by employers to drive a wedge between the races.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 30).&lt;/ref&gt;   The structure and operation of the Dock and Cotton Council has also been seen as racially stratified by some scholars.  Although black and whites were elected equally to officer positions and conference committees, and work operated under the 50-50 system, white workers consistently held the presidency and were the only ones allowed to hold foreman positions.  Black workers vehemently protested their exclusion from foreman jobs, but faced resistance from white waterfront laborers who did not want to take orders from a black man.  In order to preserve the overall alliance, black unions retreated from the foreman controversy.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 31).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screwmen==
New Orleans screwmen were responsible for tightly compressing and packing cotton bales into the holds of ships.  This critical task put them at the top of the labor force on the docks and allowed them to insist on the highest wages; their work was highly skilled, required immense strength, and was indispensable to the smooth operation of the waterfront.  However, in contrast to other waterfront laborers, white screwmen had resisted cooperation with their black counterparts.  In the 1880s, the white screwmen refused the 50-50 arrangements and voted for a quota system that allowed only 20 black screwmen crews per day.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 27).&lt;/ref&gt;   Another account put the limit at 100 black screwmen at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt;   The locals had separate contracts with different terms, and there was no way to support workers in labor disputes. In addition, rumors began to spread that shipping agents were trying to find ways to remove the 75-bale per day limit instituted by white screwmen by using black screwmen who would work for lower wages with no limit on bales stowed.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 125-26).&lt;/ref&gt;   A black shipping company also emerged.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt;   Such types of racial divisions led to riots in the mid-1890s as black screwmen attacked their white counterparts, whites responded with equal violence, and numerous deaths resulted.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 27); ''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (pp. 127-29).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the twentieth century, however, screwmen of both races faced new pressures and demands from employers with the advent of new shipping technologies, larger ship size, and the shippers' search for non-union labor.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 122).&lt;/ref&gt;   Now, "speed, not skill, was central to profitability."&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 28).&lt;/ref&gt;   In part as a response to the high wages that screwmen commanded (regardless of how many bales were stowed) and the results of cooperation between black and white workers overall on the waterfront, employers introduced a new system of loading known as 'shoot-the-chute.'  This system required crews of 4 to 5 men to throw down between 400 and 700 bales or more of cotton per day into the holds of the ships where other workers waited to pack them.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 163).&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, in contrast to earlier years, no limit was placed on the number of bales required to constitute a day's work – men would work until told to stop, not until they reached a set number of bales.  There was also concern that the faster pace would mean that there would be less work left for subsequent days, leaving workers idle (and unpaid).&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 83).&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of a fair day's work was central to the dispute, and in April 1902 the employers' Steamship Conference declared that (1) the employer had the right to direct where employees work; (2) that the employer's orders must be obeyed, even if the employer's agent was not a union member; (3) only Conference members could determine the "character of the stowage of the cotton"; and (4) the employer had the right to expect as much work as could reasonably be done.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 166).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both black and white screwmen fiercely resisted shoot-the-chute and the lower working conditions it represented for them, as well as the Conference's view of a day's work.  In order to effectively stand against their employers, the two screwmen unions agreed to a uniform wage scale in April 1902.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 28).&lt;/ref&gt;  This contract also provided for equal work distribution among black and white screwmen, but forbade them from engaging in sympathy strikes or striking for higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 82-83).&lt;/ref&gt;   As scholar [http://departments.columbian.gwu.edu/history/people/92 Eric Arnesen] analyzed the situation, "white workers reasoned accurately that success lay in reducing all possible divisions between black and white workers and preventing a revival of a split labor market on the docks."&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 28).&lt;/ref&gt;   Black screwmen found a somewhat different reason for joining with their white counterparts, namely, a sense that they were being unfairly used by owners as a way to attack the white workers and starve them out of work – and being paid lower wages in the process.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 28).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1902, the black and white screwmen unions agreed that they would present all demands to employers jointly, renew the 50-50 work-sharing agreement from the spring, and maintain mixed-race work crews.  Embracing 50-50 even further, they insisted that they would not recognize a foreman who was not a member of either the black or white screwmen's union.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 29).&lt;/ref&gt;   Moreover, 100 to 120 bales of cotton would be a day's work – not the 400 and 700 demanded under shoot-the-chute.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 83); ''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 164).&lt;/ref&gt;

The screwmen's alliance was deemed generally successful and firmly adhered to by both black and white unions.  From 1902 through 1903, they launched a series of strikes (and responding lockouts from employers) that ended in the realization of their production rate and 50-50 demands.  Notably, the screwmen enjoyed the backing of other waterfront unions – both black and white – and the newly formed Dock and Cotton Council.&lt;ref&gt;"Biracial Waterfront Unionism" in ''Waterfront Workers'' (p. 29); ''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 83-84).&lt;/ref&gt;    The first strike began on November 3, 1902 when screwmen struck all employers who did not adhere to the new joint contract demands.  Despite the fact that employers accused black unions of breaking the terms in their earlier separate contract and threatened them, the strike remained united and ended in early December 1902; by December 25, screwmen were packing on average 110 bales per day.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 85).&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the screwmen's success, employers instituted two lockouts in 1903, again centering on the shoot-the-chute system and the required number of bales that screwmen would have to stow.  In April, employers demanded no limits on the number of bales stowed, the end of 50-50, restoration of shoot-the-chute, and a restoration of the power to give work assignments.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 85); ''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 166).&lt;/ref&gt;   When both black and white workers refused and described the demand as "so objectionable and so inimical" that they could not accept,&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 167).&lt;/ref&gt;  they were locked out for approximately three weeks.  Negotiations continued through the spring and summer, with employers agreeing on 50-50 but insisting on the higher pace and threatening to move work elsewhere.  Although rumors of a split between the black and white unions surfaced, no break actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 87-88).&lt;/ref&gt;  With no contract by September and no definition of a fair day's work, workers worked at their own pace and, again, the black and white unions affirmed their cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 167).&lt;/ref&gt;

The screwmen were again locked out on October 1, 1903, this time supported by black and white longshoremen.  Shippers filed several lawsuits and restraining orders against the screwmen, and city leaders (including [[Paul Capdevielle|Mayor Paul Capdevielle]]) unsuccessfully attempted to mediate.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 168).&lt;/ref&gt;   Scholar Daniel Rosenberg noted that even imported strikebreakers sometimes quit when they learned of the lockout and both protests and violence rapidly broke out.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 88-89).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the two-week lockout ended when employers proposed terms requiring screwmen to produce 160 hand-stowed bales per day.  After intense debate in a joint meeting of the black and white screwmen, the proposal was accepted and the shipping lines admitted defeat.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 168).&lt;/ref&gt;   Shippers experienced more than $400,000 in losses while screwmen lost $50,000 in wages and prevented any bales of cotton from leaving the port of New Orleans between October 1 and October 10, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 90).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1907 General Levee Strike==
In the autumn of 1907, both black and white longshore workers launched an extended [[general strike]] against their shipping company employers.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 196); ''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 115).&lt;/ref&gt;   As in 1902-03, screwmen were the focus of the initial conflict, which one scholar identifies as resentment on the part of shippers and steamship agents that the screwmen (and other dockworkers) had nearly seized complete control over their terms of work and won the 160-per-day bale limit.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 196).&lt;/ref&gt;   When the 1903 contract expired on September 1, 1907, employers employed a 'parity' argument, demanding that New Orleans screwmen stow as much cotton as their counterparts in [[Galveston, Texas]] – a rate which employers initially claimed to be 200 bales per day but quickly escalated to what scholars peg at 240, or even 300 bales per day.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 196); ''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 119-20).&lt;/ref&gt;   On October 4, all of the shipping lines locked out the screwmen, black and white alike.  Pursuant to a call from the Dock and Cotton Council, 9,000 dockworkers, black and white, struck the New Orleans port that evening in a show of solidarity with the screwmen.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 121-22).&lt;/ref&gt;   Freight handlers from the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific line]] also struck, ending any work on the port.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 122).&lt;/ref&gt;   Individual black and white waterfront unions reinforced the Council's message, asking their members to stay away from the ports, insisting that they would hold firm across racial lines, and noting that if the employers played one racial group against the other, they would all face starvation wages.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 123).&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers responded by immediately bringing in thousands of black and white strikebreakers.  During the first week of the strike, the breakers unloaded freight trains and stowed cotton.  Although some crews worked at a 200 bale per day rate, they could not keep up that rate and were considered by some to be less efficient than expected.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt;   Some of the replacements quit when they learned they were being used as strikebreakers, and others quit in response to the protests of the New Orleans waterfront workers.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 125-127).&lt;/ref&gt;  The families of dockworkers also confronted strikebreakers, as did some members of the strikebreakers' own families who felt solidarity with the dockworkers.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 131-33).&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet the New Orleans strikers remained generally peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 126).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second week of the strike, employers launched strong attempts to create a racial break among the black and white strikers.  Some employers began calling for an end to the screwman trade altogether (to be replaced by general dock labor); a combination of events that led some observers to conclude that the employers' goal was not to reach settlement but rather to destroy the screwmen's union.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (pp. 197-98); ''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 122-23).&lt;/ref&gt;   They also appealed to the non-screwmen, noting that they were losing wages over a battle that was not their own.  Shippers also revived the White League, a group designed to intimidate black strikers.  Despite the attempts, strikers remained united.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 127-28).&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, black and white screwmen proposed a return to work at the rate of 160 bales per day, pending an investigation into port charges and conditions.  The New Orleans mayor endorsed this proposal, but employers refused and insisted on the 200 bale per day rate.  In turn, the screwmen rejected the employers' demand and held to the 160 bale rate.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 128-29).&lt;/ref&gt;   During this process, rumors began to spread claiming that the black and white screwmen had begun to splinter, as had the unity between the screwmen and the other waterfront job classification; however, no split materialized.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 128).&lt;/ref&gt;   Instead, the union agreed that it would accept the mayor's proposal of 180 bales per day on the condition that this rate stand as a final settlement, pending no further action or investigation. This was rejected by management, and prompted claims in the newspapers that the workers were inflexible.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 129-30).&lt;/ref&gt;

The general strike ended on October 24, 1907 with a compromise plan endorsed and urged by the city's mayor, who was under pressure due to ongoing financial losses resulting from the disruption of work.&lt;ref&gt;''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 133-34).&lt;/ref&gt;   Under the proposal, screwmen would agree to return to work at the rate of 180 bales per day pending binding arbitration of their conflict; shipping agents reluctantly agreed as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (pp. 198-99).&lt;/ref&gt;   In response to union demands, the agreement also included provisions for an investigation into the port's viability and conditions based on workers' allegations that they were unfairly being blamed for general economic and trade problems.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 199).&lt;/ref&gt;   Racial divisions quickly formed as the screwmen appointed their representatives to the investigatory committee along the 50-50 principle – and white ship owners refused to work with the black representatives.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 199-200); ''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (pp. 135-38).&lt;/ref&gt;  After no resolution could be reached, the mayor and Louisiana governor [[Newton C. Blanchard]] instructed the state assembly to form a five-person committee to investigate all charges and regulations affecting the New Orleans port, including labor and related elements.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 200); ''New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism 1892-1923'' (p. 140-41).&lt;/ref&gt;   This committee began work in January 1908 and continued through mid-May of the same year.  A particular focus was the nature of cross-racial action; they viewed the screwmen's 50-50 rule as undesirable, particularly as it risked fostering what they considered inappropriate social equality.  White supremacy rhetoric also existed, but although the commission called for an end to cross-racial cooperation, the workers ignored the instructions and the commission could not enforce their position.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (pp. 200-202).&lt;/ref&gt;   Ultimately, the commissioners concluded that labor was not overpaid and worked under the same conditions as their counterparts in other locations.  On the question of bale-rate, it ruled that 187 bales of loose cotton per work crew would constitute a day's work.&lt;ref&gt;''Waterfront Workers of New Orleans'' (p. 202).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Altai''' or '''Northern Altay''' is one of two [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] languages spoken in the [[Altay Republic]] of [[Russia]] on the border of [[Mongolia]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[Kazakhstan]].  Though traditionally considered one language, [[Southern Altai language|Southern Altai]] is not fully mutually intelligible with the Northern varieties.  [[Altay language|Written Altai]] is based on Southern Altai, and is rejected by Northern Altai children.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon, Jr, ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern Altay is written in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].  In 2006, in the [[Altai Krai|Altay kray]], an alphabet was created for the Kumandy variety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indigenous.ru/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=215  В Алтайском крае издана азбука кумандинского языка. 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to data from the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian Census]], 65,534 people in Russia stated that they have command of the Altay language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perepis2002.ru/index.html?id=44 Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года. Том 13. «Коренные малочисленные народы Российской Федерации»]&lt;/ref&gt;  Only around 10% of them speak Northern Altay varieties, while the remaining speak Southern Altay varieties.  Furthermore, according to some data, only 2% of Altays fluently speak the Altay language.&lt;ref name="Krugosvet"&gt;[http://www.krugosvet.ru/articles/80/1008043/1008043a1.htm Энциклопедия «Кругосвет»]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
Northern Altay consists of the following varieties:
*{{Interlanguage link|Kumandy dialect|ru|Кумандинское наречие|tr|Kumandıca|tt|Куманды теле|WD=}} (also Qubandy/Quwandy). 1,862 [[Kumandins]] claim to know their national language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_13_02.htm Russian census figures]&lt;/ref&gt; but 1,044 people were registered as knowing Kumandy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_04_04.htm Russian census figures]&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Interlanguage link|Chelkan dialect|ru|Челканское наречие|pt|Língua chelkan|WD=}} (also Kuu/Quu, Chalkandu/Shalkanduu, Lebedin).  466 [[Chelkans]] claim to speak their national language, and 539 people in all claim to know Chalkan.

{{Interlanguage link|Tubalar language|ru|Тубаларский язык|tr|Tuba Türkçesi|WD=}} (also known as Tuba language), is also often ascribed to belong to the Northern Altai group, but it's relations to other languages is dubious and it may belong to [[Kipchak languages]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613983309|title=Tubalarskie ėti︠u︡dy|date=2009|publisher=IMLI RAN|others=Tatevosov, S.

Closely related to the northern varieties of Altay are {{Interlanguage link|Kondom Shor dialect|ru|Кондомское шорское наречие|tr|Kоndоm Şor ağzı|WD=}} and the {{Interlanguage link|Lower Chulym dialect|ru|Нижнечулымское наречие|tr|Aşağı Çulım ağzı|WD=}} of [[Chulym language]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Linguistic features==
The following features refer to the outcome of commonly used Turkic [[isoglosses]] in Northern Altay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Диалект Черневых Татар (Туба-Кижи): грамматический очерк и словарь.|last=Baskakov|first=Nikolay Aleksandrovich|authorlink=Nikolay Aleksandrovich Baskakov |publisher=Наука|year=1966|isbn=|location=Moscow|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Диалект Кумандинцев (Куманды-Кижи): грамматический очерк, тексты, переводы и словарь.|last=Baskakov|first=Nikolay Aleksandrovich|publisher=Наука|authorlink=Nikolay Aleksandrovich Baskakov |year=1972|isbn=|location=Москва|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Диалект Лебединских Татар-Чалканцев (Куу-Кижи)|last=Baskakov|authorlink=Nikolay Aleksandrovich Baskakov |first=Nikolay Aleksandrovich|publisher=Наука|year=1985|isbn=|location=Москва|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* */ag/ — Proto-Turkic */ag/ is found in three variations throughout Northern Altay: /u/, /aw/, /aʁ/
* */eb/ — Proto-Turkic */eb/ is found as either /yj/ or /yg/, depending on the variety
* */VdV/ — With a few lexical exceptions (likely borrowings), proto-Turkic intervocalic */d/ results in /j/.

The '''Omashaka massacre''' was a [[mass murder]] that occurred in Omashaka, a village five miles north of [[Ondangwa]] in [[Ovamboland]], [[South West Africa]] on March 27, 1981, when a black soldier killed eight people and wounded twelve others, two of them seriously, before being arrested.

The 18-year-old soldier, a member of the [[101 Battalion]], was reported to have shot at shoppers in a trading or liquor store, and at people sitting in front of their huts with an assault rifle, killing three soldiers and five women, and wounding two other soldiers and ten civilians.&lt;ref&gt;South African soldier kills eight shoppers, ''[[The Times]]'' (March 31, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HZASAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4547,684696&amp;dq= Berserk soldier kills eight], ''[[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]'' (March 30, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palo''' is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found through the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies - usually coinciding with saint's days - as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo Basin|Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies. Palos are related to Dominican folk Catholicism, which includes a pantheon of deities/saints (here termed misterios) much like those found in the Afro-American syncretic religious traditions of Cuba, Brazil, Haiti, and elsewhere. Palos are usually associated with the lower class, black and mixed populations. They can be seen in different regions of Dominican Republic, but with variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janette Keys |url=http://www.colonialzone-dr.com/musica_tipica-palos.html |title=Palos, Atabales, Babula and Quiyombo Music of Dominican Republic |publisher=Colonialzone-dr.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition |title=Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition |publisher=Iasorecords.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
Palo music is played on long drums termed palos. The word palos means trees, and therefore all Dominican palos drums are instruments made from hollowed out logs. The head of the drum is made of cowhide and it is attached to the log portion with hoops and pegs in the Eastern region, or with nails in the Southwest. There is a master drum (palo mayor) which is the large, wide drum played with slimmer drums (alcahuetes) alongside: two in the East or three elsewhere. Palos are usually played with guiras, which are metal scrapers. They may also be played with maracas, or a little stick used to hit the master drum, called the catá. The Dominican region in which the palos are played determines the form, the number of the instruments, and how they are played.

==Tradition==
Palos are associated with the Afro- Dominican brotherhoods called cofradías. Originally, the brotherhoods were composed solely of males. As time progressed, females and family inheritance maintained the brotherhoods’ sanctity. Each brotherhood is devoted to a particular saint. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the brotherhood is to honor the saint with a festival. Historically, cofradías were established on principles similar to those of the Mediterranean guild-based societies and those founded by Africans that inhabited southern Spain. Through colonization and the slave trade, these traditions were brought to the Dominican Republic. 

Palo music is generally played at festivals honoring saints (velaciones) or during other religious events. The configuration of instruments present depends on the region in which these events take place. Palo drums are played with the hands, held between the legs, and tied to the palero's waist by a rope. The three paleros each play a distinct beat on their palos, which ultimately blend together. These rhythms vary depending on the region as well. For example, in the East, the "palo corrido" rhythm is popular, while in San Cristóbal, one may be more likely to find the "palo abajo" rhythm. While they play their drums, one of the paleros simultaneously sings verses of a song. The surrounding audience often invokes spirits of ancestors or saints, and it is not unusual to encounter participants becoming possessed at these events.

'''Patrick J.''' ("'''Pat'''") '''Michaels''' (born February 15, 1950) is an American [[Climatology|climatologist]]. Michaels is a senior fellow in environmental studies at the [[Cato Institute]]. Until 2007 he was [[Professor#Non-tenure-track positions|research professor]] of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, where he had worked from 1980.&lt;ref name="Patrick J. Michaels"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibson |first=Bob |date=September 25, 2007 |title=Former climatologist will pursue research work |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/former_climatologist_will_pursue_research_work/1857/ |newspaper=Charlottesville Daily Progress |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081201194308/http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/former_climatologist_will_pursue_research_work/1857/ |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-described skeptic on the issue of [[global warming]], he is a past president of the [[American Association of State Climatologists]]. He has written a number of books and papers on climate change, including ''Sound and Fury: The Science and Politics of Global Warming'' (1992), ''The Satanic Gases'' (2000), and ''Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media'' (2004). He's also the co-author of ''Climate of Extremes: Global Warming Science They Don't Want You to Know'' (2009).&lt;ref name="Patrick J. Michaels"&gt;"[http://www.cato.org/people/patrick-michaels Patrick J. Michaels]," Cato Institute, accessed August 3, 2010; for his self-described skepticism, see Michaels, Patrick. [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6129 "Holes in the Greenhouse Effect?"], Cato Institute, accessed August 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels' viewpoint, as argued in a 2002 article in the journal ''[[Climate Research (journal)|Climate Research]]'', is that the planet will see "a warming range of 1.3–3.0°C, with a central value of 1.9°C" for the 1990 to 2100 period (an analysis far smaller than the IPCC's average predictions).&lt;ref name=variability/&gt;

==Education==
Patrick Michaels obtained an A.B. in biological science in 1971 and an S.M. in biology in 1975 from the [[University of Chicago]], and in 1979 obtained his Ph.D. in ecological climatology from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/sites/default/files/documents/MICHAELS.CV_.2009.02.12.pdf | title=C.V.

==Views on climate change==
Michaels has said that he does not contest the basic scientific principles behind greenhouse warming and acknowledges that the global mean temperature has increased in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2007-02-01-oppose_x.htm | title=Live with climate change | work=[[USA Today]] | date=1 February 2007 | accessdate=13 March 2014 | author=Michaels, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is quoted as being skeptical of [[global warming]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=The current citation does not quote Michaels as described.}}&lt;ref name=Seattle&gt;{{cite news|title=The truth about global warming |date=11 October 2005 |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]] |first=Sandi |last=Doughton |accessdate=2007-05-04 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002549346_globewarm11.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425173920/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002549346_globewarm11.html |archivedate=April 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is described by [[Michael E. Mann]] as a "prominent climate change contrarian."&lt;ref name="Mann2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klerAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q=Michaels&amp;f=false|title=The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines|last=|first=|date=1 October 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-231-15255-6|location=|pages=106|author=Michael E. Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that the changes will be minor, not [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|catastrophic]], and may even be beneficial.&lt;ref name="Michaels2000"&gt;{{cite journal | publisher=Regulation | volume=23 | issue=3 | date=Fall 2000 | accessdate=2007-03-14 | title=The Way of Warming | first=Patrick | last=Michaels | author2=Paul C. Knappenberger | author3=Robert E. Davis | url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv23n3/michaels5.pdf | format=PDF | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070215212203/https://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv23n3/michaels5.pdf | archivedate=2007-02-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written extensive editorials on this topic for the mass media, and for [[think tank]]s and their publications such as ''Regulation''. He stated in 2000:&lt;ref name="Michaels2000" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]cientists know quite precisely how much the planet will warm in the foreseeable future, a modest three-quarters of a degree (C) [in 50 years]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;All this has to do with basic physics, which isn't real hard to understand. It has been known since 1872 that as we emit more and more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere, each increment results in less and less warming. In other words, the first changes produce the most warming, and subsequent ones produce a bit less, and so on. But we also assume carbon dioxide continues to go into the atmosphere at an ever-increasing rate. In other words, the increase from year-to-year isn't constant, but itself is increasing. The effect of increasing the rate of carbon dioxide emissions, coupled with the fact that more and more carbon dioxide produces less and less warming compels our climate projections for the future warming to be pretty much a straight line. Translation: Once human beings start to warm the climate, they do so at a constant rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Michaels | first = Patrick | title = Posturing and reality on warming | publisher = [[Washington Times]] | date = 16 October 2003 | url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/oct/15/20031015-085235-5134r/?page=all | accessdate = 2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Michaels has stated in the ''Wall Street Journal'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Why is the news on global warming always bad? Perhaps because there's little incentive to look at things the other way. If you do, you're liable to be pilloried by your colleagues. If global warming isn't such a threat, who needs all that funding?&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120847988943824973?mod=opinion_main_commentaries "Our Climate Numbers Are a Big Old Mess"], Wall Street Journal, 4-18-08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2002 article published in the journal ''[[Climate Research (journal)|Climate Research]]'' by Michaels and three other scholars has predicted "a warming range of 1.3–3.0°C, with a central value of 1.9°C" over the 1990 to 2100 period, although he remarked that the "temperature range and central values determined in our study may be too great." He made the argument that the climate feedback system involving current warming trends was weaker than generally asserted, coming to a conclusion that set his views apart from that of the IPCC's estimates.&lt;ref name=variability&gt;"[http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr2003/23/c023p001.pdf Revised 21st century temperature projections]", Patrick J. Michaels, Paul C. Knappenberger, Oliver W. Frauenfeld and Robert E. Davis, Climate Research, Vol. 23: 1–9, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Michaels authored a Cato report arguing that "Congress should pass no legislation restricting emissions of carbon dioxide, repeal current ethanol mandates, and inform the public about how little climate change would be prevented by proposed legislation." &lt;ref name=CATOHandbook2009&gt;

==Advocacy==

===Expert witness for Western Fuels Association===

In May 1994 [[Richard Lindzen]], Michaels, and [[Robert Balling]] served as expert witnesses on behalf of [[Western Fuels Association]] in St. Paul, Minnesota to determine the environmental cost of coal burning by state power plants.&lt;ref name=harpers1995&gt;

===1998: Michaels and Balling complaint against ''Star Tribune'' upheld===

In May 1997 [[Ross Gelbspan]] made a presentation in Minneapolis discussing his concerns, documented in his 1997 book ''The Heat is On'', that some climatologists were involved in a "disinformation campaign" to counter the scientific consensus on global warming. The Minnesota ''[[Star Tribune]]'' ran an editorial praising this as a public service exposing undue credit given to the "unsubsantiated opinions" of a handful of contrarian scientists, and naming Michaels and his colleague [[Robert Balling]] as skeptics whose views had been examined and dismissed by numerous other scientists. Michaels and Balling took a complaint against the ''Star Tribune'' to the Minnesota News Council, and at a hearing in April 1998 by a 9–4 decision the council "voted to sustain the complaint that the Star Tribune editorial unfairly characterized the scientific reputations of Patrick Michaels and Robert Balling."&lt;ref name=MNC&gt;Minnesota News Council, 16 April 1998, [http://news-council.org/1998/04/16/determination-118-patrick-michaels-robert-balling-v-star-tribune/ Determination 118: Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling v.

===International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group in 2007===
Michaels was one of hundreds of US reviewers composing the International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group in 2007.

Although the Greening Earth Society was generally skeptical of the impact of climate change, it acknowledged some degree of global warming as real: "Fact #1. The rate of global warming during the past several decades has been about 0.18°C per decade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeningearthsociety.org/wca/2004/wca_19d.html |title=Greening Earth Society |accessdate=March 15, 2005 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315081640/http://www.greeningearthsociety.org/wca/2004/wca_19d.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that the actual increase in the global surface temperature during the 100 years ending in 2005 was 0.74 ± 0.18&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="grida7a"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf  | format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | title=Summary for Policymakers | work=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

===''Climate of Extremes''===

Michaels received praise for his book, ''Climate of Extremes: Global Warming Science They Don't Want You to Know'' (2009) from [[University of Alabama in Huntsville|University of Alabama-Huntsville]] Principal [[Research Scientist]] [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]], who wrote, "Michaels and [[Robert Balling|[Co-Author Robert] Balling]] have provided a treasure trove of the latest global warming science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrbookservice.com/products/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=c7307 |accessdate=2010-01-10 |title=New findings about climate change the media won't tell you about |publisher=National Review Book Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105004403/http://www.nrbookservice.com/products/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=c7307 |archivedate=2011-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Happer]], Professor of [[Physics]] and Former Chairman of the University Research Board at [[Princeton University]], also praised the book and wrote it "...provides important and honest information about climate change that is hard to find elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Climate of Extremes: Global Warming Science They Don't Want You to Know | publisher=Cato Institute| first=Patrick | last=Michaels |date=January 2009| isbn=978-1-933995-23-6 | authorlink=Patrick J.

==Funding from energy or fossil fuel companies==
On July 27, 2006 [[ABC News]] reported that a Colorado energy cooperative, the Intermountain Rural Electric Association, had given Michaels $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Paul Kammerer''' (17 August 1880, in [[Vienna]] – 23 September 1926, in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg]]) was an [[Austria]]n biologist who studied and advocated [[Lamarckism]], the theory that organisms may pass to their offspring characteristics acquired in their lifetime.

==Biography==
===Education===
He began his academic career at the [[Vienna Academy]] by studying [[music]] but graduated with a degree in [[biology]].

===Biological research===

Kammerer's work in biology largely involved altering the breeding and [[embryology|development]] of [[amphibians]]. He made [[ovoviviparous]] [[fire salamander]]s become [[viviparous]], and viviparous [[alpine salamander]]s become ovoviviparous.

In lesser-known experiments, he manipulated and bred [[olm]]s. He made olms produce live young and bred dark-colored olms with full vision. He supported the [[Lamarckian]] theory of heritability of acquired characteristics, and he experimented extensively in an effort to prove the theory.&lt;ref name=Schmuck&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schmuck |first=Thomas |title=The Midwife Toad and Human Progress |editor-last=Hofrichter |editor-first=Robert |encyclopedia = Amphibians: The World of Frogs, Toads, Salamanders and Newts |pages=212–213 |publisher=Firefly |location=New York |isbn=1-55209-541-X |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kammerer succeeded in making [[midwife toad]]s breed in the water by increasing the temperature of their tanks, forcing them to retreat to the water to cool off. The male midwife toads were not genetically programmed for underwater mating so over the span of two generations, Kammerer reported that his midwife toads were exhibiting black [[nuptial pad]]s on their feet to give them more traction in this underwater mating process.

While the prehistoric ancestors of midwife toads had the pads, Kammerer considered the pads to be an acquired characteristic brought about by adaptation to environment.&lt;ref name=Schmuck/&gt;

====Accusations of fraud====
Claims arose that the result of the toad experiment had been falsified. The most notable of these was made by Dr [[Gladwyn Kingsley Noble]], Curator of Reptiles at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. After a microscopic examination, Noble claimed that the black pads actually had a far more mundane explanation: they had simply been injected with [[India ink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=G. K.|last=Noble|title=Kammerer's Alytes|journal=Nature|volume=118|issue=2962|pages=209–211|year=1926|doi=10.1038/118209a0|bibcode=1926Natur.118..209.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter, Kammerer stated that after reading Noble's paper, he re-examined his specimen and confirmed that India ink had been injected into the pads.&lt;ref name="Stein 1993"&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1993). ''Encyclopedia of Hoaxes''. Gale Group. p. 248. {{ISBN|0-8103-8414-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kammerer suggested that his specimens had been altered by a laboratory assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Oldroyd, David Roger. (1980). ''Darwinian Impacts: An Introduction to the Darwinian Revolution''. Open University Press. p. 179. {{ISBN|978-0868400334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminologist [[Edward Sagarin]] wrote, "Kammerer maintained his total innocence and declared his ignorance of the forger's identity. There is still doubt about whether an obliging (or hostile) assistant was responsible for the forgery, but Kammerer's scientific credibility was nevertheless irremediably damaged".&lt;ref&gt;Sagarin, Edward. (1977). ''Deviance and Social Change''. Sage Publications. p. 115. {{ISBN|978-0803908055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Peter J. Bowler]] wrote that most biologists believe that Kammerer was a fraud and that even the others claim that he misinterpreted the results of his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (2003). ''Evolution: The History of an Idea''. University of California Press. pp. 265-266. {{ISBN|0-520-23693-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seriality theory===
Kammerer's other passion was collecting coincidences. He published a book with the title ''Das Gesetz der Serie''&lt;ref&gt;{{scholarpedia|title=Law of series (Kammerer)|urlname=Law_of_series#Kammerer|curator=Tomasz Downarowicz}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''The Law of the Series'', never translated into English) in which he recounted some 100 anecdotes of coincidences that had led him to formulate his theory of seriality.

He postulated that all events are connected by waves of seriality. The unknown forces would cause what is perceived as just the peaks, or groupings and coincidences. Kammerer was known, for example, to make notes in public parks of what numbers of people were passing by, how many carried umbrellas etc. [[Albert Einstein]] called the idea of seriality "interesting, and by no means absurd",&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler]]. (1972). ''The Roots of Coincidence''. Vintage. p. 87. {{ISBN|978-0394719344}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carl Jung]] drew upon Kammerer's work in his essay ''[[Synchronicity]]''. [[Arthur Koestler]] reported that when he was doing research for his biography on Kammerer, he was subjected to "a meteor shower" of coincidences, as if Kammerer's ghost were grinning down at him and saying, "I told you so!"&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister Hardy]], Robert Harvie, Arthur Koestler. (1973). ''The Challenge of Chance: Experiments and Speculations''. Hutchinson. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Six weeks after the accusation by Noble, Kammerer committed suicide in the forest of [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]],&lt;ref name=Schmuck/&gt; an event which is discussed by [[Arthur Koestler]] in his book on Kammerer and his theories.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur (1973). ''The Case of the Midwife Toad''. Vintage (first published 1971). {{ISBN|978-0394718231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

The Lamarckian biologist [[Ernest MacBride]] supported the experiments of Kammerer but commented that they would have to be repeated to be accepted by other scientists.&lt;ref&gt;MacBride, Ernest (1929). ''Evolution''. J. Cape &amp; H. Smith. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The British zoologist [[Harold Munro Fox]] had attempted to replicate some of Kammerer's experiments but produced negative results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = Harold Munro | year = 1923 | title = Dr. Kammerer's Ciona Experiments | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 653–654 | doi=10.1038/112653b0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..653F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biology professor Harry Gershenowitz also attempted to duplicate Kammerer's experiment with a related species, ''[[Oriental fire-bellied toad|Bombina orientalis]]''; but he had to terminate the experiment for lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerschenowitz | first1 = Harry | year = 1983 | title = Arthur Koestler's Osculation with Lamarckism and Neo-Lamarckism | url = http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/data1/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005af7_1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Heritage Studies | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in Kammerer revived in 1971 with the publication of Arthur Koestler's book ''The Case of the Midwife Toad''. Koestler thought that Kammerer's experiments on the midwife toad may have been tampered with by a [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathizer at the [[University of Vienna]]. Certainly, as Koestler writes, "the ''Hakenkreuzler'', the swastika-wearers, as the [[Austrian Nazis]] of the early days were called, were growing in power. One center of ferment was the University of Vienna&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/archiv/tour/19.htm University 1938-1945]&lt;/ref&gt; where, on the traditional Saturday morning student parades, bloody battles were fought. Kammerer was known by his public lectures and newspaper articles as an ardent pacifist and Socialist; it was also known that he was going to build an institute in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. An act of sabotage in the laboratory would have been… in keeping with the climate of those days."

Koestler's claims have been criticized by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronson | first1 = Lester | year = 1975 | title = The Case of The Case of the Midwife Toad | url = | journal = Behavior Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 115–125 | doi=10.1007/bf01066805}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Stein]] noted:

{{quote|Koestler's book favors evidence that exonerates Kammerer, while downplaying or ignoring evidence against him.... [His] own hidden agenda may be that if Kammerer was right, then Lamarck's idea that acquired characteristics can be inherited is strengthened. The Lamarckian idea supports many ideas that foster [[parapsychology]]'s theoretical basis. Kammerer was quite interested in the study of coincidences, as was Koestler.&lt;ref name="Stein 1993"/&gt;}}

As a consequence of Noble's refutation, interest in Lamarckian inheritance diminished except in the [[Soviet Union]] where it was championed by [[Trofim Lysenko]].

[[Sander Gliboff]], a historian of biology and professor in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, [[Indiana University]], has commented that although Kammerer's conclusions proved false, his evidence was probably genuine and he did not simply argue for Lamarckism and against Darwinism as the theories are now understood. Rather, beyond the scandal, the story shows us much about the competing theories of biological and cultural evolution and the range of new ideas about heredity and variation in early 20th-century biology and the changes in experimental approach that have occurred since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Sander|last=Gliboff|title="Protoplasm… is soft wax in our hands": Paul Kammerer and the art of biological transformation|journal=Endeavour|volume=29|issue=4|pages=162–167|year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2005.10.001|pmid=16271762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, developmental biologist [[Alexander Vargas (biologist)|Alexander Vargas]], Professor in the Department of Biology, [[University of Chile]], suggested that the inheritance of acquired traits ([[Lamarckian inheritance]]) that Kammerer reported to observe in his toad experiments could be authentic and be explained by results from the emerging field of [[epigenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Elizabeth|last=Pennisi|date=4 September 2009|title=The Case of the Midwife Toad: Fraud or Epigenetics?|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5945|pages=1194–1195|doi=10.1126/science.325_1194|pmid=19729631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vargas | first1 = Alexander | year = 2009 | title = Did Paul Kammerer discover epigenetic inheritance?

Furthermore, In Vargas' view, the [[genomic imprinting|parent-of-origin effect]], which was poorly understood at the time of Kammerer's, might be explained retrospectively, in relation to similar effects seen in other organisms. Professor Gliboff of Indiana University has subsequently argued that Vargas "constructed his model without first reading Kammerer's original articles" and is "seriously misinformed about what Kammerer did and what the results even were" so Vargas's "model... cannot explain the results... originally reported...". Gliboff goes on to challenge strong that Kammerer was given credit for discovery of parent-of-origin effect and states that "Vargas' historical inferences about the Kammerer affair... [and] negative reactions of geneticists... are unsupported and do not stand up to scrutiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gliboff | first1 = Sander AO | year = 2009 | title = Did Paul Kammerer discover epigenetic inheritance?

The reinterpretation of Kammerer's work, in light of epigenetics, remains thus controversial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4122">[[File:Paul Klecki (1965) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|1965]]
'''Paul Kletzki''' (21 March 1900 - 5 March 1973) was a Polish conductor and composer.

Born '''Paweł Klecki''' in [[Łódź]], [[Poland]], Died in [[Liverpool]], United Kingdom.  He later adopted the German spelling Paul Kletzki. He joined its Philharmonic Orchestra at the age of fifteen. After serving in the [[World War I|First World War]], he studied philosophy at the [[University of Warsaw]] before moving to [[Berlin]] in 1921 to continue his studies. During the 1920s his compositions were championed by [[Arturo Toscanini]]; and [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], who permitted Kletzki to conduct the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1925. Because he was Jewish, he left [[Nazi Germany]] in 1933 and moved to Italy, however due to the [[anti-semitism]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)|Italian Fascist regime]] he moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1936. He later went to live in Switzerland.

Kletzki's most notable work is his Third Symphony, completed in October 1939, with the subtitle 'In memoriam'. It is an elegiac work interpreted as a moving monument to the victims of Nazism.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Other works include three string quartets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zb.uzh.ch/Medien/spezialsammlungen/musik/nachlaesse/klecki.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nachlassverzeichniss Paul Klecki|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}, lists 3 string quartets, Op.1 in A minor, Op.13 in C minor, Op.23 in D minor, copyright 1923, 1925, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; a Sinfonietta for strings, a Fantasy for piano, and a sonata for violin and piano.  From 1942 onwards Kletzki wrote no more compositions; he argued that Nazism had destroyed his spirit and his will to compose. During the [[Holocaust]] a number of Kletzki's family were murdered by the Nazis including his parents and his sister.

In the post-war years Kletzki was a renowned conductor, especially of [[Gustav Mahler]]. In 1954 he was appointed chief conductor of the [[Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]].  Between 1958 and 1961 he was principal conductor of the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]]. From 1966 until 1970 he was the General Music Director of the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4512">'''Pollution insurance''' is a type of insurance that covers costs related to pollution. This can include the costs of [[brownfield]] restoration and cleanup, liability for injuries and deaths caused by pollution. Most businesses will purchase broad [[commercial general insurance]] or [[property insurance]] policies but these usually contain and an "absolute pollution exclusion" and thus rarely cover pollution, although there may be limited pollution coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Absolute Pollution Exclusions Aren’t Always Absolute {{!}} Insurance Policyholder Advocate|url = http://jonesdayblogs.com/ir/?p=565|website = jonesdayblogs.com|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollution insurance usually takes the form of first-party coverage for contamination of insured property either by external or on-site sources. Coverage is also afforded for liability to third parties arising from contamination of air, water, or land due to the sudden and accidental release of hazardous materials from the insured site. The policy usually covers the costs of cleanup and may include coverage for releases from underground storage tanks. Intentional acts are specifically excluded.

The largest players in this industry are [[AIG]], [[XL Group|XL]], Ace and [[Zurich Insurance Group|Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/southcentral/2001/07/23/features/18589.htm Environmental Pollution Insurance: A Fluid and Ever-changing Market&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the purposes for such insurance policies is so that when companies that cause environmental disasters go bankrupt, the victims can still be compensated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/86/i08/8608notw9.html Chemical &amp; Engineering News: Latest News - China's Pollution Insurance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The insurance may also protect against cost overruns or regulatory changes that increase the cost of cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2001/11/05/focus4.html Pollution insurance growing in popularity - Philadelphia Business Journal:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The director of China's EPA (SEPA) has called for imposing mandatory pollution insurance on polluting industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/12/chinas_epa_dema.php As Citizens Sue, China's EPA Demands Compulsory Pollution Insurance : TreeHugger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Cato Institute]], legal theories of [[joint and several liability]] (e.g. under [[Superfund]]) and requirements by courts that insurers pay to help polluters clean up their own property (regardless of the insurance contract) have hurt the pollution insurance industry; but nonetheless, the basic idea of pollution insurance remains sound. Cato claims, "With the help of insurers and risk analysts, corporate risk managers select cost-effective products and processes, which minimize the sum of insurance premiums, expected payments to victims (in excess of insurance coverage), and risk-reduction expenditures."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj6n3-1.html Reputation And The Efficiency Of Legal Rules&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616084007/https://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj6n3-1.html |date=2008-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
In the United States, the federal U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation &amp; Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, is the predominant law.

However, there are also important state laws with similar or additional requirements. In 2013, the State of Oregon passed Oregon Environmental Cleanup Assistance Act which significantly increased the responsibility of insurers to cover pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oregon Enacts Significant Amendment to Environmental Clean-Up Insurance Statute {{!}} JD Supra|url = http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/oregon-enacts-significant-amendment-to-e-56401/|website = JD Supra|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1183">The current status of '''[[polygamy]]''' is difficult to determine in '''[[Botswana]]''' as, legally, only marriage between a single man and woman is permissible, though there is a notable loophole. A man can marry his first wife (or ''village wife'') under [[customary]] [[law]], while then marrying his second under [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. While the practice was thought to have long disappeared from the region, it has been noted that [[polygamous unions]] are still active in Botswana, though not particularly common. It has also been reported that a high number of problems have resulted from polygamous unions in the nation, such as [[divorce]] battles, [[sexual abuse]] and a higher spread of [[HIV/AIDS]], which is a notable problem to begin with in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazettebw.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2521%3Apolygamy-is-alive-in-botswana&amp;catid=19%3Anorthcast&amp;Itemid=2 Polygamy is alive in Botswana]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii''' began when [[Puerto Rico]]'s sugar industry was devastated by two [[hurricanes]] in 1899. The devastation caused a worldwide shortage in sugar and a huge demand for the product from [[Hawaii]]. Hawaiian [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] owners began to recruit the jobless, but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico.

==Prelude==
[[File:1899 hurricane damage.jpg|thumb|left|Damage in [[Puerto Rico]] after Hurricane San Ciriaco.]]
In the 19th century Puerto Rico depended mainly on its agricultural economy. The island together with [[Cuba]] was the Spanish Crown's leading exporter of [[sugar]], [[coffee]], [[tobacco]] and [[cotton]].  When the island was ceded to the [[United States]] after the [[Spanish–American War]], as stipulated by the agreements of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1898, most of its industries were taken over by American industrialists. Cheap labor was provided by Puerto Ricans who depended on the nation's agriculture as their only source of income.&lt;ref&gt;''Worker in the Cane: A Puerto Rican Life History''; by Sidney W. Mintz.; page 257; Publisher: Yale University Press; Place of Publication: no CT;  Publication Year: 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 1899, [[1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco|Hurricane San Ciriaco]], with winds of over 100 miles per hour, struck Puerto Rico and, on August 22, another hurricane followed. The floods caused by 28 days of continuous rain damaged the agricultural industry and left 3,400 dead and thousands of people without shelter, food or work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/sanciriaco.html Hurricane San Ciriaco]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there was a shortage of sugar from the caribbean in the world market and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii and other sugar producing countries. To meet the demand, plantation owners began a campaign to recruit the jobless laborers in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odu.edu/sci/cqfe/research/areas%20of%20research/hawai'i/hawai'ian%20history.htm Hawaiian History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226185844/http://www.odu.edu/sci/cqfe/research/areas%20of%20research/hawai'i/hawai'ian%20history.htm |date=2008-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First immigrants==
[[File:Steamship from Corsica.JPG|225px|right|thumb|Type of steamship that carried Puerto Ricans to Hawaii]]
On November 22, 1900, the first group of Puerto Ricans consisting of 56 men, began their long journey to [[Maui, Hawaii]].  The trip was long and unpleasant.  They first set sail from [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] harbor to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. Once in New Orleans, they were boarded on a railroad train and sent to Port [[Los Angeles, California]]. From there they set sail aboard the Rio de Janeiro to Hawaii.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;[http://www.k12.hi.us/~ebukoski/puertoricans.html The Puerto Ricans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705075218/http://www.k12.hi.us/~ebukoski/puertoricans.html |date=2009-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the "Los Angeles Times" dated December 26, 1901, the Puerto Ricans were mistreated and starved by the shippers and the railroad company. They arrived in [[Honolulu]], on December 23, 1900, and were sent to work in one of the different plantations owned by the "Big Five" on Hawaii's four islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulwaf.com/LA-1900s/01.12.html Los Angeles Times December 26, 1901]&lt;/ref&gt; By October 17, 1901, 5,000 Puerto Rican men, women and children had made their new homes on the four islands.  Records show that, in 1902, 34 plantations had 1,773 Puerto Ricans on their payrolls; 1,734 worked as field hands and another 39 were clerks or overseers (foremen).

==Discrimination by the "Big Five"==
The "Big Five" was the name given to a group of sugarcane [[corporations]] that wielded considerable political power in the [[Territory of Hawaii|Territory of Hawai‘i]] and leaned heavily towards the [[Republican Party of Hawaii|Hawai‘i Republican Party]]. The "Big Five" consisted of [[Castle &amp; Cooke]], [[Alexander &amp; Baldwin]], [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]], [[Amfac (Hawaii)|Amfac]] and [[Theo H. Davies &amp; Co.]].

The owners of the "Big Five" were Euro-Americans who would indulge in discrimination and bigotry against ethnic groups who worked the plantations. They had an association called the "Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association" (HSPA) whose power could be considered as equivalent to an [[oligarchy]].  The [[Attorney General of Hawai‘i]], referring to the Big Five, said in 1903, "There is a government in this Territory which is centralized to an extent unknown in the United States, and probably almost as centralized as it was in France under Louis XIV."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starbulletin.com/news/hawaiinews/20081025_Racism_and_prejudice_linger_in_Hawaii_says_chief_justice.html Star Bullentin]&lt;/ref&gt; Wages and living accommodations depended upon their job and race. Europeans were paid more and received better quarters. Most of the workers moved from plantation to plantation to work because they did not like the work they did and because of the racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/tempress/chapters_1400/1523_ch1.pdf The Puerto Rican Diaspora: Historical Perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Struggle for U.S. citizenship==

}}
According to the State of Hawaii Data Book 1982, by the year 1910, there were 4,890 Puerto Ricans living in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.gov/hidocs/puerto.html Puerto Ricans in Hawaii]&lt;/ref&gt; Both Puerto Rico and Hawaii were territories of the United States however, the passage of the [[Jones–Shafroth Act]] of 1917, the same year that the United States entered [[World War I]], granted American citizenship to the Puerto Rican resident in Puerto Rico and excluded those who resided in Hawaii. Yet, the "non-citizen" Puerto Ricans were assigned draft numbers and were expected to serve in the military.&lt;ref name="II"&gt;''Images and Identities'', by Asela Rodríguez-Seda de Laguna, Pgs. 101–102; Publisher: Transaction Publishers; {{ISBN|0-88738-617-2}}; {{ISBN|978-0-88738-617-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plantation owners, like those that comprised the "[[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]]", found territorial status convenient, enabling them to continue importing cheap foreign labor; such immigration was prohibited in various other states of the Union.&lt;ref&gt;''Land and Power in Hawaii: The Democratic Years''; by George Cooper, Gavan Daws; Published 1990; Publisher: University of Hawaii Press; {{ISBN|0-8248-1303-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Puerto Ricans in the island, believing that they were entitled to the same rights that every other U.S. citizens had, tried to sign up to vote in a local Hawaiian election and  were denied their rights by the county clerk who claimed that early immigrants to Hawaii were not covered by the Jones Act.&lt;ref name="II" /&gt;

[[Manuel Olivieri Sanchez]], a court interpreter at the time, became enraged in what he viewed as a violation of the civil rights of his fellow countrymen. He encouraged his fellow Puerto Ricans to protest by telling them that "If you are not allowed to vote, don't answer the draft call".&lt;ref name="II" /&gt; Olivieri Sanchez led a legal battle for the recognition of the Hawaiian Puerto Ricans as citizens of the United States. In the first legal battle the lower court ruled in favor of the county clerk, however Olivieri Sanchez did not give up the fight and took the case before the Territorial Supreme Court, which reversed the decision of the lower court, granting the Puerto Ricans of Hawaii their United States citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Puerto Rican Diaspora'', by Carmen Teresa Whalen; Pg. 47; Publisher: Temple University Press (August 30, 2005); {{ISBN|1-59213-413-0}}; {{ISBN|978-1-59213-413-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Struggle against discrimination==
Olivieri Sanchez' victory was not welcomed by members of HSPA, who depended on the cheap labor non-citizens provided. In 1930, HSPA began to circulate false rumors, they made it be known that they (HSPA) were planning to recruit laborers in Puerto Rico, while at the same time they had the "Honolulu Star Bullentin" and some local newspapers they controlled run anti-Puerto Rican stories, that—for example—claimed Puerto Ricans were "unhealthy hookwormers who had bought disease to Hawaii".&lt;ref name="II" /&gt;

In Dec. 1931, Olivieri Sanchez wrote a letter to the editor of the ''Hawaiian Advertiser'' where he stated that he saw all of the rhetoric as a tactic by the HSPA to push all the different ethnic groups in the local labor force back to work on the plantations. He was right, the HSPA wanted to persuade [[United States Congress|Congress]] to exempt the territory from a law, which in 1924 was requested by [[California]] to prevent the migration of [[Philippines|Filipinos]] and [[Japan]]ese nationals to the U.S. (National Origins Quota Action (Immigration Act) and Johnson Immigration Act of 1924).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stetsonkennedy.com/jim_crow_guide/chapter3.htm Jim Crow Guide: The Way it Was, by Stetson Kennedy 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; HSPA's secretary treasurer claimed that the association was unwilling to import Puerto Ricans to Hawaii. His defamation of Puerto Ricans condemned not only the Puerto Ricans of Hawaii, but also those on the island. Despite the efforts of Olivieri Sanchez, HSPA had their way and Hawaii was exempted from the stern anti-immigration laws of the time.&lt;ref name="II" /&gt;

The power of the plantation owners was finally broken by the activist descendants of the original immigrant laborers. Because they were born in a United States territory and they were legal American citizens, they gained full local voting rights and actively campaigned for statehood for the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;[http://starbulletin.com/1999/12/23/news/story11.html ''Star Bullentin''], December 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puerto Rican influence==
Currently, there are over 30,000 Puerto Ricans or Hawaiian-Puerto Ricans living in Hawaii.  Puerto Rican culture and traditions are very strong there. One of the traditions that is still practiced is the "compadrazgo". When a person baptizes somebody's child, he or she becomes the "padrino" (godfather) of the child and the "compadre" or "comadre" of the child's parents.  There is a relationship of respect, mutual affection and obligation between the child, parents and compadres.  The children ask for a blessing "La Bendición" and the padrinos respond with a "Dios te bendiga" (God bless you).&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt;

===Food===
As in Puerto Rico, the Hawaiian-Puerto Ricans enjoy the preparation of the [[pasteles]] (meat pies) during the [[Christmas]] holidays.  The confection of the pastel is an event where the whole family participates.  Some of the members of the family cut the green bananas and season them while others prepare the masa (dough).  The masa is then filled with seasoned pork and cilantro and then wrapped in banana or ti leaves and tied with a string.  It is then cooked in boiling water.  Once ready, the pastel is unwrapped and eaten.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt;

===Music===

}}
When the Puerto Ricans immigrated to Hawaii they took along with them their music and their musical instruments.  Among the musical instruments introduced to Hawaii was the Puerto Rican [[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]].  The Cuatro was a four stringed guitar developed in Puerto Rico in 1875; however, it eventually evolved into a ten stringed [[guitar]].  Other musical instruments introduced were the
[[Maraca]]s, a rattle containing dried seeds and the [[Guiro]] (percussion instrument made out of a gourd and played with a scraping stick).  Soon, these instruments were not only limited to playing [[Spanish language|Spanish]] songs but, were also absorbed by the typical songs of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt; [[Cachi Cachi music]] is a genre of music which began in Hawaii in the early 1900s when the Puerto Ricans immigrated to Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;"Footsteps in the Dark: The Hidden Histories of Popular Music"; By George Lipsitz; page 228; Publisher: University of Minnesota Press; {{ISBN|0816650195}}; {{ISBN|9780816650194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Master guitarmaker [[William R. Cumpiano]] and his colleagues wrote, directed and produced "Un Canto en Otra Montaña: Música Puertorriqueña en Hawaii"'' (A Song Heard in Another Mountain: Puerto Rican Music in Hawaii), a short-feature video documentary on the music and social history of the century-old Puerto Rican Diaspora in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuatro-pr.org/Home/Eng/Products/OurCuatrovol_1.htm NUESTRO CUATRO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Puerto Rican "coquí" in Hawaii==

During the late 20th century, the "[[coquí]]", a thumbnail-sized tree frog endemic to Puerto Rico, became established in Hawaii, most likely as stowaways in shippings of potted plants.  Its loud [[mating call]], "music to the ears" of Puerto Ricans on their native highland, is considered an annoyance in Hawaii where this [[invasive species]] reaches much higher population densities. Unsuccessful efforts were made to exterminate the infestation.&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403EFDE1F38F936A15752C0A9639C8B63&amp;scp=10&amp;sq=coqui&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/01/us/hawaiians-lose-sleep-over-tiny-frog-with-big-voice.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The publication of the report is carried out on fundraising from the public. To this end, an account has been opened on [[Yandex.Money]], the money transfer service operated by [[Yandex]]. The fundraising is overseen by a supervisory board, which includes editor-in-chief of [[Novaya Gazeta]] [[Dmitry Muratov]], journalist [[Oleg Kashin]], economist [[Irina Yasina]], and writer and blogger [[Oleg Kozyrev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.putinavotstavku.org/material.php?id=4D90D2A085DD2 |title=Борис Немцов: Путин. Коррупция. 28.03.2011 |publisher=Putinavotstavku.org |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; During first month 1,838,209 rubles was collected. 

On 13 April a tender was held to choose the printing house. The winning bid came from the printing house, which offered the lowest price for printing of one copy, 4.05 rubles. Thus, taking into account 3% commission of Yandex, it will be possible to print 440,000 copies. {{cn|date=December 2014}}

The account remains open and the fundraising is continuing. The account number mentioned on the covers of the brochures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.putinavotstavku.org/material.php?id=4DCD4E8B650A3 |title=Борис Немцов: Наш ответ фронту жуликов и воров. 13.05.2011 |publisher=Putinavotstavku.org |date=2011-05-13 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The report is also available on the website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.putin-itogi.ru putin-itogi.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; There one can find information on the fundraising, news and videos. On the same site, there are also other reports on Vladimir Putin. 

A grey-brown colour was chosen for the cover. According to Vladimir Ryzhkov, it "symbolises the substance flooding over our country and rust, which has covered our state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2011/033/06.html |title=Рабы на золотых галерах. «Новая газета», 29.03.2011 |publisher=Novayagazeta.ru |date=2011-03-29 |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014193415/http://novayagazeta.ru/data/2011/033/06.html |archivedate=2011-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==

In June the first batch of the press run on public donations was ready. The distribution was launched on 11 June in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. The next day, a large distribution of brochures was held in Moscow during the action of "Solidarity" movement dedicated to the [[Russia Day]]. Boris Nemtsov participated in both of these events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=b_nemtsov 13 июня, 2011 |url=http://b-nemtsov.livejournal.com/115532.html |title=Борис Немцов. «Путин.

The '''Reason Party''' is an [[Australia]]n [[List of political parties in Australia|political party]] founded in 2009 as the '''Australian Sex Party'''. It changed its name in 2017 to the Reason Party.

== History ==
The Sex Party grew out of the Eros foundation, and initially contested the Bradfield and Higgins by-elections in 2009.

They then contested the Federal election the following year, and while not winning any seats polled very well for a new party. After that election, Patten claimed that the Sex Party was "now the major minor party in Australian politics":&lt;blockquote&gt;We’ve polled better than the Greens did in their first federal election and believe that our vision of Australia as the most socially progressive country in the world is equal to the Greens environmental messages of 20 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sexparty.org.au/index.php/news/press-releases/854-sex-party-now-the-major-minor-party-in-australian-politics Sex Party Now The Major Minor Party in Australian Politics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827052014/http://www.sexparty.org.au/index.php/news/press-releases/854-sex-party-now-the-major-minor-party-in-australian-politics |date=27 August 2010 }}", Sex Party website, 23 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the Victorian election in 2014, the party succeeded in electing its first parliamentarian when Fiona Patten was successful in her bid for election in the Northern Metropolitan region for the Legislative Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/vic-election-2014/results/legislative-council/|title=Legislative Council - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the Australian Sex Party announced it would be deregistering and become the Reason Party.&lt;ref name="rebrand" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australian-sex-party-to-become-the-reason-party-20170822-gy185f.html|title=Australian Sex Party to become the Reason Party|last=Preiss|first=Benjamin|date=22 August 2017|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the [[Victorian Electoral Commission]] officially changed the party's name from "Australian Sex Party – Victoria" to "Reason Victoria".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/media/20180116-ChangeOfAustralianSexPartyToReasonVictoria.html Change of Australian Sex Party to Reason Victoria], Victorian Electoral Commission. Retrieved 18 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, the party application to register for federal elections as "Reason Australia" was announced on the Electoral Commission website.&lt;ref name="Reason register" /&gt; Registration was approved on 30 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registration_Decisions/2018/2018-reason-australia-notice.pdf|title=Registration of a political party: Reason Australia|date=30 August 2018|work=Notice under s 133(1A)(a) of the ''Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918''|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the party has focused primarily on federal and Victorian elections, they have contest one election each in the Northern Territory in 2012 and in the Australian Capital Territory in 2016.

==Parliamentary actions==

As the party's sole representative in an Australian Parliament, Fiona Patten is considered to be pro-active in pursuing policy objectives. As the party leader and only parliamentarian, Patten has been called "Australia’s most effective legislator" by radio presenter [[Jon Faine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fionapatten.com.au/about-fiona-patten/|title=About Fiona Patten {{!}} Member of the Victorian Legislative Council|work=Fionapatten|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's main goal should they be elected was to establish voluntary assisted dying laws for Victoria. After a long process and a marathon legislative session, the bill became law on a conscience vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-22/euthanasia-victorian-parliament-passes-assisted-dying-laws/9156016|title=Victoria set to make history as voluntary assisted dying bill passes Upper House|date=2017-11-22|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/mammoth-debate-over-euthanasia-why-is-it-taking-so-long/news-story/173a6b52cb8a6346c9454530031e5e12|title=‘They keep going over the same ground again and again’|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Patten put forth a Private Member's Bill calling for a {{convert|150|m|adj=on}} "Safe Access Zone" around hospitals, GP clinics and health services that perform abortions, where it will be an offence to engage in behaviour that harasses or intimidates women seeking to access an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-01/victorian-government-confirms-support-for-abortion-buffer-zone/6740928|title=Victoria looks certain to ban protesters from picketing abortion clinics|date=2015-09-01|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Health and Wellbeing Amendment (Safe Access Zone) Bill 2015 formally passed the Victorian Legislative Council without amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{CC-notice|cc=by3au|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/safe-access-zones-to-protect-womens-right-to-medical-privacy-and-dignity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiona Patten introduced another Private Member's Bill in 2016, calling for the regulation of ride-sharing apps such as [[Uber]]. The Ridesharing Bill 2016 gained support from both the [[Daniel Andrews]] Labor government and the opposition led by [[Matthew Guy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-21/productive-talks-on-bill-to-regulate-uber-in-victoria/7528248 | work=ABC News | title=Uber in Victoria: Sex Party MP holds 'productive talks' on deal to regulate ride-booking service | date=21 June 2016 | accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-22/government-strikes-deal-with-sex-party-over-uber-regulation/7533114 | work=ABC News | first=Gloria | last=Kalache | title=Uber regulation: Victorian Government strikes deal with Sex Party over ride-sharing legislation | date=22 June 2016 | accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Patten renewed calls for a pilot program of a safe injecting room in North Richmond, in response to a large increase of Victorian drug-related deaths in the last several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-21/heroin-deaths-prompt-calls-for-safe-injecting-rooms-in-victoria/8290366 | work=ABC News | first=James | last=Oaten | title=Heroin deaths prompt renewed calls for Victorian safe injecting rooms | date=21 February 2017 | accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/no-government-support-for-richmond-drug-injection-room-despite-community-backing-20170206-gu6yuo.html | work=ABC News | first1=Benjamin | last1=Preiss | first2=Clay | last2=Lucas | title=No government support for Richmond drug injection room despite community backing | date=7 February 2017 | accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first session for the Legislative Council of the year, she introduced the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Amendment (Pilot Medically Supervised Injecting Centre) Bill 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | jurisdiction=State of Victoria | house=Legislative Council | date=7 February 2017 | page=37 | speaker=[[Fiona Patten]] | position=Member for Northern Metropolitan}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there were regular overdoses in the streets of Richmond, and that number has been reduced significantly since the centre was opened, with various estimates about the number of lives saved due to the opening of the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-31/melbourne-safe-injecting-room-saving-lives-director-says/10186564|title=140 lives 'saved' during first months of safe injecting room trial in Melbourne|date=2018-08-31|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/12-lives-saved-in-richmond-safe-drug-injecting-room-s-first-week-20180706-p4zpy4.html|title='12 lives saved' in Richmond safe drug injecting room's first week|last=Booker|first=Chloe|date=2018-07-06|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==
{{update|date=July 2016}}
[[File:Fiona Patten.jpg|right|thumb|Party leader Fiona Patten]]

Reason's policy platform has been described as [[civil libertarian|libertarian]].&lt;ref name="Australian Sex Party a dark horse in federal politics" /&gt; Party leader, [[Fiona Patten]], has described Reason's policy objectives as "socially progressive but economically prudent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/03/12/australian-sex-party_n_9435110.html | work=[[Huffington Post]] | first=Josh | last=Butler |title=Inside The Australian Sex Party: Politics, Progressives And Porn | date=12 March 2016 | accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is opposed to internet censorship, and supports the introduction of a national media classification scheme, including a rating for non-violent sexual content. The Australian Sex Party was one of the earliest bodies to call for a [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|Royal Commission into child sexual abuse in religious institutions]]. In 2016, the party renewed its call for religious institutions to pay more state-based taxes, and to overturn long-standing exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/time-to-end-tax-exemptions-for-religious-groups-sex-party-20160313-gnhp5n.html|title=Time to end tax exemptions for religious groups: Sex Party|first=Benjamin|last=Preiss|date=13 March 2016|website=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policies have been laid out on the party's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reasonvic.org.au/policy/|title=Policies {{!}} Reason Victoria|work=Reason Victoria|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The party views drug use in the community as a health issue. As such they have called for full decriminalisation of all drugs, legalisation of cannabis. Drug addiction should be dealt with by referring one found with illicit drugs to a treatment centre
* Taxing the non-charitable business arms of religious institutions. This includes the estimated $9 billion portfolio of the Catholic Church in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2018/catholic-inc-what-the-church-is-really-worth/|title=Catholic Inc: What the Church is really worth|last=Vedelago|first=Royce Millar, Ben Schneiders and Chris|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reason supports vaccination to protect public health and reduce the spread of preventable diseases. In a 2016 response to the [[Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network]]'s Meryl Dorey, the Sex Party stated:&lt;ref name="aspvaxbi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-australian-sex-party-wrote-this-devastating-response-to-an-anti-vaccination-campaigner-looking-for-support-2016-5|title=The Australian Sex Party wrote this devastating response to an anti-vaccination campaigner looking for support|author=Kimmorley, Sarah|date=16 May 2016|work=Business Insider|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Choosing not to vaccinate your children amounts to medical neglect; this is a serious ethical issue".&lt;ref name="aspvaxpr"&gt;{{cite press release|title=ASXP responds to vaccination skeptics|date=May 2016|url=http://www.sexparty.org.au/news-article/215-asxp-responds-to-vaccination-skeptics|accessdate=16 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515135023/http://www.sexparty.org.au/news-article/215-asxp-responds-to-vaccination-skeptics|archivedate=15 May 2016|author=Austin, Darren|work=ASP|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Early intervention for mental health especially for young at risk people
* Focusing on community housing and ensuring that at risk people have a place to live
* Decriminalise sex work and remove censorship so that people can make their own choices what they want to watch
* Create an ombudsman for aged care and retirement housing, and establish a state wide ageing strategy
* Improving public transport especially for high growth outer suburban areas
* Expand free wifi in public spaces including on all public transport
* Increasing oversight around politicians and tighten the rules to prevent unethical behaviour by the state's politicians and public figures
* Setting a maximum bet limit for poker machines and limiting the influence of the pokies industry

'''Responsible Gaming''' is a concept that gaming and [[gambling]] operators, software suppliers and associated service providers need to uphold to ensure their offerings uphold the highest standards to ensure a fair and safe gaming experience that protects players from the adverse consequences of gaming and gambling.  The majority of gambling and gaming codes now require operators to ensure land-based and online gambling services are offered in a responsible manner.  Responsible gaming covers the areas of protecting vulnerable customers, the prevention of underage gambling, protection against fraudulent and criminal behaviour, ensuring information privacy, ensuring prompt and accurate customer payments, delivering a fair gaming experience, upholding ethical and responsible marketing, commitment to customer satisfaction and ensuring a secure, safe and reliable operating environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/Workshops/Pages/WS58eGambling.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  Operators refers to both land-based (e.g. casinos, betting shops) and online or remote operators.

== Responsible gaming areas ==

=== Vulnerable players ===
Upholding responsible gaming practices is a key means to help reduce the likelihood of [[Problem gambling]] amongst vulnerable customers.  A number of measures have been introduced to help prevent the onset of problem gambling, including self-exclusion programmes and processes, offering advice and support to problem gamblers and allowing players to set limits as to how much they spend both within online and land-based gaming channels.

=== Underage gambling ===
Operators are required to do everything within their means to ensure that underage customers are not allowed to gamble.  The age restrictions are dependent upon the laws in the jurisdiction where the gambling services are offered. Preventing underage gambling requires operators to ensure that registration processes clearly outline policies towards underage gambling and to ensure controls are in place to verify the age of gamblers. Casino operators are particularly serious about this problem because of the fines as well as the threat that their license will temporarily or permanently get revoked.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gambling Problems in Youth: Theoretical and Applied Perspectives|last=Derevensky|first=Jeffrey|last2=Gupta|first2=Rina|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|year=2004|isbn=0306485850|location=New York|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key initiatives include the efforts of the [[American Gaming Association]] (AGA) to address the problem by facilitating the creation of an industry task force on responsible gaming, which adopted a comprehensive guideline for underage gambling as well as the unattended minors guideline developed with the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Futures at Stake: Youth, Gambling, and Society|last=Shaffer|first=Howard|last2=Hall|first2=Matthew|last3=Vander Bilt|first3=Joni|last4=George|first4=Elizabeth|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=2003|isbn=087417368X|location=Reno|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the organization announced a [[code of conduct]] for its members, which included specific training requirements for employees to deal with underage gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americangaming.org/associated-press-casino-industry-us-has-new-rules-responsible-gambling|title=Associated Press - Casino industry in US has new rules for responsible gambling|last=Garcia|first=Regina|date=2017-08-03|work=AGA|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are important because - despite the existence of statutes - adolescents have little difficulty in gaining access to gambling venues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Fraudulent and criminal behaviour ===
Operators are required to implement anti-money laundering policies and procedures.  This involves implementing effective [[know your customer]] processes when taking on new customers and tracking and reporting any suspicious transactions.

=== Information privacy ===
[[Information privacy]] refers to the protection of customer data and records against unauthorised or unnecessary disclosure.  Operators are required to implement policies that ensure controls and measures are in place to prevent unauthorised disclosure and use of customer information.  Customer information typically relates to data such as name, address, age, telephone number and email address.

=== Prompt and accurate customer payments ===
Operators must ensure that payments to and from customer accounts must be conducted according to formal and documented processes in an accurate and timely manner.  Operators typically ensure that customer funds are managed separately from their own accounts and that they have sufficient cleared funds to pay all player prize wins and outstanding player balances.

=== Fair gaming ===
All gaming products should be tested to ensure they are fair and random and that they adhere to the rules of that game.  Testing to ensure fair gaming is increasingly carried out by independent organisations.

=== Ethical and responsible marketing ===
Operators should comply with the relevant regulatory advertising codes of practice which typically ensure that advertisements are factually correct and do not target underage or vulnerable gamblers, such as players who have self-excluded themselves from gambling.  It is also expected that operators should seek permission from the customer prior to engaging in direct marketing through use of the customer’s personal details.

=== Customer satisfaction ===
Customers should be able to freely make comments or complaints to operators and expect operators to have in place adequate processes and procedures to deal with complaints, either internally or via an independent third-party.  For example, ecogra.org provides a mediation service for disputes between players and operators.

=== Secure, safe and reliable operating environment ===
Operators are required to demonstrate internal controls and processes that adhere to the licensing conditions as stipulated by the regulatory jurisdiction that issues gaming and gambling licenses.  Internal controls should also be implemented to ensure that all operational, payment and technical systems and processes operate securely and effectively.  In addition, operators need to demonstrate adequate [[business continuity management]] procedures to ensure that operations can continue in the event of unforeseen circumstances or disasters.

== Responsible gaming codes of conduct ==
To ensure operators, software suppliers and associated service providers uphold the principles of responsible gaming, codes of conduct have been developed by numerous regulators, trade associations and non-profit organisations.  These competing and overlapping codes of conduct or standards have evolved over time due to the evolution of multiple legal and trade frameworks.

It has been acknowledged within the industry that given the large number of responsible gaming codes of conduct there is a need to step back and re-assess what is required within the industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cassknowledge.com/article.php?id=471&amp;title=Can+the+online+gambling+industry+continue+to+grow+profits+whilst+protecting+players%3F&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Committee for Standardisation is the process of developing Responsible Remote Gambling Measures that can protect customers and ensure that the remote gambling operators, software suppliers and associated service providers behave responsibly, which would be adopted on a voluntary basis.

== Responsible gaming events ==
A number of industry events have been organised to help the industry promote responsible gaming practices.  The European Gaming and Betting Association organised the EGBA Responsible Gaming Day conference in the European Parliament in October 2010.  The World Lotteries Association has actively organised events for its members to discuss and promote best practice in terms of Responsible Gaming.  The European Association for the Study of Gambling's 8th Annual Conference in September 2010 was attended by academics, policy makers and industry representatives and much of its themes and discussions centred on responsible gaming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9364">The '''Rural Agency for Sustainable Development''' (RASD) is an [[NGO]] based in the Ugandan town of [[Nkokonjeru]].  It was first established as a [[Community-based organization|CBO]] in 2000 before gaining NGO status in 2005, serving communities in the wider Buikwe, Kayunga and [[Mukono District]] around Nkokonjeru.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nourishinternational.org/projects/uganda3.php&lt;/ref&gt;  RASD has received broad support from the community through private donations and volunteer efforts as well as from the local government of the Nkokonjeru Town Council and Mayor.  Engineers Without Borders groups from the University of California,Davis&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewbdavis.net/&lt;/ref&gt; and Duke University&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duke.edu/~lmp10/RASD%20website2/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt; have assisted RASD with new technology implementation. [[EWB-UK]] have recently started sending students on 3 month placements to help with ongoing RASD projects.

==Mission==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In coordination with local government and other motivated organizations, RASD strives to alleviate poverty in the Buikwe, Mukono and Kayunga districts by improving the health and economic opportunities of the communities.  The focus of accomplishing this mission resolution is through development and coordination of programs for the benefit of the communities.  The various programs encompass general health improvement, assistance for orphans, [[water quality]] and availability, [[sanitation]], vocational training, and agricultural needs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Programs==
Notable programs at RASD include:

* Vocational education
There are schools for hairdressing, carpentry, catering and nursery offered at RASD.  Volunteer-taught classes provide students who do not have enough money for university-level education an alternative way to learn skills that will let them earn a successful living.

2013 Update: None of these projects are currently funded or staffed. There is currently no vocational education occurring at RASD.

* Water Treatment
From the initial visit by [[Engineers Without Borders]] from the [[University of California, Davis]], point-of-use [[water treatment]] was expressed as a priority of RASD.  Following extensive trials of four treatment technologies, a biosand filter mold and training to build biosand filters was provided to RASD.  The biosand filters are now an ongoing program of RASD in building and marketing the filters to the local community members.  RASD marketing program includes micro-financing through their community backed finance institution.

2013 Update: Biosand filter production and distribution is currently not happening. Filters were initially distributed free of charge to recipients, which has now made it impossible to move this program into a sustainable business-oriented model where the organization is able to sell filters rather than distribute them. There are no funds to continue to distribute them free of charge, which means the project is virtually defunct.

* Internet café
In 2008 students from [[Duke University]] brought two computers and established an Internet router at RASD.  For a nominal fee, members of the community can use these computers for [[web access]].

2013 Update: The Internet cafe started by Duke students was not operational and computers are currently out of use. In 2013 another student group from Miami of Ohio University was recommended by RASD to fund an internet cafe where computer classes would be taught and community members would pay to use the internet services. Five computers and an Internet package were purchased from funds raised by Miami students. Since the departure of the Miami students, no classes have been held and no funds devoted to maintaining Internet services for community use.

Another priority of RASD was improved sanitation.  Students from [[University of California, Davis]] designed and constructed an un-reinforced dome slab toilet.  Further funding allowed twenty to thirty of these latrines to be constructed at households in the community.  The dome slab design has been updated with an improved ventilated unit.  EcoSan urine-diversion toilets have also been designed, and a working model is at RASD.

2013 Update: RASD continues to promote the dome-slab technology if student groups are available to fund and construct the toilets. Dome-slab toilet construction is currently not an ongoing part of RASD's activities.

*Hand Washing Stations
Students from [[University of California, Davis]] also introduced hand-washing stations and developed hygiene training programs for RASD which have been held with community children in local schools and at RASD.

2013 Update: RASD has no on-going program promoting hand washing stations.

*Fuel Efficient Stoves
Most cooking is still done balancing a pot on three rocks with firewood below.  The open cook fires produce excessive smoke and require ample firewood.  Students from the [[University of California, Davis]] introduced more efficinet wood-burning stoves which are made cheaply from local materials.  RASD has taught a number of local youth to build these stoves for community member, providing minimal employment.

2013 Update: The fuel efficient stoves promoted by University of California, Davis was found to be too expensive for local residents to purchase. No fuel efficient stoves have been made or distributed.

* Solar power
The Internet café runs off a [[solar power]] generator.  This also allows residents to charge cell phones and other small appliances without having to depend on power from the local grid.

2013 Update: Solar power is still operating at RASD. Residents can still charge their cell phones and small appliances using solar power.

* [[Rainwater harvesting]]
To assist RASD in keeping students in school and healthy, students from [[University of California, Davis]] helped RASD acquire Interlocking Soil Stabilized Brick (ISSB) making equipment from Makerere University in Kampala.  The ISSB technology provides RASD with the ability to produce institutional sized water tanks for schools and clinics.  Further research is underway to find economical household scale harvesting tanks.

2013: RASD is not currently constructing any ISSB tanks.

==Notable Projects==
Notable projects by RASD include:

* Peace Corp Assistance
When a Peace Corp Volunteer recognized that she was not getting very good coverage of her education program through the school due to low attendance, she enlisted RASD to reach out and develop community-based education programs.

* US Embassy Grant
Recognizing the abilities of RASD, the US Embassy provided a small grant to enable RASD to provide biosand filters and dome-slab toilets to 50 families impacted by HIV/AIDS.

* USAID
Another NGO with funding from USAID enlisted the abilities of RASD to help them establish a dome-slab toilet production project in the Tororo District in eastern Uganda.

* Engineers Without Borders
RASD initiated and coordinated an arrangement with the Nkokonjeru Town Council and students from [[University of California, Davis]] to provide training, tools and spare parts for the repair of local borehole pumps.  The Town Council provided a plumber to be trained and to provide future routine maintenance and repairs, students from [[University of California, Davis]] provided tools and training, while RASD provided the coordination and the creation of local water pump committees to ensure future maintenance schedules are maintained and pumps 
receive appropriate protection and treatment.  Only 2 of 13 local pumps were operational when the program started and all were repaired and have since been maintained operational.

'''The Horticultural Collaborative Support Programme (HortCRSP)'''
is a USAID funded project through the University of California Davis that is currently going on at RASD. It kicked off in October 2010 and will end in September 2013, and its objective is to promote production and marketing of Indigenous leafy greens among small holder farmers in Buikwe and Mukono districts-Central Uganda. This project involves multiple partners that include;University of California Davis, Makerere University, Mukono Zonal Agricultural and Development Institute (MUZARDI) and Uganda Christian University Mukono. The project is using two participatory agricultural development models that are increasingly gaining popularity worldwide in agricultural research and development work. These are the Farmer Field Schools and Participatory Market Chain Approaches that help farmers in addressing production and marketing constraints respectively. RASD's role in the project has been to mobilize farmers to participate in the project activities as well as providing technical back-stopping to farmers. RASD has also helped in coordinating the research activities of the different partners in this project. These include providing research assistance to the graduate students (PhD and Masters) attached to the project, through mobilizing farmers for surveys and interviews as well as providing internship placements for Undergraduate students in fields of Social work, Agriculture and Community Development.

2013 Update: Hort CRSP project activities ended in 2013.

'''Samahang Makasining (Artist Club)''' (also known as '''Makasining''' or simply '''Artist Club''') is a widespread art organization in different universities and municipalities and also the largest collegiate semi-fraternity in the Philippines. It is organized to promote art awareness among the youth and develop their innate talents. It also aims to provide art community service, art related youth development, and social development opportunities for college students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blographics.wordpress.com/2009/12/01/lakbay-turo2|title=Lakbay Turo|publisher=BlogGraphics|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Philippines. It is composed not only of young aspirant artists but also of national art professionals, environmentalists, students and out-of-school youths. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neust.edu.ph/index.php?martcon=38&amp;ac=view&amp;_show=neust|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617100940/http://www.neust.edu.ph/index.php?martcon=38&amp;ac=view&amp;_show=neust|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-06-17|title=Student Organization|publisher=NEUST Website|date=2001|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1982. The [[Indigenous games]] or ''[[Laro ng Lahi]]'' was coined and popularized by this group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpLQunmssd8|title=Lovely day Laro ng Lahi|publisher=GMA 7 Lovely day|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://makasining.org/?page=laro|title=LARO NG LAHI (Filipino Indigenous Games) Project|publisher=Makasining &amp; NCCA|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laronglahiruffa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDgZlIyNibU|title=(Laro ng Lahi) ABS-CBN Ruffa and Ai|publisher=ABS-CBN Ruffa and Ai|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] (NCCA).&lt;ref name="laronglahiruffa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laronglahipdf1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Terminal_Report_Sulyap_III_2003_Laro_ng_Lahi.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-25|title=Laro ng Lahi|publisher=Samahang Makasining (Artist Club), Inc.|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only organization who uses a unique officer structure for their chapters. Grand Artist is the equivalent of the President, Auxiliary Grand artist as Committee chair or as Vice President, Master Artist as Junior Adviser and Grand Master Artist as Adviser. It is also broadly consists of three main recognized level groups; 1) College Student level group, 2) Alumni/Municipal/Professional Level and 3) Mixed Probationary level group.

==History==
Established by a mere student organization in [[Central Luzon State University]] (CLSU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tutsea.com.ph/organisations/2823/samahang-makasining-inc|title=Samahang Makasining (Artist Club), Inc.|publisher=ltutsea|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as CLSU Artist Club which was founded on February 12, 1982. Starting by the [[Constancio Padilla National High School]] (CPNHS Young Artist Club) to be the first high school chapter founded on September 7, 1994. Then on September 5, 1995, the [[Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology]] (NEUST Artist Club) in Cabanatuan City became the first College/University chapter. Founded also in that same year were the [[Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College]] (ISPSC Artist Club) and [[Tarlac College of Agriculture]] (TCA Artist Club). 

In 1998 the Samahang Makasining (Artist Club) was officially registered at the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) as a non-profit organization. The group has been also recognized and affiliated to the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] (NCCA) on the same year (1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://112.199.66.15/cultural_%20mapping/cultural_mapping.php?i=5|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)|title=Cultural mapping|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the SEC registration, the [[Pantabangan]] Municipal Chapter was founded and established on November 20, 1999, being the first Municipal/Professional level of the group. 

The organization has extended and opened the horizon to all interested artists. The [[Philippine Rice Research Institute|Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice)]] Chapter became the first national agency professional level members founded on November 7, 2003. On November 29, 2008, that was 11 years passed, the University of Southern Mindanao (USM Artist Club) was founded and became the first University chapter in Mindanao area. There are now 42 chapters nationwide as of 2014.

=== The members ===
The members often use brother or sister for their members. The others called the members as '''Makasining''' (Filipoino term for pro-artist) or sometimes the members within the club use the word '''Kasining''' (Filipino term co-artist).

== Ritual and symbolism ==

'''Sinitic religion''' or '''Siniticism'''{{refn|group=note|Hu Shih's coinage. In his writing "Religion and Philosophy in Chinese History" he says: "Two great religions have played tremendously important roles throughout Chinese history. One is Buddhism which came to China probably before the Christian era but which began to exert nation-wide influence only after the third century A.D. The other great religion has had no generic name, but I propose to call it Siniticism. It is the native religion of the Chinese people: it dates back to time immemorial and includes all such later phases of its development as Moism, Confucianism (as a state religion), and all the various stages of the Taoist religion.".{{sfnb|Hu|2013|p=82}}}} is the [[religion]] of the [[history of China|Chinese civilisation]]. It has its sources in the [[Neolithic]] and has developed throughout history into a coherent multiplex system which persists up to the present day, and consists of [[Chinese folk religion|indigenous and popular devotional cults]], [[Chinese salvationist religions|popular soteriological organisations]], [[Chinese ritual mastery traditions|vernacular ritual methods]], [[Chinese shamanism|shamanic methods]], [[Confucian ritual religion|state ritual systems]], and [[Chinese philosophy|schools of high philosophy and ritual]] (chiefly distinguished into [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]).

According to the definition given by [[Hu Shih]], Sinitic religion was the product of the merger of [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] cultures, and "has been to China what [[Hinduism]] has been to [[India]]". The Shang contributed with a strong devotion to ancestors, while the Zhou who came from the west emphasised a theology of the supreme God (''[[Shangdi]]'' or ''[[Tian]]'', cf. [[Chinese theology]]). The result is a living cosmology with the supreme God as its spring, presiding over a hierarchy of mediating forces, namely the gods of cosmic and natural powers, the deified ancestors of great achievement, the progenitors of human groups. Also tribal gods of populations who were assimilated into China were integrated into this cosmology. While always retaining its primary core, it has taken onto itself philosophical elements from [[Buddhism]]. The most ancient book of the Sinitic religious system is the ''[[Yijing]]''.{{sfnb|Hu|2013|pp=82-83}}

[[Victor H. Mair]] similarly describes Sinitic religion as built upon two foundations:
* Shang ancestor worship orthopraxis and [[magianism]] (i.e. ''[[magi]]'' priesthood);
* Zhou theology revolving about ''Tian'' and its way;

The developments of organised religious systems from the medieval to the early modern periods did not alter this nucleus, although contributed to a continuous change of architecture, music, literature and institutions.{{sfnb|Mair|2011|p=104}} Ho (1998) describes Sinitic religion as "man-centred" with "[[Chinese ancestor worship|ancestor worship]] at its core".{{sfnb|Ho|1998|p=151}}

{{Main|Chinese folk religion}}
The worship of local gods and forces of nature, and kinship progenitors, was defined as "Shendao" (神道 ''Shéndào'', the "Way of the Gods") by 14th century [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], drawing from the ''Yijing'' in which the term refers to the natural order established by deities.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Dardess. ''Ming China, 1368-1644: A Concise History of a Resilient Empire''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2012. {{ISBN|1442204915}}. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; It is the "hardware" upon which philosophical and ritual traditions such as Confucianism and Taoism build. Recent scholarship has proposed the name "Shenxianism" (神仙教 ''Shénxiānjiào'', "religion of [[shen (Chinese religion)|deities]] and [[xian (Taoism)|immortals]]").{{sfnb|Shi|2008}} All [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] falling outside the scope and patronage of the high institutional forms of Confucianism and Taoism can be defined as "popular religion".

According to Hu Shih, Confucianism, founded by [[Confucius]], a scion of the erstwhile ruling Shang lineage, is a school of Sinitic religion concerned with setting the world to the right order, a system of education and "psychology of religious experience" which regards ritual as the device for this praxis. It is also a religion of "ancestor worship" and of "body as inheritance from the ancestors", whence the emphasis on personal purity and cultivation.{{sfnb|Hu|2013|pp=86-87}}

===Mohism===
{{Main|Mohism}}
Mohism, which has not had a profound impact compared to Confucianism, was founded by [[Mozi]]. According to Hu Shih it is a religion focused on a theology of "God as love".{{sfnb|Hu|2013|p=87}} Moism ultimately merged with Taoism.

===Taoism===
[[File:VM 6095 Lanzhou evening market at Xiguan.jpg|thumb|150px|Evening market at the Temple of Supreme Brightness (太清宫 ''Tàiqīnggōng''), an urban temple of the Zhengyi order in Xiguan, [[Lanzhou]], [[Gansu]].]]
{{Main|Taoism|Taoist schools}}
Taoism is a tradition of philosophy, rite and ecclesiastical organisation, which emphasises living in harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ({{lang|zh|[[Wikt:道|道]]}}, literally "Way", [[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanised as ''Dao'']]). Taoist schools function as theoretical and [[liturgy|liturgical]] frameworks for both popular and high cults of broader Chinese religion (cf. [[Zhengyi Taoism]]), and some of them (the [[Quanzhen Taoism|Quanzhen]] traditions) have a distinct monastic institution. In this tradition the ''Tao'' denotes both the metaphysical source of everything that exist and its physical pattern of unconcealment. Taoism differs specifically from [[Confucianism|Confucian traditions]] by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order, which are fundamental in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart | last = Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor | first = Elizabeth; Clifford; Robert | publisher = Norton | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780393918472 | location = New York, New York | page = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thanjavur Art Plate''' is an artifact which is exclusively made in [[Thanjavur]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India. It is a circular plate made as a gift item.

It is listed at item 63 as "Thanjavur Art Plate" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India, with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.&lt;ref name=Tanjore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_30March2015.pdf |format=pdf |title=State Wise Registration Details Of G.I Applications |accessdate=26 January 2016 |publisher=Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327150038/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_30March2015.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the size of the article is permitted to be different while other metal compositions and particularization have to remain the same as per GI approval.&lt;ref name=Tanjore/&gt;

==History==
The Thanjavur Art Plate or plaque was introduced by [[Serfoji II|Rajah Serfoji-II]] (1777&amp;ndash;1832) during the [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom|Maratha rule]] in Thanjavur. It was made as an exclusive gift item by the artisans of Thanjavur at the suggestion of the Rajah.&lt;ref name=Tanjore/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plate/&gt; 

The artifact is crafted  exclusively by the community of [[Vishwakarmas]], which consists of a few goldsmith families of Thanjavur. It is an inherited art, and is a way of living for them. It is a declared cottage industry as it is made in the houses of the craftsmen. Its manufacture is the prerogative of the menfolk only.{{Sfn|Rathakrishnan|2010|p=250}}

A plaque made in the 20th century was displayed at the Government Museum in Thanjavur during 2011. This plaque made of the prescribed metals has in the [[relief]] images of [[Nataraja]], the sage [[Pathanjali]], and the goddess [[Shivakamini|Sivakami]] in a standing posture over a lotus flower, encrusted at the plate's central part.&lt;ref name=Plate&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/Thanjavur-art-plate-on-display-at-museum/2013/06/04/article1618407.ece|title=Thanjavur art plate on display at museum|date=4 June 2013|newspaper=Express News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process of manufacture==
The artifact consists of three components: the base plate, a circular plate of metals with primary relief, and the secondary relief. Sheets of brass are used to make the base plate, silver sheets to craft the reliefs, lead to create moulds to project the three-dimensional images, and an asphalt or wax board to fix the plate. The base plate is prepared first by craftsman specialized in heavy metals. Then the crafting of designs or reliefs is done by jewelers, and the encrusting of the relief is the prerogative of the diamond-setting expert. The procedure of manufacture involves the making of the base plate followed by the casting of the copper plate, preparing moulds, and crafting the motifs on copper plates and dyes. The base plate is also covered with motifs. Floral and other designs are carved on the reliefs, and the product is then finished by polishing.{{Sfn|Rathakrishnan|2010|pp=250&amp;ndash;51}}

The art plates are marketed within the country and also exported. They are marketed by the artisans themselves or in handicraft showrooms and through exporters.{{Sfn|Rathakrishnan|2010|p=252}}

'''Upsala Simsällskap''', the "Uppsala Swimming Society" (but using the old spelling of the city name with one p), was founded in [[Uppsala]] in 1796. It is the oldest existing sports club in [[Sweden]] and claims to be the oldest swimming club in the world.

The society was founded by the mathematician and astronomer [[Jöns Svanberg]] (1771–1851) together with some colleagues at [[Uppsala university|the university]] as a way to remedy the general lack of swimming skills. The same year the society was founded, Svanberg arranged a mock "graduation ceremony" (''promotion''), modelled after the academic ceremony, where he and some of his colleagues awarded themselves the master's degree (''magister'') and their pupils the degree of bachelor (''kandidat'') in swimming. The ''simpromotion'' and these "degrees" were taken over by other Swedish swimming clubs and are still used in Swedish [[swimming school]]s.

After Svanberg had temporarily left Uppsala for [[Stockholm]], [[Gabriel Marklin]], otherwise remembered as an eccentric scientific collector, briefly took care of the swimming school, to be succeeded for a few years by Carl Gustaf Grahl, the first professional swimming instructor in Sweden. By that time, Svanberg had returned to Uppsala as professor of mathematics.

In the middle of the 19th century, a bath house was built and later a [[springboard]] for [[diving (sport)|diving]]. The [[Isander]] dive (or half gainer), one of the most common dives in springboard diving, was named after Lars Fredrik Isander (1828–1893), active in the Society and later lecturer at the [[Katedralskolan (Linköping)|Gymnasium in Linköping]], and the [[Mollberg]] dive (full gainer) was named after Anders Fredrik Mollberg, swimming instructor for the society (1878–1879), who supposedly invented it by accident when he was actually intending to do an Isander dive. It actually appears to be considerably older and is described already in ''Underrättelser i simkonsten'', a Swedish instruction book in swimming from 1839. Anecdotes describe Mollberg's extraordinary gymnastic ability and how he once made two consecutive "Mollberg" dives while slightly tipsy, leaving spectators wondering how he came out of the water alive.

Although the original intent for the Society was elementary swimming instruction, it entered competitive swimming in 1910 and is one of the most successful swimming clubs in Sweden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6295">'''Village banking''' is a [[microcredit]] methodology whereby financial services are administered locally rather than centralized in a formal bank. Village banking has its roots in ancient cultures and was most recently adopted for use by micro-finance institutions (MFIs) as a way to control costs. Early MFI village banking methods were innovated by Grameen Bank and then later developed by groups such as [[FINCA International]] founder [[John Hatch (development specialist)|John Hatch]]. Among US-based non-profit agencies there are at least 31 [[microfinance]] institutions (MFIs) that have collectively created over 800 village banking programs in at least 90 countries. And in many of these countries there are host-country MFIs—sometimes dozens—that are village banking practitioners as well.&lt;ref name="cat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/HaasGlobal/docs/hatch_fincaprimer.doc|title="A Brief Primer on FINCA", a lecture by John Hatch at the University of Berkeley's Haas School of Business, July 21, 2004|accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
A village bank is an informal self-help support group of 20-30 members, predominantly female heads-of-household. If the program is “on mission”, in a normal village bank about 50% of all new members entering the program will be severely poor—representing families with a daily per-capita expenditure (DPCE) of less than US$1; the rest are moderately poor (DPCE=$1–2/day) or non-poor (DPCE &gt;$2).{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  These women meet once a week in the home of one of their members to avail themselves of working capital loans, a safe place to save, skill training, mentoring, and motivation. Loans normally start at $50–$100 and are linked to savings such that the more a client saves the more she can borrow.  The normal loan period is four months and is repaid in 16 weekly installments.&lt;ref name="cat"/&gt; At the end of 2006, 95% of clients covered by a benchmark sample of 71 [[NGO]]s and institutions engaged in village bank lending were women.&lt;ref&gt;''MicroBanking Bulletin'', Issue 15, MIX, Washington, August 2007, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

To eliminate the need for collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving bank loans), village banks rely on a variation of the [[solidarity lending]] methodology. It relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and social pressure makes it possible for even the poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a repayment rate of over 97% in its worldwide network.  
Village banks are highly democratic, self-managed, grassroots organizations. They elect their own leaders, select their own members, create their own bylaws, do their own bookkeeping, manage all funds, disburse and deposit all funds, resolve loan delinquency problems, and levy their own fines on members who come late, miss meetings, or fall behind in their payments.&lt;ref name="cat"/&gt;

There was some hope in the early years of village bank development that these small village organizations could become independent and self-financing, but this hope was later abandoned.  Most village banks in operation today are directly supervised by the staff of a local NGO or microfinance institution, from which they receive much of their loan financing.

==Sources of funds==
Market interest rates apply to village bank loans.  At the end of 2006, the average portfolio yield for a sample 71 microfinance institutions engaged in village banking was 27.7%, after removing the effect of local inflation.&lt;ref&gt;''MicroBanking Bulletin'', Issue 15, MIX, Washington, August 2007, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The village bank itself will usually mark up this rate when it on-lends to individual members.  While these rates seem high, they are low compared to those charged by local [[moneylenders]] in most countries.  Unlike [[rural banks]] and [[credit unions]] these microfinance institutions do not provide savings services directly to their clients.

The [[capital (finance)|capital]] for the loans is provided by FINCA with on-time weekly installment repayments collectively guaranteed by all members—i.e., a shortfall by one member must be covered by other group members. This joint liability form of microcredit is controversial, with [[Muhammad Yunus]] (for example) rejecting formal systems of joint liability in [[Grameen Bank|Grameen Bank's]] solidarity groups.

==FINCA==
Worldwide FINCA’s 21 affiliates have about 3,300 staff, of which about 2,600 are field staff (credit officers and supervisors), and among these many are the better-educated children of FINCA clients. Each credit officer (CO) attends the weekly meeting of each of her 10-15 village banks to coach its leadership committee and monitor the bank’s activities. In addition to motivation and adult education, the CO supervises client attendance, monitors bookkeeping accuracy, checks the accuracy of the current week’s loan and savings collections, and checks when the deposit receipt of the previous meeting. In turn, each village bank is managed by its elected officers—a president (who leads the bank’s democratic decision-making process), secretary (who takes attendance and keeps minutes) and a treasurer (responsible for accurately handling all cash transactions). Finally, each village banker has her own passbook, and her recorded balances of loan payments and savings deposits must always be the same as those recorded in the treasurer’s record for each client.&lt;ref name="cat"/&gt;

 [[Image:Bulgaria (ethnic) 1892.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ethnic map of Bulgaria according to the census results from 1892 (Blue denotes regions with a Romanian minority)]]

'''Vlachs''' ({{lang-bg|власи/vlasi}}, autonymed '''Rumâni'''; {{lang-ro|români, rumâni}}), are a community concentrated in the [[Vidin Province]] in the northwestern part of [[Bulgaria]]. Most of this people declare themselves ''vlasi'' (Vlachs) when asked in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (e.g. on the [[census]]). The Vlachs in Bulgaria are not recognized as a national minority, and as an ethnic group and they don't have ethnic rights in schools or churches since the [[Interwar period]].

The Romance-speaking community in Bulgaria (the ''vlasi'') are roughly divided into the "White Vlachs" of Vidin and "Kutzo-Vlachs" of the Rhodopes. A part of the Vidin Vlachs is identified as '''Romanians''', however, the Bulgarian state identifies them as Vlachs and not Romanians.{{sfn|Poulton|1998|p=26}}

==History==
Vlachs were identified as a separate entity during the 11th century, and their history during the Migration Period is a matter of scholarly speculations.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, Gottfried (1997). Ein Damm bricht. Die römische Donaugrenze und die Invasionen des 5-7. Jahrhunderts in Lichte der Namen und Wörter [A Dam Breaks: The Roman Danube frontier and the Invasions of the 5th-7th Centuries in the Light of Names and Words] (in German). R. Oldenbourg Verlag. {{ISBN|3-486-56262-2}}, pp. 336-337.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one theory, the Vlachs originated from romanised local Balkan tribes,&lt;ref&gt;Fine, John V. A (1994). The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest. The University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|0-472-08260-4}}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and their Eastern Romance language prove the survival of the latinised [[Thraco-Roman]] population in the lower Danube basin. The Vlachs came later into close contacts with sedentary Slavic-speaking communities and adopted Old Church Slavonic liturgy in the First Bulgarian Empire. The Second Bulgarian Empire established during 12th century was called also Vlach-Bulgarian kingdom. In Ottoman times, Eastern Orthodox Christians, were subsumed into the wider ethno-religious group called [[Rum millet]]. A  distinct Vlach consciousness was not developed until the 19th century, and was influenced by the rise of Romanian national movement. As a result, wealthy, urbanized Vlachs were culturally hellenised  during 17-18th century and bulgarised during the 19th. Some Gypsy people, which spoke [[Vlax Romani language]], crossed the Danube during Ottoman era, because of the [[Slavery in Romania|slavery in Vallachia and Moldova]]. Most of the slaves there were of Roma (Gypsy) ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Beck, "The Origins of Gypsy Slavery in Romania", in Dialectical Anthropology, Volume 14, Number 1 / March, 1989, Springer, p. 53-61.&lt;/ref&gt; There were ca. 50,000 Vlachs in Bulgaria at the end of the 19th. century. At the beginning of the 20th century, a process of Romanian self-identification began in the community of Bulgarian Vlachs.&lt;ref&gt;The Wallachian Problem in Bulgaria between the Two World Wars: Political Factors and Aspects, Author: Blagovest Nyagulov, Journal: Bulgarian ethnology, 1995, Issue No: 5, Page Range: 52-75, Language: Bulgarian.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no remaining community in the [[Dobrogea]], which Romania colonized with Vlachs when it held that region briefly between the tho World wars. Vigorous assimilation occurred in the area, especially after the Second World War, and today only small groups identify themselves as Vlach or Romanian in Bulgaria.

The Vlach people in northeastern Bulgaria are referred by Romanian researchers as "Romanians".&lt;ref&gt;Boldur Alexandru, Istoria Basarabiei, Editura Frunza, Bucuresti, 1990, p 95&lt;/ref&gt; The Vlachs from the Vidin Province are separated into 2 main groups: the "Dunăreni" (who live around the [[Danube river]]) and the "Pădureni" (who lived in the higher placed regions with many woods). They speak the [[Oltenia]]n variety of the [[Romanian language]]. In southwestern Bulgaria lives also a very small [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] population, such as in the village [[Peshtera]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/doc97/edoc7728.htm Aromanians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the people, that self-declare as Vlachs, are in fact [[Romani people]], which speak a Vlax Romani dialects.&lt;ref&gt;The Bulgarian Gypsies – Searching their Place in the Society, Elena Marušiakova et Veselin Popov, Balkanology Magazine, Vol. IV, № 2, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, an Association of the Vlachs in Bulgaria was founded. In 2011 census 3,684 people declared themselves as Vlachs, and 891 as Romanians.

'''"When It Changed"''' is a [[science fiction]] short story by [[Joanna Russ]]. It was first published in the anthology ''[[Again, Dangerous Visions]]''.

==Synopsis==
Janet Evason lives on Whileaway, an all-female human colony planet whose inhabitants produce offspring by chemically combining [[egg cell|ova]] because all their males died in a plague 30 generations earlier. When male astronauts arrive from Earth, they assume that Whileaway society must be in some way deficient, and announce that they will reproduce with the women. Janet's wife tries to kill the astronauts; Janet stops her, but realizes that their very existence will change Whileaway society forever.

==Reception==
"When It Changed" won the 1972 [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story]],&lt;ref name=Nebula&gt;[https://nebulas.sfwa.org/nominated-work/when-it-changed/ When It Changed], at [[Science Fiction Writers of America]]; retrieved October 27, 20128&lt;/ref&gt; and was a finalist for the 1973 [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]].&lt;ref name=Hugo&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1973-hugo-awards/ 1973 Hugo Awards], at TheHugoAwards.org; retrieved October 28, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In the afterword, Russ states "When It Changed" was written to challenge ideas in [[science fiction]] that had not, at the time of writing, been addressed.  These ideas were related to the way women—and societies consisting solely of women—were handled by writers who are male.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have read SF stories about manless worlds before; they are either full of busty girls in wisps of chiffon who slink about writhing with lust ([[Keith Laumer]] wrote a charming, funny one called "The War with the Yukks"), or the women have set up a static, beelike society in imitation of some presumed primitive matriarchy. These stories are written by men. Why women who have been alone for generations should "instinctively" turn their sexual desires toward persons of whom they have only intellectual knowledge, or why female people are presumed to have an innate preference for Byzantine rigidity, I don't know.&lt;ref name="Sci Fiction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/classics/classics_archive/russ/russ1.html |title=When It Changed |last=Russ |first=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Russ |work=[[Sci Fiction]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514042130/http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/classics/classics_archive/russ/russ1.html |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |accessdate=February 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Russ also mentions [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s novel ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' as an influence on the story.

==Awards and nominations==
* [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story]] 1973
* [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]] nominee 1973

'''Women in [[Senegal]]''' have a traditional social status as shaped by local custom and religion. According to 2005 survey, the [[female genital mutilation]] prevalence rate stands at 28% of all women in Senegal aged between 15 and 49.&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-senegal-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Senegal] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The traditional division of labour in Senegal saw women responsible for household tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and childcare. They were also responsible for a large share of agricultural work, including weeding and harvesting, for such common crops as rice.  Women of the nobility used to be influential in political scenes. This is partly because matrilineage was the means for a prince to become king (particularly in the Wolof kingdoms). Such ''lingeer'' as [[Yacine Boubou]], [[Ndate Yalla]] and her sister [[Njembeut Mbodji]] are hailed as inspirations for contemporary Senegalese women.

In recent decades, economic change and urbanization has led to many young men migrating to the cities, such as Dakar.  Rural women have become increasingly involved in managing village forestry resources and operating millet and rice mills.&lt;ref name="Culture of Senegal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of Senegal|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Sa-Th/Senegal.html|accessdate=August 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government's rural development agency aims to organize village women and involve them more actively in the development process. Women play a prominent role in village health committees and prenatal and postnatal programs. In urban areas, despite women's second-class status [[Women in Islam|within Islam]], cultural change has led to women entering the labour market as office and retail clerks, domestic workers and unskilled workers in textile mills and tuna-canning factories.&lt;ref name="Culture of Senegal"/&gt;

Non-government organizations are also active in promoting women's economic opportunities.  Micro-financing loans for women's businesses have improved the economic situation of many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senegal's women find a way out of poverty|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/797156--senegal-s-women-find-a-way-out-of-poverty|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=August 13, 2011|date=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senegal ratified the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, as well as the additional protocol.  Senegal is also a signatory of the African Charter of Human and People's Rights, which was adopted during the 2003 African Union Summit.  However, Senegalese feminists have been critical of the government's lack of action in enforcing the protocols, conventions and other texts that have been signed as a means of protecting women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil society, media women seek enforcement of texts on women's rights|url=http://www.afriquejet.com/civil-society-media-women-seek-enforcement-of-texts-on-womens-rights-201102131409.html|publisher=Afrique en ligne|accessdate=August 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's rights ==
Women in Senegal face a number of disparities in their social status.  Women have high rates of illiteracy.  They make up less than 10% of the formal labour force.  [[Female genital mutilation]] is a persistent practise in some rural areas, despite being outlawed by the constitution of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Being a woman in Senegal|url=http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&amp;id_article=431|accessdate=August 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's legal rights are blunted by such practises as [[polygyny]] marriages, and [[sharia|Islamic law]] involving property ownership.

[[Female genital mutilation]] is present in Senegal.&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"&gt;[http://www.brighamandwomens.org/Departments_and_Services/obgyn/services/africanwomenscenter/FGCprevalence.aspx "FGC Prevalence Rates Diagram"], African Women's Health Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, accessed 7 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2005 survey, the FGM prevalence rate is 28% of all women aged between 15 and 49.&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011/&gt; There are significant differences in regional prevalence. FGM is most widespread in the Southern Senegal (94% in Kolda Region) and in Northeastern Senegal (93% in Matam Region).&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011/&gt;

FGM rates are lower in other regions: Tambacounda (86%), Ziguinchor (69%), and less than 5% in Diourbel and Louga Regions. Senegal is 94% Muslim. The FGM prevalence rate varies by religion: 29% of Muslim women have undergone FGM, 16% of Animists, and 11% of Christian women.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/FGM-C_final_10_October.pdf FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING: A Statistical Exploration] UNICEF (2010); see Table 1C, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011/&gt;
