'''Ansley v Prospectus Nominees Unlimited''' [2004] NZCA 14; [2004] 2 NZLR 590; (2004) 5 NZ ConvC 193,914; (2004) 5 NZCPR 330; (2004) 10 TCLR 952 (3 March 2004) is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding whether a party to a conditional contract can [[Invitation to treat|treat]] that [[contract]] as ended if they are responsible for the failure of the stipulated condition.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
PNU was subdividing a [[property]] in [[Wanaka]]. In October 2001, whilst the subdivision [[consent]] was tied up in the Environment [[Court]], they entered into a conditional sale with the Ansleys for $1.05 million, on the proviso that PNU obtained the necessary consents by 28 February 2002.

Due to PNU not following up the consent in a timely manner, the consents did not eventuate until after this date, and as a result PNU claimed the Ansleys contract was at an end, leaving PNU to sell the property to a 3rd party for a higher price.

The Ansleys unsuccessfully sought specific performance for the transaction, and sued PNU for account of the profit they made on the resale of the property.

PNU argued that the contract was at an end. The Ansleys argued that the contract only ended due to PNU not pursuing the consent in a proper manner.

==Held==
The court held that PNU had not pursued the consent in a proper manner, and awarded the Ansleys PNU's profit on the resale.

The '''barndoor skate''' (''Dipturus laevis'') is a [[species]] of [[Seawater|marine]] [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] in the [[Skate (fish)|skate]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Rajidae]] of the order [[Rajiformes]]. It is native to the northwestern [[Atlantic Ocean]], and is found from the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] and the southern side of the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] south to [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="adw"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Dipturus_laevis.html | title = Dipturus laevis | author = Basta, J. | year = 2002 | publisher = Animal Diversity Web | accessdate = 28 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish is one of the largest skates found in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], reaching lengths up to {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. It is [[carnivore|carnivorous]], feeding on [[invertebrate]]s and other [[fish]] found near the sea floor.

After peaking in the 1950s, the population of the barndoor skate dramatically declined in the 1960s and early 1970s as a result of overfishing.  In 2003, it was listed as endangered by the [[World Conservation Union]]. Barndoor skate populations have increased substantially since 1990. In most cases, the barndoor skate is not intentionally harvested by the commercial fishing industry&amp;mdash;it is usually considered [[bycatch]] in the [[trawling]] nets used to target other species of fish.

==Description==
[[File:Barndoor skate.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton]] 
The barndoor skate is a flat-bodied fish with a large, disk-like body with sharply angled corners and a pointed snout. Its [[pectoral fin]]s have [[evolution|evolved]] into broad, flat, [[wing]]-like appendages used to propel the fish through the water. These fins have a concave front edge with rounded posterior corners. Like [[shark]]s, it has a boneless [[skeleton]] made of [[cartilage]], a tough, elastic substance composed of [[collagen]]ous and/or elastic fibers, [[Chondrocyte|cells]], and a firm, gel-like substance called the matrix. It has slot-like body openings called [[gill slit]]s on the underside of the body beneath the pectoral fins that lead from the [[gill]]s. The [[dorsal fin]]s are close together and far removed from the tail.&lt;ref name="flmnh"&gt;{{cite web | author = Wettstein, M.J. | url = http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/BarndoorSkate/BarndoorSkate.html | title = Biological Profiles: Barndoor Skate | publisher = Florida Museum of Natural History, Ichthyology Department | accessdate = 28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two eyes on its dorsal surface, located about {{convert|5.5|cm|in|1|sp=us}} apart.&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt;

The fish's upper surface is brown to reddish brown with many scattered darker spots, lighter streaks, and reticulations. The center of each [[pectoral fin]] is marked with an oval spot or blotch. The lower surface is light, white to grey, blotched irregularly with gray spots.&lt;ref name="flmnh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigelow53"&gt;{{cite book | author = Bigelow, H.B. |author2=W.C.

Part two. | location = New Haven | publisher = Sears Found. Mar. Res., Yale Univ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barndoor skate is unique from other species of skate in its having a straight line that begins at the snout and ends at the anterior margin of the outer corner of the disk, but stopping short of the disk.&lt;ref name="flmnh"/&gt;

The barndoor skate is one of the largest skates found in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; It can reach lengths of up to {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and can weigh up to {{convert|18|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="fishbase"&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Dipturus | species = laevis | year = 2006 | month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been unconfirmed reports of individuals reaching lengths of {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="flmnh"/&gt; A {{convert|71|-|76|cm|adj=on|abbr=on}} barndoor skate typically weighs {{convert|2|-|3|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="flmnh"/&gt;

The tail is moderately short and does not have large, thorn-like structures called [[dermal denticle]]s that are normally found on skates. This lack of denticles distinguishes it from all but two species of skates found in the western Atlantic.&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; Larger individuals do have three rows of smaller denticles on the tail, and mature females also possess denticles on the head and shoulders, and along the dorsal midbelt of the disk and tail. Denticles are completely absent on small individuals.&lt;ref name="flmnh"/&gt;

==Habitat==
The barndoor skate occurs in a range extending from the banks of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the southern [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], and along the northeastern coast and offshore banks of [[Nova Scotia]] south to [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="bigelow54"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bigelow, H.B. |author2=W.C.

Zool. | volume = 112 | pages = 38–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports in the 19th century said the range of the fish extended as far south as northeastern [[Florida]], but more recent research suggests that the Florida discoveries may have actually been a misidentification of ''R. floridana''.&lt;ref name="mceachran75"&gt;{{cite journal | author = McEachran, J.D. |author2=J.A. Musick | year = 1975 | title = Distribution and relative abundance of seven species of skates (Pisces: Rajidae) which occur between Nova Scotia and Cape Hatteras | journal = U.S. Fishery Bulletin | volume = 73 |pages = 110–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found on various types of ocean bottoms, including soft muddy, sandy, and rocky bottoms. It can be found from the [[shoreline]] to depths to {{convert|750|m|ft|abbr=on}}, although it is most commonly found at depths less than {{convert|150|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. It inhabits waters in a broad range of temperatures, from just above freezing to {{convert|20|°C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="bigelow54"/&gt; It appears to move closer to shore in the autumn and further out to sea in the warmer months. It tolerates [[brackish water]] where the [[salinity]] is as low as 21 to 24&amp;nbsp;parts per thousand, but it prefers salinity between 31 and 35 parts per thousand.&lt;ref name="fishbase"/&gt; It is believed to not exhibit any north-south [[Fish migration|migratory]] patterns.

==Diet==
The fish is [[Carnivore|carnivorous]], with its [[prey]] consisting mainly of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrates and [[fish]]es. Such food items include [[polychaete]]s, [[gastropod]]s, [[Bivalvia|bivalve mollusks]], [[Grapsidae|rock crabs]], [[Cancer (genus)|cancer crabs]], [[Majidae|spider crabs]], [[lobster]]s, [[shrimp]]s, [[squid]]s, and fishes including [[spiny dogfish]], [[alewife]], [[Atlantic herring]], [[menhaden]], [[hake]]s, [[sculpin]]s, [[cunner]], [[tautog]], [[sand lance]], [[Stromateidae|butterfish]], and various [[flounder]]s. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, [[copepod]]s, [[amphipod]]s, [[isopod]]s, [[Crangonidae|crangon shrimp]], and [[euphausiid]]s.&lt;ref name="noaa173"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Packer D. | author2 = Zetlin, C. | author3 = Vitaliano J. | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2003 | title = Essential Fish Habitat Source Document: Barndoor Skate, ''Dipturus laevis'', Life History and Habitat Characteristics | publisher = National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-NE-173 | url = http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/nefsc/publications/tm/tm173/tm173.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals have been found with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.&lt;ref name="flmnh"/&gt;

==Importance to humans==
The barndoor skate is one of five skates in the [[Gulf of Maine]] that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the [[winter skate]] (''[[Leucoraja ocellata]]'') and the [[thorny skate]] (''[[thorny skate|Amblyraja radiata]]'').&lt;ref name="noaa173"/&gt; The barndoor skate is most commonly considered bycatch by [[commercial trawler]]s operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using [[bottom trawling]].&lt;ref name="fishbase"/&gt; When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as [[Bait (luring substance)|bait]], [[fish meal]], and pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption.&lt;ref name="flmnh"/&gt; Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings.&lt;ref name="nfsc00"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Northeast Fisheries Science Center | year = 2000 | title = Report of the 30th Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop (30th SAW): Stock Assessment Review Committee (SARC) consensus summary of assessments | publisher = Northeast Fish.

==Conservation==
[[Image:Dipturus laevis 2.jpg|thumb|Barndoor skate caught during an NOAA research cruise]]
Abundances of barndoor skate dropped precipitously in the 1960s and early 1970s, coinciding with the period of intense fishing by foreign factory trawlers. The abundance remained very low through around 1990, but increased nearly exponentially from 1990–2005, and have been approaching the levels observed in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="nfsc08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/publications/crd/crd0902/skates/skateFigures.pdf. |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121214025157/http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/publications/crd/crd0902/skates/skateFigures.pdf. |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 December 2012 |title=Data poor working group, skate assessment figures |author=NEFSC |year=2009 |publisher=NEFSC |accessdate=12 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Casey and Myers &lt;ref name="casey98"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Casey, J.M. |author2=R.A.

However, they only presented data through 1993, so the recovery that started in the early 1990s was not clearly evident. In 1999, two conservation groups, GreenWorld, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Center for Marine Conservation, based in Washington, DC, petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to have the barndoor skate listed under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. After a 12-month study, the NMFS announced in 2002 that listing the species as endangered or threatened was not warranted. It cited increases in abundance and biomass of barndoor skate observed during surveys since 1993, which had become quite rapid by that time. {{cite web | title = endangered species ruling | author = NOAA | publisher = NOAA | accessdate = 12 April 2012 | url = http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/fr/fr67-61055.pdf}} In 1994, the [[World Conservation Union]] had listed the barndoor skate as "vulnerable" under the 1994 Categories and Criteria, but in 2003, it reassessed the species as "endangered" on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

Each year, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) estimates current population levels for a variety of aquatic species of special interest, and releases an annual report showing the progress being made to reduce harvesting of overfished species. When a species has been determined to be either overfished or subject to overfishing, the regional fishery management councils are required to develop a plan to correct the problem. In 2006, NOAA published a press release stating that as a result of conservation efforts, between 2004 and 2005, monitored stocks of the barndoor skate had grown to a level that the NOAA no longer considers "overfished".&lt;ref name="noaa06"&gt;{{cite press release | title = NOAA Releases Report on Status of U.S. Marine Fisheries for 2005 | publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | date = June 20, 2006 | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2006/jun06/noaa06-061.html | accessdate = 28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and naming==
The fish was originally described as ''Raja laevis'' by [[Samuel Latham Mitchill]] in 1818. The [[scientific name]] was later changed to the currently valid name ''Dipturus laevis''. It has also been misidentified as ''Raia granulata'' by [[Theodore Gill]], an American ichthyologist, in 1879.&lt;ref name="goode79"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goode, G. B.|author2=Bean, T. H.| year = 1879 | title = List of the Fishes of Essex County, Massachusetts, including those of Massachusetts Bay | journal = Bull.

''[[Raja (genus)|Raja]]'', the original genus which was coined by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]], is still recognized as a valid [[subgenus]].&lt;ref name="flmnh"/&gt;

'''Beatrice Harraden''' (1864–1936) was a British writer and [[suffragette]].

==Life==
Born in [[Hampstead]], [[London]]&lt;ref name=Dickins&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickins|first=Gordon|title=An Illustrated Literary Guide to Shropshire|year=1987|publisher=Shropshire Libraries|page=35|isbn=0-903802-37-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 January 1864, Harraden studied in [[Dresden]], at [[Cheltenham Ladies' College|Cheltenham Ladies’ College]] in [[Gloucestershire]] and at [[Queen's College, London|Queen’s College]] and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]] in London, and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]&lt;ref name=Dickins /&gt; degree. She travelled extensively in Europe and the United States and in 1893 found fame with her [[debut novel]], ''Ships That Pass in the Night'', a love story set in a [[tuberculosis]] [[sanatorium]].  It was a best-seller, but she failed to achieve similar success with subsequent books which included novels, short stories and books for children.&lt;ref name=Dickins /&gt;

Harraden spent several summer holidays lodging at The Green Dragon inn at [[Little Stretton, Shropshire]], walking and writing.  Her memories of this and the landlady, a Mrs Benbow, led to her writing a short story, ''At the Green Dragon'', published in 1894.&lt;ref name=Dickins /&gt;

Harraden involved herself  with the women's rights movement, joining the [[Women's Social and Political Union]], the [[Women Writers' Suffrage League]] and [[Women's Tax Resistance League|Women’s Tax Resistance League]] and publishing her work in the suffragette paper ''[[Votes for Women]]''. This involvement is reflected in much of her fiction. She also involved herself as a reader for the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', and this, too is reflected in her fiction: ''The Scholar’s Daughter'' (1906) is set among [[lexicographer]]s.&lt;ref name="winchester"&gt;{{cite book

In 1930, she received a [[Pension#Civil list pensions|civil list pension]] for her literary work. She died at Barton-on-Sea on Monday 5 May 1936.

The '''''Bernese Chronicle''''' (German: ''Chronik der Stadt Bern'') contains information about the early history of the city of [[Bern]], Switzerland.

The ''Bernese Chronicle'' was composed in 1430 by [[Conrad Justinger]] from Bern.&lt;ref name="zahnd"&gt;Zahnd, Urs M. “Erläuterungen.” 12 April 2008. {{cite web |url=http://www.digibern.ch/justinger/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606094926/http://www.digibern.ch/justinger/ |archivedate=2008-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Müller, Justinger was entrusted by the Bernese council under the chairmanship of its mayor [[Rudolf Hofmeister]] to chronicle the history of his hometown Bern from its foundation until the present time.&lt;ref name="müller_758"&gt;Müller, P.

By Justinger’s own account, the ''Bernese Chronicle'' is primarily based on documents that were stored in the archives of the city of Bern in the early 14th century.&lt;ref name="müller_758"/&gt; Furthermore, Justinger used the ''[[Narratio conflictus apud Laupen]]'' (Latin: ‘Narrative of the conflict at Laupen’) as well as the annals of the [[cathedral of Bern]] (''[[Cronica de Berno]]'') as sources for his chronicle.&lt;ref name="müller_758"/&gt;

Even if Justinger’s monumental work appears to have been considerably influenced by older chronicles from [[Strasbourg]], [[Basle]], [[Constance]] and [[Zurich]], researchers are generally agreed that the ''Bernese Chronicle'' constitutes the earliest record of the cruelties of the [[Habsburg]] governors towards the population of the [[Forest Cantons]].&lt;ref name="zahnd"/&gt;

Justinger’s ''Bernese Chronicle'' had a deep impact on the historiography of [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="zahnd"/&gt; Although the original [[manuscript]] of the ''Bernese Chronicle'' is lost with the exception of 2½ leaves, its text has, nevertheless, been preserved in a single manuscript contained in the archive of the [[University of Jena]].

The '''Book League of America, Inc.''' was a [[United States|US]]  [[Book publishing|book publisher]]  and [[mail order]] [[book sales club]]. It was established in 1930, a few years after the [[Book of the Month Club]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Its founder was [[Lawrence Lamm]], previously an editor at [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; The company was located at 100 [[Fifth Avenue]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profitfrog.com/small-business/chapter-9.htm |title=Book Clubs |accessdate=2008-08-06  |publisher=Profitfrog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a {{convert|240000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} office building that was constructed in 1906.&lt;ref name="therealdeal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/atlas-flips-100-fifth-avenue-for-152m|title=Atlas flips 100 Fifth Avenue for $152M|date=February 21, 2008|work=therealdeal.com|publisher=The Real Deal Online|accessdate=28 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It [[Publishing#Printing|printed]] and  [[Publishing#Distribution|distributed]] a variety of volumes in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. A victim of the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; the Book League of America was purchased by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 1936.

==Products==
Book League of America printed and published contemporary and classic books.  The clothbound [[hardcover]] was commonly a dark navy-blue, though sometimes red or black.  There was an embossed logo on the front.  Depending upon a variety of exposure conditions and perhaps publishing years, the spine cloth faded differently, with some of the spines remaining dark navy, while others turned purple or navy-green.  The spine featured book title and author in gold or silver [[Gilding|gilt]] lettering, along with decorative scrolling, sometimes in an [[art deco]] motif.

Most of the pages were smooth-cut on the top and bottom edges, and [[deckle]]d on the outer edge.  Some books contained the note: "This book is standard length, complete and unabridged.  Manufactured under wartime conditions in conformity with all government regulations controlling the use of paper and other materials."  This explains the yellowed or tanning paper condition, more noticeable in some books than others.  Some books were illustrated. Many of the books did not include a publish date.  [[Dust jacket]]s were not included.

==Services==
Approximately 5,000 [[Subscription business model|subscribers]] received monthly [[Flyer (pamphlet)|fliers]] that offered a selection from a variety of contemporary and [[Classic book|world classic literature]] choices.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Van Gelder |title=Lawrence Lamm, 99, Pioneer in Book Packaging |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/30/obituaries/lawrence-lamm-99-pioneer-in-book-packaging.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1995-08-30 |accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The famous Board of Editors selects for you 2 books each month: the best new book -AND- one of the greatest classics.  The Book League of America supplies these 2 books each month at 1/3 of the usual cost!&lt;ref name="tias"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tias.com/cgi-bin/showcase-item.cgi?itemKey=1923062207&amp;store=/stores/mspackratz |title=1930s - The Book league of America ad |accessdate=2008-08-06 |publisher=tias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Cassell's Book of Knowledge''''' was an alphabetical eight-volume [[encyclopedia]] published under a range of titles including ''The Book of Knowledge'' and ''The New Book of Knowledge''. The series was printed in [[London]] by The [[Waverley Book Company]], Ltd. in various years beginning in 1922. The essays were written in a now dated style, but designed to appeal to both adults and children. The books were edited by multiple [[editor]]s including [[Harold Felix Baker Wheeler|Harold FB Wheeler]] (circa 1935), [[John Alexander Hammerton]] (circa 1950), and [[Gordon Stowell]] (1955). ''The New Book of Knowledge'', an updated set, appeared circa 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopaediaantiquus.wordpress.com/category/cassells-book-of-knowledge/|title=Cassell’s Book of Knowledge - Encyclopaedia Antiquus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre Against Expulsions''' ({{lang-de|Zentrum gegen Vertreibungen}}, ZgV) was a planned [[Germany|German]] documentation centre for [[wikt:expulsion|expulsion]]s and [[ethnic cleansing]], particularly the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]].&lt;ref name=tasks /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Levitin, Telegraph.uk, 26 Feb 2009, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/4841432/Germany-provokes-anger-over-museum-to-refugees-who-fled-Poland-during-WWII.html] "plans to build a museum dedicated to German refugees who fled or were expelled from Poland after the Second World War."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ggov /&gt; Since March 19, 2008 the name of the project is Sichtbares Zeichen gegen Flucht und Vertreibung.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesregierung.de/nsc_true/Content/DE/__Anlagen/BKM/2008-04-09-sichtbares-zeichen-konzeption-barrierefrei,property=publicationFile.pdf/2008-04-09-sichtbares-zeichen-konzeption-barrierefrei]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project was initiated by the [[Federation of Expellees]], who dedicated a "Foundation Centre Against Expulsions" to the centre.&lt;ref name=of /&gt; This foundation is based in [[Wiesbaden]], and headed by [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] politician and president of the Federation of Expellees, [[Erika Steinbach]]. The other head of the foundation was [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician [[Peter Glotz]] who died in 2005.

Since late 2008, the project is forwarded by the Federal Republic of Germany, when the federal government and parliament passed a law calling for the constitution of a ''Foundation German Historical Museum'' subordinate to the federal government, which in turn shall hold a ''Foundation Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation'' which shall take on the actual documentation in Berlin.&lt;ref name=ggov&gt;[http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_6562/Content/EN/Artikel/2008/09/2008-09-03-flucht-vertreibung-versoehnung__en.html German federal government release of 03.09.2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DHMlaw /&gt; The project has been subject to criticism, especially in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/4841432/Germany-provokes-anger-over-museum-to-refugees-who-fled-Poland-during-WWII.html Michael Levitin, Telegraph.uk, 26 Feb 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-and-poland-square-up-in-row-over-war-1628262.html Tony Paterson, The Independent, 21 February 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Foundation Centre Against Expulsions" of the Federation of Expellees==

The [[Federation of Expellees]] ({{lang-de|Bund der Vertriebenen, BdV)}} is the German non-governmental head organization of various organized groups of German refugees and expellees. The federation is committed to document the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|post- World War II flight and expulsion of Germans]]&lt;ref name=tasks /&gt; as well as other forced displacements, and maintains an exhibition for this purpose shown in changing locations of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.z-g-v.de/english/aktuelles/?id=49 Centre Against Expulsions, foundation website, "Permanent exhibition"]&lt;/ref&gt; To expand this exhibition and to find a permanent place for it, the Federation of Expellees set up the "Foundation Centre Against Expulsions" ({{lang-de|Stiftung Zentrum gegen Vertreibungen, ZgV)}}) on 6 September 2000.&lt;ref name=of&gt;[http://www.z-g-v.de/english/aktuelles/?id=34 Centre Against Expulsions, foundation website, "Our Foundation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801185047/http://www.z-g-v.de/english/aktuelles/?id=34 |date=2009-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectives ===

The foundation Centre Against Expulsions defines four objectives:&lt;ref name=tasks&gt;[http://www.z-g-v.de/english/aktuelles/?id=35 Centre Against Expulsions, foundation website, "Tasks and Objectives"]&lt;/ref&gt;

# To document the [[History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe|history of settlement]], culture, [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|post-World War II deportation and expulsion]], forced labour, torture, and later emigration of Germans from various countries of [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]], in a modern museum.&lt;ref name=tasks /&gt; The museum shall provide room for the documentation and "additional space for sadness, sympathy and forgiveness" in a requiem rotunda.&lt;ref name=tasks /&gt;
# To document and to evaluate the impact of the integration of millions of uprooted Germans into the post-World War II German society.&lt;ref name=tasks /&gt;
# To document the "expulsion and genocide of other peoples, especially in Europe",&lt;ref name=tasks /&gt; arguing that "''displacement, expulsion and genocide can never be justified, [...] are always a crime, contradicting human rights and carried out by following the archaic thinking of the bloody vendetta.''"&lt;ref name=tasks /&gt;
# To donate a ''[[Franz Werfel Human Rights Award]]''&lt;ref name=award&gt;Centre Against Expulsions, foundation website, "[[Franz Werfel Human Rights Award|Franz-Werfel-Human Rights Award]]" [http://www.z-g-v.de/english/aktuelles/?id=45/]&lt;/ref&gt; to people who "sharpen the sense of responsibility through their actions is one of the foundation's tasks".&lt;ref name=tasks /&gt;

=="Foundation Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation"==

On 11 November 2005, the largest German political parties [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] signed a coalition. One stated goal of the coalition is the establishment of a centre termed "Visible Sign" ({{lang-de|Sichtbares Zeichen}}).&lt;ref name=govpressrelease&gt;German Federal Government, Appointee for Culture and Media, center conception, press release 19 March 2008 [http://www.bundesregierung.de/nsc_true/Content/DE/__Anlagen/BKM/2008-04-09-sichtbares-zeichen-konzeption-barrierefrei,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/2008-04-09-sichtbares-zeichen-konzeption-barrierefrei]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2008 the German federal government passed a law calling for the establishment of a center against expulsions in the ''Deutschlandhaus'' building of the [[Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof|Anhalter Bahnhof]] site in [[Berlin]]-[[Kreuzberg]].&lt;ref name=pr3sept08&gt;German Federal Government, press release, 3 September 2008 [http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BPA/2008/09/2008-09-03-pm-stiftung-flucht-vertreibung.html] (including link to the law (pdf file)&lt;/ref&gt; The law passed the [[Bundestag|German parliament]] and was enacted on 29 December 2008.&lt;ref name=DHMlaw&gt;full text of German law to establish a foundation "German Historical Museum": Gesetz zur Errichtung einer Stiftung „Deutsches Historisches Museum“ (DHMG) vom 21.

The United Nations' first [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|High Commissioner for Human Rights]] Dr. [[José Ayala Lasso]], German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/meldung96654.html tagesschau:Merkel supports center against expulsions in Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel literature laureate]] and Holocaust survivor [[Imre Kertész]], [[Joachim Gauck]], [[Milan Horáček]], former [[Austria]]n crown prince [[Otto von Habsburg]], and historians such as [[Guido Knopp]], Hungarian novelist [[György Konrád]], and [[Christian Tomuschat]], have also voiced their support for the centre.

==Criticism==

In a petition initiated by Hans Henning Hahn, Eva Hahn, Alexandra Kurth, Samuel Salzborn and Tobias Weger in 2003, signed by several hundred people, primarily German, Czech, and Polish historians, opponents of the proposed form of Centre expressed concerns the centre would "establish and popularize a one-sided image of the past, without historical context", and see the dangers of "de-contexualizing the past" and "ethnification of social conflicts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bohemistik.de/zentrumgb.html For a critical and enlightened debate about the past]&lt;/ref&gt; German-Jewish writer [[Ralph Giordano (writer)|Ralph Giordano]] withdrew his initial support for the same reason,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rp.pl/artykul/9102,73756_Chcialem_zmienic_pania_Steinbach_.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,4732284.html&lt;/ref&gt; but defended Steinbach against the latest personal accusations from Poland, which he called defamation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2009/02/27/1065469.html?s=1 Giordano:Erika Steinbach ist keine Revanchistin]&lt;/ref&gt; Former German Foreign minister [[Joschka Fischer]] said "This can't be a museum of German war victims. Germans can't point fingers at others".&lt;ref&gt;http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/swiat/1,34181,1642833.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism in Poland===

Critics in Poland oppose the idea of the centre claiming that it would equate German suffering with that of the Jews and Poles and will suggest a moral equivalence between the victims of war and their oppressors.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Landler, [[International Herald Tribune]], 31 August 2006, ([http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/08/30/news/poland.php Poles riled by Berlin exhibition, Germans’ expulsion after the war is its focus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marek Edelman]], the last living leader of [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], criticized the project as nationalistic, arrogant and serving to realize political ambitions of the backers of the project. According to Edelman other nations subject to German expulsions didn't establish any comparable monuments, even as they faced a harsher fate than Germans.&lt;ref name="tygodnik2003-2007.onet.pl"&gt;http://tygodnik2003-2007.onet.pl/1544,5549,1131042,1,tematy.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tygodnik2003-2007.onet.pl" /&gt;

The Polish government opposes the involvement of [[Erika Steinbach]] in any issues related to Polish-German history and at the same time supports an international net of centers dedicated to remembrance of totalitarian regimes and their victims called "European Network Remembrance and Solidarity".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7559">The '''Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders''' ('''CCMD'''; {{zh|c=中国精神疾病分类方案与诊断标准}}), published by the [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]] (CSP), is a [[Medical guideline|clinical guide]] used in [[China]] for the diagnosis of [[mental disorder]]s. It is currently on a third version, the '''CCMD-3''', written in Chinese and English. It is intentionally similar in structure and categorisation to the [[ICD]] and [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], the two most well-known diagnostic manuals, though includes some variations on their main diagnoses and around 40 culturally related diagnoses.

== History ==
The first published Chinese psychiatric classificatory scheme appeared in 1979. A revised classification system, the CCMD-1, was made available in 1981 and further modified in 1984 (CCMD-2-R). The CCMD-3 was published in 2001.

Many Chinese psychiatrists believed the CCMD had special advantages over other manuals, such as simplicity, stability, the inclusion of culture-distinctive categories, and the exclusion of certain Western diagnostic categories. The Chinese translation of the [[ICD-10]] was seen as linguistically complicated, containing very long sentences and awkward terms and syntax (Lee, 2001).

== Diagnostic categories ==

The diagnosis of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] is included in the CCMD, with many similar criteria to the ICD or DSM, with the core having been translated as 'low spirits'. However, [[Neurasthenia]] is a more central diagnosis. Although also found in the ICD, its diagnosis takes a particular form in China, called 'shenjing shuairuo', which emphasizes [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] (bodily) complaints as well as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] or depressed feelings. Neurasthenia is a less stigmatizing diagnosis than depression in China, being conceptually distinct from psychiatric labels, and is said to fit well with a tendency to express emotional issues in somatic terms. The concept of neurasthenia as a [[nervous system disorder]] is also said to fit well with the traditional Chinese [[epistemology]] of disease causation on the basis of disharmony of [[vital organ]]s and imbalance of [[qi]].

The diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] is included in the CCMD. It is applied quite readily and broadly in Chinese psychiatry.

Some of the wordings of the diagnosis are different, for example rather than [[borderline personality disorder]] as in the DSM, or [[emotionally unstable personality disorder]] (borderline type) as in the ICD, the CCMD has [[impulsive personality disorder]].

Diagnoses that are more specific to Chinese or Asian culture, though they may also be outlined in the ICD (or DSM glossary section), include:

*'''[[Koro (medicine)|Koro]]''' or '''Genital retraction syndrome''': excessive fear of the [[genitals]] (and also breasts in women) shrinking or drawing back into the body.
*'''[[Zou huo ru mo (medicine)|Zou huo ru mo]]''' ({{lang|zh|走火入魔}}) or '''qigong deviation''' ({{lang|zh|氣功偏差}}): perception of uncontrolled flow of [[qi]] in the body.
*Mental disorders due to [[superstition]] or [[witchcraft]]. 
*Travelling [[psychosis]]

The CCMD-3 lists several "disorders of sexual preference" including [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation|ego-dystonic homosexuality]], but does not recognize [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Janssen, Diederik F. | year = 2014 | title = "Paraphilia": Acultural or Anti-Anthropological? | journal = Sexual Offender Treatment | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | url = http://www.sexual-offender-treatment.org/134.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koro===
{{main|Koro (medicine)}}

[[Koro (medicine)|Koro]] or '''Genital retraction syndrome''' is a culture-specific syndrome from Southeast Asia in which the patient has an overpowering belief that the genitalia (or nipples in females) is shrinking and will shortly disappear. In China, it is known as shuk yang, shook yong, and suo yang (simplified Chinese: 缩阳; traditional Chinese: 縮陽).  This has been associated with cultures placing a heavy emphasis on balance, or on [[fertility]] and [[reproduction]].

===Zou huo ru mo===
{{main|Zou huo ru mo (medicine)}}

'''[[Zou huo ru mo (medicine)|Zou huo ru mo]]''' ({{lang|zh|走火入魔}}) or "qigong deviation" ({{lang|zh|氣功偏差}}) is a mental condition characterized by the perception that there is uncontrolled flow of [[qi]] in the body.  Other complaints include localized pains, headache, insomnia, and uncontrolled spontaneous movements.&lt;ref name=Nancy3 &gt;{{cite book|last= Chen |first=Nancy N. | year=2003|date= |title= Breathing spaces: qigong, psychiatry, and healing in China |publisher= Columbia University Press  |isbn=0-231-12804-5 | chapter=Chapter 4.

A '''city directory''' is a listing of residents, streets,  businesses, organizations or institutions, giving their location in a [[city]].  It may be arranged alphabetically or geographically or in other ways.  Antedating [[telephone directories]], they were in use for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oberlinheritagecenter.org/researchlearn/directories|title=City Directories|website=www.oberlinheritagecenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many older directories have been digitized and are available on the open web and through subscription databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276753&amp;p=1845804|title=Research Guides: New York City: City Directories|last=Moazeni|first=Sarah|website=guides.nyu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Email archiving''' is the act of preserving and making searchable all email to/from an individual. Email archiving solutions capture email content either directly from the email application itself or during transport. The messages are typically then stored on magnetic disk storage and indexed to simplify future searches. In addition to simply accumulating email messages, these applications index and provide quick, searchable access to archived messages independent of the users of the system using a couple of different technical methods of implementation. The reasons a company may opt to implement an email archiving solution include protection of mission critical data, to meet retention and supervision requirements of applicable regulations, and for e-discovery purposes. It is predicted that the [[email]] archiving market will grow from nearly $2.1 billion in 2009 to over $5.1 billion in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2566994/ The Radicati Group, Inc. Releases "E-Mail Archiving Market, 2009-2013" Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Email archiving is an automated process for preserving and protecting all inbound and outbound email messages (as well as attachments and metadata) so they can be accessed at a later date should the need arise.  The benefits of email archiving include the recovery of lost or accidentally deleted emails, accelerated audit response, preservation of the intellectual property contained in business email and its attachments and "eDiscovery" in the case of litigation or internal investigations (what happened when, who said what).

==Overview==
Email Archiving is the process of capturing, preserving, and making easily searchable all email traffic to and from a given individual, organization, or service. Email archiving solutions capture email content either directly from the email server itself (journaling) or during message transit. The email archive can then be stored on magnetic tape, disk arrays, or now more often than not, in the cloud.   Regardless of the location of the email archive, it gets indexed in order to speed future searches, and most archive vendors provide a search UI to simplify query construction.

In addition to email, attachments and associated [[metadata]], some email archiving applications can also archive additional aspects of a mailbox including public folders, [[.pst]] files, calendars, contacts, notes, instant messages and context.

==Objectives==
There are many motivations for enterprises or end-users to invest in an Email Archiving solution, including:
* Data Preservation
* Protection of Intellectual Property
* Regulatory compliance
* Litigation and Legal Discovery
* Email Backup and Disaster Recovery
* Messaging System &amp; Storage Optimization
* Monitoring of Internal &amp; External Email Content
* Records Management (Email Retention Policies)
* Business &amp; Email Continuity

===Regulatory compliance===
As enterprises of all sizes grow more reliant on email, the business value of that content is also growing. To protect this increasingly valuable information (''intellectual property''), numerous standards and regulations have been enacted to require records protection and retention as well as timely response to legal (discovery) and information (FOIA) requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securitiesindustry.com/supplements/19_15/21818-1.html|title=System Maintenance|work=IProduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern email archiving solutions allow companies to meet regulatory requirements or corporate policies by securing and preserving data and providing flexible data management policies to enable authorized users to enact 'legal holds', set retention and purge policies, or conduct searches across multiple mailboxes to complete various inquiries.

Some of the primary compliance requirements driving the need for secure email archiving are (''alphabetically''):

* [[Patriot Act]]

Note, that many of the compliance regulations require the preservation of "electronic business communications" which consist of not only email, but may include instant messaging, file attachments, Bloomberg Messaging, Reuters Messaging, PIN-to-PIN and SMS text messages, VoIP and other electronic messaging communications used in business.

===Litigation and legal discovery===
For [[legal discovery]], email archiving solutions will lower the overall risk of [[spoliation]] and greatly speed up electronic discovery. This is because messages are indexed, audit trails are provided, messages are deduplicated, and legal hold/preservation can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;The Sedona Canada Principles: Addressing Electronic Discovery, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  For litigation support, email can be retrieved quickly and a history of the email exists to prove its authenticity for chain of custody.  For compliance support, email records are stored in the archive according to administrator defined retention policies.  When retention periods expire, email is automatically deleted by the archiving application. In order to be compliant, an organization can intentionally destroy email messages, so long as (1) the destruction is done pursuant to a stated company policy and (2) the destruction stops immediately if an incident occurs which could give rise to a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kest|first=Kristopher|title=Are You Allowed to Intentionally Destroy Emails? Re: Privacy in the Workplace|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/are-you-allowed-to-intentionally-destroy-emails-re-privacy-workplace|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=April 12, 2013|author2=Drew Sorrell|author3=Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor &amp; Reed, P.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an organization has multiple separate applications, for example for e-discovery, records information management, and email archiving, each application may have a separate database and it becomes difficult to de-duplicate messages and ensure that a single retention policy is being applied. From a legal point of view, this is important because once retention periods have expired the message should be purged from the archive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usdatavault.com/library/email_archiving_best_practices.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Messages that are not purged are still discoverable, should litigation arise at a later date. As such, without a unified archive it is difficult to ensure one single retention policy. This problem is magnified for large organizations that manage tens of millions of emails per day.

Without email archiving, email likely exists on some combination of backup tapes and on [[end users]]’ local workstations.  If a specific email needs to be found for an internal investigation or in response to litigation, it can take weeks to find and costs a great deal.  With today’s legal discovery rules (see FRCP: https://web.archive.org/web/20141021110256/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/EDiscovery_w_Notes.pdf) and compliance legislations, it has become necessary for IT departments to centrally manage and archive their organization’s email, so email can be searched and found in minutes; not days or weeks.

===Email backup and disaster recovery===
Email is the lifeblood of many modern businesses, and enterprises today depend more on reliable email service. Virtually all enterprises implement a messaging infrastructure to connect workers and enable business processes.  In the [[e-commerce]] arena, employees may require access to email to close sales and manage accounts. These employees, plus many others, may choose to keep their emails indefinitely, but some organizations may mandate that emails more than 90 days old be deleted. Setting these kinds of retention policies deserves careful consideration as a single email could help a company win a lawsuit or avoid litigation altogether.  Email archiving can also be used for business continuity at the individual employee level. When one employee quits, his/her replacement can be given access to the departed employee's archived messages in order to preserve correspondence records, and enable accelerated on-boarding.

As part of a comprehensive [[disaster recovery plan]], an email archive can be instrumental in an organization's effort to "get back to business". An offsite, online archive means that secondary facilities can spin up messaging servers and quickly get access to the last mails sent/received as well as all historical messaging data.  Offsite archives can take the form of disk farms (SANs) in distant DR facilities or email archives stored in public/private cloud environments.  Although email archiving products do capture and copy all messages, they are not mirrored copies of the messaging server itself, and therefore cannot help recreate user accounts/groups in the event of a disaster.

===Messaging system &amp; storage optimization===
Every email message takes up space on an email system's hard drive or some other permanent storage device (e.g. [[Network Attached Storage]], [[Storage Area Network]], etc.). As the number of these messages increase, simple operations such as retrieving, searching, indexing, backup, etc. utilize more information system resources. At some point older data must be removed from the production email system so that they can maintain a level of performance for their primary use, exchange of email messages. Email archiving solutions improve email server performance and storage efficiency by removing email and attachments from the messaging server based on administrator defined policies.  Archived email and attachments remain accessible to end users via the existing email client applications.

'''''Fraser v Children's Court, Pretoria North and Others''''' is a 1997 judgment of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]] which held that, in certain circumstances, the consent of the father is required before a child born [[Legitimacy (family law)|out of wedlock]] may be [[adoption|adopted]]. In a unanimous decision, the court held that the provisions of the [[Child Care Act, 1983]], which required only the mother's consent, were unconstitutional, but suspended its order for two years so that [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] could amend the law accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1997/1media.pdf |title=Media Summary: Fraser v Children's Court, Pretoria North and Others |publisher=Constitutional Court |date=5 February 1997 |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts ==
During the period for which the applicant, Fraser, and second respondent, Naude, lived together, the latter became pregnant. She decided to give the child up for adoption. The applicant did not agree with this decision and so launched series of unsuccessful applications to prevent the child being given up for adoption, and to be given custody of his child. He was denied this opportunity, as section 18(4)(d) of the Child Care Act only required the consent of the mother to give up children born out of wedlock for adoption.

== Judgment ==
The court declared this to be unconstitutional, as it discriminated against fathers of children born out of wedlock on the basis of their gender. The Constitutional Court ordered Parliament to bring this provision of the Child Care Act in line with the Constitution within two years.

'''''History by Contract''''' is a book by early aviation researchers Major William J. O'Dwyer, [[U.S. Air Force Reserve]] (ret.) and Stella Randolph about aviation pioneer [[Gustave Whitehead]]. The book focuses on an agreement between the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the estate of [[Orville Wright]], which stipulates that the Smithsonian, as a condition of owning and displaying the 1903 [[Wright Flyer]], must recognize and label it as the first heavier-than-air machine to make a manned, powered, controlled and sustained flight.

The authors of the book offer evidence which they assert shows that the Smithsonian deliberately ignored Whitehead's aeronautical work in order not to violate the agreement with the Wright estate.
The net result, they allege, made Whitehead a virtual nonentity in aviation history."&lt;ref name="Delear"&gt;Delear, Frank. [http://www.historynet.com/gustave-whitehead-and-the-first-flight-controversy.htm " Gustave Whitehead and the First-Flight Controversy."] ''History Net,'' June 12, 2006.  (originally published in ''Aviation History'', March 1996.) Retrieved: July, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They and other researchers argue that Whitehead made the first successful airplane flight in August 1901, predating the Wright brothers by more than two years. ''History By Contract'' reviews evidence and material available in two earlier books about Whitehead by Randolph and added statements and affidavits from self-described witnesses to Whitehead flights.&lt;ref&gt;History by Contract, O'Dwyer and Randolph (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Dwyer alleged that secrecy and denial by the Smithsonian kept the agreement with the Wright estate from public knowledge for years. He obtained a copy of the agreement in 1976 with help of then-Senator [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.|Lowell Weicker]].&lt;ref&gt;History by Contract", O'Dwyer and Randolph (1978) p. 140-240&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian has said the agreement was put in place not to hide Whitehead's aviation experiments, but to prevent re-occurrence of a mistaken emphasis by the Smithsonian on the 1903 [[Langley Aerodrome]], which the Institution wrongly identified for years as the first airplane "capable" of flight, even though it had not actually flown when Langley's workers tested it.&lt;ref name=FoxNews2013&gt;Smithsonian releases Wright brothers contract detailing 'first in flight' claims http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/04/01/contract-forcing-smithsonian-to-call-wright-bros-first-in-flight/&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian based its claim on test flights of the heavily modified Aerodrome in 1914 by [[Glenn Curtiss]] and his team.

==The title's meaning==
[[Image:Th Smithsonian contract.jpg|thumb|right|Excerpt of the Agreement seen in its original form]]
The "contract" of the book title refers to the agreement between the estate of Orville Wright and the United States, represented by the Smithsonian Institution. The agreement, dated 23 November 1948, stipulated:&lt;ref name="WBcontract"&gt;[http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/History_of_the_Airplane/Who_Was_First/Smithsonian_Contract/Smithsonian_Contract.htm  The Smithsonian Contract] Wright-Brothers.org.

* The Estate of Orville Wright agrees to sell the 1903 Wright Flyer to the United States (represented by the Smithsonian) for $1.
* In return, the United States guarantees the aircraft to be displayed prominently in the nation's capital and to be identified as the first heavier-than-air flying machine in which men made a controlled and powered flight.
* The airplane is to be valued at $1 for tax purposes.
* Should the United States not prominently display the airplane, display it without the agreed-upon identification, or identify another airplane as being capable of controlled and powered manned flight before December 17, 1903, the ownership of the airplane reverts to the Estate.
* Additionally, if the airplane is valued at more than $1 and the Estate assessed for taxes, the United States will pay those taxes. If it does not, the title reverts.
* If the United States forfeits its title to the airplane for any of these reasons, it has five years to comply with the agreement to regain title.
* The required labeling: There shall at all times be prominently displayed with said Aeroplane a label in the following form and language:

The second and third flights were a little longer, and the fourth lasted 59 seconds covering a distance of 852 feet over the ground against a 20 mile wind."
Wilbur and Orville Wright&lt;br&gt;
(From ''Century Magazine'', Vol. 76 September 1908, p.&amp;nbsp;649)

==Key provisions==
The most controversial clause in the agreement is Paragraph 2(d):
"Neither the Smithsonian Institution or its successors nor any museum or other agency, bureau or facilities, administered for the United States of America by the Smithsonian Institution or its successors, shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the Wright Aeroplane of 1903, claiming In effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gustave-whitehead.com/history-of-whitehead-critics/contract-signed-1948-11-23-by-smithsonian-and-wright-heirs/&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Dwyer and Randolph asserted this clause presents a strong incentive to keep the Smithsonian from officially recognizing any manned, powered, controlled airplane flight before that of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903.

==History behind the agreement==
The agreement ended a bitter feud that existed between Orville Wright and the Smithsonian over credit for developing the first man-carrying airplane to achieve controlled, sustained powered flight. After short test flights of the heavily modified [[Langley Aerodrome]] by [[Glenn Curtiss]] in 1914, the Smithsonian claimed that the Aerodrome, created by former Smithsonian Secretary [[Samuel Langley]] and unsuccessfully tested shortly before the 1903 Kitty Hawk flights, was "the first man-carrying airplane in the history of the world capable of sustained free flight," according to the plaque displayed with the Aerodrome. Orville believed that claim "perverted" the history of flying machines and refused to donate the [[Wright Flyer|1903 Kitty Hawk Flyer]] to the Smithsonian, loaning it instead to the [[Science Museum, London]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1953/1953%20-%201634.PDF "Wright Flyer" p788] ''Flight'' 11 December 1953&lt;/ref&gt; When the Smithsonian recanted its claim in 1942, Orville agreed to have the Flyer returned to the United States. The airplane remained in protective storage in Britain during World War II and was not returned to the U.S. until 1948, when the agreement was signed by Orville Wright's executors following his death.&lt;ref&gt;"The Bishop's Boys, Tom Crouch, pps.525-527, WW Norton &amp; Co., 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the agreement contend that it is a conflict of interest that continues to interfere with the Smithsonian's willingness to research and recognize anyone who might have made successful powered flights before December 17, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;'The Who Flew First' Debate, O'Dwyer, Flight Journal (1998) http://cdn6.flightjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/whitehead.pdf?83a8bd&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy reignited in 2013 when ''[[Jane's All the World's Aircraft]]'' editorialized that Whitehead, not the Wright brothers, was first to make a successful airplane flight. A month later, however, Jane's stated that the editorial reflected the opinion of the editorialist and not Jane's.&lt;ref name="aviationheritagearea 2015-04-17"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aviationheritagearea.org/janes-backs-off-gustave-whitehead-claim/ |title=Jane's backs off Gustave Whitehead claim |work=National Aviation Heritage Area |date=2015-04-17 |accessdate=2016-03-20 |quote=The publisher of a column that prompted Connecticut to declare itself "first in flight" has distanced itself from the claim in a statement it issued in response to a query by the New York Times. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to resulting negative publicity about the agreement, [[National Air and Space Museum]] senior curator Tom Crouch issued a statement, which said: "The contract remains in force today, a healthy reminder of a less than exemplary moment in Smithsonian history. Over the years individuals who argue for other claimants to the honor of having made the first flight have claimed that the contract is secret. It is not. I have sent many copies upon request. Critics have also charged that no Smithsonian staff member would ever be willing to entertain such a possibility and risk losing a national treasure. I can only hope that, should persuasive evidence
for a prior flight be presented, my colleagues and I would have the courage and the honesty to admit the new evidence and risk the loss of the Wright Flyer."&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Institution Press Release"&gt;http://newsdesk.si.edu/sites/default/files/Wright-Contract.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{EnigmaSeries}}
'''Hut 8''' was a section in the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]] (the British [[World War II]] [[codebreaking]] station) tasked with solving German naval ([[Kriegsmarine]]) [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages.  The section was led initially by [[Alan Turing]].  He was succeeded in November 1942 by his deputy, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]].  Patrick Mahon succeeded Alexander in September 1944.&lt;ref name ="codebreakers.hut8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Noskwith|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hut 8 was partnered with [[Hut 4]], which handled the translation and intelligence analysis of the raw decrypts provided by Hut 8.

Located initially in one of the original single-story wooden huts, the name "Hut 8" was retained when Huts 3, 6 &amp; 8 moved to a new brick building, Block D, in February 1943.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Days: Code-breaking in Bletchley Park'' by [[Asa Briggs]] (2011, Frontline Books, London) p 70 {{ISBN|978-1-84832-615-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2005, the first Hut 8 was restored to its wartime condition, and it now houses the "HMS Petard Exhibition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Operation==
In 1940, a few breaks were made into the naval "Dolphin" code, but [[Luftwaffe]] messages were the first to be read in quantity.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Days: Code-breaking in Bletchley Park'' by [[Asa Briggs]] (2011, Frontline Books, London) p 75 {{ISBN|978-1-84832-615-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed (see {{format link|Battle of the Atlantic#Enigma}}) before they could be broken. In February 1942, the German navy introduced "Triton", a version of Enigma with a fourth rotor for messages to and from Atlantic U-boats; these became unreadable for a period of ten months during a crucial period (see [[Battle of the Atlantic#Enigma in 1942|Enigma in 1942]]).

Britain produced modified [[bombe]]s, but it was the success of the [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|US Navy bombe]] that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war.{{Citation needed|reason=Unusual that this "fact" has never been mentioned in any documentary before if it is true|date=September 2013}} Messages were sent to and from across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.

==Personnel==
In addition to the [[cryptanalysts]], around 130 women worked in Hut 8 and provided essential clerical support including punching holes into the [[Banburismus|Banbury sheets]].  Hut 8 relied on [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wrens]] to run the bombes housed elsewhere at Bletchley.&lt;ref name ="codebreakers.hut8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Noskwith|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''e-mail letter''' (also '''L-mail''' and '''letter mail''') is a [[letter (message)|letter]] which sent as an [[email]] using a computer then printed out and delivered as a traditional (physical) letter. It is a communication means between the [[Virtuality|virtual]] [[Internet-related prefixes|cyber]]- and the material real world. The [[printer (publisher)|printer]] or [[mail transfer agent]] prints the [[electronic mail]] on paper, the [[mail transport agent]] packs it into an [[envelope]] and the [[mail delivery agent]] or [[postman]] delivers it to the receiver's mailbox. Generally there is a [[fee]] for this service; however very small amounts and single email letters may be free of charge depending on the [[service provider]] and generally fees are much lower than directly sending mail or using a franking machine.

There are also reverse systems, where handwritten letters can be delivered as email. This mail scanning service, sometimes called '''letter email''', is increasingly popular with businesses and individuals who wish to access their mail from another country. However, special care must be taken to inspect local laws and the service provider's scanning practices to ensure that they are not reading the mail or acting on behalf of the client from a legal standpoint.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

{{IPA notice|lang=no}}The '''ichthys''' or '''ichthus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|k|θ|ə|s}}&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=third|year=2007|article=ichthus}}&lt;/ref&gt;), from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''ikhthýs'' ({{lang|grc|[[Wiktionary:ἰχθύς|ἰχθύς]]}} 1st cent. AD [[Koine Greek]] {{IPA|[ikʰˈtʰys]}}, "[[fish]]") is a [[symbol]] consisting of two intersecting arcs, the ends of the right side extending beyond the meeting point so as to resemble the profile of a fish. The symbol was adopted by [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] as a secret symbol. It is now known colloquially as the "'''sign of the fish'''" or the "'''Jesus fish'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-goldberg1apr01,0,5893988.column|title=Evolution of religious bigotry|author=Los Angeles Times|date=1 April 2008|work=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Ephesus IchthysCrop.jpg|thumb|right|375px|An early circular ichthys symbol, created by combining the Greek letters ΙΧΘΥΣ, [[Ephesus]].]]
The first appearances of the ichthys symbol in [[Christian art]] and literature date to the 2nd century AD. The symbol's use among Christians had become popular by the late 2nd century, and its use spread widely in the 3rd and 4th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Rasimus, T. (2011). "Revisiting the Ichthys: A Suggestion Concerning the Origins of Christological Fish Symbolism". Pp 327-348 in '' Mystery and Secrecy in the Nag Hammadi Collection and Other Ancient Literature: Ideas and Practices.'' Biblical Studies, Ancient Near East and Early Christianity E-Books Online, Collection 2012, '''76'''.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbolism of the fish itself may have its origins in pre-Christian religious imagery. For example, [[Orpheus]] was described as a "fisher of men" as early as the 3rd or fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux, M. (2007). The survival of the Greek gods in early Christianity. ''[[Journal for Semitics]]'', '''16'''(2): 483-497.&lt;/ref&gt; The fish was used as a symbol in a number of other near-eastern religions as well, often as a sacred (or taboo) food. The fish was sacred to the goddess [[Atargatis]], for example, who was said to cause tumors in those who ate them. Fish were only allowed to be eaten by priests during rituals devoted to Atargatis, in the belief that they represented her body.&lt;ref name=paganismtochristianity/&gt; Despite the thematic similarities of these various sacred fish, some scholars have argued that there is no direct link between them and the Christian symbol or practice of the Eucharist; instead, the Christian usage was probably simply part of a larger, popular religious motif of the time.&lt;ref name=paganismtochristianity&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyde|first=Walter Woodburn|date=2008|orig-year=1946|title=Paganism to Christianity in the Roman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H_VLAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Paganism+to+Christianity+in+the+Roman+Empire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjErtWtwYDbAhXC7oMKHYhmC2AQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Atargatis&amp;f=false|location=Eugene, Oregon|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-60608-349-9|pages=57–58|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[early Church]], the Ichthys symbol held "the most sacred significance", and Christians used it to recognize churches and other believers through this symbol because they were [[Anti-Christian policies in the Roman Empire|persecuted by the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="JowettO'Donnell2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jowett|first1=Garth S.|last2=O'Donnell|first2=Victoria|title=Propaganda &amp; Persuasion|date=11 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781483323527|page=86|quote=Initially used as a secret sign during the time when Christians were persecuted by the Roman authorities, the fish symolized the mission of the group it represented and did so simply and effectively.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ichthys symbol is also a reference to "the [[Holy Eucharist]], with which the [[Feeding the multitude|miracle of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes]] had such intimate connection both in point of time and significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Irish Monthly, Volume 12|year=1884|page=89|quote=It must, however, be born in mind that the "fish," specially in those early days, was a Christian symbol of the most sacred significance. The name ''ichthus'', which is the Greek word for fish, and the fish itself are of constant recurrence amongst the sacred symbols of the early Christians in the Catacombs. The letters of the Greek word formed the initial letters of this sentence: "Jesus Christ, of God the Son, our Saviour." The heavenly Ichthus, then, was Jesus Christ, and we are the smaller fishes, born in the waters of baptism, as Tertullian says, caught in the net of salvation, and thus made members of the heavenly kingdom. There is a reference to the same symbol to the Holy Eucharist, with which the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes had such intimate connection both in point of time and significance. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While many Christians hang a [[cross necklace]] or [[rosary]] inside their vehicles, "the fish sticker on the car is a more conscious symbol of a [[evangelism|witnessing]] Christian—significantly, unlike the former, it is on the outside of the car for everyone to see".&lt;ref name="Garbowski2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garbowski|first=Christopher|title=Religious Life in Poland: History, Diversity and Modern Issues|date=27 January 2014|publisher=McFarland|language=English|isbn=9780786475896|page=222|quote=If folk religion is demonstrated by drivers with rosaries hanging from rearview mirrors or St. Christopher figures on the dashboard, still common enough in Poland, the fish sticker on the car is a more conscious symbol of a witnessing Christian--significantly, unlike the former, it is on the outside of the car for everyone to see. This stops some interested Catholics from placing the symbol on their cars, since they feel might not live up to the good driving practices that should accompany its presence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Gospels==

Fish are mentioned and given symbolic meaning several times in the Gospels. Several of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]' 12 [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] were fishermen. He commissions them with the words "[[Mark 1#Calling of the four disciples|I will make you fishers of men]]". (Mark 1: 16-18)

Having been [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]], Jesus is offered some grilled fish in [[Luke 24]]:41-43.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|24:41-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Feeding the multitude|feeding of the five thousand]], a boy is brought to Jesus with "five small loaves and two fish". The question is asked, "But what are they, among so many?" Jesus multiplies the loaves and fish to feed the multitude. In [[Matthew 13]]:47-50, the [[Parable of Drawing in the Net]], Jesus compares the angels separating the righteous from the wicked at the end of this world to fishers sorting out their catch, keeping the good fish and throwing the bad fish away.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|13:47-50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[John 21]]:11, it is related that the disciples fished all night but caught nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|21:11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus instructed them to cast the nets on the other side of the boat, and [[Miraculous catch of fish|they drew in 153 fish]]. In [[Matthew 17]]:24-27, upon being asked if his Teacher pays the temple (or two-drachma) tax, Simon Peter answers yes. Christ tells Peter to go to the water and cast a line, saying that a coin sufficient for both of them will be found in the fish's mouth. Peter does this and finds the coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|17:24-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fish is also used by Jesus to describe "the Sign of Jonah". ([[Matthew 12]]:38-45) This is symbolic of Jesus's resurrection, upon which the entire Christian faith is based. ([[1 Corinthians 15]]:1-58)

==Early church==

According to tradition, ancient Christians, during their persecution by the Roman Empire in the first few centuries after Christ, used the fish symbol to mark meeting places and tombs, or to distinguish friends from foes:

{{Quote|According to one ancient story, when a Christian met a stranger in the road, the Christian sometimes drew one arc of the simple fish outline in the dirt. If the stranger drew the other arc, both believers knew they were in good company. Current bumper-sticker and business-card uses of the fish hearken back to this practice.|''Christianity Today'', Elesha Coffman, "Ask The Expert"&lt;ref name="CT_ask_the_expert"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/asktheexpert/oct26.html| author=Elesha Coffman| title=What is the origin of the Christian fish symbol?| publisher=christianitytoday.com| date=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are several other hypotheses as to why the fish was chosen. Some sources indicate that the earliest literary references came from the recommendation of [[Clement of Alexandria]] to his readers (Paedagogus, III, xi) to engrave their seals with the dove or fish. However, it can be inferred from Roman monumental sources such as the Cappella Greca and the Sacrament Chapels of the catacomb of [[St. Callistus]] that the fish symbol was known to Christians much earlier.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Jesus Fish variation promoting Evolutionary Creation - Theistic Evolution.jpg|thumb|upright|Jesus Fish on a car, promoting [[evolutionary creation]]. Some other Jesus fish emblems oppose or promote evolution, or feature [[Cthulhu]] to parody religious belief.]]

In the 1970s the "Jesus Fish" started to be used as an icon of [[History of modern Christianity|modern Christianity]]. In 1973 the symbol and message was taken to the [[Aquarius Festival|Aquarius Rock Festival]] in [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]], [[Christianity in Australia|Australia]]. Today, it can be seen as a decal or emblem on the rear of automobiles or as pendants or necklaces as a sign that the owner is a Christian. Versions of this include an Ichthys with "Jesus" or "ΙΧΘΥΣ" in the centre, or simply the Ichthys outline by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_symb.htm|work=religioustolerance.org|accessdate=22 April 2014|title=Christian symbols: Fish (Ichthus), cross and crucifix |quote=The body of the symbol may be empty, or may contain a name ('Jesus' or 'ICTUS').}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music festival===

[[Ichthus Music Festival]] is an annual large outdoor [[Christian music]] Festival held in mid-June in [[Wilmore, Kentucky]]. Ichthus Festival is  the oldest Christian music festival in the [[Christianity in the United States|United States]] starting in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0w7vTv6hzIMC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=ichthus+christian+music+festival&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oTf0y7CPi1&amp;sig=D5FLBuNRRDLUKKPCIk6Qik55D5s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gkDuSrCMDdSztgf3qtk6&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ichthus%20christian%20music%20festival&amp;f=false See, Robison, Greg, ''Christian Rock Festivals''], (New York: The Rosen Publishing Co., 2009), p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''imagined contact hypothesis''' is an extension of the [[contact hypothesis]], a theoretical proposition centred on the psychology of [[prejudice]] and prejudice reduction. It was originally developed by Richard J. Crisp and Rhiannon N. Turner and proposes that the mental simulation, or [[imagining]], of a positive social interaction with an [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] member can lead to increased positive [[Propositional attitude|attitudes]], greater desire for [[social relation|social contact]], and improved [[group dynamics]].&lt;ref name="Crisp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crisp|first=R.

==Theoretical background==

The imagined contact hypothesis is derived from [[Gordon Allport]]'s [[contact hypothesis]], which states that contact between groups is an effective means of reducing prejudice and intergroup conflict.&lt;ref name="Allport"&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). ''The Nature of Prejudice''. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Books&lt;/ref&gt;  In Allport's seminal work ''The Nature of Prejudice'' he suggested that contact at the "fantasy level"&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). ''The Nature of Prejudice''. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Books. p.453&lt;/ref&gt; may also be an effective means of reducing prejudice.  Crisp and Turner cite Allport's work as a strong influence on their imagined contact hypothesis.&lt;ref name="AdvancesBook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crisp |first1=Richard J. |last2=Turner |first2=Rhiannon N. |editor-last=Olson |editor-first=James M.|editor-last2=Zanna|editor-first2=Mark P.|title=Advances in Social Psychology|publisher=Academic Press|date=2012|pages=125–182 |chapter=The Imagined Contact Hypothesis |isbn=978-0-12-394281-4 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the imagined contact hypothesis is linked to the extended contact hypothesis which states intergroup attitudes may be improved simply by learning that other ingroup members have outgroup friends.&lt;ref name="Wilder"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=S.C.|author2=Aron, A.|author3=McLaughlin-Volpe, T.|author4=Ropp, S.A.|title=The extended contact effect: Knowledge of cross-group friendships and prejudice|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|year=1997|volume=73|pages=73–90|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.1.73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imagined contact hypothesis is also influenced by [[cognitive psychology]], particularly work on [[mental imagery]] which suggesting that imagining scenarios can induce [[emotion]] and [[motivation]] similar to real-life&lt;ref name="Dadds"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dadds|first=M.R.|author2=Bovbjerg, D.H.|author3=Redd, W.H.|author4=Cutmore, T.R.|title=Imagery in human classical conditioning|journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]]|year=1997|volume=122|pages=89–103|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.122.1.89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is important to directing [[goal]] related behavior.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|author2=Pham, L.B.|author3=Rivkin, I.D.|author4=Armor, D.A.|title=Harnessing the imagination: Mental simulation, self-regulation, and coping|journal=[[The American Psychologist]]|year=1998|volume=53|pages=429–439|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.53.4.429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research from [[stereotypes]] also indicates that imagining a counter-stereotypical person, such as an assertive woman, reduces activation of [[implicit stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blair|first=I.V.|author2=Ma, J.E.|author3=Lenton, A.P.|title=Imagining stereotypes away: The moderation of implicit stereotypes through mental imagery|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|year=2001|volume=81|pages=828–841|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.828}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This research all supports the core proposition of the imagined contact hypothesis, that imaging an interaction with an outgroup member can improve attitudes and behaviors towards the outgroup as a whole.&lt;ref name="CrispCompass"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crisp|first=R.J.|author2=Stathi, S.|author3=Turner, R.N.|author4=Husnu, S|title=Imagined intergroup contact: Theory, paradigm, and practice|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|year=2008|volume=2|pages=1–18|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2008.00155.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The imagined contact hypothesis proposes that imaging a positive social interaction with an outgroup member, will lead to a variety of beneficial outcomes, namely an increase in positive attitudes towards the outgroup and greater intention to engage with outgroup members.&lt;ref name=AdvancesBook /&gt;  This paradigm is viewed as particularly useful for improving intergroup relations when intergroup contact may be difficult or impossible (e.g., war or settings where few minorities exist).&lt;ref name=CrispCompass /&gt;  Notably, the imagined contact hypothesis is not meant to replace intergroup contact but instead be a first step to establishing better relations.&lt;ref name=CrispCompass /&gt; Overall, a meta-analysis of over 70 studies demonstrated a moderate [[effect size]] (d+ = 0.35) for imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member improving outcomes across attitudes, emotions (i.e., feelings of anxiety), behaviors (i.e., self-disclosure to outgroup members, number of outgroup friends) and intentions (i.e., future desire to contact or engage with outgroup members).&lt;ref name="Miles, 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = E. | last2 = Crisp | first2 = R. J. | year = 2014 | title = A meta-analytic test of the imagined contact hypothesis | url = | journal = Group Processes and Intergroup Relations | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 3–26 | doi=10.1177/1368430213510573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general experimental paradigm used to test the effects of the imagined contact hypothesis utilizes two sets of instructions.  In the basic paradigm, participants are placed via [[random assignment]] in either a control or an experimental condition.  In the control condition participants are instructed:

{{indent|5}}"''We would like you to take a minute to imagine an outdoor scene.  Try to imagine aspects of the scene (e.g., it is a beach, a forest, are there trees, hills, what's on the horizon).''"&lt;ref name="CrispCompass6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crisp|first=R.J.|author2=Stathi, S.|author3=Turner, R.N.|author4=Husnu, S|title=Imagined intergroup contact: Theory, paradigm, and practice|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|year=2008|volume=2|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative variations include imagining positive social interactions with another non-outgroup individual.&lt;ref name="Stathi &amp; Crisp, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stath | first1 = S.I. | last2 = Crisp | first2 = R. J. | year = 2008 | title = Imagining intergroup contact promotes projection to outgroups | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 943–957 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the imagined contact condition instructions state:

{{indent|5}}"''We would like you to take a minute to imagine yourself meeting [an outgroup] stranger for the first time.  Imagine that the interaction is positive, relaxed and comfortable.''"&lt;ref name="CrispCompass5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crisp|first=R.J.|author2=Stathi, S.|author3=Turner, R.N.|author4=Husnu, S|title=Imagined intergroup contact: Theory, paradigm, and practice|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|year=2008|volume=2|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both conditions, participants are usually given a short time (one to five minutes) to imagine the scenario and then are asked to write a brief description of what they imagined in order to elaborate on the mental imagery.

For the imagined contact condition it is important that the interaction be positive and involve a social element.&lt;ref name=CrispCompass /&gt;  Indeed, if participants are not directly instructed to imagine a positive interaction there is concern that they may spontaneously imagine a negative interaction, leading to more negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=AdvancesBook /&gt;  The interaction must also involve a social element in order to create a mental script for the participant.  Indeed, research indicates that imagining contact versus simply imagining the outgroup member is important to obtain the positive benefits associated with the imagined contact hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt;

==Effects and outcomes ==

===Explicit attitudes===
In the first test of the imagined contact hypothesis researchers demonstrated that imagining a positive social interaction with an older adult led to greater desire to interact with an older versus younger adults and improved evaluations of gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=R. N.|author2=Crisp, R. J. |author3=Lambert, E. |title=Imagining intergroup contact can improve intergroup attitudes|journal=[[Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations]]|year=2007|volume=10|pages=427–441|doi=10.1177/1368430207081533|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since this initial test, the imagined contact hypothesis has been associated with improved explicit attitudes towards outgroups such as:  religious groups (i.e., Muslims),&lt;ref name="Husnu, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Husnu | first1 = S. | last2 = Crisp | first2 = R. J. | year = 2010 | title = Elaboration enhances the imagined contact effect | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 943–950 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2010.05.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; undocumented immigrants,&lt;ref name="Harwood et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harwood | first1 = J. | last2 = Paolini | first2 = S. | last3 = Joyce | first3 = N. | last4 = Rubin | first4 = M. | last5 = Arroyo | first5 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Secondary transfer effects from imagined contact: Group similarity affects the generalization gradient | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 180–189 | doi=10.1348/014466610x524263}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentally ill,&lt;ref name=Giacobbe /&gt; ethnic minorities&lt;ref name="Stathi &amp; Crisp, 2008" /&gt; and the obese.&lt;ref name="Turner2"/&gt;

===Implicit attitudes===
The imagined contact hypothesis paradigm is also effective at improving [[implicit attitudes]] towards outgroups.  For instance, Turner and Crisp had college-aged participants imagine either a positive social interaction with an older adult or imagine an outdoor scene.  They then measured participants implicit attitudes using an [[Implicit Association Test]] (IAT).  Their results showed that following an imagined interaction with an older adult, college-aged participants were faster to associate positive traits with the "old" category (e.g., stereotypically old names - Arthur, Mildred) compared to participants who imagined an outdoor scene.&lt;ref name="Turner 2010 129–142"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=R. N.|author2=Crisp, R. J.|title=Imagining intergroup contact reduces implicit prejudice|journal=[[British Journal of Social Psychology]]|year=2010|volume=49|pages=129–142|doi=10.1348/014466609X419901|pmid=19302731|issue=Pt 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This pattern of results was replicated with non-Muslim's implicit attitudes towards Muslims using the IAT.&lt;ref name="Turner 2010 129–142"/&gt;  Furthermore, the effects of imagined contact on implicit attitudes extend to school aged children, with researchers demonstrating that implicit attitudes towards immigrants improved for children following an imagined contact scenario compared to a control scenario.&lt;ref name="Vezzali et al, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vezzali | first1 = L. | last2 = Capozza | first2 = D. | last3 = Giovannini | first3 = D. | last4 = Stathi | first4 = S. | year = 2012a | title = Improving implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes using imagined contact: An experimental intervention with elementary school children | url = | journal = Group Processes and Intergroup Relations | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 203–212 | doi=10.1177/1368430211424920}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been argued that these demonstrations of implicit attitude change with the imagined contact hypothesis rule out alternative explanations such as the possibility that [[demand characteristics]] influence participants' explicit attitudes because implicit attitudes are harder to control.&lt;ref name=AdvancesBook /&gt;

===Behavioral intentions===
The effects of the imagined contact hypothesis extend beyond increasing explicit and implicit attitudes to impact behavioral intentions such as engaging with outgroup members.  Researchers showed that having non-Muslim British undergraduate students imagine contact with an outgroup Muslim lead to greater intentions (measured via a [[Likert scale]] survey) to engage with Muslims in the future, compared to a control condition.&lt;ref name="Husnu, 2010" /&gt;  This work has been replicated using a variety of outgroup targets such as ethnic minorities in [[Cyprus]],&lt;ref name=Husnu /&gt; gay men&lt;ref name=Crisp /&gt; and asylum seekers.&lt;ref name="Turner, West, Christie, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = R. N. | last2 = West | first2 = K. | last3 = Christie | first3 = Z. | year = 2013 | title = Out-group trust, intergroup anxiety, and out-group attitude as mediators of the effect of imagined intergroup contact on intergroup behavioral tendencies | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = E196–E205 | doi=10.1111/jasp.12019}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the cases described, behavioral intention to engage was measured via survey items such as how much do you want to "avoid" or "talk to" an outgroup member.  This work has also been replicated in school-aged children.&lt;ref name="Vezzali, Capozza, Stathi, &amp; Giovanni, 2012b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vezzali | first1 = L. | last2 = Capozza | first2 = D. | last3 = Giovannini | first3 = D. | last4 = Stathi | first4 = S. | year = 2012b | title = Increasing outgroup trust, reducing infrahumanization, and enhancing future contact intentions via imagined intergroup contact | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 437–440 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond simply intentions to engage, the imagined contact paradigm also influences social distancing.  For example, one study showed that undergraduate participants who first imagined a positive interaction with an obese individual subsequently positioned chairs closer together when they thought they would be interacting and discussing society's perception of obesity with an obese individual.&lt;ref name="Turner2" /&gt;

==Factors influencing effectiveness==

===Elaborated imagined contact===
Husnu and Crisp&lt;ref name="Husnu, 2010" /&gt; demonstrated that greater elaboration of the imagined social interaction improved outcomes above and beyond those associated with the traditional imagined contact hypothesis paradigm.  Specifically they found that by guiding Non-Muslim undergraduates to imagine contextual factors within the imagined interaction such as ''when'' and ''where'' the interaction took place improved future intentions to interact with Muslims over and above traditional instructions.  Additional research also indicated elaboration increases participants estimated likelihood of befriending elderly individuals.&lt;ref name="Husnu &amp; Crisp, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Husnu | first1 = S. | last2 = Crisp | first2 = R. J. | year = 2011 | title = Enhancing the imagined contact effect | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 113–116 | doi=10.1080/00224541003599043}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one of their studies Husnu and Crisp identified that the relationship between elaboration and improved outcomes was mediated by participant's vividness of the imagined scenario.&lt;ref name="Husnu, 2010" /&gt;  Specifically participants who elaborated on their imagined social interaction reported greater vividness of the social interaction, which subsequently improved outcomes.

==Typicality of the imagined individual==
Researchers have also investigated how factors about the imagined individual impact outcome measures.  Stathi, Crisp, &amp; Hogg had participants imagine either a stereotypical or non-stereotypical individual.  Specifically they asked participants to either "imagine meeting a British Muslim stranger for the first time...[who] dresses in a traditional way, avoids alcohol, reads the Koran, and prays five times a day" or "imagine meeting a British Muslim stranger...[who] dresses in "western" clothes, drinks alcohol, eats pork, and does not pray regularly".&lt;ref name="Stathi, Crisp, &amp; Hogg (2011)"&gt;. Imagining intergroup contact enables member-to-group generalization.  ''Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 15'' 275-284. p.280&lt;/ref&gt;  Their results indicated that imagining a [[stereotypical]] individual lead to greater feelings of contact-efficacy, that is how well a future interaction will go.  This finding aligns with research on intergroup relations which shows that typicality of members leads to greater generalization effects compared to atypical group members.&lt;ref name="Hewstone &amp; Brown, 1986"&gt;Hewstone, M. &amp; Brown, R. (1986). Contact is not enough: An intergroup perspective on the 'contact hypothesis'. In M. Hewstone &amp; R. Brown (Eds.), ''Contact and conflict in intergroup encounters'' (p. 1-44).  Oxford, England: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual differences===

There are many individual level differences that also moderate the effectiveness of imagined contact.  For instance, Husnu and Crisp asked participants the extent to which they have contact with British Muslims and found greater real-life contact was associated with higher intentions to engage with Muslims following an imagined contact paradigm.&lt;ref name="Husnu, 2010" /&gt; Individuals who feel greater [[intergroup anxiety]] also report more difficulty in imaging a positive social interaction with an outgroup member, however, this did not ultimately affect the quality of an interaction with an outgroup member following the imagined contact manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birtel|first1=M. D.|last2=Crisp|first2=R. J.|title=Imagining intergroup contact is more cognitively difficult for people higher in intergroup anxiety but this does not detract from its effectiveness|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|date=22 May 2012|volume=15|issue=6|pages=744–761|doi=10.1177/1368430212443867}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants' amount of ingroup identification also impacts the effectiveness of imagining outgroup contact.  Individuals who rate they are lower in their ingroup identification show stronger positive outgroup evaluations following imagining contact.&lt;ref name="Stathi &amp; Crisp, 2008" /&gt;

==Psychological processes of imagined contact==

Two key psychological processes, [[anxiety]] and [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], have been identified as potential mechanisms for why imaging outgroup contact is effective for improving intergroup relations.  Anxiety often characterizes and is engendered by intergroup encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richeson|first1=J. A.|last2=Shelton|first2=J. N.|title=When Prejudice Does Not Pay: Effects of Interracial Contact on Executive Function|journal=Psychological Science|date=1 May 2003|volume=14|issue=3|pages=287–290|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.03437}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, intergroup contact between African-Americans and European-Americans frequently produces higher levels of intergroup anxiety compared to same-race interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trawalter|first1=Sophie|last2=Adam|first2=Emma K.|last3=Chase-Lansdale|first3=P. Lindsay|last4=Richeson|first4=Jennifer A.|title=Concerns about appearing prejudiced get under the skin: Stress responses to interracial contact in the moment and across time|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=May 2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=682–693|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.12.003|pmc=3375720}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers however show that imaging a positive intergroup interaction leads to reductions in anxiety, with anxiety being a [[mediation|mediator]] between the relationship of imagined contact and improved intergroup attitudes.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt;&lt;ref name="Husnu, 2010" /&gt;

Trust is another important mediator between imagined contact and positive intergroup outcomes.  In one study, imagining contact with a [[gay]] man produced higher levels of trust towards gay men in general which mediated the relationship between imagined contact and positive intergroup attitudes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=Rhiannon N.|last2=West|first2=Keon|last3=Christie|first3=Zara|title=Out-group trust, intergroup anxiety, and out-group attitude as mediators of the effect of imagined intergroup contact on intergroup behavioral tendencies|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=June 2013|volume=43|pages=E196–E205|doi=10.1111/jasp.12019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same study, these researchers showed unique contributions of anxiety and trust, with imagined contact increasing intergroup trust leading to lower intentions to avoid the outgroup, and decreasing intergroup anxiety thus increasing approach related behaviors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

While multiple studies have demonstrated the overall positive effects of imagining contact on intergroup attitudes and intergroup behavior,&lt;ref name="Miles, 2014" /&gt; there is some debate about the theoretical importance and application of the imagined contact hypothesis.  Some researchers criticized the imagined contact hypothesis as too rooted in the microlevel and laboratory setting, with it unable to address macrolevel social problems of intergroup conflict such as [[genocide]] and [[mass murder]].&lt;ref name="Back in the real world"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Yueh-Ting|last2=Jussim|first2=Lee|title=Back in the real world.|journal=American Psychologist|date=2010|volume=65|issue=2|pages=130–131|doi=10.1037/a0018195}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, there is criticism that imagining contact is not effective for minorities regarding attitudes and behavioral intentions towards majority group members, particularly if the minority group has experienced high levels of oppression and violence at the hands of the majority group.&lt;ref name="Back in the real world"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stathi &amp; Crisp, 2008" /&gt;  Lastly, some have critiqued the small effects, potential for demand characteristics to influence results, and short duration of effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bigler|first1=Rebecca S.|last2=Hughes|first2=Julie Milligan|title=Reasons for skepticism about the efficacy of simulated social contact interventions.|journal=American Psychologist|date=2010|volume=65|issue=2|pages=132–133|doi=10.1037/a0018097|pmid=20141270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crisp and Turner responded to a number of these criticism by acknowledging the limitations of the imagined contact hypothesis and their methodological approach as experimental psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crisp|first1=Richard J.|last2=Turner|first2=Rhiannon N.|title=Have confidence in contact.|journal=American Psychologist|date=2010|volume=65|issue=2|pages=133–135|doi=10.1037/a0018437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, they argued that experimental evidence is a vital step to understanding and developing empirically tested prejudice reduction strategies.  They also argued that evidence of the imagined contact hypothesis improving implicit attitudes&lt;ref name="Turner 2010 129–142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vezzali et al, 2010" /&gt; counters the possibility of demand characteristics influencing results.  Finally, they agreed that a single session in the laboratory may not be enough to improve intergroup attitudes and conflict however suggested that imagining contact represented a first step in a continuum of contact interventions.

The '''''Kangxi Dictionary''''' ({{zh|c=康熙字典|p=Kāngxī Zìdiǎn}}) was the standard [[Chinese dictionary]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. The [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the Manchu [[Qing Dynasty]] ordered its compilation in 1710. It used the earlier [[Zihui]] system of 214 radicals, today known as [[Kangxi radical|214 Kangxi radicals]], and was published in 1716. The dictionary is named after the Emperor's [[Chinese era name|era name]].

The dictionary contains more than 47,000 characters, though some 40% of them are graphic variants. In addition, there are rare or archaic characters, some of which are attested only once. Fewer than a quarter of the characters it contains are now in common use.&lt;ref&gt;Endymion Wilkinson. ''[[Chinese History: A New Manual]].'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Asia Center, Harvard-Yenching Institute Monograph Series,  2012. {{ISBN|9780674067158}}), pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compilation==
The ''Kangxi Dictionary'' editors, including Zhang Yushu ({{lang|zh-Hant|張玉書}}) and Chen Tingjing ({{lang|zh-Hant|陳廷敬}}), based it partly on two [[Ming Dynasty]] dictionaries: the 1615 ''[[Zihui]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|字彙}} "Character Collection") by Mei Yingzuo ({{lang|zh-Hant|梅膺祚}}), and the 1627 ''[[Zhengzitong]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|正字通}} "Correct Character Mastery") by Zhang Zilie ({{lang|zh-Hant|張自烈}}). Since the imperial edict required that the ''Kangxi Dictionary'' be compiled within five years, a number of errors were inevitable. The [[Daoguang Emperor]] established a review board and their 1831 ''Zidian kaozheng'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|字典考證}} "Character Dictionary Textual Research") corrected 2,588 mistakes, mostly in quotations and citations.&lt;ref&gt;Teng and Biggerstaff 1971:130&lt;/ref&gt;

The supplemented dictionary contains 47,035 character entries, plus 1,995 [[Variant Chinese character|graphic variants]], giving a total of  49,030 different characters. They are grouped under the 214 [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] and arranged by the number of additional strokes in the character.  Although these 214 radicals were first used in the ''[[Zihui]]'', due to the popularity of the ''Kangxi Dictionary'' they are known as [[List of Kangxi radicals|Kangxi radicals]] and remain in modern usage as a method to categorize [[traditional Chinese character]]s.

The character entries give variants (if any), pronunciations in traditional [[fanqie]] spelling and in modern reading of a [[homophone]], different meanings, and quotations from Chinese books and lexicons. The dictionary also contains [[rime table]]s with characters ordered under [[syllable rime]] classes, [[Tonal language|tone]]s, and initial [[syllable onset]]s.

The ''Kangxi Dictionary'' is available in many forms, from old Qing Dynasty editions in [[block printing]], to reprints in [[traditional Chinese bookbinding]], to modern revised editions with essays in Western-style [[hardcover]], to the digitized [[Internet]] version.

The ''Kangxi Dictionary'' is one of the Chinese dictionaries used by the [[Ideographic Rapporteur Group]] for the [[Unicode]] standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">In '''''Kroukam v SA Airlink (Pty) Ltd''''', an important case in [[South African labour law]], the Appellant was employed as a senior pilot. He was dismissed after being found guilty of [[insubordination]] and constituting a disruptive influence in the operations of the company. At the time of his dismissal he was also the chairperson of the [[Airlines Pilots Association]] (a [[trade union]]). He contended that his dismissal was in fact automatically unfair in terms of section 187(1)(d) of the [[Labour Relations Act]], because he had been dismissed for union activities and for initiating litigation against the company on behalf of the union.

The court held the dismissal to have been automatically unfair as contemplated by section 187(1 )(d) of the LRA. In coming to this conclusion, the court cautioned against an argument that participation in trade-union activities destroys the trust relationship —

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my view it would undermine the protection that the [[South African Constitution|Constitution]] and the Act seek to confer on union officials or representatives and employees against victimization for the exercise of their constitutional and statutory rights to accept a proposition the effect of which would be that an employer may destroy a trust relationship by victimizing an employee and then benefit from such illegitimate and unlawful conduct. The proposition that even if the court concluded that the employee was indeed dismissed for an illegitimate and unlawful or unconstitutional reason, he must still lose his job because the illegitimate conduct of the employer has destroyed such trust relationship is, in my view, unacceptable as a matter of policy. An employer who acts in breach of such fundamental rights must, as a matter of policy, not be allowed to benefit from his unacceptable conduct. An approach of a court which allows such conduct to prevail may itself be in conflict with some of the values and principles which make up the foundation of our [[post-apartheid]] society.&lt;ref&gt;Para 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">In compiling the history of the [[Early Christian Church]], the '''Liberian Catalogue''' (''Catalogus Liberianus''), which was part of the [[illuminated manuscript]] known as the [[Chronography of 354]], is an essential document, for it consists of a [[List of popes|list of the popes]], designated bishops of Rome, ending with [[Pope Liberius]] (died 366), hence its name and approximate date. The list gives the lengths of their respective episcopates, the corresponding consular dates, and the names of the reigning emperors. In many cases there are other details. "The collection of tracts of which this forms a part was edited (apparently by one Furius Dionysius Philocalus) in 354" (''CE''). It now survives only in a copy. 

The Liberian Catalogue is clearly the work of a compiler using earlier texts. It has been suggested that it is largely dependent on a work of Bishop [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus of Portus]] (died 235), and is his lost ''Chronica''. The character of the entries changes after [[Pope Pontian|Pontian]]. There are a number of "strange errors" (Edmundson 1913, lecture VIII) in the Liberian Catalogue, some of which may be the product merely of copyist errors (''CE''). The texts in the Chronography do display damage in transmission.

==Anomalies in the Liberian Catalogue==
George Edmundson pointed out a number of anomalies. "The deaths of St. Peter and St. Paul are stated to have taken place in A.D. 55 Clement succeeds Linus in A.D. 67, and Anencletus, the real successor of Linus, is duplicated and follows Clement, first at Cletus, then as Anacletus. Clement’s death is recorded as having occurred sixteen years before he became bishop according to the generally received date." Nor were the errors confined to the first-century episcopates. The Hippolytean source is not even accurate about Pope Pius himself, who in the words of the [[Muratorian fragment]] lived "very recently in our own times". Hegesippus and Irenaeus, both of whom stayed some time in Rome soon after the death of Pius, both give the order of succession as Pius, Anicetus, Soter, Eleutherus. The ''Liberian Catalogue'' makes Pius the successor of Anicetus instead of the predecessor.

=="Depositio martyrum" and the "Depositio episcoporum"==

Two other lists are associated, in the sense that they occur in the same manuscript (the ''Chronographus anni'' 354). These are the ''Depositio martyrum'' and ''Depositio episcoporum''. While these names could be generic, for lists of martyrs and bishops, scholarly usage without qualification tends to mean these lists.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Lusternik–Schnirelmann theorem''', aka '''Lusternik–Schnirelmann–Borsuk theorem''' or '''LSB theorem''', says as follows. 

If the [[sphere]] '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is covered by ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 open sets, then one of these sets contains a pair (''x'',&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''x'') of antipodal points. 

It is named after [[Lazar Lyusternik]] and [[Lev Schnirelmann]], who published it in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A '''MUD client''' is a [[computer application]] used to connect to a [[MUD]], a type of [[multiplayer online game]]. Generally, a MUD client is a very basic [[telnet]] client that lacks [[VT100]] terminal emulation and the capability to perform telnet negotiations. On the other hand, MUD clients are enhanced with various features designed to enhance the [[gameplay]] of MUDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last1 = Levine | first1 = John R. | authorlink = John R. Levine
 | title = More Internet for Dummies
 | publisher = IDG Books
 | year = 1997
 | isbn = 0-7645-0135-6
 | pages = 199
 | quote = A better way to connect to a MUD is by using a MUD client program: a program specifically designed for MUDding.  A MUD program is really a telnet program that has had various MUD-related commands added.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard features seen in most MUD clients include [[ANSI]] color support, [[Macro (computer science)|aliases]], [[Event-driven programming|trigger]]s and [[Scripting language|scripting]]. The client can often be extended almost indefinitely with its built-in scripting language. Most MUDs restrict the usage of scripts because they give an unfair advantage, as well as the fear that the game will end up being played by fully automated clients instead of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=A brief history of botting
 |author=Raph Koster
 |year=2008
 |quote=Everyone’s advice to a newbie was “get a client,” followed by the lengthy caveat that a given mud had specific rules about what was permissible. In other words, the third-party tools were seen as something that added invaluable interface enhancements, but that also afforded a bit too much power.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first MUD client with a notable number of features was Tinytalk by Anton Rang in January 1990, for [[Unix-like]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.mud/msg/cd7c39ab3fbefbb2
 |title=TinyTalk 1.0 is now available for anonymous FTP
 |author=Anton Rang
 |year=1990
 |quote=TinyTalk is an interface to the TinyMUD system.  It replaces telnet, and adds many new features.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1990 TinyWar 1.1.4 was released by Leo Plotkin which was based on TinyTalk 1.0 and added support for [[event-driven programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=TinyWar does exist! Here it is...
 |author=Jason Downs
 |year=1990
 |quote=The program you are using now.  Tinywar is a modified tinytalk, the later program originally written by Anton Rang.  It's a telnet clone, with MUD-specific features.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1990 [[TinyFugue]] which was based on TinyWar 1.2.3 and TT 1.1 was released by Greg Hudson and featured more advanced trigger support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.mud/msg/29ed0f9e9c5b28e8
 |title=TinyFugue 1.1.4 released to anonymous FTP
 |author=Greg Hudson
 |year=1990
 |quote=TinyFugue is, I believe, the most advanced TinyClient to date, incorporating most of the features of TinyWar 1.2.3, the features of GrimJim's TT 1.1.jwl-2 beta, many of my own enhancements (such as extensive reentrance, trigger priority, and trigger probability), and input/output windows. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of TinyFugue was taken over by Ken Keys in 1991.  TinyFugue has continued to evolve and remains a popular client today for [[Unix-like]] systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

TinyFugue, or tf, was primarily written for [[Unix-like]] operating systems. It is one of the earliest MUD clients in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | quote = The ''TinyFugue'' system has long been a popular client interface for players of MOO, MUCK, and many TinyMUD-derivative systems.  With a robust feature list supporting multiple sessions, macros, triggers and automation, command history and other functions, TinyFugue offers users maximum control over their environment.  Although more recent programs such as Tintin++ have gained large followings, many MUD players continue to use TinyFugue because of its power and flexibility in the hands of an experience client programmer.

 | quote = There are also front-end client programs, such as TinyTalk, TinyFugue, and Tintin, that provide an easier interface to the MUDs for their human players.  They can handle some of the more routine work&amp;mdash;for example, automatically greeting anyone who enters the room.

Another early client was TINTIN by Peter Unold in April 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=TINTIN III is a mud client special designed to help dikumudders. It runs under various UNIX implementations.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of TINTIN was continued by Bill Reiss who announced the release of TinTin++ 1.0 in July 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=where to get tintin++
 |author=Bill Reiss
 |year=1993
 |quote=Since berkeley removed its diku base, I have put a copy of tintin++ 1.0 beta on flipper.pvv.unit.no in the pub/mud/diku directory.  From here on, I will most likely be putting the updates to tintin++ there.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The client gained popularity quickly because of its easy to use scripting language and the popularity of [[DikuMUD]] for which it was designed. Being open source with originally no license restrictions, many current clients like GGMud, MudMaster, and Pueblo are based on TinTin++.

Following on from TINTIN's success, Mike Potter was keen to produce a Windows port of the client resulting in the release of [[zMUD]] 1.0 in December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |author=Mike Potter

 |quote=zMUD is a powerful client, with many features of TinTin++, as well as graphical interface features such as customizeable buttons.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; zMUD was initially licensed as freeware, but Mike Potter realized that he could make a living from sales of the client and started selling zMUD 4.0 as [[shareware]] in September 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Such an approach has been adopted by the zMUD client, from Zugg Software, which includes the automapping tool shown in figure 8.5.  zMUD can be configured to decode the room descriptions, and to record the standard cardinal walking directions, teleports and one-way links."

'''Microprinting''' is the production of recognizable patterns or characters in a printed medium at a scale that requires magnification to read with the naked eye.  To the unaided eye, the text may appear as a solid line. Attempts to reproduce by methods of [[photocopy]], [[image scanning]], or [[pantograph]] typically translate as a dotted or solid line, unless the reproduction method can identify and recreate patterns to such scale.  Microprint is predominantly used as an [[counterfeit|anti-counterfeiting]] technique, due to its inability to be easily reproduced by digital methods.

[[File:Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects.pdf |thumb|right |A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects published by Albert Boni (1943)]]
While microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was significantly influenced by [[Albert Boni]]&lt;ref name=price&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Price |first1=Miles |title=The Microcard Foundation |date=April 1953 |volume=39 |pages=304–305 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSQMvwRpV_8C&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=microprint+originally+invented+by#v=onepage&amp;q=microprint%20originally%20invented%20by&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 October 2015 |publisher=American Bar Association |issn=0747-0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff, who was showing his experimentations related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Boni that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs, this technology might enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space.  Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography. ({{US patent |2260551A}}, {{US patent |2260552A}})  This process proved to produce a 6" by 9" index card that stored 100 pages of text from the normal sized publications he was reproducing.  Boni began the Readex Microprint company to produce and license this technology.  He also published an article ''[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=mdp.39015009825780 A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects (1943)]'', which appeared in a supplemental 18th issue of the Photo-Lab Index.&lt;ref name=metcalf&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metcalf |first1=K.

==Usage==
[[File:USD100-microprint USA.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of microprint incorporated on US $100 paper currency]]
[[Currency]] commonly exhibits the highest quality (smallest size) of microprint because it demands the highest level of counterfeiting deterrence.&lt;ref name=trimm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trimm|first1=Harold H|title=Forensics the Easy Way|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DB82v7DdYygC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=Microprinting#PPA276,M1|isbn=0-7641-3050-1|page=276|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, on the series 2004 [[United States]] [[U.S. twenty dollar bill|$20 bill]], microprint is hidden within the border in the lower left corner of the obverse (front) side as well as the Twenty USA background.&lt;ref name=trimm/&gt;

[[File:Microprint.gif|thumb|left|''MP'' microprint commonly used on personal bank cheques]]
[[Bank cheques]] as well as various other items of value may also commonly leverage microprinting methods, but generally not of such extreme size.  For example, personal bank cheques commonly place the characters ''MP'' next to the signature line of the check; these characters represent ''microprint'' and indicate that the signature line or other check features are actually microprinted characters. The microprinted characters are used as an anti-counterfeiting feature due to their difficultly in being reproduced while the prominent MP serves as a overt deterrent warning that the item employs microprint.

While microprinting at some scales may be readable to the [[human eye]] without [[microscopy]], there is no differentiation between microprinting at these different scales.

The first US postage stamp to incorporate microprinting was the American Wildflower Series introduced by The [[United States Postal Service]] in 1992.  It was also the first commemorative stamp wholly produced by offset lithography.  The USPS has since issued other stamps with more complex microprinting incorporated along with dates, words, and abbreviations such as ''USPS'' and even entire stamp designs composed of microprint letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/blog/Chenevert_page_1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Security Features of United States Postage Stamps 1974-2009|page=1|last1=Chenevert|first1=James|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Engraving.jpg|thumb|Preparing a lithographic printing plate]]

Microprint of the smallest scale is only producible by hand using engraved [[offset printing]] plates or some other method of [[Intaglio (printmaking)]].

[[File:MICR char.svg|thumb|left|MICR]]

Digital microtext printers utilize specially designed fonts and ink for the purpose.  The ink used is most commonly [[MICR]] (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) toner particles but may also be [[Polyester resin|polyester]] based toners and [[styrene]] [[acrylate]] [[polymer]] based toners.  The ink is not limited to [[grayscale]] only, but may also use color toners or even more specialized toners containing dyes sensitive to [[ultraviolet]] or [[infrared]] radiation and producing [[fluorescence]] when exposed to those radiations.&lt;ref name=us7270918b2&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=7270918|status=patent|title=Printing system, process, and product with microprinting|gdate=2007-09-18|fdate=2004-11-18|pridate=2003-12-24|inventory-first1=J|inventory-last1=Blood|inventory-first2=C|inventory-last2=Leonard|inventory-first3=J|inventory-last3=Crichton|inventory-first4=T|inventory-last4=Plutchak|inventory-first5=G|inventory-last5=Rombola|assign1=Eastman Kodak Company|url=http://www.google.nr/patents/US7270918|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microtext and microfonts==
[[File:Microfont.png|thumb|right|Examples of several microfonts used in digital microprinting]]

Microprint of the scale capable by other printing methods cannot be produced by a digital printer regardless of the resolution of the device.  Some digital fonts are designed specifically for the purpose of microprinting.  These pseudo-microprint fonts are referred to as microtext.&lt;ref name=us7270918b2/&gt;

Xerox was acclaimed for developing a microtext font they claimed could produce characters 1/100th of an [[inch]] tall.&lt;ref name=xerox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xerox.com/innovation/news-stories/microtext/enus.html|title=Xerox Scientists Develop Microtext Font; Digitally Printing Tiny Words And Numbers Will Help Make Documents More Secure|publisher=Xerox Corporation|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1/100th of an inch is equivalent to 0.7227 [[Point (typography)|points]].&lt;ref name=inchpoint&gt;{{NIST-PD|article=Conversion Factors for Science, Engineering, and Industrial Terms|url=ftp://ftp.nist.gov/pub/dataplot/other/reference/CONVFACT.TXT|accessdate=2015-10-05}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Videojet Technologies released their 1650 High Resolution (HR) and 1620 HR Continuous Inkjet (CIR) printers, said to be capable of printing sub-pixel size characters as small as 0.6mm in height (equivalent to 1.7007{{overline|9}} points). The printers use a 40-micron nozzle that outputs more than 100,000 drops per second of ink.  While these printers make microprinting faster and easier to produce digitally, they still have not reached the true sub-pixel size of less than 1 point.&lt;ref name=videojet&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.pmpnews.com/news/enhanced-microprinting-technology-featured-latest-videojet-1000-series-release-150410|publisher=UBM Canon|title=Enhanced Microprinting Technology Featured in Latest Videojet 1000 Series Release|last1=Anderson|date=2015-04-09|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest scale microtext a laser printer can produce is 0.5pt.&lt;ref name=troy&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.troygroup.com/contact/downloads/TROY_Microprint_Whitepaper_011609.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Comparison of Laser Printed Microprint Fonts and Practical Considerations for Use in Prescriptions|date=16 Jan 2009|page=3|accessdate=2015-10-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008060618/http://www.troygroup.com/contact/downloads/TROY_Microprint_Whitepaper_011609.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microstructures==
{{Expert needed|Science|section|talk=Microstructures|date=October 2015}}
Using gold [[nanoparticle]] inks on a glass substrate, scientists concluded that it was possible for them to control the production of print patterns to a scale of 2 microns.  After printing, the nano-particle ink suspension was heated using a [[Gaussian beam|gaussian laser]], as it was heated, the glass would expand due to the [[thermal conductivity]] of the gold nano-ink.  In further experiments, they were able to fuse the nano-particles together into a tighter formation a continuous conductive line.  Such experiments did not directly include font characters but could translate to such usage.&lt;ref name=nano&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D.|degree=D.Sc.|date=2004|url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:27519/eth-27519-02.pdf|title=Transport Phenomena in the microprinting and laser annealing of Gold Nanoparticle Inks|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology|location=Zurich, Switzerland|first1=Nicole Renée|last1=Bieri|format=PDF|page=167&lt;!--appears as page 201 in the digital pdf, marked as page 167 on the page --&gt;|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Musée Nissim de Camondo''' is an elegant house museum of French decorative arts located in the Hôtel Camondo, 63, rue de Monceau, at the edge of the [[Parc Monceau]], in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]], [[France]]. The nearest [[Paris Métro]] stops are [[Villiers (Paris Métro)|Villiers]] or [[Monceau (Paris Métro)|Monceau]] on [[Paris Métro Line 2|Line 2]].

==History==
The mansion was built in 1911 by the Comte [[Moïse de Camondo]], a banker, with architect [[René Sergent]], to set off his collection of eighteenth-century French furniture and art objects. Its design was patterned upon the [[Petit Trianon]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], though with modern conveniences. Both house and collections were bequeathed to [[Les Arts Décoratifs]] in honour of his son, [[Nissim de Camondo]], killed in [[World War I]], and opened as a museum in 1936. More tragedy followed a few years later when Moise’s daughter and her family were deported to Auschwitz, where they died.

Today, the house is maintained as if it were still a private home preserved in its original condition. Three floors are open to visitors: the lower ground floor (kitchens), upper ground floor (formal rooms), first floor (private apartments), and gardens.

The house's furnishings include needlepoint chairs and work by artisans of the [[Garde Meuble Royal]] (Royal Furniture Repository) such as [[Jean-François Oeben]], [[Jean Henri Riesener]], and [[Georges Jacob]]. Floors are furnished with [[Savonnerie]] carpets woven in 1678 for the Grande Galerie in the [[Louvre]], and walls accented with tapestries (many [[Beauvais]] or [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]]), and paintings including portraits by [[Élisabeth-Louise Vigée Le Brun]], landscapes by [[Guardi]] and [[Hubert Robert]] and hunting scenes by [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]]. Table setting are of particular interest, especially the Orloff silver dinner service commissioned by [[Catherine II of Russia]] from silversmith [[Jacques-Nicolas Roettiers]] in 1770, and the Buffon porcelain services made at [[Sèvres]] in the 1780s with a bird theme. Other notable objects include a bust by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], bas-reliefs, Chinese vases, and crystal chandeliers.

'''Mirotvorets''', or '''Myrotvorets''' ({{lang-uk|Миротворець}} {{IPA|/mɪrɔ'tvɔrɛt͡sʲ/}}, lit. "Peacemaker"), is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Kiev]]-based&lt;ref name="tass20160512" /&gt; [[website]] that purports to reveal personal information of people who are considered to be "enemies of Ukraine",&lt;ref name="globalvoices20160511" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rt20160512" /&gt; or, as the website itself states, "whose actions have signs of crimes against the national security of Ukraine, peace, human security, and the international law".&lt;ref name="Myrotvorets20161107" /&gt; It was launched in December 2014 by Ukrainian politician and activist [[George Tuka|Georgy Tuka]],&lt;ref name="Facebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ipress" /&gt; then a head of "[[Narodny Tyl]]", who since 29 April 2016 serves in the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] as Deputy Minister at the [[Ministry of Temporarily Occupied Territories and IDPs]]&lt;ref name="rt20160512" /&gt; and before that, in 2015–2016, was the governor of [[Luhansk Oblast]] ("chairman of the Luhansk Regional Military and Civil Administration") appointed by president [[Petro Poroshenko]].&lt;ref name="UNIAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kyivpost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ukraine Today" /&gt;

The site reflects the work of [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] ″Myrotvorets centre″, led by Roman Zaitsev, former employee of [[Luhansk]] [[Security Service of Ukraine]] office.&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt;

The website is curated by the government law-enforcement and intelligence agency [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU)&lt;ref name="ibtimes20160513" /&gt; and promoted by Advisor to the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine]] {{ill|Anton Gerashchenko|uk|Геращенко Антон Юрійович}}.&lt;ref name="ibtimes20160513" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MT" /&gt; In October 2015 he proposed to add a special section titled "Putin's crimes in Syria and Middle East" dedicated for personal data of [[Russia]]n military personnel of [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|the operation in Syria]] collected by [[Inform Napalm]],&lt;ref name="MK" /&gt; as he cited from his correspondence:&lt;ref name="rt20161007" /&gt; in order "to help [[ISIS]] take revenge" on them "in accordance with [[Sharia law]]".&lt;ref name="rt20160512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rt20161007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RTTV" /&gt;

In April 2015 the website published the home addresses of Ukrainian writer [[Oles Buzina]] and former [[Verkhovna Rada]] parliamentarian [[Oleg Kalashnikov]] just days before they were assassinated.&lt;ref name="rt20160512" /&gt;

On 7 May 2016 the website published the personal data of 4,508 journalists and other media members from all over the world who had worked (or had received accreditation to work) on the [[War in Donbass|war in the uncontrolled government territory of Donbass]], and therefore cooperated with terrorists.&lt;ref name="tass20160512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalvoices20160511" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rt20160512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimes20160513" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thedailybeast20160512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sputniknews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interfax20150512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNIAN20160511" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interfax20151007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost201609512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl20160511" /&gt;
There were phone numbers, email addresses, and some countries and cities of residence of Ukrainian and foreign journalists received from the hacked database of Donetsk People's Republic Ministry of State Security; journalists and support staff provided these data to be "accredited" by Russia-controlled militants. In response, the Security Service of Ukraine issued a statement that it found no violations of Ukrainian law by Myrotvorets.&lt;ref name="UNIAN2" /&gt;

The slogan of the centre's website and the centre itself is a Latin saying: ''Pro bono publico'' (for the public good).

==History==
[[File:PeacekeepersUA2.jpg|300px|thumb|The staff of the "Myrotvorets" Centre]]
Myrotvorets Centre began to develop the project in summer 2014, during the [[War in Donbass]]. The project was launched in December 2014 as part of the work of the volunteer group known as "[[Narodny Tyl]]".&lt;ref name="ipress" /&gt; The first true leader and participants were not reported, for their safety.&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt; For distraction a leader was presented as "[[Narodny Tyl]]" leader&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt; {{Failed verification|date=May 2016}} Ukrainian politician and activist [[George Tuka|Georgy Tuka]], who since 29 April 2016 serves in the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] as Deputy Minister at the [[Ministry of Temporarily Occupied Territories and IDPs]]&lt;ref name="rt20160512" /&gt; and before that, in 2015–2016, served as the governor of [[Luhansk Oblast]] ("chairman of the Luhansk Regional Military and Civil Administration") appointed by president [[Petro Poroshenko]].&lt;ref name="UNIAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kyivpost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ukraine Today" /&gt;
 
The director of the Centre is Roman Zaitsev, a former employee of the territorial office of the [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] in the [[Luhansk]] region. At the Centre, there are about 250 people living both in Ukraine and abroad. During the first two years the Centre incurred losses in killed, wounded and missing people.&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2016}}

The website is promoted by Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine]]. The centre is affiliated with the government law-enforcement and intelligence agency, the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU)&lt;ref name="ibtimes20160513" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thedailybeast20160512" /&gt; and the Ukrainian [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]].&lt;ref name="rt20160512" /&gt;

==Activity==
[[File:Myrotvorets-Coat.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Coat of "Myrotvorets" staff member with field version of emblem]]
The "Myrotvorets" leader states that the centre's objective is to provide information and advice to the executive authorities, to finally bring peace and harmony in Ukraine. In its work the centre pays special attention to expressions of "[[separatist]] and [[terrorist]] activities" on the territory of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2016}}

Sources of information for the centre are primarily public materials posted on the Internet, publications and more. Much like other volunteer organisations, the centre widely uses [[Open-source intelligence|OSINT methods]]. In addition, the centre uses information provided by individuals on a confidential basis. Under current Ukrainian law, the centre does not use information contained in anonymous appeals.&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2016}}

In October 2015, the centre added a special section titled "Putin's crimes in Syria and the Middle East" dedicated to providing personal data of [[Russia]]n military personnel involved in [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|the operation in Syria]], according to Russian media "to help [[ISIS]] take revenge" on the Russian pilots "in accordance with [[Sharia law]]".&lt;ref name="rt20160512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rt20161007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RTTV" /&gt; Myrotvorets' actions caused extremely strong reactions from the Russian presidential administration and among Russian experts in military affairs and special operations. As stated in the website [[InformNapalm]], an important element of the operation was to compare the numbers of [[Su-24]] from the Russian airbase "Shagol" and the same type of aircraft, overturned in Syria. A few days after the operation began, Russian TV started to hide the numbers of military aircraft based in [[Syria]] for their video shoots.&lt;ref name="svoboda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RTTV20151014" /&gt; After the information was published, the Investigative Committee of Russia launched criminal proceedings against Anton Gerashchenko for "public calls to terrorism."&lt;ref name="ria" /&gt;

In February 2016, members of the centre took part in the operation of mobile groups against illegal transport of cargo through the line of armed conflict in the [[War in Donbass]].&lt;ref name="TCH" /&gt;

Myrotvorets Centre repeatedly provided information on the participation of foreign nationals in the armed conflict, on the side of pro-Russian separatists. In early March 2016, due to the materials published by the centre, law enforcement authorities in [[Bulgaria]] initiated criminal proceedings against George Bliznakov, a Bulgarian citizen. Similar materials are being considered regarding other Bulgarian citizens.&lt;ref name="clubZ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bTV" /&gt;

According to the head of the centre, 4.5 thousand people were in the file cabinet in October 2014; 16 December 2015 – 7.5 thousand; January 2015 – 9000; 13 April 2015 – 30 thousand. In October 2015 – 45 thousand people; by 21 March 2016 – 57,775 people;&lt;ref name="censorbook" /&gt; by 27 January 2017 - more than 102 thousand.&lt;ref name="Fakty270117" /&gt; The most complete database contains residents of the [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2016}}

On 15 April 2018, Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s name was added to the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/10081817-syrian-president-lands-up-on-ukraine-s-myrotvorets-database-due-to-his-children-s-visit-to-crimea.html |title=Syrian president lands up on Ukraine's Myrotvorets database due to his children's visit to Crimea |date=2018-04-16|agency=UNIAN|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In April 2015, Myrotvorets published the home addresses of Ukrainian writer [[Oles Buzina]] and former [[Verkhovna Rada]] parliamentarian [[Oleg Kalashnikov]], just days before they were assassinated.&lt;ref name="rt20160512" /&gt;

After the site published the data of various journalists, [[Valeriya Lutkovska]], Ukrainian lawyer and Ombudswoman of Ukraine since April 2012, demanded both the website and the Centre be shut down.&lt;ref name="interfaxLut" /&gt; Ukrainian editor and journalist [[Vitaly Portnikov]] and Ukrainian parliamentarian and military expert/blogger [[Dmytro Tymchuk]] have compared accreditation of a Ukrainian journalist in [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic]] to accreditation of an [[Israelis|Israeli]] journalist with the [[Hamas]] "Ministry of Information" in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].&lt;ref name="expres" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DWPort" /&gt;

On 2 June 2016, [[G7]] ambassadors to Kiev released a joint statement expressing deep concern about disclosures of journalists' personal data on the Myrotvorets website and called on the Myrotvorets team to withdraw personal data from public access.&lt;ref name="Britist embassy"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/g7-ambassadors-statement-regarding-journalists-personal-data-on-myrotvorets-website G7 Ambassadors are deeply concerned by recent massive disclosures of journalists’ personal data on the Myrotvorets websiteв]{{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day President [[Petro Poroshenko]] at a press conference condemned the publication of  journalists' personal data, but stressed that he is extremely limited in terms of influence over the "Myrotvorets" website, which is curated by the government law-enforcement and intelligence agency [[Security Service of Ukraine]]; thus he is not going to press for a policy change.&lt;ref name="Press-conference1"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFiUArw-p9I Fragment of Mr. Poroshenko's press-conference on 6 June 2016]{{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 2017, Russia's foreign ministry sent a note of complaint to the US Department of State to protest the migration of the site to US servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia demands Ukrainian doxing site be closed down|url=http://tass.com/politics/977148|accessdate=23 November 2017|agency=TASS|date=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Myrotvorets wrote on Facebook that their database included residents of [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] who had [[Ukrainian nationality law|illegally]] taken out [[Hungarian citizenship]].&lt;ref name=Unian22Sep18&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.unian.info/society/10270593-residents-of-zakarpattia-region-with-hungarian-citizenship-included-in-ukraine-s-myrotvorets-database.html |title=Residents of Zakarpattia region with Hungarian citizenship included in Ukraine's Myrotvorets database |agency=UNIAN |date=22 September 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks of work in Zakarpattia Oblast, the database held more than 300 names of Ukrainian officials and local councillors from the oblast who had Hungarian passports.&lt;ref name=UNIAN09Oct18&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/10292058-over-300-officials-get-hungarian-passports-in-ukraine-s-zakarpattia-region-myrotvorets-database.html |title=Over 300 officials get Hungarian passports in Ukraine's Zakarpattia region – Myrotvorets database |date=9 October 2018 |df=dmy-all|agency=UNIAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 October 2018, Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Péter Szijjártó]] said: "It is a lie that the Ukrainian state has nothing to do with the website that is listing suspected dual Ukrainian-Hungarian nationals", and claimed that President [[Petro Poroshenko]] "gave his consent to the hate campaign in an attempt to increase his popularity".&lt;ref name=UNIAN11Oct18&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.unian.info/politics/10295418-hungary-accuses-ukraine-state-of-lying-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-website-listing-dual-nationals.html |title=Hungary accuses Ukraine state of lying it has nothing to do with website listing dual nationals |date=11 October 2018| agency=UNIAN |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathaniel Lord Britton''' (January 15, 1859 – June 25, 1934) was an [[United States|American]] [[botanist]] and [[taxonomist]] who co-founded the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in the [[Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Early life==
Britton was born in [[New Dorp, Staten Island|New Dorp]] in [[Staten Island, New York]] to Jasper Alexander Hamilton Britton and Harriet Lord Turner.&lt;ref name=nybg-bio&gt;{{cite web|last=Fraser|first=Susan|title=NATHANIEL LORD BRITTON RECORDS (1875-1934)|url=http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/libr/finding_guide/britwb2.asp.html|publisher=New York Botanical Garden|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toddler's Dress|url=https://statenisland.pastperfectonline.com/webobject/27EAD842-5C22-41EA-ADB1-810313079220|work=Online Collections Database|publisher=Staten Island Historical Society|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents wanted him to study religion, but he was attracted to [[nature study]] at an early age.

He was a graduate of the [[School of Engineering and Applied Science (Columbia University)|Columbia University School of Mines]] and afterwards taught [[geology]] and [[botany]] at [[Columbia University]].  He joined the [[Torrey Botanical Society|Torrey Botanical Club]] soon after graduation and was a member his entire life.  He married [[Elizabeth Gertrude Britton|Elizabeth Gertrude Knight]], a [[Bryophyte|bryologist]], on August 27, 1885.  They had met when she joined the club and were lifelong collaborators in botanical research.

==New York Botanical Garden==
During their honeymoon in 1888, they visited [[Kew Gardens]], which led to his wife proposing a botanical garden for New York at a Torrey Club meeting.  Together, they campaigned to bring about the NYBG.  Britton left Columbia in 1895 to become the first director of the New York Botanical Garden, a position he held until 1929.  He was on the first Board of Managers for the institution, along with [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[J. Pierpont Morgan]], and [[Cornelius Vanderbilt II]].  He engendered substantial financial support for the botanical garden by naming plants after wealthy contributors.

==Scientific research==
Much of his field work was done in the [[Caribbean]], where he visited frequently when the winter weather in [[New York City]] became too severe.  His contributions to the study of Caribbean flora are undisputed.

He wrote ''Illustrated  Flora of the Northern United States, Canada, and the British Possessions'' (1896) with [[Addison Brown]], and ''[[The Cactaceae]]'' with [[Joseph Nelson Rose]].

Britton is also remembered as one of the signatories of the American Code of [[Botanical nomenclature|Botanical Nomenclature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|title=American Code of Botanical Nomenclature|volume=34|year=1907}}&lt;br&gt;* {{wikisource-inline|Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club/V34/American Code of Botanical Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proposed such radical changes to the rules governing nomenclature that a compromise was not reached (and some of the principal American provisions adopted) until nearly 30 years later.

==Death and legacy==
He died at his home in the Bronx, after suffering a stroke 9 weeks earlier.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr N.L. Britton, 74, Biologist, is dead|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1934/06/26/93761609.pdf|work=26 June 1934|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house he lived and worked in, the [[The Britton Cottage|Britton Cottage]], is preserved at [[Historic Richmond Town]] on Staten Island.

The '''National Front''' (''Fronte Nazionale'', FN) is an Italian [[far-right]] political party.

The FN had its roots in the [[Fiamma Tricolore]] when two leading radicals, [[Tomaso Staiti di Cuddia]] and [[Adriano Tilgher (politician)|Adriano Tilgher]], were expelled from the party in 1997. As a response Tilgher formed his own group in September of that year, calling it ''Fronte Nazionale'' (a name already used twice before on the Italian far right) and basing it on the French [[National Front (France)|National Front]] of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw97-8/italy.html Stephen Roth Institute Italy Report 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629110430/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw97-8/italy.html |date=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party, which initially confined its operations largely to [[Rome]], gained 18,000 votes in that city in the local elections of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw98-9/italy.htm Stephen Roth Institute Italy Report 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party began to expand in early 2000, seeking to work with other minor groups on the [[far right]] to form a united alternative to the [[National Alliance (Italy)|Alleanza Nazionale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw99-2000/italy.htm Stephen Roth Institute Italy Report 1999-2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The group reconstituted under the FSN name after a merger with further dissident elements within the Fiamma Tricolore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2001-2/italy.htm Stephen Roth Institute Italy Report 2001-2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119101212/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2001-2/italy.htm |date=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2003 supporters of the new group protested outside the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] embassy against the jailing of [[Gaston-Armand Amaudruz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2002-3/italy.htm Stephen Roth Institute Italy Report 2002-3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119111315/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2002-3/italy.htm |date=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Italy)|2004 European election]] the party joined with ''[[Social Action|Azione Sociale]]'' and [[New Force (Italy)|Forza Nuova]] in the [[Alessandra Mussolini]]-led coalition ''[[Social Alternative]]'', which captured a single seat in the [[European Parliament]]. They remained part of this coalition until its dissolution following poor results in the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfio Bernabei, "Mussolini Repositions Herself After Election Setback", ''Searchlight'', No. 372, June 2006, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Tilgher joined with [[Francesco Storace]]'s group ''[[The Right (Italy)|La Destra]]'', and the FSN disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adrianotilgher.it/biografia.html |title=Biography |publisher=Adriano Tilgher  |date=28 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725040300/http://adrianotilgher.it/biografia.html |archivedate=2013-07-25 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2013 the party comes out from The Right and regains its autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2013/10/05/tilgher-e-fronte-nazionale/247802/ Destra, il fascista Tilgher: Un Fronte Nazionale per essere padroni a casa nostra]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Information Exchange Model''' ('''NIEM''') ({{IPAc-en|n|i:|m}} {{Respell|neem}}) is an [[XML]]-based [[information exchange]] framework from the [[United States]]. NIEM represents a collaborative partnership of agencies and organizations across all levels of government (federal, state, tribal, and local) and with private industry. The purpose of this partnership is to effectively and efficiently share critical information at key decision points throughout the whole of the [[United States Department of Justice|justice]], [[Department of Public Safety|public safety]], [[Emergency management|emergency and disaster management]], [[Director of national intelligence|intelligence]], and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|homeland security]] enterprise. NIEM is designed to develop, disseminate, and support enterprise-wide information exchange standards and processes that will enable [[jurisdictions]] to automate information sharing.

NIEM is an outgrowth of the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[GJXDM|Global Justice XML Data Model]] (GJXDM) project. NIEM is now being expanded to include other federal and state agencies such as the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]], [[United States Department of Defense]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and others.

==Introduction==
NIEM is designed to facilitate the creation of automated enterprise-wide information exchanges which can be uniformly developed, centrally maintained, quickly identified and discovered, and efficiently reused.

==Key concepts==
The following key concepts are essential to understanding the purpose, architecture, processes, and other capabilities of NIEM, as well as to establish a common knowledge base with which to develop the ability to use NIEM effectively.

'''Data Components.''' The fundamental building block of NIEM is the data component.  Data components are the basic business data elements that represent real-world objects and concepts. Information exchanged between agencies can be broken down into individual components – for example, information about people, places, material things, and events. Components that are frequently and uniformly used in practice are specified in NIEM and can then be reused by practitioners for information exchanges, regardless of the nature of their business or the operational context of their exchanges, provided they are semantically consistent.

'''Information Exchange Package Documentation.'''  The information that is commonly or universally exchanged between participating domains can be organized into ''information exchange packages'' (IEPs) in the form of XML Schemas. An example of this collection of information is data associated with an arrest.  The data to be exchanged includes not only descriptive and personal identification data regarding the individual arrested (i.e., the person component described above) but also information about the person's alleged offense, the location of the offense, the arresting officer, etc.  The IEP represents a set of data that is actually transmitted between agencies for a specific business purpose (e.g., initiating a charging document by the local prosecutor).  It includes the actual XML instance that delivers the payload or information. Additional information regarding this specific exchange can be further documented in the form of an ''information exchange package documentation'' ([[IEPD]]), which also contains data describing the structure, content, and other artifacts of the information exchange. An IEPD supports a specific set of business requirements in an operational setting.

'''NIEM Core.'''  Data components within an information exchange that are universally shared and understood among all (or almost all) domains are identified as universal components (e.g., person, address, and organization).  To become a universal component, consensus by all domains is needed on the semantics and structure of the component. The set of NIEM universal components is stable (once established) and relatively small.

'''Domains.'''  For purposes of NIEM, a domain refers to a business enterprise broadly reflecting the agencies, units of government, operational functions, services, and information systems which are organized or affiliated to meet common objectives. NIEM domains are organized to facilitate governance, and each has some measure of persistency.  Each domain traditionally includes a cohesive group of data stewards who are subject matter experts (SMEs), have some level of authority within the domains they represent, and participate in the processes related to harmonizing conflicts and resolving data component ambiguities.

'''Communities of Interest.'''  Communities of interest (COIs) are collaborative groups of users who exchange information in pursuit of shared goals, interests, missions, or business processes and who therefore must have a shared vocabulary for the information they exchange.  COIs reuse data components and artifacts found in NIEM to document their information exchanges. One or more COIs can coordinate to develop new domain content as they identify gaps in the data components needed for documenting information exchanges.

'''NIEM Conformance.''' There are [[NIEM Conformance|NIEM conformance rules]] that serve as guidelines for agencies utilizing NIEM to implement their information sharing exchanges. Grantees developing inter-agency XML-based exchanges must comply with the special condition language contained in the grant, and follow the associated NIEM implementation guidelines.

==Organizational support==

===NIEM Program Management Office===
The NIEM Program Management Office (PMO) operates to:
*Bring stakeholders, agencies, and the domains and COIs that they represent together to identify information sharing requirements in daily operational and emergency situations;
*Develop information sharing standards, a common lexicon, and an online repository of information exchange package documentation and data components that support information sharing;
*Provide technical tools, processes, and methodologies to support the analysis, development, discovery, dissemination, and reuse of exchange standards and documents; and 
*Provide training, technical assistance, communication, outreach, and implementation support services for NIEM-based information sharing.

===Training and other technical resources===
NIEM is a continually evolving program, and new agencies and COIs are joining the effort all the time.  As new stakeholders come on board, they need to receive information to gain understanding and knowledge of the core capabilities of NIEM and how to engage in NIE information exchanges.  NIEM.gov provides training materials, such as briefings and process-related documentation, as well as other resources, such as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070826175904/http://it.ojp.gov/NISS/helpdesk/ National Information Sharing Standards Help Desk and Knowledge Base].  Training provides the knowledge and know-how stakeholders need to use the tools and other capabilities provided by NIEM. NIEM tools and training opportunities are further described below. Other training materials, such as executive briefings, marketing material, and briefings for conferences and workshops, are offered from time to time and are tailored depending on the audience. A selection of online materials are also available both from the main NIEM.gov web site and resources such as [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=NIEM+exchange+training&amp;oq=NIEM+exchange+training Youtube.com] (search on NIEM training).

===NIEM.gov website===
The [http://www.niem.gov NIEM Web site] serves as a primary means by which NIEM can provide the latest documentation and downloads to those interested in NIEM.  It also serves as a starting point for those wishing to contact NIEM staff with questions, support, and information requests. As related projects, tools, and support resources develop around NIEM, the Web site will expand as the hub for these supplemental resources.

==Technical standards==
NIEM adopts standard [[XML Schema]] constructs and methods, such as roles, associations, and augmentation from industry standards, such as the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] language.

===NIEM schemas===
The NIEM reference schemas are a set of interrelated schemas that define NIEM data components.  Each schema defines its own target namespace.  Schemas in the reference set may import one another by namespace in order to use (or reuse) components they define.  In general, domain reference schemas import schemas from the Core.  The NIEM reference schema set represents the full set of data components in NIEM.

The following kinds of XML schemas are associated with the NIEM architecture:

*'''NIEM reference schemas:''' Schemas containing content created or approved by the NIEM steering committees are periodically released in schema distributions.
*'''Subset Schema:''' a NIEM-conformant schema, containing only the parts of the reference schemas needed to support a particular exchange.
*'''Support schemas:''' NIEM includes three special schemas, appinfo, structures and proxy, for annotating and structuring NIEM-conformant schemas.
*'''Extension Schema:''' a NIEM-conformant schema which adds domain- or application-specific content to the base NIEM model.
*'''Exchange Schema:''' a NIEM-conformant schema which specifies a document in a particular exchange.
*'''Constraint Schema:''' a NIEM-conformant schema which adds additional constraints to NIEM-conformant instances, but which is assumed to validate in concert with existing NIEM-conformant or subset schemas. A constraint schema need not validate constraints that are applied by other schemas.
*'''Codelist Schemas:''' a NIEM-conformant schema which provides a list of acceptable values that a data element will be constrained to.

The only mandatory schemas for validation are the NIEM reference schemas or a correct subset, however the IEPD specification requires that an IEPD include an exchange schema (along with the reference schemas or subsets) to be considered a complete IEPD. The NIEM schemas may import additional schemas, such as code table schemas, as needed.  An optional extension schema may be used to add extended types and properties for components not contained in NIEM, but which are needed for the exchange.

===NIEM Naming and Design Rules (NDR)===
The naming and design rules for NIEM are documented in the [https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM-NDR NIEM&amp;nbsp;NDR], which specifies the data model, XML components, and XML data for use with NIEM and provides a basis for [[NIEM Conformance|NIEM conformance]].  The current version is NDR&amp;nbsp;v4.0, which was released on July 13, 2017).

NIEM is based on several concepts from the [[11179|International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 11179]], which provides guidelines for the naming and definition of data elements, as well as information about the metadata captured about data elements. [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c035347_ISO_IEC_11179-5_2005(E).zip Part 5 of the ISO 11179 standard] establishes a methodology for naming items in data dictionaries.

The ISO 11179-based NIEM NDR naming convention uses object class, property, and representation terms to constitute a multiple-part name as shown in the figure below:

[[Image:ISO naming convention.gif|thumb|right|Example of an ISO standard data element name]]
'''Object Class Term:'''  Represents the object to which the property is applicable.  In NIEM, we interpret that object to be the real-world object. (An object class refers to a group of objects that share the same attributes, operations, methods, relationships, and semantics.)

'''Property Term:'''  Identifies the property that the data element represents (e.g., last name, expiration date, height, total).

'''Representation Term:'''  Describes the form of the data represented. This term is taken from a list of [[ebXML|electronic business XML (ebXML)]] [[representation term]]s, including amount, code, date, time, graphic, identifier, indicator, measure, name, percent, picture, quantity, rate, time, and numeric.

'''Qualifier Term:'''  The object class and property terms can have qualifiers; i.e., a word or words that help define and differentiate the element name.

===NIEM modeling and schema concepts===
The NIEM technical modeling and schema concepts and mechanisms which support building new data components that meet specific requirements and reusing existing NIEM data components are briefly described below. More detail can be found in the NIEM User Guide and the NIEM NDR.

====Data elements, classes, types, and properties====
The NIEM data model uses concepts originating from object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP defines a class as a specific entity in the data model, which may represent a real-world object but may also represent any [[conceptual object]], such as relationships and messages. An object's properties are said to describe the object. When the NIEM XML Schemas are generated from the NIEM data model, data model classes are represented as XML Schema types, and data model properties are represented as XML elements and attributes.

====Extension techniques====
There are two approaches for extending the NIEM data model for use in information exchange schemas and documents.
* Creating new NIEM types to represent new concepts
* Adding new data to existing NIEM types, to extend existing concepts

====Specialization with inheritance====
Specialization is used when a base object class (type) contains or can be subcategorized into a more specific subclass.  When this can be done, the subclass derived from the base class inherits the properties of the more general base or parent class.  This mechanism is used to share or reuse properties between the general data component and its specialization.  For example, a vehicle type (or class) is identified as a data component with properties of vehicle identification number (VIN), make, and model.  Truck type (or class) is a specialization of vehicle and thus inherits the vehicle's properties but also has its own characteristic properties, such as truck bed length.  Specialization is time independent and is generally used only when the base class and subclass always exist.

====Roles====
A role is a special type which represents a particular function, purpose, context, or activity for an entity.  Roles are generally time dependent and, therefore, temporary.  A new type can be created for a role when the role has specific data associated with it and its own life cycle.  A role type has a property, RoleOf, which indicates what object is assuming this role.  A single entity may assume multiple roles.  For example, many different entities may assume the role of a weapon.  Therefore, if a vehicle is used as a weapon (to attempt to injure or kill a person), then an instance of WeaponType would contain the property, RoleOf, which references the vehicle instance used as the weapon.  The WeaponType (the role) might also contain properties that describe the persons and activities involved, dates and times of involvement, and how the entity was used as a weapon.

====Associations====
An association type is an object that represents a relationship between data components.  For example, two PersonType instances, Abigail and Bob, could be referenced by a MarriageAssociationType to represent the fact they are married.  The MarriageAssociationType could contain its own properties, such as date of marriage, number of children, date of divorce, death of one spouse, etc.

====Augmentation====
Augmentation of a NIEM data type allows the addition of domain- or model-specific information to the concept embodied in the NIEM type, without creating a new NIEM type. It would be impractical and unwieldy to include all possible domain model-specific properties in NIEM Core schemas for general use. Instead, domain modelers need to be able define data for their use, independently from common definitions. Furthermore, that data needs to be applicable to the NIEM data object itself, and reusable in multiple exchanges. The augmentation approach built into NIEM utilizes XML Schema constructs to reuse the existing XML schema representations for the data model, by allowing them to be augmented with the new information.

====Element substitution====
NIEM uses several techniques from XML Schema to allow as-needed element substitutions for pre-existing NIEM properties and into pre-existing NIEM types. Element substitution techniques allow the substitution of new XML Schema elements, representing derived NIEM properties that can be used where the parent properties are expected.

There are three XML Schema techniques that support the NIEM use of element substitutions:
* use of substitution groups
* creation of abstract, type-less elements, and
* use of abstract elements in reference schemas.

====Adapting external standards====
In addition to adding new NIEM types and properties to NIEM, it is possible to adapt existing external (non-NIEM) namespaces for use in the NIEM framework. This allows the use of external standards within NIEM IEPDs, without requiring that the external standards themselves be NIEM-conformant. The intent here is to allow use of external standard components exactly as they were defined.

====Metadata====
[[Metadata]], or data about data, defines information that supports the actual content of XML instances. The metadata feature provides a mechanism for attaching structured properties that describe the pedigree or source (when reported, who reported, how reliable, etc.) of instance data to any data component of the model (type or object, property, association, role, or augmentation) in any namespace.  It allows sets of metadata to be extended with additional properties for local requirements and enables metadata properties to be repeated.

=== EIEM dictionary concepts ===
NIEM has introduced the concept of Enterprise Information Exchange Model (EIEM) dictionaries to allow NIEM implementers to position local collections of components specific to their own enterprise.  Typically these may be drawn from an Enterprise Data Model (EDM) and then exported and refactored as XML components that conform to the NIEM NDR.  See Tools section below for information on creating EIEM dictionaries.

==Tools==
NIEM provides a reference set of [http://tools.niem.gov/ tools] freely available with each NIEM release.  The tools implement all of the structural and content features of the release, including the NIEM NDR. NIEM's well-defined interfaces and output products also support the development of independent third-party tools. Example supporting third party tools are listed below.

===NIEM XML data dictionary spreadsheet===
The NIEM XML [http://release.niem.gov/niem/2.1/niem-2.1.xls data&amp;nbsp;dictionary&amp;nbsp;spreadsheet] is a tangible representation of the entire NIEM data dictionary.  It includes all of the element names that are organized hierarchically under core data components (person, property, organization, etc.) with hyperlinks to related elements.  This spreadsheet also provides information on the type of data being represented (date, integer, string, etc.) and a precise, context-rich definition of each dictionary component.

===Information exchanges mapping tool===
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20111015020517/http://tools.niem.gov/niemtools/mapping/index.iepd Information Exchanges Mapping Tool] allows the user to specify metadata and upload XMI domain models associated with NIEM IEPDs, map components within domain models to NIEM components, and generate artifacts based on mappings, including mapping reports, wantlist, exchange schemas, extension schemas, and subset schemas.

===Schema Subset Generation Tool===
The [http://tools.niem.gov/niemtools/ssgt/index.iepd Schema Subset Generation Tool] (SSGT) enables users to search through the NIEM data model and build a NIEM subset. The NIEM data model covers several domains and typically not all of the data model is usable in an exchange. It is useful to make a schema subset of NIEM components to use in an exchange. It helps to limit the scope of developing an IEPD and can be built to the specific requirements of an exchange.  With this tool users can:

*Search the data model from the Search Page. 
*Navigate through the data model. 
*Download already generated subsets from each domain. 
*Build a schema subset containing the components required by their exchange. 
*Save a list of components required for a subset. 
*Upload a list of requested components to continue to edit it. 
*Download a schema subset based on a list of required components. 
*Create IEPD with current subset. 
*Change the NIEM release used for building a schema subset.

===IEPD tool===
The [http://tools.niem.gov/niemtools/iepdt/index.iepd IEPD tool] enables the user to upload or enter the artifacts required for an IEPD (schemas, documentation, and metadata) and assembles into a package according to the IEPD specification. It can also validate that minimum artifacts and metadata are present. The user creates an account and is granted a work space ("My IEPDs").  Inside this work space, the user can upload the artifacts to construct any number of IEPDs (complete or partial); share them with other account holders; or search, discover, and download IEPDs that other account holders have marked for sharing.

A [http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/1.0/model-package-description-1.0.pdf Model Package Description Specification] specifies the artifacts to be included in an IEPD or other Information Exchange Model (IEM).

Additionally see [[National Information Exchange Model#Third Party NIEM development tools|Third Party NIEM tools]] section below for [[National Information Exchange Model#Third Party NIEM development tools|IEPD tools]] that can automate much of the IEPD artifact generation. 3rd Party IEPD tool support includes automatic generation of NIEM cross-reference, wantlist.xml, exchange and subset schema, XML examples, rules documentation and NDR evaluation.

IEPDs which have been published to the [http://it.ojp.gov/iepd/ IEPD Clearinghouse] are available for reuse by other organizations.

It was the largest of the four hemp factories in [[Greece]], in production and facilities. It is also a unit of the [[Water Museum of Edessa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edessacity.gr/museum/watermuseum/index.htm|title=Edessa - Open Air Water Museum - EcoMuseum - Υπαίθριο Μουσείο Νερού Έδεσσας|website=www.edessacity.gr|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is placed at the site "Megalos Kremnos" next to the traditional quarter of the city and the well-known Park of Waterfalls. It operated as a factory until 1967, and then it was abandoned. Later in 1997, the factory turned into a Recreation and Education Center, where it continues to operate until 2014, when it is finally closed.

== Establishment ==
The founding of the company was made in 1908 by the company Totskas and Co.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Factories|first=in Edessa|date=1997|title=Factories of Edessa|url=https://www.archaiologia.gr/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/18-6.pdf|journal=Archaiologia Elladas|volume=|pages=11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other smaller shareholders from [[Thessaloniki]], who wanted to develop the textile industry in [[Greece]]. The choice of location where the factory was built was because [[Edessa]]'s wider area was abundant in waterfalls where it would help to operate the engines as they were supported by waterworks. It's address was assigned to the experienced industrialist Iraklis Hatzidimoula&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Acne 1928-1950 ==
[[File:ΚΑΝΝΑΒΟΥΡΓΕΙΟ ΑΙΘΟΥΣΑ ΠΑΡΑΓΩΓΗΣ 2017.jpg|thumb|363x363px|The main building where ropes been created.]]
The full edge&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of the factory is placed in the period 1928 - 1940, during which it employs 150 workers (mainly from Edessa). Particularly during the interwar period, the factory covered the demand for fabrics and twine all over Greece. Coarse ropes went to [[Crete]] (the largest consumption center), to [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus]], while the thin ropes in [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]]. However, there was a stagnation in the distribution of products between October and March.

== Decline 1952-1966 ==
The loss of aquaculture acquis, the amount of debts to banks, shareholders' disputes, and government led to bankruptcy and closure of the factory in May 1966.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 100 workers of the Hemp Factory founded the "Production Cooperative [[Pella]]" and undertake its management. Later in 1967, the management committee asked I.S.R.S (Industrial Safety Regulation Staff) a loan to continue the factory operation, but in vain. The factory closed and the state became the owner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Educational and Entertainment Use ==

=== Start of Operation 1997 ===
At the end of 1990, after 40 years of abandonment, the complex was partially renovated by the municipality of Edessa where in 1997 a restaurant and leisure center served by a double lift along the cliff was constructed. Later, the Hemp Factory became part of the "Mill Rehabilitation Program" for the complete upgrading and refurbishment of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kannavourgio.gr/|title=Αρχική σελίδα - Πολυχώρος Κανναβουργείου|website=kannavourgio.gr|language=el-gr|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program included:&lt;ref name="typosthes.gr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.typosthes.gr/gr/perissotera/%CE%A4%CE%B1%CE%BE%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1/article/130265/i-viomihaniki-istoria-tis-edessas-zodaneuei-stin-periohi-ton-mulon-foto-/|title=Η βιομηχανική ιστορία της Έδεσσας "ζωντανεύει" στην περιοχή των Μύλων (ΦΩΤΟ)|website=www.typosthes.gr|language=el|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Remodeling of the Industrial complex
*Reconstruction of old Machine site and Shelters
*Establishment of Industrial Museum.
*Construction of 2 outdoor lifts to facilitate access
*Construction of sites for recreational and cultural use.

Upon completion of the rehabilitation, the site is re-opened as a Culture and Event site, focusing on highlighting the history of the factory. It has also been incorporated as a new section of the Edessa Water Museum.

=== Shut down in 2014-today===
After 17 years of continuous operation the center closes and the complex is deserted. The cost of reopening is high as debt and maintenance costs are high. Lifts have been deactivated since the end of 2013 to cut spending, which has subsequently proved to be fatal as it has reduced tourist traffic even further. There was an attempt to reopen in 2015 but unfortunately it did not favor. The complex was finally closed in December 2014 and its new owner is the Municipality of Edessa. Unfortunately, the site was not properly guarded and suffered huge damage.&lt;ref name="typosthes.gr"/&gt;

=== New Hemp Factory ===
The "'''New hemp factory'''" is the definition that refers to the complete reconstruction of the complex and the official establishment of the Edessa Industrial Museum. At the end of June 2018, the Hemp Factory and the surrounding area were integrated with the resources of the C.A.D.F. (Corporate Agreement for the Development Framework), so that it can be reopened and used as an event hall, while at the same time there will be an Industrial Museum where its equipment will be demonstrably functioning. There will also be a recreation area and a complete remodeling of the lifts and the surrounding buildings for the benefit of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tastv.gr/article/anavathmizetai-kannavoyrgeio-edessas-gia-politistiki-kai-toyristiki-hrisi-me-hrimatodotisi|title=ΑΝΑΒΑΘΜΙΖΕΤΑΙ ΤΟ ΚΑΝΝΑΒΟΥΡΓΕΙΟ ΈΔΕΣΣΑΣ ΓΙΑ ΠΟΛΙΤΙΣΤΙΚΗ ΚΑΙ ΤΟΥΡΙΣΤΙΚΗ ΧΡΗΣΗ ΜΕ ΧΡΗΜΑΤΟΔΟΤΗΣΗ ΑΠΟ ΤΟ ΥΠΟΥΡΓΕΙΟ ΟΙΚΟΝΟΜΙΑΣ {{!}} TASTV.gr {{!}} Τα νέα της Πέλλας LIVE|website=www.tastv.gr|language=el|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/971591/gallery/epikairothta/ellada/die3odos-gia-dwdeka-ktiria---fantasmata|title=Διέξοδος για δώδεκα κτίρια - φαντάσματα, του Γιώργου Λιάλιου {{!}} Kathimerini|access-date=2018-07-23|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenLDAP''' is a [[free software|free]], [[open-source software|open-source]] implementation of the [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP) developed by the OpenLDAP Project.  It is released under its own BSD-style license called the OpenLDAP Public License.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openldap.org/software/release/license.html |title=OpenLDAP, Public License for 2.4.39 |publisher=Openldap.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LDAP is a platform-independent protocol. Several common [[Linux]] distributions include OpenLDAP Software for LDAP support. The software also runs on [[BSD]]-variants, as well as [[AIX operating system|AIX]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[HP-UX]], [[macOS]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Microsoft Windows]] (NT and derivatives, e.g. 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, etc.), and [[z/OS]].

== History ==
The OpenLDAP project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openldap.org/project |title=OpenLDAP, Project |publisher=Openldap.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was started in 1998 by Kurt Zeilenga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openldap.org/project/kurt |title=OpenLDAP, Kurt D. Zeilenga |publisher=Openldap.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project started by cloning the LDAP reference source from the [[University of Michigan]] where a long-running project had supported development and evolution of the LDAP protocol until that project's final release in 1996.

{{As of|2015|5}}, the OpenLDAP project has four core team members: Howard Chu (chief architect),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Howard Chu |url=http://www.highlandsun.com/hyc |title=Howard's Miscellaneous Page |publisher=Highlandsun.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quanah Gibson-Mount, Hallvard Furuseth, and Kurt Zeilenga. There are numerous other important and active contributors including Luke Howard, Ryan Tandy, and Gavin Henry.  Past core team members include Pierangelo Masarati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.polimi.it/masarati/personal.html |title=Ando's Home Page |publisher=Aero.polimi.it |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
OpenLDAP has three main components:
* [[slapd]] – stand-alone LDAP [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]] and associated modules and tools
* libraries implementing the LDAP [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] and [[ASN.1]] Basic Encoding Rules (BER)
* client software: ldapsearch, ldapadd, ldapdelete, and others

Additionally, the OpenLDAP Project is home to a number of subprojects:
* JLDAP – LDAP class libraries for Java
* JDBC-LDAP – Java [[JDBC]] - LDAP Bridge driver
* ldapc++ – LDAP class libraries for [[C++]]
* [[Apache Fortress|Fortress]] - Role-based identity access management Java SDK
* [[Lightning Memory-Mapped Database|LMDB]] - Memory-mapped database library

==Backends==
===Overall concept===
Historically the OpenLDAP server (slapd, the Standalone LDAP Daemon) architecture was
split between a frontend which handles network access and protocol processing, and a
backend which deals strictly with data storage. This split design was a feature of the
original University of Michigan code written in 1996&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tux.org/pub/net/ldap/ldap-3.3.tar.Z&lt;/ref&gt; and carried on in all subsequent
OpenLDAP releases. The original code included one main database backend and two
experimental/demo backends. The architecture is modular and many
different backends are now available for interfacing to other technologies, not just
traditional databases.

Note: In older (1.x) releases, the terms "backend" and "database" were often used interchangeably.
To be precise, a "backend" is a class of storage interface, and a "database" is an instance of a
backend. The slapd server can use arbitrarily many backends at once, and can have arbitrarily
many instances of each backend (i.e., arbitrarily many databases) active at once.

===Available backends===
Currently 17 different backends are provided in the OpenLDAP distribution, and various
third parties are known to maintain other backends independently. The standard backends
are loosely organized into three different categories:
* Data storage backends – these actually store data
** back-bdb: the first transactional backend for OpenLDAP, built on [[Berkeley DB]]
** back-hdb: a variant of back-bdb that is fully hierarchical and supports subtree renames
** back-ldif: built on plain text [[LDIF]] files
** back-mdb: a transactional backend built on OpenLDAP's [[Lightning Memory-Mapped Database]] (LMDB)
** back-ndb: a transactional backend built on MySQL's NDB cluster engine
* Proxy backends – these act as gateways to other data storage systems
** back-ldap: simple proxy to other LDAP servers
** back-meta: proxy with meta-directory features
** back-passwd: uses a Unix system's passwd and group data
** back-relay: internally redirects to other slapd backends
** back-sql: talks to arbitrary SQL databases
* Dynamic backends – these generate data on the fly
** back-config: slapd configuration via LDAP
** back-dnssrv: Locates LDAP servers via DNS
** back-monitor: slapd statistics via LDAP
** back-null: a sink/no-op backend, analogous to Unix /dev/null
** back-perl: invokes arbitrary perl modules in response to LDAP requests
** back-shell: invokes shell scripts for LDAP requests
** back-sock: forwards LDAP requests over IPC to arbitrary daemons

Some backends available in older OpenLDAP releases have been retired from use,
most notably back-ldbm which was inherited from the original UMich code, and
back-tcl which was similar to back-perl and back-shell.

Support for other backends will soon be withdrawn as well. back-ndb is deprecated now since the partnership with MySQL that led to its development was terminated by Oracle after Oracle acquired MySQL. back-bdb and back-hdb will be deprecated in favor of back-mdb soon since back-mdb is superior in all aspects of performance, reliability, and manageability.

In practice, backends like -perl, -shell, and -sock allow interfacing to any arbitrary programming language, thus providing limitless capabilities for customization and expansion. In effect the slapd server becomes an RPC engine with a compact,
well-defined and ubiquitous API.

==Overlays==
===Overall concept===
Ordinarily an LDAP request is received by the frontend, decoded, and then passed to a backend for processing. When the backend completes a request, it returns a result to the frontend, which then sends the result to the LDAP client. An overlay is a piece of code that can be inserted between the frontend and the backend. It is thus able to intercept requests and trigger other actions on them before the backend receives them, and it can also likewise act on the backend's results before they reach the frontend. Overlays have complete access to the slapd internal APIs, and so can invoke anything the frontend or other backends could perform. Multiple overlays can be used at once, forming a stack of modules between the frontend and the backend.

Overlays provide a simple means to augment the functionality of a database without requiring that an entirely new backend be written, and allow new functionalities to be added in compact, easily debuggable and maintainable modules. Since the introduction
of the overlay feature in OpenLDAP 2.2 many new overlays have been contributed from the OpenLDAP community.

===Available overlays===
Currently there are 21 overlays in the core OpenLDAP distribution, with another 15 overlays in the user-contributed code section, and more awaiting approval for inclusion.

{{Col-begin|width=100%}}
{{Col-break|width=50%}}
* The core overlays include:
** accesslog: log server activity in another LDAP database, for LDAP-accessible logging
** auditlog: log server activity in a flat text file
** chain: intercept referrals and chain them instead; code is part of back-ldap
** collect: implement X.500-style collective attributes (aka Netscape Class Of Service)
** constraint: restrict the acceptable values for particular attributes
** dds: dynamic data service – short-lived, self-expiring entries
** deref: return information about entries referenced in a given search result
** dyngroup: simple dynamic group support
** dynlist: more sophisticated dynamic group support plus more
** memberof: support for memberOf and similar backlink attributes
** pcache: cache search results, mainly to improve performance for proxied servers
** ppolicy: LDAP Password Policy – password quality, expiration, etc.
** refint: referential integrity
** retcode: set predetermined return codes for various operations; used for client debugging
** rwm: rewrite module, for various alterations of LDAP data
** seqmod: serialize writes to individual entries
** sssvlv: Server Side Sorting and Virtual List Views

==Other modules==
Backends and overlays are the two most commonly used types of modules. Backends were typically built into the slapd binary,
but they may also be built as dynamically loaded modules, and overlays are usually built as dynamic modules. In addition,
slapd supports dynamic modules for implementing new LDAP syntaxes, matching rules, controls, and extended operations, as
well as for implementing custom access control mechanisms and password hashing mechanisms.

OpenLDAP also supports SLAPI, the plugin architecture used by Sun and Netscape/Fedora/Red Hat. In current releases,
the SLAPI framework is implemented inside a slapd overlay. While many plugins written for Sun/Netscape/Fedora/Red Hat
are compatible with OpenLDAP, very few members of the OpenLDAP community use SLAPI.

===Available modules===
* Native slapd modules
** acl/posixgroup – support posixGroup membership in access controls
** comp_match – support component-based matching
** kinit – maintain/refresh a Kerberos TGT for slapd
** passwd/ – additional password hashing mechanisms. Currently includes [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], Netscape, [[RADIUS]], and [[SHA-2]].
* SLAPI plugins
** addrdnvalue – add RDN value to an entry if it was omitted in an Add request

==Replication==
OpenLDAP supports replication using Content Synchronization as specified in RFC 4533. This spec is hereafter referred to as "syncrepl". In addition to the base specification, an enhancement known as delta-syncrepl is also supported. Additional enhancements have been implemented to support [[multi-master replication]].

===syncrepl===
The basic synchronization operation is described in RFC 4533. The protocol is defined such that a persistent database of changes is not required.  Rather the set of changes is implied via change sequence number (CSN) information stored in each entry and optimized via an optional session log which is particularly useful to track recent deletes.  The model of operation is that a replication client (consumer) sends a "content synchronizing search" to a replication server (provider).  The consumer can provide a cookie in this search (especially when it has been in sync with the provider previously). In the OpenLDAP implementation of the RFC 4533, this cookie includes the latest CSN that has been received from the provider (called the contextCSN).

The provider then returns as search results (or, see optimization below, sync info replies) the present (unchanged entry only used in the present phase of the refresh stage) (no attributes), added, modified (represented in the refresh phase as an add with all current attributes), or deleted (no attributes) entries to put the consumer into a synchronized state based on what is known via their cookie.  If the cookie is absent or indicates that the consumer is totally out of sync, then the provider will, in the refresh stage, send an add for each entry it has.  In the ideal case, the refresh stage of the response contains only a delete phase with just a small set of adds (including those that represent the current result of modifies) and deletes that have occurred since the time the consumer last synchronized with the provider.   However, due to limited session log state (also non persistent) kept in the provider, a present phase may be required, particularly including the presentation of all unchanged entries as a means (inefficient) of implying what has been deleted in the provider since the consumer last synchronized.

The search can be done in either refresh or refreshAndPersist mode, which implies what stages occur.  The refresh stage always occurs first.  During the refresh stage, two phases may occur: present and delete, where present always occurs before delete.  The phases are delimited via a sync info response that specifies which phase is completed.  The refresh and persist stages are also delimited via such sync info response.  An optional optimization to more compactly represent a group of entries that are to be presented or deleted is to use a sync info response containing a syncIdSet that identifies the list of entryUUID values of those entries.

The present phase is differentiated from the delete phase as follows.  Entries that present unchanged entries may only be returned in the present phase.  Entries that delete entries may only be provided in the delete phase.  In either phase, add entries (including adds that represent all current attributes of modified entries) can be returned.  At the end of a present phase, each entry that the consumer has that was not identified in an add entry or present response during the present phase is implicitly no longer in the provider and thus must be deleted at the consumer so as to synchronize the consumer with the provider.

Once the persist stage begins, the provider sends search results that indicate only the add, modify and delete of entries (no present unchanged entry indications) for those entries changed since the refresh stage completed.  The persist stage continues indefinitely, meaning that search has no final "done" response.  By contrast, in the refresh mode only a refresh stage occurs and such stage completes with a done response that also ends the present or delete phase (whichever phase was currently active).

===delta-syncrepl===
This protocol keeps a persistent database of write accesses (changes) and can represent each modify precisely (meaning only the attributes that have changed). It is still built on the standard syncrepl specification, which always sends changes as complete entries. But in delta-syncrepl, the transmitted entries are actually sent from a log database, where each change in the main database is recorded as a log entry. The log entries are recorded using the LDAP Log Schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-chu-ldap-logschema-00 |title=draft-chu-ldap-logschema-00 - A Schema for Logging the LDAP Protocol |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4273">The '''Pinelli–Walckenaer Atlas''' is a late 14th-century atlas of [[portolan chart]]s, explicitly dated 1384, primarily composed by an anonymous [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] cartographer, and held by the [[British Library]].

== Background ==
[[image:Pinelli-Walckenaer Atlas (p. 3).jpg|thumb|250px|Third sheet of the Pinelli-Walckenaer (North Atlantic and West Mediterranean)]]

The Pinelli-Walckenaer atlas was primarily composed by an anonymous [[Venice|Venetian]] cartographer (although some suggest [[Genoa|Genoese]]&lt;ref&gt;See D'Avezac, 1847: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pUwSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 42])&lt;/ref&gt;), probably the same person who made the similar [[Corbitis Atlas]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1987: p. 419-20; 2011: [http://www.maphistory.info/PortolanAttributions.html#14ven sec.])&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pinelli-Walckenaer atlas is explicitly dated 1384 (according to its calendar), but some scholars believe it to have been made a little later (c. 1410).&lt;ref&gt;D'Avezac (1847: p. 66) and Pujades (2007: p. 494b) vote for an early date 1384 or 1385, Campbell (2011) suggests the first part of the 15th century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the charts in the atlas (the specific charts for the Aegean and the Adriatic) were definitely later additions by someone else and not part of the original atlas. One suggestion is that the latter two charts were made by the Venetian cartographer [[Francesco de Cesanis]] around 1434.&lt;ref&gt;Pujades (2007); Campbell (2011: [http://www.maphistory.info/PortolanAttributions.html#vensecond 2nd quarter])&lt;/ref&gt;  The calendar itself might date from 1458.&lt;ref&gt;D'Avezac (1847: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pUwSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 66])&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The name of the atlas refers to its previous owners.  It was in the possession of the Pinelli family of [[Venice]], which owned the atlas for many years, until it was purchased in 1790 by the Baron [[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;D'Avezac (1847: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pUwSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 36]) Beazley (1906: [https://books.google.com/books?id=64MYAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA527#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 527])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pinelli-Walckenaer atlas is currently held by the [[British Library]] (Add MS, 19510) in [[London]].

== Features ==
The Pinelli-Walckenaer atlas is composed of seven sheets:

* 1. astronomical calendar
* 2. South Atlantic (Spain and northwest Africa)
* 3. North Atlantic and west Mediterranean (incl. British isles)
* 4. East Mediterranean and Black Sea
* 5. Central Mediterranean
* 6. Adriatic Sea
* 7. Aegean Sea

The first calendar sheet explicitly dates the atlas 1384.  Sheets 1-5 were made by the same anonymous person in the late 14th or early 15th century, while sheets 6-7 were made by someone else (possibly Cesanis) in the second quarter of the 15th century.

The '''Stroganov Chronicle''', also known under the name '''"On Capturing of the Siberian Land"''' (''Строгановская летопись'', ''"О взятии Сибирской земли"'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) is one of the earliest [[Siberian Chronicles]].

There is no unanimous opinion in the [[Russia]]n scientific community with regards to the exact date of this [[chronicle]]'s compilation. It is generally considered that it was written either in 1620–1630 or 1668–1673. Some [[historian]]s believe that parts of the Stroganov Chronicle are based on the [[Yesipov Chronicle]], which was written in 1636. The Stroganov Chronicle is based on [[Annals|annalistic]] data (which didn't survive to this day) and materials of the Stroganovs' [[archive]]s, including their correspondence with [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]]'s [[druzhina]]. The Stroganov Chronicle tells in great detail about the events of the early stage of the [[annexation]] of [[Siberia]] in favor of [[Russia]]. The Stroganovs' initiative to organize Yermak's campaign is put in the forefront in this chronicle.

The '''Sweet Auburn Curb Market''' is a historic [[municipal market]] located at 209 Edgewood Avenue, S.W., in downtown [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The market operates as a [[nonprofit]] enterprise, with the building leased from the City of Atlanta and the individual vendors sub-leasing. 

==History==
The market was originally established in 1918 on land cleared by the [[Great Atlanta fire of 1917]]. The market, set up in a huge tent, was an immediate success, bringing urban consumers direct access to farmers and their products. Wishing to give the curb market a more permanent home, the Atlanta Woman's Club raised money for a fireproof brick and concrete building which opened on May 1, 1924, and was called the Municipal Market of Atlanta. At the time, it was located in the exact geographic center of Atlanta and quickly became "the place to shop" for every Atlantan. At that time, Atlanta was still living under [[racial segregation]] and whites owned shops inside the market,  blacks were only permitted to sell from stalls lining the curb. 

In 2010, the Municipal Market received both CDBG funding and a Stimulus Grant for a total of 1.8 million dollars. As part of basic maintenance and updates, a portion of the funds were used to replace the sign damaged by the tornado of 2008. Because the management was able to locate the original exterior sign and have it repaired and displayed inside the building, the city's department of Urban Design approved the creation of a replica of the sign to be displayed on the Edgewood Ave side of the building. It was litty. 

The Municipal Market was called the Sweet Auburn Curb Market from 1998 - Present. However, in 2018, as part of the 100 year anniversary, the Municipal Market Company decided to rebrand the market to reflect the original name.

Going forward, the public market will reflect the original name "Municipal Market." But it will forever be known to locals as the "Curb Market."

The market was the filming location for a scene in the 2014 film, ''[[Ride Along (film)|Ride Along]]'', which takes place and was filmed in Atlanta. It is also featured in a network television series, "Kevin (Probably) Saves The World". This was filmed in 2018.

==Tenants==
Vendors within the market are individually owned businesses and offer goods including meat, fish, baked goods, vegetables, fruit, nuts, coffee, flowers, plants, [[Caribbean]] groceries, prescription medication and more. Additionally, there are many restaurants located in the market, including several that have gone on to start stand-alone restaurants, such as Grindhouse Killer Burgers and Bell Street Burritos.  The Market is seen by some as a place to incubate a small business.&lt;ref name=AJC&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonner|first=Jeanne|title=Sweet Auburn Curb Market viewed as business incubator|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/business/sweet-auburn-curb-market-viewed-as-business-incuba/nQnzB/|publisher=Atlanta Journal Constitution|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Thomson''' &lt;small&gt;[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[FSA Scot]]&lt;/small&gt; (10 November 1768 – 2 October 1852) was a Scottish advocate, antiquarian and archivist who served as [[Principal Clerk of Session]] (1828–1852) and as secretary of the literary section of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (1812–20).&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waterston |first1=Charles D. |last2=Macmillan Shearer |first2=A. |title=Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002: Biographical Index |url=http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/fells_indexp2.pdf |accessdate=23 December 2010 |volume=2 |date=2006 |publisher=[[The Royal Society of Edinburgh]] |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-902198-84-5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004113303/http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/fells_indexp2.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas Thomson Lauder.jpg|thumb|Thomas Thomson, a portrait by [[Robert Scott Lauder]]]]

==Life==
Thomas Thomson was born on 10 November 1768, the eldest son of Thomas Thomson, minister of [[Dailly]] in Ayrshire, by his second wife, Mary, daughter of Francis Hay. [[John Thomson of Duddingston]] was a younger brother. After attending the parish school of Dailly, he entered the [[University of Glasgow]] at age 13, where he graduated M.A. on 27 April 1789. He then for two years attended classes in theology and law; and went to Edinburgh, where he was admitted advocate on 10 December 1793. He became a close friend of [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Thomson, Thomas (1768-1852)|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson acquired a practice at the bar, particularly in cases demanding legal learning. Legal and historical antiquities later absorbed his attention. His main role was deputy clerk-register of Scotland, a new post to which he was appointed on 30 June 1806. His work mainly consisted of reforming the system of public registries and the method of the custody of records, in rendering these records accessible to research, in rescuing and repairing old records, and in editing the acts of the Scottish parliament and other governmental records under the authority of the [[Record Commission]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In February 1828 Thomson was chosen one of the principal clerks of the [[court of session]]. On the institution of the [[Bannatyne Club]] in 1823 he had been chosen vice-president, and on the death of Scott in 1832 he succeeded as president. Thomson, however, was lax on finance. After an inquiry into the accounts of the register office in 1839 he was removed from the office of deputy clerk-register.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; At this time he was living at 127 George Street in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.nls.uk/83401875|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|page=190|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medallion head of Thomas Thomson in Dean Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Medallion head of Thomas Thomson in Dean Cemetery]]

Thomson died at Shrub Hill, [[Leith Walk]], Edinburgh, on 2 October 1852.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He is buried in [[Dean Cemetery]] in the section known as "Lord's Row".

He was succeeded as Principal Clerk of Session by [[Cosmo Innes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andywightman.com/docs/Cosmo_Innes_Oxford_biog.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:The grave of Thomas Thomson, Dean Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The grave of Thomas Thomson, Dean Cemetery]]
For research in the register office Thomson prepared some manuals:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;
 
*"A Continuation of the Retours of Service to the Chancery Office from the Union, A.D. 1707"
*"An Abbreviate or Digest of the Registers of Sasines, General and Particular, arranged in Counties with relative Indexes, from the 1st of January 1781"
*"An Abbreviate of Adjudications from 1st January 1781 to 1830"
*"An Abbreviate of Inhibitions, General and Particular, arranged in Counties, from 1st January 1781 to 1830"

His various ''Reports'' appeared from 1807. Of works published by Thomson for the [[Record Commission]], the major one was ''The Acts of the Parliament of Scotland'', 1424–1707, vols 2–11 (1814–1824). Vol. 1, containing the ''Regiam Majestatem'', with the oldest recorded Proceedings and Acts of Parliament, was published last; and, although almost complete before 1841, when Thomson's connection with the register office ceased, did not appear until 1844, when it was edited, with additions, by [[Cosmo Innes]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Other works published under the authority of the Record Commission were:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;
*''Inquisitionum ad Capellam Domini Regis Retornatarum, quæ in Publicis Archivis Scotiæ adhuc servantur, Abbreviatio'' (1811, 1816), 3 vols
*''Registrum Magni Sigilli Regum Scotorum in Archivis Publicis asservatum, mcccvi–mccccxxiv'' (1814)
*''The Acts of the Lords Auditors of Causes and Complaints, mcccclxvi–mccccxciv'' (1839)
*the ''Acts of the Lords of Council in Civil Causes, mcccclxxviii–mccccxcv'' (1839)

Other related works mainly derived from the same sources, were:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

*''A Compilation of the Forms of Process in the Court of Session during the earlier periods after its establishment, with the Variations which they have since undergone'' (Edinburgh, 1839)
*''A Collection of Inventories and other Records of the Royal Wardrobe and Jewel House, and of the Artillery and Munition in some of the Royal Castles, 1488–1606'' (Edinburgh, 1815)
*''Chamberlain Rolls'', vols 1–2, 1326–1406 (1817); vol. 3, 1406–1459 (1845, for the [[Bannatyne Club]])

Thomson also edited the ''Memoirs'' of [[Sir George Mackenzie]] (Edinburgh, 1821); and ''Memoirs of the Lives and Characters of the Right Honourable George Baillie of Jerviswood, and of Lady Grissell, by their Daughter, Lady Murray'' (Edinburgh, 1822); and he published:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

*''Inventory of Work done for the State by his Majesty's Printer in Scotland, December 1642–October 1647'' (Edinburgh, 1815), on Evan Tyler
*''Ane Addicioun of Scottis Cronikles and Deidis. A Short Chronicle of the Reign of James the Second, King of Scots. From Asloan's Manuscript in the Auchinleck Library'' (Edinburgh, 1819)
*''Menu de la Maison de la Royne faict par Mons. de Pinguillon, MDLXII'' (Edinburgh, 1824)

For the [[Bannatyne Club]] he also edited:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

*''Alexander Myln. Vitæ Dunkeldensis Ecclesiæ Episcoporum'' (1823)
*''Discours particulier d'Escosse, escrit en 1559'' (1824)
*''The History and Life of King James the Sext'' (1825)
*''Memoirs of his own Life by Sir James Melville of Halhill'' (1827)
*''Memoirs of his own Life and Times by Sir James Turner'' (1829)
*''The History of Scotland'', by [[John Lesley]], bishop of Ross (1830)
*''Collection of Ancient Scottish Prophecies in Alliterative Verse'' (1833)
*''Diurnal of Remarkable Occurrents from the Pollok MS'' (1833)
*''The Ragman Rolls, 1291–1296'' (1834)
*''The Book of the Universal Kirk of Scotland, 1560–1618'', 3 vols (1839–45)
*''A Diary of the Public Correspondence of Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall'' (1843) 
*''Munimenta Vetustiora Comitatus de Mortoun'', and ''Original Letters and Papers in the Archives of the Earls of Morton'' (1852)

In 1800 Thomson was chosen to edit an edition of [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|Lord Hailes]]'s ''Works''. It never appeared; but the edition of Hailes's ''Annals'' and ''Historical Tracts'' (1819) acknowledged Thomson's help. A close associate of [[Francis Jeffrey]] and other projectors of the ''Edinburgh Review'', Thomson contributed three papers (on [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s ''Temple of Nature'' (1803); [[Anna Seward]]'s ''Memories of the Past'' (1804); and [[John Mason Good]]'s ''Life'' of [[Alexander Geddes]] (1804)); and occasionally undertook the editorship for Jeffrey.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Xenophobia''' is the fear and distrust of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia |title=Xenophobia – definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary |work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia |title=Xenophobia – Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com |work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can involve [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] and can manifest itself in suspicion of the activities of others, and a desire to eliminate their presence to secure a presumed purity and may relate to a fear of losing national, ethnic or racial identity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. Pp. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia is a political term and not a recognized medical [[phobia]].{{Needs citation|date=September 2018}}

Xenophobia can also be exhibited in the form of an "uncritical exaltation of another culture" in which a culture is ascribed "an unreal, stereotyped and exotic quality".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The terms xenophobia and [[racism]] are sometimes confused and used interchangeably because people who share a national origin may also belong to the same [[race (human classification)|race]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO – Xenophobia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/xenophobia/ |title=Xenophobia |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, xenophobia is usually distinguished by opposition to foreign culture.&lt;ref name="UNESCO – Xenophobia" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
Dictionary definitions of ''xenophobia'' include: "deep-rooted fear towards foreigners" (Oxford English Dictionary; OED), and "fear of the unfamiliar" (Webster's).&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, Dorset and Baber, Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] words ξένος (''xenos''), meaning "strange", "foreigner", and φόβος (''phobos''), meaning "fear".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Standard English Dictionary' (OED). Oxford Press, 2004, CDROM version.&lt;/ref&gt;

A scholarly definition of xenophobia, according to Andreas Wimmer, is "an element of a political struggle about who has the right to be cared for by the state and society: a fight for the collective goods of the modern state." In other words, xenophobia arises when people feel that their rights to benefit from the government is being subverted by other people's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wimmer |first=Andreas |year=1997 |title=Explaining xenophobia and racism: A critical review of current research approaches |journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=17 |doi=10.1080/01419870.1997.9993946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
An early example of xenophobic sentiment in [[Western culture]] is the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] denigration of foreigners as "[[barbarian]]s", the belief that the Greek people and culture were superior to all others, and the subsequent conclusion that barbarians were naturally meant to be enslaved.&lt;ref name="GreeksBarbarians"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=z3VmQB99c5YC |title=Greeks and Barbarians |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |author=Harrison, Thomas |year=2002 |page=3 |isbn=978-0-415-93959-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/xenophobia-examples.htm |title=Xenophobia – Examples in World History |work=Medindia |access-date=2017-12-06 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] also held notions of superiority over all other peoples, such as in a speech attributed to [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 191 BC)|Manius Acilius]], "There, as you know, there were Macedonians and Thracians and Illyrians, all most warlike nations, here Syrians and Asiatic Greeks, the most worthless peoples among mankind and born for [[slavery]]."&lt;ref name="Invention Racism"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=jfylyRawl8EC |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Isaac, Benjamin H. |year=2006 |page=317 |isbn=978-0-691-12598-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the majority of the country's population being of mixed ([[Pardo]]), African, or indigenous heritage, depictions of non-European Brazilians on the programming of most national television networks is scarce and typically relegated for musicians/their shows. In the case of [[telenovella]]s, Brazilians of [[dark skin|darker skin]] tone are typically depicted as housekeepers or in positions of lower socioeconomic standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isc.temple.edu/evanson/brazilhistory/Bahia.htm |title=Instructional Support Center |accessdate=17 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121024219/http://isc.temple.edu/evanson/brazilhistory/Bahia.htm |archivedate=21 November 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
[[Muslim]] and [[Sikhism in Canada|Sikh Canadian]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have faced [[racism]] and [[discrimination]] within recent years, especially after 2001, and the spill over effect of the United States’ [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/09/11/911-muslim-women-discrimination_n_957305.html |title=9/11: Women In The Fight Against Discrimination |website=HuffPost |access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 survey from The Environics Institute, which was a follow-up to a study conducted 10 years prior that there may be discriminating attitudes that may be a residual of the effects of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Environics Institute: Survey of Muslims in Canada |url=http://www.environicsinstitute.org/uploads/institute-projects/survey%20of%20muslims%20in%20canada%202016%20-%20final%20report.pdf |publisher=The Environics Institute |accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to opinions on both Sikh's and Muslims, a poll done by [[Maclean's]] revealed that only 28% of Canadians view [[Islam]] favourably, and only 30% viewed the Sikh religion favourably. 45% of respondents believed Islam encourages violence. In [[Quebec]] in particular, only 17% of respondents had a favourable view of [[Muslims]]&lt;ref name="macleans.ca"&gt;{{cite web |last=Geddes |first=John |title=What Canadians think of Sikhs, Jews, Christians, Muslims . . . |website=Maclean's |date=April 28, 2009 |url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/what-canadians-think-of-sikhs-jews-christians-muslims/ |access-date=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Racism in Mexico}}
Racism in Mexico has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDF1330F932A25755C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 The World; Racism? Mexico's in Denial.]", ''The New York Times'', June 11, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Mexicans with light skin tones had absolute control over dark skinned Amerindians due to the structure of the Spanish colonial caste system. When a Mexican of a darker-skinned tone marries one of a lighter skinned-tone, it is common for them say that they are " 'making the race better' (''mejorando la raza'')." This can be interpreted as a self-attack on their ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_2081.shtml Racism in Mexico?]", The Final Call, June 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Despite improving economic and social conditions of Indigenous Mexicans, discrimination against Indigenous Mexicans continues to this day and there are few laws to protect Indigenous Mexicans from discrimination. Violent attacks against indigenous Mexicans are moderately common and many times go unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=294476 |title=Empresario agrede a valet parking, se ampara y evita la cárcel |author=La Redacción |work=Proceso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Venezuela ====
When the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]] started, the Spanish enlisted the [[Llanero]]s, playing on their dislike of the ''[[Criollo (people)|criollos]]'' of the independence movement. José Tomás Boves led an army of llaneros which routinely killed white Venezuelans. After several more years of war, which killed half of [[Venezuela]]'s white population, the country achieved independence from Spain in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpr.org/knowledge/businessguides/prlandscape-venezuela.pdf |title=globalpr.org |accessdate=17 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617124314/http://www.globalpr.org/knowledge/businessguides/prlandscape-venezuela.pdf |archivedate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/1491 |title=A First-Hand Impression of the Venezuelan Opposition |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern over Japanese ethnic and immigrant groups during the Second World War prompted the Canadian and U.S. governments to intern most of their ethnically Japanese populations in the western portions of North America. As in most countries, many people in the U.S. continue to be xenophobic against other races. In the view of a network of scores of US civil rights and human rights organizations, "Discrimination permeates all aspects of life in the United States, and extends to all communities of color." Discrimination against racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, especially when it comes to [[African Americans]], is widely acknowledged. Members of every major American ethnic and religious minority have perceived discrimination in their dealings with other minority racial and religious groups. Philosopher [[Cornel West]] has stated that "racism is an integral element within the very fabric of American culture and society. It is embedded in the country's first collective definition, enunciated in its subsequent laws, and imbued in its dominant way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Cornel |title=Prophesy Deliverance!: An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity |date=2002 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Trump signing order January 27.jpg|thumb|U.S. President Donald Trump signing the original travel ban (Executive Order 13769)]]

After [[Donald Trump]] took presidential office in 2017, he repeatedly attempted to enact a [[Executive Order 13769|travel ban]] on originally seven countries ([[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Yemen]], [[Syria]] and [[Libya]]) which were listed as "countries of concern" by [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Jeh Johnson]] under the [[Obama administration]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Department of Homeland Security |url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/02/18/dhs-announces-further-travel-restrictions-visa-waiver-program |date=February 18, 2016 |title=DHS Announces Further Travel Restrictions for the Visa Waiver Program |access-date=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/158/text |title=H.R.158 – Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 |year=2015 |publisher=Congress.gov |access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later changed to six in a revision that removed Iraq in part due to criticism that the original order overlooked the country’s role in fighting [[Islamic terrorism]] and barred entry even to the Iraqi interpreters who had been embedded with US forces in the region.&lt;ref name="Siddiqui" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38798588 |title=US travel ban: Why these seven countries? |date=January 30, 2017 |publisher=BBC News |last1=Goodman |first1=Jack |accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khizr and Ghazala Khan|Khizr Khan]], the father of [[United States Army]] Captain [[Humayun Khan (soldier)|Humayun Khan]], described it in a CNN interview as a continuation of what he called "Trump's xenophobic rhetoric"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump's ban is disguise for xenophobia |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/29/opinions/trump-ban-xenophobia-disguise-amanullah/index.html |accessdate=6 September 2017 |date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the order was described as xenophobic by [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=xenophobic inhumane and just plain stupid |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/03/xenophobic-inhumane-and-just-plain-stupid/ |accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was also criticized for [[Islamophobia|targeting exclusively Muslim majority countries]].&lt;ref name="Siddiqui"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/06/new-trump-travel-ban-muslim-majority-countries-refugees |title=Trump travel ban: new order targeting six Muslim-majority countries signed |last=Siddiqui |first=Sabrina |date=2017-03-06 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-08-01 |last2=York |first2=Lauren Gambino Oliver Laughland in New |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In defense of this order, Trump's press secretary [[Sean Spicer]] cited these existing restrictions as evidence that the executive order was based on outstanding policies saying that the seven targeted countries were said to be "countries of particular concern" by the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=ShelbourneMallory20170129&gt;{{cite news |last=Shelbourne |first=Mallory |title=Spicer: Obama administration originally flagged 7 countries in Trump's order |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/316733-spicer-obama-administration-originally-flagged-7-countries |newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | date=January 29, 2017 |accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Trump stated his policy was "similar" to an order in 2011 signed by [[Barack Obama]] that "banned visa for refugees from Iraq", where the number of [[Refugees of Iraq|refugees from Iraq]] dropped from 18,000 to 9,000 as a result of the suspension.&lt;ref name=ShelbourneMallory20170129 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blaine |first1=Kyle |last2=Horowitz |first2=Julia |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/how-the-trump-administration-chose-the-7-countries/index.html |title=How the Trump administration chose the 7 countries in the immigration executive order |publisher=CNN |date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though others saw the connection between these two policies as tenuous at best.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/donald-trump/why-comparing-trumps-and-obamas-immigration-restri/ |title=Why comparing Trump's and Obama's immigration restrictions is flawed |last=Qiu |first=Linda |date=January 30, 2017 |website=[[PolitiFact.com]] | access-date=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Peskin |first1=Sara Manning |title=Trump’s Immigration Ban vs. Obama’s 2011 Policy |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-immigration-ban-vs-obamas-2011-policy_us_58b1cc3de4b0e5fdf61972b3 |accessdate=15 December 2017 |date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991–92, [[Bhutan]] is said to have deported between 10,000 and 100,000 ethnic Nepalis ([[Lhotshampa]]). The actual number of refugees that were initially deported is debated by both sides.

A number of discriminatory laws against [[Chinese Indonesian#Post-independence and New Order Era|Chinese Indonesians]] were enacted by the government of [[Indonesia]]. In 1959, President [[Sukarno]] approved [[PP 10/1959]] that forced Chinese Indonesians to close their businesses in rural areas and relocate into urban areas. Moreover, political pressures in the 1970s and 1980s restricted the role of the Chinese Indonesian in politics, academics, and the military. As a result, they were thereafter constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In 1998, Indonesia riots over higher food prices and rumors of hoarding by merchants and shopkeepers often degenerated into anti-Chinese attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1998/02/24/qanda.t_2.php|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|website=www.iht.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(There are no laws within the Kingdom of Thailand which outlaws racial discrimination inclusive of racist cliches known in the Western world. Unlike its neighboring nations which have been under [[colonialism]], Thailand's heritage as an uncolonized state also shaped its existing laws unlike its Westernized counterparts after decolonization. This also includes signage promoting [[racial segregation]] as done in the United States prior to [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964]] and South Africa under [[Apartheid]].)

Although Thailand has incorporated certain Western ideals concerning beauty, Asian attitudes regarding skin tones have been around for a long time. The 20 million [[Isan]] population for instance, many of whom are of [[Lao people|Laotian]] and [[Khmer people|Khmer]] descent, traditionally had darker skin and studies show that many view themselves as less desirable than those with lighter skin. [[Skin whitening]] products have proven increasingly popular in most of Asia, including Thailand and are marketed in such a way as to promote light skin as beautiful and desirable.&lt;ref name="int-res"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/esep2013/13/e013p027.pdf |date=6 August 2013 |title=Thailand: beauty and globalized self-identity through cosmetic therapy and skin lightening |author=Napat Chaipraditkul |journal=Ethics in Science and Environmental Politics |volume=13 |pages=27–37 |doi=10.3354/esep00134 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Racism in Germany}}
The period after losing [[World War I]] led to an increased use of anti-Semitism and other racism in political discourse, for example among the right-wing [[Freikorps]], emotions that finally culminated in the ascent of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. The [[Nazi racial policy]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] against Jews and other non-Aryans represented the most explicit racist policies in Europe in the twentieth century. These laws deprived all Jews including even half-Jews and quarter-Jews as well as other non-Aryans from German citizenship. Jews official title became "subject of the state". The Nuremberg Race Laws forbid racially mixed sexual relations and marriage between Aryans and at first Jews but was later extended to "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring".&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Burleigh |title=The Racial State: Germany 1933–1945 |date=7 November 1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-39802-2 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interracial relations became a criminal and punishable offence under the race laws known as "racial pollution" [[Rassenschande]].&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S.

As in other European countries, the [[Romani people]] faced disadvantages, including unequal treatment, discrimination, segregation and harassment. Negative stereotypes are often linked to Romani unemployment and reliance on state benefits.&lt;ref name="FRA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2013-thematic-situation-report-3_en_1.pdf |title=Racism, discrimination, intolerance and extremism: learning from experiences in Greece and Hungary |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) |date=December 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2009 nine attacks took place against Romani in Hungary, resulting in six deaths and multiple injuries.

==== Italy ====
{{Main|Racism in Italy}}
[[Anti-Roma]] sentiment exists in [[Italy]] and takes the form of hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed at Romani people. There's no reliable data for the total number of Roma people living in Italy, but estimates put it between 140,000 and 170,000. Many national and local political leaders engaged in rhetoric during 2007 and 2008 that maintained that the extraordinary rise in crime at the time was mainly a result of uncontrolled immigration of people of Roma origin from recent [[European Union]] member state Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hammarberg, "Memorandum following the visit to Italy on 19–20 June 2008," the [[Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights]], CommDH(2008)18, para. 26, 28 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; National and local leaders declared their plans to expel Roma from settlements in and around major cities and to deport illegal immigrants. The mayors of Rome and Milan signed "Security Pacts" in May 2007 that "envisaged the forced eviction of up to 10,000 Romani people."&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]], The State of the World’s Human Rights 2008: Italy, POL 10/001/2008, June 2008, pp. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a May 2008 poll 68% of Italians, wanted to see all of the country's approximately 150,000 Gypsies, many of them Italian citizens, expelled.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/17/italy 68% of Italians want Roma expelled – poll], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Tom Kington, Rome, 17 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The survey, published as mobs in Naples burned down Gypsy camps that month, revealed that the majority also wanted all Gypsy camps in Italy to be demolished.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

==== Netherlands ====
{{Further|Antisemitism in the Netherlands}}
In the early 2012 the Dutch right-wing [[Party for Freedom]] established an [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|anti-Slavic]] (predominantly [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]]) and  [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani]] website, where native [[Dutch people]] could air their frustration about losing their job because of cheaper workers from [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] and other non-Germanic [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries. This led to commentaries involving [[hate speech]] and other racial prejudice mainly against Poles and Roma, but also aimed at other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/news/115208 Dutch far right opens anti-Polish hotline: ''"Did you lose your job to a Pole, a Bulgarian, a Romanian, or any other Central or Eastern European? We would like to hear about it".'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], antisemitic incidents, from verbal abuse to violence, are reported, allegedly connected with Islamic youth, mostly boys from [[Morocco|Moroccan]] descent. A phrase made popular during football matches against the so-called Jewish football club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] has been adopted by Muslim youth and is frequently heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations: "Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!" According to the Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel, a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, in 2009, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]], the city that is home to most of the approximately 40,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], was said to be doubled compared to 2008.&lt;ref name="nrc.nl"&gt;Berkhout, Karel.

{{Further|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that [[anti-semitism]] was common among Norwegian [[Muslim]]s. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students," and "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]." Additionally that "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews" and that it says in "the Quran that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews." Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also told that his child after school had been taken by a Muslim mob (though managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and hanged because he was a Jew".&lt;ref name="Jødiske barn blir hetset 2010"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=NRK |title=Nett-TV: Lørdagsrevyen 13.03.10 Jødiske barn blir hetset |date=March 13, 2010 |url=https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317183545/https://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057/ |archive-date=March 17, 2010 |dead-url=yes |language=no |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the [[Russian Empire]] consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions.  Many pogroms accompanied the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former [[Russian Empire]]; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism |title=anti-Semitism |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary L Rubinstein, Daniel C Cohn-Sherbok, Abraham J Edelheit, William D Rubinstein, ''The Jews in the Modern World'', Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk told ''Die Presse'', an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being "harassed and physically attacked" by "people from the Middle East", although he added that only a small number of Malmö's 40,000 Muslims "exhibit hatred of Jews". Sieradzk also stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malmö to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment.

In addition to the many victims among the various tribes of the northern and southern regions of the country that have perished in the ongoing conflict, [[White people|white]] foreigners residing or visiting Ivory Coast have also been subjected to violent attacks. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the Ivory Coast government is guilty of fanning ethnic hatred for its own political ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/Africa/1932930.stm Ivory Coast "fanning ethnic hatred"] BBC News. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529154708/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1932930.stm |date=2006-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavery in Mauritania]] persists despite its abolition in 1980 and mostly affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into [[slavery]] who now live in [[Mauritania]] as "black [[Moors]]" or ''[[haratin]]'' and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or ''bidhan'', as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the ''haratin'' lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L18334379.htm |title=Thomson Reuters Foundation |publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]] ([[White Australia policy]]) effectively barred people of non-European descent from [[Immigration to Australia|immigrating to Australia]]. There was never any specific policy titled as such, but the term was invented later to encapsulate a collection of policies that were designed to exclude people from [[Asia]] (particularly [[China]]) and the [[Pacific Islands]] (particularly [[Melanesia]]) from immigrating to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan |title=Events That Shaped Australia |page=102 |publisher=New Holland |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-74110-492-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Menzies Government (1949–1966)|Menzies]] and [[Holt Government]]s effectively dismantled the policies between 1949 and 1966 and the [[Whitlam Government]] passed laws to ensure that [[Race (human classification)|race]] would be totally disregarded as a component for immigration to Australia in 1973.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.border.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/08abolition |title=Fact Sheet – Abolition of the 'White Australia' Policy |work=Australian Immigration |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia, National Communications Branch, Department of Immigration and Citizenship |accessdate=27 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919131355/http://www.border.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/08abolition# |archive-date=2015-09-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2005 Cronulla riots]] were a series of [[race riots]] and outbreaks of [[mob violence]] in [[Sydney]]'s southern suburb [[Cronulla]] which resulted from strained relations between [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] and (predominantly [[Muslim]]) [[Lebanese Australians]].

On the island of [[Fiji]] there is on-going tension between the large number (38%) of [[Hindu]] ethnic Indian [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]], who are the descendents of contract laborers brought to Fiji from northern [[India]] during British colonial rule and the majority (54%) local [[Christian]] [[Fijians|Fijian]] population who are ethnic [[Melanesians]].

The '''Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Yıldız Hamidiye Camii}}), also called the '''Yıldız Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Yıldız Camii|links=no}}), is an [[Ottoman imperial mosque]] located in [[Yıldız]] neighbourhood of [[Beşiktaş]] district in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], on the way to [[Yıldız Palace]]. The mosque was commissioned by the Ottoman sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], and constructed between 1884 and 1886. The mosque was built on a rectangular plan and has one [[minaret]]. The architecture of the mosque is a combination of [[Neo-Gothic]] style and classical Ottoman motifs. A bronze colonnade erected by Abdul Hamid II in [[Marjeh Square]] of [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] bears a replica statue of the Yıldız Mosque on top.

On 4 August 2017, the mosque was reopened by President [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] after 4 years of restoration work that cost 27 million Turkish liras ($7.6 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/culture-and-art/erdogan-reopens-historic-mosque-in-istanbul/876509|title=Erdogan reopens historic mosque in Istanbul|date=4 August 2016|publisher=Anadolu Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 1905, members of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] attempted to assassinate [[Abdul Hamid II]] by placing a horse carriage bomb in front of the mosque, an event known as the [[Yıldız assassination attempt]]. Although the bomb failed to kill the sultan due to an unforeseen delay, it killed 26 others and wounded 58 more. The attempt was in response to the pogroms and massacres against Armenians and other minorities of the Ottoman Empire carried out by Abdul Hamid II's government, the [[Hamidian massacres]].

[[File:Zhifang waiji1.PNG|thumb|Pages from the '''''Zhifang Waiji''''', showing the Eurasian Steppe and the Indian Ocean from the Horn of Africa to the Malay peninsula]]
The '''''Zhifang Waiji''''' ({{lang-zh|{{linktext|職方|外|紀}}}}, "Record of Foreign Lands"; {{lang-ko|직방외기}}, ''Chikpang Oegi'') was an [[atlas]] written by various Italian Jesuits in China in the early seventeenth century. The name literally refers to lands beyond the purview of the ''Zhifang Si'', the Imperial cartography office.&lt;ref name="Hostetler2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Hostetler|title=Qing Colonial Enterprise: Ethnography and Cartography in Early Modern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UKTzo1UiVgC&amp;pg=PA56|date=15 December 2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-35421-7|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first detailed atlas of global geography available in Chinese.&lt;ref name="Zhang2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xiping Zhang|script-title=zh:跟随利玛窦到中国|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_u2P83LgGUC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2006|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-5085-0982-2|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
In the late 16th century, Western [[cartography]] was introduced to China by [[Matteo Ricci]], who produced the ''[[Kunyu Wanguo Quantu]]'', China's first world map, in 1602. The [[Wanli Emperor]], who commissioned Ricci's map, subsequently ordered Ricci's colleagues [[Diego de Pantoja]] and [[Sabatino de Ursis]] to produce a book explaining the geography of the new countries shown; their work was eventually edited, compiled and revised by [[Giulio Aleni]]. In 1623, the book was finally published by [[Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism#Yang Tingyun|Yang Tingyun]] in [[Hangzhou]], and three years later was later reissued in a revised edition in [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name=wdl&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronicle of Foreign Lands|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/227/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ricci&gt;{{cite web|title=Zhifang waiji 職方外紀|url=http://riccilibrary.usfca.edu/view.aspx?catalogID=392|website=the Ricci Institute Online Library Catalogue|publisher=Ricci Institute|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The eight scrolls of the ''Zhifang Waiji'' divide the world into five continents, each with separate maps and descriptions. These are named as [[Asia]], [[Europe]], Libya ([[Africa]]), [[Americas]], and [[Terra Australis|Magellanica]] (Europe receives considerably more coverage than any other continent).&lt;ref name=wdl/&gt; An additional section covers the oceans.&lt;ref name="UhalleyWu2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Uhalley|author2=Xiaoxin Wu|title=China and Christianity: Burdened Past, Hopeful Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPnqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|date=4 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47501-9|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lary2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana Lary|title=The Chinese State at the Borders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFzhWyoYG_wC&amp;pg=PA36|date=1 November 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4087-3|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricci's original map had placed China off to one side, which resulted in a somewhat negative reception in Chinese scholarly circles; when Aleni and Yang published their version, they adjusted the design so that China occupied the centre of the world map. This small change made the ''Zhifang Waiji'' more popular, and it had a much longer and more wide-ranging influence than the ''Kunyu Wanguo Quantu'' as a result.&lt;ref name="Lary2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RujivacharakulHahn2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vimalin Rujivacharakul|author2=H. Hazel Hahn|author3=Ken Tadashi Oshima|author4=Peter Christensen|title=Architecturalized Asia: Mapping a Continent through History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCoWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=1 November 2013|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-988-8208-05-0|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
The ''Zhifang Waiji'' was introduced to [[Joseon|Korea]] by [[Jeong Duwon]] in 1631, a gift from the [[Jesuit China Missions|Jesuit]] translator [[Joao Rodrigues Tcuzu|João Rodrigues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Choi |first=Chongko |contribution=On the Reception of Western Law in Korea |title=Korean Journal of Comparative Law |date=1981 |volume=Vol. 141 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Choi |first=Chongko |contribution=Traditional Korean Law and Its Modernization |contribution-url=http://www.raskb.com/transactions/VOL64/VOL64-1.docx |title=Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch |volume=Vol. 64 |date=1989 |p=4 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was introduced to [[Japan]] during the [[Edo period]], but was initially banned because of its Christian authorship and its initial appearance in a collection of Christian writings. The ban was lessened in 1720 to allow works which did not directly relate to Christianity to be bought and sold, and the first "legitimate" sale of the book to Japan came in 1731. Despite the fact that only one edition was printed, it appears to have been widely read.&lt;ref name="WataruFogel2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matsuda Wataru|author2=Joshua A. Fogel|title=Japan and China: Mutual Representations in the Modern Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdPbAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-82109-7|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the text was reused by [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] in 1674 for his ''Kunyu Tushuo'' (Explanation of the World Map), and it was reprinted in a number of collections, including [[Li Zhizao]]'s ''Collection of Celestial Studies'', the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' and a number of 19th and early 20th century encyclopedias.&lt;ref name=Ricci/&gt;&lt;ref name="UhalleyWu2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lary2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RujivacharakulHahn2013"/&gt;
