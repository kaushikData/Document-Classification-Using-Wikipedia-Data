===World population growth===
[[File:Food production per capita.svg|thumb|Growth in food production was greater than population growth since 1961.]]
Although some commentators have argued that this food crisis stems from unprecedented [[World population|global]] [[population growth]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world-news/world-in-grip-of-food-crisis_10035221.html World in grip of food crisis].

To prevent price growth, food production should outpace population growth, which [[World population estimates|was about 1.2% per year]]. But there was a temporary drop in food production growth:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth-policy.org/datacenter/xls/indicator3_2013_03.xlsx |title=World Grain Production and Consumption, 1960–2012 |website=Earth Policy Institute |quote=The 2006 world grain harvest of 2,005 million tons, from the USDA Production, Supply, &amp; Distribution database, was down 11&amp;nbsp;million tons from last year, or roughly 0.5%.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. non-food corn use (ethanol). http://www.earth-policy.org/datacenter/xls/indicator3_2006_4.xls&lt;/ref&gt; for example, wheat production during 2006 and 2007 [[International wheat production statistics|was 4% lower]] than that in 2004 and 2005.

===Increased demand for more resource intensive food===
The head of the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]], stated in 2008 that the gradual change in diet among newly prosperous populations is the most important factor underpinning the rise in global food prices.&lt;ref&gt;von Braun, "High and Rising Food Prices", 2008, p 5, slide 14&lt;/ref&gt; Where food consumption has increased, it has largely been in processed ("[[value added]]") foods, sold in developing and developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;

The report notes that: "[O]n a per capita basis, wheat and rice consumption levels decline marginally in the developing countries, mostly in favour of higher intakes of more value-added food, especially in China."
&lt;/ref&gt; Total grain utilization growth since 2006 (up three percent, over the 2000–2006 per annum average of two percent) has been greatest in non-food usage, especially in feed and biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;

One kilogram of beef requires seven kilograms of feed grain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/wolfforum/2008/04/food-crisis-is-a-chance-to-reform-global-agriculture/#comment-11083 Comment] by [[Paul Collier]] on 2 May 2008 to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' ''The Economists' Forum'' blog post [http://blogs.ft.com/wolfforum/2008/04/food-crisis-is-a-chance-to-reform-global-agriculture "Food crisis is a chance to reform global agriculture]" by [[Martin Wolf]], 30 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These reports, therefore, conclude that usage in industrial, feed, and input intensive foods, not population growth among poor consumers of simple grains, has contributed to the price increases.  Rising meat consumption due to changes in lifestyle can in turn lead to higher energy consumption due to the higher energy-intensity of meat products, for example, one kilogram of meat uses about 19 times as much energy to produce it as the same amount of apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truecostblog.com/2010/02/24/list-of-foods-by-environmental-impact-and-energy-efficiency/|title=List of Foods By Environmental Impact and Energy Efficiency|work=True Cost – Analyzing our economy, government policy, and society through the lens of cost-benefit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the vast majority of the population in Asia remains rural and poor, the growth of the middle class in the region has been dramatic. For comparison, in 1990, the middle class grew by 9.7 percent in India and 8.6 percent in China, but by 2007 the [[Population growth rate|growth rate]] was nearly 30 percent and 70 percent respectively.&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt; The corresponding increase in Asian affluence also brought with it a change in lifestyle and eating habits, particularly a demand for greater variety, leading to increased competition with western nations for already strained agricultural resources.&lt;ref name="BBC16Oct2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://research.cibcwm.com/economic_public/download/smay08.pdf (hamburgers replacing rice bowls)&lt;/ref&gt; This demand exacerbates dramatic increases in [[commodity]] prices such as oil.

Another issue with rising affluence in India and China was reducing the "shock absorber" of poor people who are forced to reduce their resource consumption when food prices rise. This reduced price elasticity and caused a sharp rise in food prices during some shortages. In the media, China is often mentioned as one of the main reasons for the increase in world food prices. However, China has to a large extent been able to meet its own demand for food, and even exports its surpluses in the world market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/AmberWaves/June08/Features/ChinaFeed.htm |title=USDA ERS –  Who Will China Feed?|author=Bryan Lohmar, Fred Gale |work=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of petroleum and fertilizer price increases===
Starting in 2007, the prices of fertilizers of all kinds increased dramatically, peaking around the summer of 2008 (see graphs by the [[International Fertilizer Industry Association]]). Prices approximately tripled for [[ammonia]], [[urea]], [[diammonium phosphate]], [[muriate of potash]] (KCl), and [[sulfuric acid]] (used for making phosphate fertilizer), and then fell just as dramatically in the latter part of 2008. Some prices doubled within the six months before April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=16 April 2008 |title=Fertilizer cost rising sharply: Result will be higher food prices |url=http://www.sunherald.com/business/story/493854.html |newspaper=Sun Herald |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=16 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421010500/http://www.sunherald.com/business/story/493854.html |archive-date=21 April 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the cause for these price rises was the [[Oil price increases since 2003|rise in the price of oil]], since the most fertilizers require petroleum or natural gas to manufacture.&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt; Although the main fossil fuel input for fertilizer comes from natural gas to generate hydrogen for the [[Haber–Bosch process]] (see: [[Ammonia production]]), natural gas has its own supply problems similar to those for oil. Because natural gas can substitute for petroleum in some uses (for example, [[natural gas liquids]] and [[Fossil fuel power plant|electricity generation]]), increasing prices for petroleum lead to increasing prices for natural gas, and thus for fertilizer.

Costs for fertilizer raw materials other than oil, such as [[potash]], have been increasing&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/nytimes/080430/1194770341872.html?.v=6] Shortages Threaten Farmers' Key Tool: Fertilizer&lt;/ref&gt; as increased production of staples increases demand.  This is causing a boom (with associated volatility) in agriculture stocks.

The major [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] Report launched in February 2011 stated that the causes of the 2008 global food crisis were similar to that of the 1972–74 food crisis, in that the oil price and energy price was the major driver, as well as the shock to cereal demand (from biofuels this time), low interest rates, devaluation of the dollar, declining stocks, and some adverse weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/rr165.pdf Reflections on the Global Food Crisis: How Did It Happen? How Has It Hurt? And How Can We Prevent the Next One?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately the IFPRI states that such shocks are likely to recur with several shocks in the future; compounded by a long history of neglecting agricultural investments.

===Declining world food stockpiles===
In the past, nations tended to keep more sizable food stockpiles, but more recently, due to a faster pace of food growth and ease of importation, less emphasis is placed on high stockpiles. For example, in February 2008 wheat stockpiles hit a 60-year low in the United States (see also [[Rice shortage]]).&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt; Data stocks are often calculated as a residual between Production and Consumption but it becomes difficult to discriminate between a de-stocking policy choices of individual countries and a deficit between production and consumption.

===Financial speculation===
Destabilizing influences, including indiscriminate lending and real estate speculation, led to a [[Black Monday (January 2008)|crisis in January 2008]], and eroded investment in food commodities.&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;

Foreign investment drives productivity improvements, and other gains for farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrows, Roth|title=Land Tenure and Investment in African Agriculture: Theory and Evidence|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|year=1990|volume=20|issue=2|pages=265–297|doi=10.1017/S0022278X00054458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/apdj_10_2/mahadevan.pdf |title=Productivity Growth in Indian Agriculture: The Role of Globalization and Economic Reform |date=December 2003 |website=United Nations ESCAP |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Linking Globalization, Economic Growth and Poverty: Impacts of Agribusiness Strategies on Sub-Saharan Africa|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|date=August 2001|volume=83|issue=3|pages=722–729|jstor=1245106|doi=10.1111/0002-9092.00197 | last1 = Weatherspoon | first1 = Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Commodity index funds ====
{{main|Commodity index fund}}
Goldman Sachs' entry into the commodities market via the [[S&amp;P GSCI|Goldman Sachs Commodity Index]] has been implicated by some in the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. In a 2010 article in Harper's magazine, Frederick Kaufman accused Goldman Sachs of profiting while many people went hungry or even starved.

===Effects of trade liberalization===
Some theorists, such as [[Martin Khor]] of the [[Third World Network]],&lt;ref name="MK"&gt;[[Martin Khor|Khor, Martin]]. ''[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/books/Ghanarevised.htm The Impact of Trade Liberalisation on Agriculture in Developing Countries: The Experience of Ghana]'', [[Third World Network]](2008) {{ISBN|978-983-2729-31-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; point out that many developing nations have gone from being food independent to being net food importing economies since the 1970s and 1980s [[International Monetary Fund]] (and later the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Agriculture]]) [[free market economics]] directives to debtor nations. In opening developing countries to [[developed world]] food imports subsidised by Western governments, [[developing nations]] can become more dependent upon food imports if local agriculture does not improve.&lt;ref name="MK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moseley | first1 = W.G. | last2 = Carney | first2 = J. | last3 = Becker | first3 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Neoliberal Policy, Rural Livelihoods and Urban Food Security in West Africa: A Comparative Study of The Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire and Mali | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 13| pages = 5774–5779 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0905717107| pmc = 2851933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While developed countries pressured the developing world to abolish subsidies in the interest of trade liberalization, rich countries largely kept subsidies in place for their own farmers. In recent years United States government subsidies have been added to push production toward biofuel rather than food and vegetables

===Effects of food for fuel===

This has resulted in less food available for human consumption, especially in [[Developing country|developing]] and [[least developed countries]], where a family's daily allowances for food purchases are extremely limited. The crisis can be seen, in a sense, to dichotomize [[North-South divide|rich and poor nations]], since, for example, filling a tank of an average car with [[biofuel]], amounts to as much maize (Africa's principal food staple) as an African person consumes in an entire year.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite news |last=Reguly |first=Eric |date=12 April 2008 |title=How the cupboard went bare |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com//servlet/story/LAC.20080412.FOOD12/TPStory/International/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415055334/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080412.FOOD12/TPStory/International/ |archive-date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since reaching record high prices in June 2008, corn prices fell 50% by October 2008, declining sharply together with other commodities, including oil. As ethanol production from corn has continued at the same levels, some have argued this trend shows the belief that the increased demand for corn to produce ethanol was mistaken. "Analysts, including some in the ethanol sector, say ethanol demand adds about 75 cents to $1.00 per bushel to the price of corn, as a rule of thumb. Other analysts say it adds around 20 percent, or just under 80 cents per bushel at current prices. Those estimates hint that $4 per bushel corn might be priced at only $3 without demand for ethanol fuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN2338007820081023|title=Ethanol no longer seen as big driver of food price|author=Sam Nelson|publisher=Reuters UK|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These industry sources consider that a [[speculative bubble]] in the [[commodity markets]] holding positions in corn [[Futures contract|futures]] was the main driver behind the observed hike in corn prices affecting food supply.

Second- and third-generation biofuels (such as [[cellulosic ethanol]] and [[algae fuel]], respectively) may someday ease the competition with food crops, as can grow on marginal lands unsuited for food crops, but these advanced biofuels require further development of farming practices and refining technology; in contrast, ethanol from maize uses [[mature technology]] and the maize crop can be shifted between food and fuel use quickly.

===Biofuel subsidies in the US and the EU===
The World Bank lists the effect of biofuels as an important contributor to higher food prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/3YYF4BOSN0 "The Effects of High Food Prices in Africa – Q&amp;A"], [[World Bank]]. Retrieved 6 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FAO]]/ECMB has reported that world land usage for agriculture has declined since the 1980s, and subsidies outside the United States and EU have dropped since the year 2004, leaving supply, while sufficient to meet 2004 needs, vulnerable when the United States began converting agricultural commodities to [[biofuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corcoran |first=Katherine |date=24 March 2008 |title=Food Prices Soaring Worldwide |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hY6QytGQclZ5k8yFlaDr0VZin6IwD8VJULF00 |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331195822/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hY6QytGQclZ5k8yFlaDr0VZin6IwD8VJULF00 |archive-date=31 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), global wheat imports and stocks have decreased, domestic consumption has stagnated, and world wheat production has decreased from 2006 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/psdgetreport.aspx?hidReportRetrievalName=BVS&amp;hidReportRetrievalID=686&amp;hidReportRetrievalTemplateID=8 Regional Wheat Imports, Production, Consumption, and Stocks (Thousand Metric Tons)], United States Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service 3 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, government subsidies for ethanol production have prompted many farmers to switch to production for biofuel. Maize is the primary crop used for the production of ethanol, with the United States being the biggest producer of maize ethanol. As a result, 23 percent of United States maize crops were being used for ethanol in 2006–2007 (up from 6 percent in 2005–2006), and the USDA expects the United States to use 81 million tons of maize for ethanol production in the 2007–2008 season, up 37 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/hunger/general/2008/0303foodcrisis.htm Are We Approaching a Global Food Crisis?

Katarina Wahlberg Global Policy Forum: World Economy &amp; Development in Brief, 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This not only diverts grains from food, but it diverts agricultural land from food production.

Nevertheless, supporters of ethanol claim that using [[maize|corn]] for ethanol is not responsible for the worst [[food riot]]s in the world, many of which have been caused by the price of rice and oil, which are not affected by biofuel use but rather by supply and demand.

However, a World Bank policy research working paper released in July 2008&lt;ref name="WorldBank_07_08" /&gt; says that [[biofuel]]s have raised food prices between 70 and 75 percent. The study found that higher oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25–30% of total price rise. The "month-by-month" five-year analysis disputes that increases in global grain consumption and droughts were responsible for price increases, reporting that this had had only a marginal effect and instead argues that the EU and US drive for biofuels has had by far the biggest effect on food supply and prices. The paper concludes that increased production of biofuels in the US and EU were supported by subsidies and tariffs on imports, and considers that without these policies, price increases would have been smaller. This research also concluded that Brazil's sugar cane based ethanol has not raised sugar prices significantly, and suggest to remove tariffs on ethanol imports by both the US and EU, to allow more efficient producers such as Brazil and other developing countries to produce ethanol profitably for export to meet the mandates in the EU and the US.&lt;ref name="Veja_28_07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;

===Idled farmland===
According to the ''New York Times'' on 9 April 2008, the United States government pays farmers to [[fallow|idle their cropland]] under a conservation program. This policy reached a peak of {{convert|36800000|acre|km2}} idled in 2007, that is 8% of cropland in United States, representing a total area bigger than the state of New York.&lt;ref&gt;"As Prices Rise, Farmers Spurn Conservation Program" New York Times 9 April 2008.

===Crop shortfalls from natural disasters===
Several distinct weather- and climate-related incidents have caused disruptions in crop production.  Perhaps the most influential is the [[Drought in Australia#Rainfall deficiencies in 2006|extended drought in Australia]], in particular the fertile [[Murray-Darling Basin]], which produces large amounts of wheat and rice. The drought has caused the annual rice harvest to fall by as much as 98% from pre-drought levels.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/17/business/worldbusiness/17warm.html?n=Top/News/Science/Topics/Global%20Warming Drought in Australia reduces Australia’s rice crop by 98 percent.]
The New York Times, 17 April 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is historically the second-largest exporter of wheat after the United States, producing up to 25 million tons in a good year, the vast majority for export.  However, the 2006 harvest was 9.8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7289194.stm "Australia's food bowl lies empty"], ''BBC News'', 11 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other events that have negatively affected the price of food include the [[2006 North American heat wave|2006 heat wave]] in California's [[San Joaquin Valley]], which killed large numbers of farm animals, and unseasonable 2008 rains in [[Kerala]], India, which destroyed swathes of grain. These incidents are consistent with the effects of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of [[Cyclone Nargis]] on Burma in May 2008 caused a spike in the price of rice.  Burma has historically been a rice exporter, though yields have fallen as government [[price controls]] have reduced incentives for farmers.  The [[storm surge]] inundated rice paddies up to {{convert|30|mi|km}} inland in the [[Irrawaddy Delta]], raising concern that the salt could make the fields infertile.  The FAO had previously estimated that Burma would export up to 600,000 tons of rice in 2008, but concerns were raised in the cyclone's aftermath that Burma may be forced to import rice for the first time, putting further upward pressure on global rice prices.&lt;ref name=cyclone&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7387251.stm "Cyclone fuels rice price increase"], ''BBC News'', 7 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/07/AR2008050700642.html?hpid=topnews "Scant Aid Reaching Burma's Delta"] by Amy Kazmin and Colum Lynch, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 8 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stem rust]] reappeared in 1998&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheatrust.cornell.edu/about/index.html |title=About this project |website=Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat |publisher=Cornell}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Uganda (and possibly earlier in Kenya)&lt;ref name=CIMMYT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070729144609/http://www.globalrust.org/uploads/documents/SoundingAlarmGlobalRust.pdf An assessment of race UG99 in Kenya and Ethiopia and the potential for impact in neighbouring regions and beyond].

Unlike other rusts, which only partially affect crop yields, UG99 can bring 100% crop loss. Up to 80% yield losses were recently recorded in Kenya.&lt;ref name=KARI&gt;Effect of a new race on wheat production/use of fungicides and its cost in large vs small scale farmers, situation of current cultivars.

As of 2005 stem rust was still believed to be "largely under control worldwide except in Eastern Africa".&lt;ref name = CIMMYT/&gt; But by January 2007 an even more virulent strain had gone across the Red Sea into Yemen. FAO first reported on 5 March 2008 that Ug99 had now spread to major wheat-growing areas in Iran.&lt;ref name=FAOmar08&gt;http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2008/1000805/index.html First report of wheat stem rust, strain Ug99, in Iran&lt;/ref&gt;

These countries in North Africa and Middle East consume over 150% of their own wheat production;&lt;ref name = cornell/&gt; the failure of this staple crop thus adds a major burden on them. The disease is now expected to spread over China and the Far-East. The strong international collaboration network of research and development that spread disease-resistant strains some 40 years ago and started the [[Green Revolution]], known as [[CGIAR]], was since slowly starved of research funds because of its own success and is now too atrophied to swiftly react to the new threat.&lt;ref name = cornell/&gt;

=== Soil and productivity losses ===
Sundquist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.alltel.net/bsundquist1/se0.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008022016/http://home.alltel.net/bsundquist1/se0.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 October 2003 |title=Soils and Croplands Degradation |publisher=Home.alltel.net |accessdate=3 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that large areas of croplands are lost year after year, due mainly to [[soil erosion]], water depletion and urbanisation. According to him "60,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/year of land becomes so severely degraded that it loses its productive capacity and becomes wasteland", and even more are affected to a lesser extent, adding to the crop supply problem.

Additionally, agricultural production is also lost due to [[Water crisis|water depletion]]. Northern China in particular has depleted much of its non-renewables [[aquifer]]s, which now impacts negatively its crop production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skmconsulting.com/news/2006/Managing+Chinas+Shrinking+Groundwater+Reserves.htm |title=Managing China's Shrinking Groundwater Reserves |publisher=Skmconsulting.com |accessdate=3 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009162239/http://www.skmconsulting.com/news/2006/Managing%2BChinas%2BShrinking%2BGroundwater%2BReserves.htm |archivedate=9 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urbanisation is another, smaller, difficult to estimate cause of annual cropland reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.alltel.net/bsundquist1/se6.html |title=Chapter 6 – Urbanization-caused topsoil loss |publisher=Home.alltel.net |accessdate=3 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011193251/http://home.alltel.net/bsundquist1/se6.html |archivedate=11 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising levels of ozone===
One possible environmental factor in the food price crisis is rising background levels of ground-level [[tropospheric ozone]] in the atmosphere. Plants have been shown to have a high sensitivity to ozone levels, and lower yields of important food crops, such as wheat and soybeans, may have been a result of elevated ozone levels. Ozone levels in the [[Yangtze Delta]] were studied for their effect on [[oilseed rape]], a member of the cabbage family that produces one-third of the vegetable oil used in China. Plants grown in chambers that controlled ozone levels exhibited a 10–20 percent reduction in size and weight ([[biomass]]) when exposed to elevated ozone levels. Production of seeds and oil was also reduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541362/ Lower Crop Yields Due to Ozone a Factor in World Food Crisis] Newswise. Retrieved 15 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese authors of this study also reported that rice grown in chambers that controlled ozone levels exhibited a 14 to 20 percent reduction in [[biomass]] yield when exposed to ozone levels over 25 times higher than was normal for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1001-0742(08)60050-9 | volume=20 | title=Effects of elevated ozone on growth and yield of field-grown rice in Yangtze River Delta, China | year=2008 | journal=Journal of Environmental Sciences | pages=320–325 | last1 = Chen | first1 = Zhan | last2 = Wang | first2 = Xiaoke | last3 = Feng | first3 = Zhaozhong | last4 = Zheng | first4 = Feixiang | last5 = Duan | first5 = Xiaonan | last6 = Yang | first6 = Wenrui}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rising prices==
From the beginning of 2007 to early 2008, the prices of some of the most basic international food commodities increased dramatically on international markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timmer|first=Peter C.|title=Reflections on food crises past|journal=Food Policy|year=2010|volume=35|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2009.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international market price of wheat doubled from February 2007 to February 2008 hitting a record high of over US$10 a [[bushel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7148374.stm Wheat breaks through $10 a bushel], BBC, 17 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rice prices also reached ten-year highs.  In some nations, milk and meat prices more than doubled, while [[soy]] (which hit a 34-year high price in December 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7149079.stm Corn's key role as food and fuel], Adam Brookes BBC News, 17 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) and maize prices have increased dramatically.

Total food import bills rose by an estimated 25% for developing countries in 2007. Researchers from the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have suggested this problem will be worsened by a likely fall in food aid. As food aid is programmed by budget rather than volume, rising food prices mean that the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) needs an extra $500&amp;nbsp;million just to sustain the current operations.&lt;ref name = "bpdnsw"&gt;[http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1009&amp;title=rising-food-prices-global-crisis Rising Food Prices: A Global Crisis], [[Overseas Development Institute]], 22 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure that food remains available for their domestic populations and to combat dramatic price inflation, major rice exporters, such as China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Egypt, imposed strict export bans on rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=14 April 2008 |title=The global food crisis and the Indian situation  |url=http://www.navhindtimes.com/articles.php?Story_ID=04147 |newspaper=[[Navhind Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625010620/http://www.navhindtimes.com/articles.php?Story_ID=04147 |archive-date=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, several other nations, including Argentina, Ukraine, Russia, and Serbia either imposed high tariffs or blocked the export of wheat and other foodstuffs altogether, driving up prices still further for net food importing nations while trying to isolate their internal markets. North Korea suffered from the food crisis to such extent that a North Korean official was quoted in June '08 with saying "Life is more than difficult. It seems that everyone is going to die".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; This nation however is solely relying on food assistance to cope with the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 April 2002 |title=North Korea faces 'looming' food crisis |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1921634.stm |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 18 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on farmers==
If global price movements are transmitted to local markets, farmers in the developing world could benefit from the rising price of food. According to researchers from the [[Overseas Development Institute]], this may depend on farmers' capacity to respond to changing market conditions. Experience suggests that farmers lack the credit and inputs needed to respond in the short term. In the medium or long term, however, they could benefit, as seen in the Asian [[Green Revolution]] or in many African countries in the recent past.&lt;ref name = "bpdnsw"/&gt;

=== Relationship with 2008 Chinese milk scandal ===
{{Details|2008 Chinese milk scandal}}
As grain prices increased, China's numerous small-holding milk farmers, as well as producers of feed for cattle, were unable to exist economically. As a result, they turned to putting additives into the feed and milk, including [[melamine]], to boost the measured level of protein. Hundreds of thousands of children became ill, China's milk exports virtually ended, executives and officials were arrested and some executed, and companies went bankrupt.&lt;ref name="tele1"&gt;

Cameroon, the world's fourth largest [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] producer, saw large scale rioting in late February 2008 in Douala, the country's commercial capital. Protesters were against inflating food and fuel prices, as well as the attempt by President [[Paul Biya]] to extend his 25-year rule. Protesters set up barricades, burned tires, and targeted businesses that they believed belonged to the Biya family, high members of the ruling party, the government, or France.&lt;ref name="Amin 2012 20–43"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amin|first=J.|title=Understanding the Protest of February 2008 in Cameroon|journal=Africa Today|year=2012|volume=58|issue=4|pages=20–43|doi=10.2979/africatoday.58.4.21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first protest in the nation's history in which minute- by-minute events were covered by social media. By 27 February, a strike was taking place in thirty-one cities, including Yaoundé, Douala, Bamenda, Bafoussam, Buea, Limbe, Tiko, Muea, Mutengene, and Kumba.&lt;ref name="Amin 2012 20–43"/&gt; At least seven people were killed in the worst unrest seen in the country in over fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 February 2008 |title=Anti-government rioting spreads in Cameroon |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/27/africa/27cameroon.php |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |agency=Reuters |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310021014/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/27/africa/27cameroon.php |archive-date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure was later increased to 24.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Time; Food Prices:What went wrong (16 June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Youths were mobilized in ways that had not been seen since the days of the villes mortes.&lt;ref name="Amin 2012 20–43"/&gt; Part of the government response to the protests was a reduction in import taxes on foods including rice, flour, and fish. The government reached an agreement with retailers by which prices would be lowered in exchange for the reduced import taxes. As of late April 2008, however, reports suggested that prices had not eased and in some cases had even increased.&lt;ref&gt;IRIN 2008, [http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=77971 'CAMEROON: Lifting of import taxes fails to reduce food prices'], 29 April.

=== Côte d'Ivoire ===
On 31 March, Côte d'Ivoire's capital [[Abidjan]] saw police use tear gas and a dozen protesters injured following food riots that gripped the city. The riots followed dramatic hikes in the price of food and fuel, with the price of beef rising from US$1.68 to $2.16 per kilogram, and the price of gasoline rising from $1.44 to $2.04 per liter, in only three days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200803311850.html "Côte d'Ivoire: Food Price Hikes Spark Riots"], ''[[AllAfrica.com]]'', 31 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
In Egypt, a boy was killed from a gunshot to the head after Egyptian police intervened in violent demonstrations over rising food prices that gripped the industrial city of [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra|Mahalla]] on 8 April 2008. Large swathes of the population have been hit as food prices, and particularly the price of bread, have doubled over the last several months as a result of producers exploiting a shortage that has existed since 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 April 2008 |title=Egyptian boy dies from wounds sustained in Mahalla food riots |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/04/08/africa/ME-GEN-Egypt-Protest-Death.php |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623012845/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/04/08/africa/ME-GEN-Egypt-Protest-Death.php |archive-date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steavenson|first=Wendell|title=It's the baladi, stupid|work=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|page=Perspectives Review supplement (pp. 3–5)|date=9 January 2009|quote=The difference between the subsidised and market price of bread [in Egypt] is exploited at every stage of production and sale, by importers, millers, warehousers, traders, bakers and consumers alike.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
The [[President of Mexico]], [[Felipe Calderón]], with industry representatives and members of the Confederation of Industrial Chambers (Concamin), agreed to freeze prices of more than 150 consumer staples, such as coffee, sardines, tuna, oil, soup or tea, among others, until the end of December 2008. The measure was carried out in an attempt to control inflation, which stood at an annual rate of 4.95%, the highest increase since December 2004.

Mexican baking company [[Grupo Bimbo]]'s CEO, Daniel Servitje, announced in the 19th Plenary Meeting of the Mexico–China Business Committee that Bimbo agreed to freeze their product prices, despite a 20% rise in production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 August 2015 |title=Bimbo busca mantener sus precios durante 2009 |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/finanzas/69118.html |newspaper=El Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bimbo is one of the most important baking companies worldwide, having recently expanded to China.

===Mozambique===
In mid February, rioting that started in the Mozambican rural town of [[Chokwe, Mozambique|Chokwe]] and then spread to the capital, [[Maputo]], has resulted in at least four deaths. The riots were reported in the media to have been, at least in part, over food prices and were termed "food riots." A biofuel advocacy publication, however, claimed that these were, in fact, "fuel riots", limited to the rise in the cost of diesel, and argued that the "food riot" characterization worked to fan "anti-biofuels sentiment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/blog2/2008/02/19/mozambique-diesel-riots-reported-in-western-media-as-food-riots-fanning-anti-biofuels-sentiment/ "Mozambique diesel riots reported in Western media as "food riots", fanning anti-biofuels sentiment"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421001450/http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/blog2/2008/02/19/mozambique-diesel-riots-reported-in-western-media-as-food-riots-fanning-anti-biofuels-sentiment/ |date=21 April 2008 }}, ''Biofuel Digest'', 19 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistan ===
The [[Pakistan Army]] has been deployed to avoid the seizure of food from fields and warehouses. This hasn't stopped the food prices from increasing. The new government has been blamed for not managing the countries food stockpiles properly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidANA145104100629 zawya.com] (need to be login first)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Myanmar ===
Once the world's top rice producer,  has produced enough rice to feed itself until now. Rice exports dropped over four decades from nearly 4 million tons to only about 40,000 tons last year, mostly due to neglect by Myanmar's ruling generals of infrastructure, including irrigation and warehousing.
On 3 May 2008 [[Cyclone Nargis]] stripped Myanmar's rice-growing districts, ruining large areas with salt water. U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that these areas produce 65 percent of Myanmar's rice. Worries of long-term food shortages and rationing are rife.  The military regime says nothing about the rice crisis, but continues to export rice at the same rate.
&lt;!-- The reference cannot be checked, but I'm the native that know the fact --&gt;
"...at least the next two harvests are going to be greatly affected and there'll be virtually no output from those areas during that time. So we're likely to see considerable food and rice shortages for the next couple of years. The damage to the economy is going to be profound." said economist and Myanmar expert Sean Turnell, of Australia's Macquarie University. (interviewed in "The Irriwaddy", Tuesday, 27 May 2008)

===Panama===
In Panama, in response to higher rice prices the government began buying rice at the high market price and selling rice to the public at a lower subsidized price at food kiosks.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Arroyo government]] insisted on 13 April that there would be no food riots in the country and that there could be no comparison with Haiti's situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2008/04/13/palace.assures.no.food.riots.in.rp.

On 31 March 2008, Senegal had riots in response to the rise in the price of food and fuel. Twenty-four people were arrested and detained in a response that one local human rights group claimed included "torture" and other "unspeakable acts" on the part of the security forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=77539 "Senegal: Heavy handed response to food protesters"], ''[[IRIN]]'', 31 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Further protests took place in [[Dakar]] on 26 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 April 2008 |title=Food costs spark protests in Senegal |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/6239F12A-AE9B-44FC-A6CD-1A01A9F3586E.htm |work=Al Jazeera English |access-date=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemen===
Food riots in southern Yemen that began in late March and continued through early April, saw police stations torched, and roadblocks were set up by armed protesters. The army has deployed tanks and other military vehicles. Although the riots involved thousands of demonstrators over several days and over 100 arrests, officials claimed no fatalities; residents, however, claimed that at least one of the fourteen wounded people has died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inteldaily.com/?c=148&amp;a=5876 "Food riots rock Yemen"], ''The Intelligence Daily'', 4 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2008, the United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] established a Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis [https://www.un.org/issues/food/taskforce/] under his chairmanship and composed of the heads of the United Nations specialized agencies, funds and programmes, Bretton Woods institutions and relevant parts of the UN Secretariat to co-ordinate efforts to alleviate the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7372393.stm UN Sets up food crisis task force], BBC, 29 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the crisis==
2013 research concluded that the spike was the result of an unusual combination of circumstances and prices in the future will be higher than before the spike, depending on [[oil prices]], [[climate change]], and future diets. The impacts of the spike on poor people were concentrated in low-income countries and may have been less severe than once thought, thanks to rising rural wages in some countries. The researchers called on developing countries to ensure good data on the key indicators of distress and to strengthen [[social protection]], and on those involved in international development to continue increasing focus on reducing child [[malnutrition]] and stimulating agricultural development.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Wiggins and Sharada Keats, July 2013, Looking back, peering forward: what has been learned from the food-price spike of 2007–2008? http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7384-look-back-peering-forward-food-price-spike&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food price decreases==

In December 2008, the [[Late-2000s recession|global economic slowdown]], [[2000s energy crisis#Falling prices in late 2008|decreasing oil prices]], and speculation of decreased demand for commodities worldwide brought about sharp decreases in the price of staple crops from their earlier highs. Corn prices on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] dropped from US$7.99 per bushel in June to US$3.74 per bushel in mid-December; wheat and rice prices experienced similar decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601012&amp;sid=aFEkJtgBWsSA|title=Corn Caps Record Week, Soybeans Drop on Shifts in U.S. Planting|publisher=Bloomberg|date=12 December 2008|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, however, warned against "a false sense of security", noting that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|credit crisis]] could cause farmers to reduce plantings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d125dbf2-ac2c-11dd-aa46-000077b07658,dwp_uuid=a955630e-3603-11dc-ad42-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|title=Another food crisis year looms, says FAO|work=Financial Times|date=6 November 2008|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAO convened a [[World Summit on Food Security]] at its headquarters in Rome in November 2008, noting that food prices remained high in developing countries and that the global [[food security]] situation has worsened.

By early 2011, food prices had risen again to surpass the record highs of 2008. Some commentators saw this as the resumption of the price spike seen in 2007–08.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/1/143S.abstract|title=Medium- to Long-Run Implications of High Food Prices for Global Nutrition|publisher=Journal of Nutrition|date=31 January 2010|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices had dropped after good weather helped increase grain yields while demand had dropped due to the recession.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Lester|title=The New Geopolitics of Food|journal=Foreign Policy|date=May–June 2011|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/25/the_new_geopolitics_of_food?page=full|accessdate=7 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110624094608/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/25/the_new_geopolitics_of_food?page=full| archivedate= 24 June 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SC''' (formerly '''Supercomputing'''), the '''International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis''', is the name of the annual conference established in 1988 by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] and the [[IEEE Computer Society]]. In 2016, about 11,000 people participated overall.&lt;ref name="SC16 final pr"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Just Released: SC16 Breaks Exhibits and Workshop Attendance Records |url=http://sc16.supercomputing.org/2016/11/18/sc16-breaks-exhibits-workshop-attendance-records/ |location=Salt Lake City |publisher=SC16 |agency= |date= November 18, 2016 |access-date= 2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The not-for-profit conference is run by a committee of approximately 600 volunteers who spend roughly three years organizing each conference.

Not to be confused with the [[International Supercomputing Conference]], now known as ISC High Performance, or ICS, the [[ACM SIGARCH#Conferences|ACM SIGARCH International Conference on Supercomputing]].

==Sponsorship and Governance==
SC is sponsored by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] and the [[IEEE Computer Society]]. From its formation through 2011, ACM sponsorship was managed through ACM's [[ACM SIGARCH|Special Interest Group on Computer Architecture (SIGARCH)]]. Sponsors are listed on each proceedings page in the ACM DL; see for example.&lt;ref name="SC88 Proceedings"&gt;{{Cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACM began the process of transitioning sponsorship from SIGARCH to the recently formed [[ACM SIGHPC|Special Interest Group on High Performance Computing (SIGHPC)]]. This transition was completed after SC15,&lt;ref name="SC15 Proceedings"&gt;{{Cite conference

| location = Salt Lake City, UT, USA
| isbn = 978-1-4673-8815-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference is non-profit.

The conference is governed by a steering committee that includes representatives of the sponsoring societies, the current conference general chair, the general chairs of the preceding two years, the general chairs of the next two conference years, and a number of elected members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supercomputing.org/steering.php |title=SC Steering Committee |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=The Supercomputing Conference Series |access-date= 2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All steering committee members are volunteers, with the exception of the two representatives of the sponsoring societies, who are employees of those societies. The committee selects the conference general chair, approves each year's conference budget, and is responsible for setting policy and strategy for the conference.

==Conference Components==
Although each conference committee introduces slight variations on the program each year, the core components of the conference remain largely unchanged from year to year.

===Technical Program===
The SC Technical Program is competitive with an acceptance rate around 20% for papers (see [[#History|History]]). Traditionally, the program includes invited talks, panels, research papers, tutorials, workshops, posters, and Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc16.supercomputing.org/full-program/ |title=SC16 Full Conference Program |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=SC16 conference website |access-date= 2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
Each year, SC hosts the following conference and sponsoring society awards:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc16.supercomputing.org/submitters/awards/ |title=SC16 Awards Program |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=SC16 conference website |access-date= 2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhibits===
In addition to the technical program, SC hosts a research exhibition each year that includes universities, state-sponsored computing research organizations (such as the Federal labs in the US), and vendors of HPC-related hardware and software from many countries around the world. There were 353 exhibitors at SC16 in Salt Lake City, UT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iebms.heiexpo.com/iebms/oep/oep_p1_exhibitors.aspx?oc=34&amp;ct=OEP&amp;eventid=5016 |title=SC16 List of Exhibitors |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=SC16 exhibitor directory |access-date= 2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Program===
SC's program for students has gone through a variety of changes and emphases over the years. Beginning with SC15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc15.supercomputing.org/conference-program/student-program.html |title=Students@SC |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=SC15 conference website |access-date= 2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the program is called "Students@SC", and is oriented toward undergraduate and graduate students in computing related fields, and computing-oriented students in science and engineering. The program includes professional development programs, opportunities to learn from mentors, and engagement with SC's technical sessions.

===SCinet===
[[SCinet]] is SC's research network. Started in 1991, SCinet features emerging technologies for very high bandwidth, low latency wide area network communications in addition to operational services necessary to provide conference attendees with connectivity to the commodity Internet and to many national research and engineering networks.

==Name changes==
Since its establishment in 1988,&lt;ref name="SC88 Proceedings" /&gt; and until 1995,&lt;ref name="SC95 Proceedings"&gt;{{Cite conference

the full name of the conference was the "ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference" (sometimes: "ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing"). The conference's abbreviated (and more commonly used) formal name was "Supercomputing 'XY", where XY denotes the last two digits of the year. In 1996, according to the archived  [http://portalparts.acm.org/370000/369028/fm/frontmatter.pdf front matter] of the conference proceedings,&lt;ref name="SC96 Proceedings"&gt;{{Cite conference

the full name was changed to the ACM/IEEE "International Conference on
High Performance Computing and Communications". The latter document
further announced that, as of 1997, the conference will undergo a name
change and will be called "SC97: High Performance Networking and
Computing". The document explained that

At any rate, the word "supercomputing" has been excised from the title of the annual trade shows, sponsored by the IEEE and ACM, that have been known for almost ten years as "Supercomputing  '(final two digits of year)". The next event, to be held in San Jose next November, has been redesignated "SC '97." Like Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat, "supercomputing" has faded steadily away until only the smile, nose, and whiskers remain. [...] The loss is a real one. An enormous range of ordinary people had some idea, however vague, what "supercomputing" meant. No-caf, local alternatives like "SC" and "HPC" lack this authority. This is not a trivial issue. In these days of rapid change, passing technofancies, and information overload, a rose with the wrong name is just another thorn -- or forgotten immediately. After all, how can businessmen, ordinary consumers, and taxpayers be expected to pay money for something they can't comprehend? More important, will investors and grant-givers hand over money to support further R&amp;D on something whose only identity is an arbitrary clump of capital letters?

Despite these concerns, the abbreviated name of the conference, "SC",
is still used today, a reminiscent of the abbreviation of the 
conference's original name—"Supercomputing Conference".

The full name, in contrast, underwent several changes.

the name "High Performance Networking and Computing" was specified in
the front matter of the archived conference proceedings in some years
(1997, 1998, 2000, 2002), whereas in other years it was omitted
altogether in favor of the abbreviated name (1999, 2001, 2003).

the current full name, as used today, emerged: "The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis".

Despite all of the name variances in the proceedings through the years, the digital library of ACM, the co-sponsoring society, records the name of the conference as "The ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing" from 1998 - 2008, when it changes to ""The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis". It is these two names that are used in the full citations to the conference proceedings provided in this article.

'''''Albert Einstein: The Practical Bohemian''''' is a stage [[Play (theatre)|play]] that is the only show officially endorsed by the Einstein family. A quote from Albert Einstein's first cousin said that the family "felt as though they were in the presence of their dear cousin Albert." The one-man show opened in 1978 written and performed by actor-writer [[Ed Metzger]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. 

Since that time, he has presented it throughout the world, including the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The show, co-written by Metzger's wife Laya Gelff, is a portrayal is about the man as well as the scientist, creating a portrait of one of the 20th Century's greatest minds, but who harbored dreams of being a solo violinist. The show highlights the curiosity that drove Einstein to seek answers to the mysteries of the universe. It shows his struggle as a pacifist, threatened by [[anti-semitism]] and forced to flee [[Germany]], and eventually disappointed that his scientific discoveries were used in the creation of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="Ny times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stage: Ed Metzger as Einstein; Genius and Pixie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/26/archives/stage-ed-metzger-as-einstein-genius-and-pixie.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=7 August 2013|author=Richard F.

'''Boris Alexandrovich Epshteyn''' ({{lang-ru|Бори́с Алекса́ндрович Эпштейн}}; born August 14, 1982) is a Russian-born American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political strategist, investment banker, and attorney. He is currently the Chief Political Analyst at [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]. He was a senior advisor to [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 campaign]] for [[President of the United States]], and previously worked on the [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|McCain-Palin campaign]]. Following Trump's election, he was named director of communications for the Presidential Inaugural Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/presidential-inaugural-committee-seeks-workers-and-volunteers/2016/11/23/29a886d0-b188-11e6-be1c-8cec35b1ad25_story.html|title=Presidential Inaugural Committee seeks workers and volunteers|work=Washington Post|date=November 23, 2016|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then assistant communications director for surrogate operations in the administration, until he resigned in March 2017.

==Early life and education==
Epshteyn was born in 1982 in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], the son of Anna Shulkina and Aleksandr Epshteyn. His family is Russian Jewish.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In 1993, he immigrated with his family to [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey]].

Epshteyn is a graduate of [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar|Georgetown University School of Foreign Service]] (BSFS, 2004). During his time as an undergraduate at Georgetown, Epshteyn became a brother of the Eta Sigma chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aepi.org/about-aepi/notable-alumni/ "Notable Alumni"], ''aepi.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Georgetown University Law Center]] with a law degree.&lt;ref name="Wedding"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/fashion/weddings/29tanick.html|title=Lauren Tanick, Boris Epshteyn - Weddings and Celebrations|date=November 27, 2009|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following his graduation from law school, Epshteyn was part of the finance practice of [[Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy]] New York. He worked on securities transactions, private placements, and bank finance.&lt;ref name="TGPS"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.tgpsecurities.com/about-us.html|publisher=TGP Securities|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Epshteyn was a communications aide with the McCain-Palin campaign. While at the campaign, he was part of a rapid response task force which concentrated on issues related to the vice presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/arena/bio/boris_epshteyn.html | title=Arena Profile: Boris Epshteyn | work=Politico | accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epshteyn was managing director of business and legal affairs at the boutique investment bank West America Securities Corporation until the firm was expelled from the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency in 2013.&lt;ref name="FinRA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boris Epshtyn|url=https://brokercheck.finra.org/individual/summary/5712968#timelineSection|publisher=FinRA|accessdate=26 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is managing director of business and legal affairs for investment banking firm TGP Securities.&lt;ref name="TGPS"/&gt; In October 2013, Epshteyn moderated a panel at the investment conference "Invest in Moscow!" The panel was composed mainly of Moscow city government officials, including Sergey Cheremin, a city minister who heads Moscow's foreign economic and international relations department.&lt;ref name="Marans"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-advisers-russia-ties_us_57acd474e4b007c36e4db94c|title=When It Comes To Donald Trump's Russia Ties, It's All About The Aides|last=Marans|first=Daniel|date=2016-08-12|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump campaign===
During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Epshteyn acted as a senior advisor to the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump campaign]], making frequent television appearances as a Trump media surrogate on Trump's behalf.&lt;ref name="Marans"/&gt;

In September 2016, Epshteyn responded to a question from [[MSNBC]]'s [[Hallie Jackson]] by offering a new explanation for why a portrait of Trump – paid for by the [[Donald J. Trump Foundation]] – wound up on display at [[Trump National Doral Miami]], a Trump-owned for-profit golf resort in Florida. Epshteyn said, "There are IRS rules which specifically state that when a foundation has an item, an individual can store those items – on behalf of the foundation – in order to help it with storage costs... And that's absolutely proper." Epshteyn's explanation was, in effect, that Trump hadn't used his foundation to buy some art for his resort, which would be [[self-dealing]]. Instead, Trump's resort was helping the foundation – which has no employees or office space of its own – to store one of its possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/27/trump-is-actually-doing-his-foundation-a-favor-by-storing-its-portrait-his-golf-resort-wall-his-adviser-says/|title=Trump is actually doing his foundation a favor, by ‘storing’ its portrait on his golf resort wall, his adviser says|first=David A.|last=Fahrenthold|date=September 27, 2016|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the media watchdog organization [[Media Matters for America]] criticized [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], and [[PBS]] for failing to disclose Epshteyn's "financial ties to the former Soviet Union, which include consulting through Strategy International LLC for 'entities doing business in Eastern Europe' and moderating a Russian-sponsored conference on 'investment opportunities in Moscow.'"&lt;ref&gt;Hananoki, Eric (September 15, 2016). [http://mediamatters.org/research/2016/09/15/media-host-trump-adviser-boris-epshteyn-russia-without-disclosing-his-business-ties/213113 "Media host Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn on Russia without disclosing his business ties,"] Media Matters for America, retrieved January 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2016 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, three political commentators said in separate interviews that Epshteyn "often acted in a rude, condescending manner toward show staffers, makeup artists and others." [[Joy-Ann Reid|Joy Reid]], an [[MSNBC]] show host, said "Boris is abrasive. That is who he is both on the air and off."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Meier, Barry; Craig, Susanne (October 13, 2016). [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/us/politics/boris-epshteyn-trump.html?_r=0 "The Obscure Lawyer Who Became Donald Trump’s TV Attack Dog,"] ''The New York Times'', retrieved January 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Epshteyn co-hosted the Trump Campaign [[Facebook|Facebook Live]] coverage before and after the final presidential debate. He also anchored "Trump Tower Live", the Trump Campaign Facebook live nightly program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/trumps-campaign-launching-nightly-news-show-facebook/|title=Trump’s Campaign Is Launching a Nightly News Show on Facebook|last=Lapowsky|first=Issie|newspaper=Wired|date=October 24, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump administration===
Epshteyn became a special assistant in the [[Trump administration]] as it took office. He wrote Trump's controversial statement for [[Holocaust Remembrance Day]] in January 2017, which omitted any mention of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="Karni"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karni|first1=Annie|title=White House aide Epshteyn wrote controversial Holocaust memorial statement|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-holocaust-memorial-234394|work=Politico|date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following criticism of the omission, press secretary [[Sean Spicer]] defended the statement as written by "an individual who is both Jewish and the descendent of Holocaust survivors."&lt;ref name="Karni"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salkin|first1=Jeffrey|title=Meet Trump’s Holocaust tutor|url=http://religionnews.com/2017/01/31/trump-holocaust-boris-epshteyn/|work=Religion News Service|date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of March 2017, it was reported that unnamed sources had said Epshteyn was resigning.&lt;ref&gt;Haberman, Maggie, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/25/us/politics/boris-epshteyn-white-house-press-official-is-let-go-from-his-job.html "Boris Epshteyn, Trump TV Surrogate, Is Leaving White House Job"], ''New York Times'', March 25, 2017. "according to three people with knowledge of the move". Retrieved 2017-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinclair Broadcast Group===
In mid-April 2017, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group|Sinclair]] announced it had hired Epshteyn as its senior political analyst. Regarding the appointment, Scott Livingston at Sinclair said in part, "We understand the frustration with government and traditional institutions." Epshteyn said in part, "I greatly admire Sinclair’s mission to provide thoughtful impactful reporting throughout the country." At the time, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also noted [[Jared Kushner]]'s December 2016 revelation of [[Sinclair_Broadcast_Group#Political_programming|discussions]] between the Trump campaign and the company and content provided to the company which, the report said, Sinclair had "vehemently denied".&lt;ref&gt;Littleton, Cynthia, [https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/trump-spokesman-boris-epshteyn-sinclair-broadcast-group-1202032200/ "Trump Spokesman Boris Epshteyn Joins Sinclair Broadcast Group as Political Analyst"], ''Variety'', April 17, 2017. Retrieved 2017-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Epshteyn married Lauren Tanick Epshteyn, a sales manager at [[Google]], in 2009.&lt;ref name="Wedding"/&gt; They have one child. 

Epshteyn was reported to be a friend of [[Eric Trump]], who also attended Georgetown.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Following a bar fight in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in 2014, Epshteyn was charged with misdemeanor [[assault]]. The charge was dropped after he agreed to undergo [[anger management]] counseling and perform community service.&lt;ref name="NYT"

The '''CASCAR Super Series''' was Canada's premier stock car touring division. It was sanctioned by [[CASCAR]]. The series ended after the 2006 season after [[NASCAR]] purchased CASCAR. NASCAR used the series as the basis for the [[NASCAR Canadian Tire Series]], and currently called the Nascar Pinty's Series.

The film was dubbed and released in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Captain Prabhakar''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbokyUrVx14&lt;/ref&gt;


==Plot==
Captain Prabhakaran ([[Vijayakanth]]) is an [[Indian Forest Service|IFS officer (Indian Forest Service)]] sent to Sathyamangalam to nab Veerabhadran ([[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]]) who tortures the people of that place. Prabhakaran is not only going to nab Veerabhadran, but also avenge the death of his friend Rajaraman [[Indian Forest Service|IFS]] ([[R. Sarathkumar]]) who was a forest officer killed by Veerabhadran. The police commissioner and the district collector are corrupt and also support Veerabhadran. In the climax, Veerabhadran kidnaps Prabhakaran's wife and son. Prabhakaran arrives at the right time and saves his wife and son. He then nabs Veerabhadran. Poongudi ([[Ramya Krishnan]]) was Rajaraman's lover.  She dies while giving birth to his child. Veerabhadran is shot dead by the corrupt inspector and collector. Prabhakaran kills both of them. He is then dragged to court for killing the police inspector and the collector. Prabhakaran tells the truth that they were corrupt, and the film ends with Prabhakaran being released from the court.

==Production==
After the success of ''[[Pulan Visaranai]]'', Rowther decided to make another project with Vijayakanth and Selvamani titled ''Captain Prabhakaran'', the plotline of the film was based on the forest brigand [[Veerappan]]. The film also was the 100th project of Vijayakanth. The filming was held at [[Chalakudy]] for 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2013/09/05231139/selvamani-cinema-history.html|title=Tamil Cinema news - Tamil Movies - Cinema seithigal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinema.maalaimalar.com/2013/09/06231550/selvamani-cinema-history.html|title=Tamil Cinema news - Tamil Movies - Cinema seithigal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had Mansoor Ali Khan in his first major role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/grill-mill-mansoor-ali-khan/article821865.ece|title=Grill Mill - Mansoor Ali Khan|date=9 October 2010|publisher=|via=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the shoot, a rope to which Vijayakanth was bound snapped and his shoulder got dislocated. With both his hands tied he screamed in pain, but this was mistaken for acting, and as a result, there was a delay in getting medical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shivakumar|first1=S.|title=Playing a Captain's innings|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/fr/2005/08/26/stories/2005082600040400.htm|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=The Hindu|date=26 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack has only two songs composed by [[Ilaiyaraaja]] while the lyrics were written by [[Gangai Amaran]] and [[Piraisoodan]]. The song "Aattama Therottama" is set in the [[carnatic raga]] known as [[Sindhu Bhairavi (raga)|Sindhu Bhairavi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Raga Chintamani: A Guide to Carnatic Ragas Through Tamil Film Music |last=Sundararaman |publisher=Pichhamal Chintamani |year=2007 |edition=2nd |location=Chennai |pages=125 |oclc=295034757 |ref=harv |orig-year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/light-and-melodious/article4702358.ece |title=Light and melodious |last=Mani |first=Charulatha |date=10 May 2013 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later remixed by Prasanna Sekhar in ''[[Singakutty]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/well-picturised/article1408347.ece|title=Well picturised|date=20 February 2008|publisher=|via=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''concert tour''' (or simply '''tour''') is a series of [[concert]]s by an artist or group of artists in different cities, countries or locations.  Often concert tours are named to differentiate different tours by the same artist and to associate a specific tour with a particular album or product (for example: [[U2]]'s [[The Joshua Tree Tour]] named after [[The Joshua Tree|the album]]).  Especially in the popular music world, such tours can become large-scale enterprises that last for several months or even years, are seen by hundreds of thousands or millions of people, and bring in millions of dollars (or the equivalent) in ticket revenues. A performer who embarks on a concert tour is called a '''touring artist'''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/photos/live/488653/hot-tours-roger-waters-mana-bob-dylan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7271843/madonna-extends-record-highest-grossing-solo-touring-artist&lt;/ref&gt;

Different segments of longer concert tours are known as "legs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Concert Tour?|url=http://tourbeat.com/news-and-announcements/what-is-a-concert-tour|publisher=[[TourBeat]]|accessdate=10 January 2015|quote=A concert tour is an opportunity for musicians to perform over longer periods of time across several cities, which are differentiated by segments known as "legs." Legs of tours of can be denoted by a series of dates that have no long break between them, by geographical regions or destinations, or by different opening acts. Each city or region may have the same opening act for each leg, or they may change opening acts at each city.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different legs of a tour are denoted in different ways, dependent on the artist and type of tour, but the most common means of separating legs are dates (especially if there is a long break at some point), countries and/or continents, or different opening acts.  In the largest concert tours it is becoming more common for different legs to employ separate touring production crews and equipment, local to each geographical region.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Concert tours are often administered on the local level by concert promoters or by [[performing arts presenters]]. Usually, small concert tours are managed by a [[road manager]] whereas large concert tours are managed by a [[tour manager]].

==Logistics==
The major challenge in concert tours is how to move the performance's logistics from one venue to another venue, especially for a transcontinental tour. Tour logistics should be very organized and everything has to happen on time and in the right order as planned.&lt;ref name="inbound"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inboundlogistics.com/cms/article/taking-the-show-on-the-road/|title=Taking the Show on the Road - Inbound Logistics|website=www.inboundlogistics.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine estimated 30 to 50 trucks were required by [[Taylor Swift]]'s [[1989 World Tour]] to bring all the stage, sound equipment, instruments, props, and clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/how-many-trucks-does-it-take-put-taylor-swift-show|title=How many trucks does it take to put on a Taylor Swift show?|website=autoweek.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Beyoncé]] visited the United Kingdom with her 2016 [[Formation World Tour]], it took seven [[Boeing 747]] air freighters and a fleet of more than 70 trucks to get her stage set and other gear to the venues. The logistics phase of that tour didn't include transportation of the backstage staff, musicians, performers, and the singer herself.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39926895&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock-It Cargo is one of the company that provided freight forwarding for some of the biggest names in music, such as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and [[The Police]]. Before the start of a tour, Rock-It Cargo had to move gear to a central location—either a rehearsal spot or the site of the first engagement. Then it arranged to transport whatever gear the band requires from one venue to the next. The company's vice president, Ed Butler, said "We use different freight modes—local trucking, cross-country trucking, air freight, and ocean freight. We also provide import, export, customs clearance, carnets (a document that allows a shipper—including a band—to move equipment across international boundaries and clear customs without paying duties)—everything a tour would need."&lt;ref name="inbound"/&gt;

==Response==
The mobility of concert tours requires a lot of costs, times, and energy. British singer [[Adele]] expressed her unhappiness of concert tours, saying "Touring is a peculiar thing, it doesn't suit me particularly well. I'm a real homebody and I get so much joy in the small things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/this-is-it-adele-hints-to-fans-she-may-never-tour-again-10930875|title='This is it': Adele hints to fans she may never tour again|website=sky.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[concert residency]] concept is offered as an alternative to performers. As opposed to the concert tour, the concert residency consists of multiple shows in one location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccalerner/2017/06/14/meet-the-celeb-100-stars-cashing-in-on-the-vegas-residency-boom/2/#1b325f685c01|title=Meet The Celeb 100 Stars Cashing In On The Vegas Residency Boom|first=Rebecca|last=Lerner|website=forbes.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 study by charity [[Help Musicians UK]] found that over 60% of musicians suffered from depression or other psychological issues, with touring an issue for 71% of respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/25/musicians-touring-psychological-dangers-willis-earl-beal-kate-nash|title=Insomnia, anxiety, break-ups … musicians on the dark side of touring|first=Luke Morgan|last=Britton|date=25 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eve/Livia''' is a fictional character created by [[Robert Tapert]] for the popular TV series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]''. She is portrayed by [[Adrienne Wilkinson]] as an adult and as a baby by infant actors. She is loosely based on [[Livia Drusilla]] who was the wife of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]].

==Character history==
Eve is the daughter of [[Xena]] and younger sister of [[Solan (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Solan]], born of a miraculous conception after Xena and [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]] encounter a deity called the ''God of Light''.&lt;ref name="fallen angel"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Fallen Angel|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Xena chooses to save her former enemy, [[Callisto (Xena)|Callisto]], from eternal suffering, the redeemed spirit of Callisto allows her to conceive a child, who is then selected to be her [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="fallen angel"/&gt;

Before her birth, Xena's unborn daughter is prophesied by [[Moirai|the Fates]] to become the Bringer of Twilight, the human who will bring about the end of the rule of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="god fearing"&gt;{{cite episode|title=God Fearing Child|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] attempts to kill Xena and her child before this happens, but is thwarted by his son [[Heracles|Hercules]], who kills him with a rib of [[Cronus]].&lt;ref name="god fearing"/&gt; Xena delivers the baby with Gabrielle's help in the shade of a tree, moments after Zeus's demise. Xena names the girl Eve, a name that her deceased son [[Solan (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Solan]] suggested upon seeing him in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]].&lt;ref name="god fearing"/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Athena]] becomes the leader of the Olympian gods, and they continue their ceaseless persecution of the infant Eve. Driven to desperation, Xena and Gabrielle fake their own deaths, and that of Eve, by staging a fatal crash, then taking a sleeping draught&lt;ref name="death in the eye"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Looking Death in the Eye|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a manner similar to the ploy in [[Romeo and Juliet]]. They intend to awaken shortly afterwards, but the plan goes awry when [[Ares (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess)|Ares]], believing them to be dead, buries Xena and Gabrielle in an [[ice cave]] on [[Mount Etna]] as great warriors and leaves Xena's [[sword]] and [[chakram]]. Eve remains in the custody of Xena's friend [[Augustus|Octavius]], who proceeds to take her to Rome and sends her to the [[Roman province|provinces]] to be educated.&lt;ref name="death in the eye"/&gt;

Twenty-five years later, Xena and Gabrielle awaken to discover that Octavius has become the [[Roman Emperor]] Augustus Caesar, and Eve is now a brutal warrior known as ''[[Livia]]'', the Champion of Rome.&lt;ref name="Livia"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Livia|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the protégée and lover of Ares, but is intending to marry Augustus and thus become the empress. Xena sets about trying to stop her daughter from massacring innocent people, and in the process inadvertently exposes Livia's identity to the gods, who resume their persecution of her as the Bringer of Twilight.&lt;ref name="Livia"/&gt; She feels conflicted when Eve murders Xena's old friend [[Joxer]].

Livia is reformed when [[Eli (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Eli]]'s spirit shows her various moments of Xena taking care of her when she was a baby, and learns that her mother truly did care for her.&lt;ref name="Eve"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Eve|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformed Livia once again takes on the name of Eve, and intends to become the Messenger of Eli, who taught pacifism and independence from the Olympian gods. While Eve is initiated into the sect of Eli, the God of Eli gives Xena the power to kill gods as long as Eve is alive.&lt;ref name="Motherhood"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Motherhood|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development causes the Olympians to redouble their efforts to kill Xena and her daughter, bringing about their own demise when Xena goes up against them with her newly acquired power. Ares and [[Aphrodite (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess)|Aphrodite]] survive, having remained neutral during the ordeal. However, Ares gives up his powers and [[immortality]] to save Eve and Gabrielle.&lt;ref name="Motherhood"/&gt;

After the Twilight of the Gods, Eve travelled with Xena and Gabrielle. As such, she appears in the first four episodes of season six. According to an interview with Adrienne Wilkinson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Final Chakram Throw|url=http://www.bitch-of-rome.com/interviews/finalchakram.html|publisher=Bitch of Rome}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the episode "Coming Home" took place a year after the events in "Motherhood".

After "Who's Gurkhan?" Eve apparently returned to Rome, though no explanation was provided for her absence. In fact, while Xena seemed to know where Eve was, Gabrielle didn't, as seen in "The God You Know" where Gabrielle seems surprised to learn Eve is in Rome.

Eve challenges the emperor, [[Caligula]], in "The God You Know" in regards to his slaughter of the Elijans. She is nearly killed by [[Caligula]], but Xena arrives in time to defeat him and save Eve.

Eve is seen briefly in "You Are There" being interviewed by a [[news reporter]] Nigel.

Eve's final appearance in the series was in the episode "Path of Vengeance" in which she returns to the land of [[Varia (Xena)|Varia]]'s [[tribe]] of [[Amazons]] in order to atone for her attack on them six years prior. Varia, now leading the multiple Amazon tribes that have gathered from around the known world, captures Eve in order to make her stand trial. Marga had apparently banished Eve after "Coming Home" with the threat of death if she returned. Varia, having lost her little sister at Livia's hand during the attack on her village, is after Eve's life.

It is revealed in this episode, that the Amazons she captured as slaves (as stated in "Coming Home"), she had tossed overboard with their [[shackles]] still on when she was unable to sell them to Gurkhan.

Gabrielle challenges Varia for leadership of the Amazons in order to save Eve's life when she is found guilty, but loses. Xena challenges Varia to a fight before she can execute Eve, and in doing so, she shows Varia that she has become like Livia, which leads Varia to stop her actions, and pardon Eve (stating Livia is dead).

At the end of the episode, Eve parts ways with Xena and Gabrielle, heading to [[China ]]a to continue to spread the message of Eli. Xena offers to go with her, but Eve states she needs to do it on her own, and departs.

There is a hint of Eve having children as stated in the episode "The Xena Scrolls", Professor Pappas and Melinda Pappas to be descendants of Xena in the 1940s, as she is Xena's only living offspring.

Livia made two appearances in season six. One was as a vision seen by Eve, caused by the king of [[Hell]], [[Mephistopheles]], in order to torment Eve, hoping to get her to spill her blood in order to release him into the world in the episode " The Haunting of [[Amphipolis]]." Livia was also seen in flashbacks in " Path of Vengeance" when she attacked Varia's tribe.

==Skills and Abilities==
Eve possesses excellent combat prowess; comprehensively trained by [[Ares (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess)|Ares]] from early childhood to fight in his name. (Hand-to-hand combat, all sorts of weapons but mostly swords) She is established as an extremely dangerous individual, and is more than capable of taking a stand against even the most skilled and dangerous of opponents, such as the [[Ares (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess)|God of War]] and her [[Xena|mother]].

'''Chakram Skills: ''' In the episode "Eve", she was able to stop the Chakram when Xena threw it at her by  cutting it into two pieces. In the next episode "Motherhood", Eve caught the Chakram.

'''Acrobatic Skills: ''' Aside from other acrobatic skills almost all well-trained warriors have in the show, Eve (Livia) has her own ''trademark'' moves: in the episode "Coming Home" as well as in the episode "Path of Vengeance", Eve (Livia) made a flip that only '''she''' knew how to do; this was revealed by Varia: '"I've seen only one warrior do that move..."' and which actually helped her to recognize the woman as being the former Livia—the Champion of Rome.

'''Commander: ''' Being the former commander of the Roman Legions, Eve (Livia) holds her previously acquired knowledge of political and historical facts.

'''Heavenly Abilities:''' After Eve was initialized as the Messenger of the God of Light, she received a number of abilities that are channelled from Heaven. In the episodes "The Haunting of Amphipolis" and "Heart of Darkness", Eve was shown casting evil spirits back to Hell and healing a human who was taken by demons.

'''Fantasporto''', also known as '''Fantas''', is an international [[film festival]], annually organized since 1981 in [[Porto]], Portugal. Giving screen space to [[Fantasy film|fantasy]]/[[Science fiction film|science fiction]]/[[Horror film|horror]]-oriented commercial feature films, [[auteur]] films and experimental projects from all over the world, Fantasporto has created enthusiastic audiences, ranging from cinephiles to more popular spectators, with an annual average of 110,000 attendees. It was rated in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' as one of the 25 leading festivals of the world.&lt;ref name="http://www.fantasporto.com/"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.fantasporto.com/about|website=Fantasporto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 27th edition in February 2006 the festival reached 104,000 people and 5,000 media references, both domestic and international, with a record of 187 hours of TV time. Present in Porto were about 100 members of the foreign press and about 250 Portuguese journalists and media representatives.

In spite of being organized by a private entity, the event is mostly state funded, with the [[Ministry of Culture]] of Portugal leading and the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]] as head of the Honour Committee, along with several private sponsors.

The 2019 festival will be held February 22nd- March 2nd 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantasporto.com/|title=Fantasporto|website=www.fantasporto.com|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fence''', also known as a '''receiver''', '''mover''', or '''moving man''', is an individual who [[mens rea|knowingly]] buys [[stolen goods]] in order to later resell them for profit. The fence acts as a [[wikt:middleman|middleman]] between [[thieves]] and the eventual buyers of stolen goods who may not be aware that the goods are stolen. As a verb, the word describes the behaviour of the thief in the transaction: ''The burglar fenced the stolen radio''. This sense of the term came from [[Thieves' cant|thieves' slang]], first attested c. 1700, from the notion of such transactions providing a ''defence'' against being caught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.word-detective.com/2013/09/fence/ "Fence"] in the Word Detective&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fence |title='&amp;#39;Online Etymology Dictionary'&amp;#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term remains in common use in all major dialects of modern English, all of which spell it with a "c" even though the source word in some dialects (particularly [[American English]]) is now spelled ''defense.''

The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he/she is able to secretly pay thieves a very low price for "hot" goods that cannot be easily sold on the open markets. The thieves who patronize the fence are willing to accept a low [[profit margin]] in order to reduce their risks by instantly "washing their hands" of the [[black market]] loot and disassociating themselves from the criminal act that procured it. After the sale, the fence recoups their investment by disguising the stolen nature of the goods (via methods such as repackaging and altering/effacing [[serial numbers]]) and reselling the goods as near to the [[white market]] price as possible without drawing suspicion. This process often relies on a legal business (such as a [[pawnshop]], [[flea market]] or [[street vendor]]) in order to "launder" the stolen goods by intermixing them with legally-purchased items of the same type. &lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news |last= Wilber |first= Del Quentin |authorlink= Del Quentin Wilber |title= D.C.

==Approach==

[[File:Car window burglary.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Car stereo thieves typically want to sell stolen items quickly. By selling to fences, they avoid the hassle and suspicion of selling directly to the final buyers.]]
The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he is able to pay thieves a very low price for stolen goods. Thieves agree to this because their alternatives may present a greater risk of the thief being caught. As well, selling stolen goods takes a great deal of time and effort ([[transaction costs]]), as the thief would have to try to contact a number of potential buyers and show them the merchandise. Some habitual thieves are so well known to police that if the thief were to attempt to sell any [[used good]]s, this would quickly draw the attention of law enforcement.

The fence then disguises the stolen nature of the goods, if possible, so that he or she can sell them closer to the market price. Depending on the stolen item, the fence may attempt to remove, deface, or replace [[serial number]]s on the stolen item before reselling it. In some cases, fences will transport the stolen items to a different city to sell them, because this lessens the likelihood that the items will be recognized. For some types of stolen goods, fences disassemble the good and sell the individual parts, because the sale of parts is less risky. For example, a stolen car or bicycle [[chop shop|may be disassembled]] so that the parts can be sold individually. Another tactic used by some fences is to retain stolen items for some time before selling them, which lessens the likelihood that the burglary victims or police will be actively looking for the items in auctions and pawnshops.

Fencing is often conducted through legal businesses.&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt; Some fences maintain a legitimate-seeming "front" through which they can sell stolen merchandise. Depending on the type of stolen merchandise a fence deals in, "front" businesses might be discount stores, [[used goods]] stores, a coin and gem store, [[auction house]], [[flea market]], or auto salvage yards. The degree of illicit activity in each "front" business may differ from fence to fence. While one fence's [[Wrecking yard|salvage yard]] may consist mainly of stolen auto parts, another fence's used goods store might consist mainly of legitimately purchased used goods, with the stolen merchandise acting as a minor, but profitable, sideline.

The prices fences pay thieves typically depend both on norms and on legitimate market rates for the items in question.  Vulnerable sellers, such as drug addicts or casual thieves, may receive less than 20% of an item's value.  Higher prices, sometimes as high as 50% of an item's value in a legal market, can be commanded by a professional thief, especially one who concentrates on valuable items.  At the same time, fences will often take advantage of thieves by deceiving them about the value of an individual item and the relevant market conditions.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt; For example, a fence may falsely tell a petty thief that the market for the type of good which the thief is selling is flooded with this type of merchandise, to justify paying out a lower price.

Research on fences shows that they view themselves as entrepreneurs, relying on networking with and patronage by prominent criminals to become successful in their word-of-mouth-based "wheeling and dealing".  They occupy the middle ground between the criminal world (thieves, burglars and shoplifters) and the legitimate world (e.g., everyday people who purchase used goods).  Some active fences go farther in their business, maintaining longstanding contacts and even teaching thieves how to practice their craft, whether by identifying specific products or by teaching them tools of the trade.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

There are a number of different types of fences. One way of categorizing fences is by the type of good in which they trade, such as jewels, power tools, or electronics. Another way of categorizing fences is by their level of involvement in buying and selling stolen goods; for some, fencing is an occasional "sideline" activity, while it is an economic mainstay for others. At the lowest level, a hustler or drug dealer may occasionally accept stolen goods. At the highest level would be a fence whose main criminal income comes from buying and selling stolen items. At the broadest level, two tiers of fences can be distinguished. The lower level of fences are those who directly buy stolen goods from thieves and burglars. At a higher level are the "master fences", who do not deal with street-level thieves, but only with other fences.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

The degree to which the purchasers of the stolen goods know or suspect that the items are stolen varies. If a purchaser buys a high-quality item for a low price, in cash, from a stranger at a bar or from the back of a van, there is a higher likelihood that the items may be stolen. On the other hand, if a purchaser buys the same high-quality item for the standard retail price from a used goods store, and obtains a proper receipt, the purchaser may reasonably believe that the item is not stolen (even if, in fact, it is a stolen item).

== History of receiving ==

The fence, or receiver, is an old kind of criminal, historically attested in many countries and with deep and complex dynamics within society.
 
=== Early modern England ===

Receiving was a widespread crime in Modern England and an increasingly crucial concern for the English government of that period. It involved many other kinds of activities and crimes, and it saw its peak in the early 18th century with the notorious [[Jonathan Wild]]. Receiving is intrinsically connected to theft, as receivers, by definition, buy previously stolen goods in order to make profit out of them later. When organised theft grew increasingly important in London thanks to largely supportive receivers,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the establishment started to fight it off with new laws, often aimed at receivers: receiving was acknowledged as the very core of property crime.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Receiving was not considered as a felony (crime) in common law until 1691, when fences became potential targets of charges as accessories to theft. This meant that in order to judge a suspected receiver, it was necessary to condemn the related thief first. Later laws further focused on receivers, especially the [[Transportation Act 1717|1718 Transportation Act]], which, together with other measures, made fences main felons and not simply accessories to other felonies. Nonetheless, it was not easy to prove that a dealer knowingly accepted stolen goods, especially without the related theft event being fully cleared out.&lt;ref name="B189"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.189-90.&lt;/ref&gt;
Proceedings stored in the [http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/ Old Bailey Online] archive where the offence category is receiving are 5664. Of these, 1973 have a verdict category of guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/stats.jsp?y=&amp;x=&amp;countBy=&amp;render=&amp;_offences_offenceCategory_offenceSubcategory=theft_receiving&amp;_verdicts_verdictCategory_verdictSubcategory=guilty&amp;_punishments_punishmentCategory_punishmentSubcategory=&amp;_defendantNames_defendantGender=&amp;defendantAgeFrom=&amp;defendantAgeTo=&amp;_victimNames_victimGender=&amp;victimAgeFrom=&amp;victimAgeTo=&amp;_divs_fulltext=&amp;kwparse=and&amp;fromMonth=&amp;fromYear=&amp;toMonth=&amp;toYear= Old Bailey Proceedings Online] (www.oldbaileyonline.org, 22 November 2015), Searched Old Bailey Proceedings for all offences where offence category is receiving and verdict category is guilty.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1718 Transportation Act also made a felony of returning goods for a fee, revealing that by then, receiving had already been widely taken to the next stage: returning goods to their owner, for a fee, instead of selling them in the second-hand market. Thieves could act as go-betweens themselves, but go-betweens could raise some suspicions, while relying on receivers added a safety layer against effective prosecution. A victim of theft was often willing to pay in order to get his goods back, in order to spare himself further troubles and/or if the items taken had the potential to reveal unflattering details about his personal affairs. In addition to that, for many centuries, prosecution in England was entirely at the expense (of personal money, time and effort) of the prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.41-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, also considering the difficulty of actually proving receiving in courts, common people, especially shopkeepers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; often preferred compounding, feeling that prosecuting was not worth it. This gave a considerable advantage to receivers.
[[File:Ticket to the hanging of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|Ticket to the hanging of [[Jonathan Wild]]. ]]
In order to effectively act as go-betweens for compounding, or brokers, fences needed to personally know thieves or have ways to easily interact and bargain with them for a common benefit about compounding: nobody was in a better position to do so than [[thief-takers]]. Thief-takers grew increasingly notorious in England as a reward was introduced by the Crown for each successfully condemned criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.55-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them, such as Anthony Dunn, publicly referred to as "pretended Thiefe-taker" in a 1707 document,&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; used their social power as thief-takers as an advantage for receiving. Thief-takers were usually so involved with thieves and gangs of thieves that they could easily condemn them for the reward, or use this power to intimidate and command thieves to do their biddings: in exchange of clemency or protection from capture or condemnation, they could have thieves to steal under their command. Indeed, thief-takers could act as direct instigators, supporting their thieves with intelligence or offering them shelter at need (when convenient), and then act as receivers with the stolen goods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Beattie, , J. M. Crime and the Courts in England 1660 - 1800. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986, pp.159-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Through parallel occupations, receivers could feed their own business.

Confirmation of how thief-taking and receiving were tightly connected could be seen in the career of [[Charles Hitchen]], who was known as a thief-taker. He bought off the position of Under City Marshal through his wife's money in order to have one of the best positions amongst the thief-takers of the City. However, a vast part of his income actually came from the receiving activity related to the network of connections with London's underworld. Hitchen controlled this network through his official (that is to say, legal) position as a thief-taker.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, pp.253-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The synergy between receiving, theft and corruption, as well as official activities such as thief-taking or pawnbroking was a huge dynamic bond where each element enhanced the others in a vicious circle.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The master of this powerful synergy of London underworld was [[Jonathan Wild]], who rapidly replaced his previous master, Charles Hitchen, in 1713, and rapidly gained control of London's crime and the title of "thief-taker general". His power was due to his ruthless thief-taking and intimidation activities as well as a complex web of intelligence also built around the diffusion of newspapers. However, overly bold receiving was his undoing,&lt;ref name="ex"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.381.&lt;/ref&gt; as it grew so large and complex a matter to prompt the English government to promote further laws against receiving and related activities, such as the Transportation Act in 1718, also known as "Jonathan Wild Act",&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock and Schoemaker. Tales from the Hanging Court. London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; and its extension in 1720, which made returning goods for a fee a felony of the same importance and punishment as the crime (theft) related to the goods returned (which meant a capital offence in most cases, with raised potential reward for definitive evidence, from £40 to £140).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Beattie, J. M. Policing and Punishment in London, 1660-1750 Urban Crime and the Limits of Terror. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2001, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the government decided to directly take action against Wild through lawyers, succeeding in condemning and executing him in 1725.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt;

=== Early modern English literature ===

Receiving grew increasingly important in Early Modern society, and combined with the increasing interest of society on reading, it became the source for many writers, such as [[Daniel Defoe]], with [[Moll Flanders]] and [[John Gay]], with [[The Beggar's Opera]]. 
These works reflect how receiving was conceived and portrayed by authors.

==== Moll Flanders ====

''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is a novel intended to narrate the whole life of its protagonist, referred to as Moll Flanders, but a relevant part of it is about her becoming a master thief. Moll's activity as a thief largely relied on the protection and support of her governess, who acted also as a receiver for the goods stolen by her affiliates. She is the one who buys Moll's stolen goods the first time, as Moll narrates "I was now at a loss for a market for my goods,[...] At last I resolved to go to my old governess." Therefore, the governess character sealed Moll's fate as a thief, and eventually taught her the basics of thievery redirecting Moll to work with other senior thieves.&lt;ref name="gut"/&gt; With these events, Defoe shows how crucial as well as subtle receiving was in building the whole of crime activity in London.

The Governess is officially a pawnbroker, and she uses this legal business to recycle stolen goods into the secondary market. Sometimes, such as in the case of a silver inscribed mug stolen by Moll, she smelts metals, in order to avoid getting caught while re-selling. Along with receiving activity, she actively protects and support many criminals and thieves in order to secure a steady income to her activity.

The same governess goes on in protecting and offering refuge to her affiliates whenever possible, or recruiting thieves into small groups, always via middlemen, in order to protect their thieves' identities in case some of them were caught and willing to confess.

She is also a main intelligence source and often a direct instigator to theft such as in a case of fire in a well-off house in the neighbourhood (more vulnerable to theft because of the sudden emergency), and finally becomes a broker for goods stolen by Moll to a drunken gentleman. In that case, the amount gained is allegedly greater than what she would have gained by standard re-selling in the secondary market.&lt;ref name="gut"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/370/370-h/370-h.htm The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders &amp;c. on Project Gutenberg], accessed on November 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governess embodies female social cunning in London's underworld, from Defoe's point of view. She is a typical receiver of her time, and whereas many male receivers used thief-taking as an official business, she relies on pawnbroking.

==Legal aspects==
Fencing is illegal almost everywhere, usually under a similar rationale as in the United States, where [[receipt of stolen property]] is a crime in every state, as well as a [[federal crime]] if the property crossed a state line. Occasionally federal agents will temporarily set up a false fence [[sting operation]].  Fencing is a common source of income for organized crime.  In [[England and Wales]], as in many U.S. states, the crime requires three elements: stolen property, the receiver's act of receiving or hiding it, and his knowledge of its stolen status.&lt;ref name=whatwhenhow /&gt;

[[Pawnbroker]]s have often been associated with fencing, though in many jurisdictions, government identification must be shown in order to pawn an item and police regularly check pawnshops for stolen goods and repossess any stolen items. While pawnbrokers do not like this characterization of their business, police efforts have indicated that some pawnbrokers are involved in fencing.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Bill.

== E-fencing ==

[[File:US Army 51805 Post, AAFES combat increases in juvenile shoplifting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stores have complained that increasingly, shoplifters are stealing goods with the intent of selling them anonymously online. In this photo, a store loss-prevention officer scans the security cameras for shoplifters.]]
E-fencing is the sale of items on the Internet that have been obtained illegally. It is an activity that criminals often mix with sales to pawnbrokers. The auction website [[eBay]], being easy to reach for the average thief, is a popular location for e-fencing; customers reported more than eight thousand crimes from the website in 2008, many of which involved the sale of stolen property.&lt;ref name="Ebay"&gt;April 11, 2009. EBay: brisk bidding in stolen goods. business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article6074448.ece&lt;/ref&gt;   Classified websites like [[Craigslist]], [[AutoTrader.com]], [[Pennysaver]] online, etc. are some of the Internet sources used for fencing goods online and circumventing the middleman fencer, in addition to a number of illegal [[darknet market]]s.

E-fenced items may be shoplifted or otherwise stolen, alternatively they may be purchased using stolen [[credit card]]s or similar banking information. The latter practice is often intertwined with [[Carding (fraud)|carding]], which is the trafficking of thousands or even millions of stolen credit card numbers. The sale of stolen credit cards, which usually takes place on the darknet markets, is generally considered to be a form of e-fencing in its own right, and often plays a role in supplying the data used to purchase physical goods that may be either e-fenced themselves or fenced through more traditional means.

Crime rings steal and/or use stolen financial information to pay for in-demand items from retailers and then sell them online, relying on the Internet's ability to reach buyers around the world and its anonymity; some theft rings even take pre-orders, confident that they can steal and/or fraudulently pay for whatever is currently in demand.  In the United States, major retailers such as [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] have advocated for federal legislation to combat Internet fencing.  Proposals for such legislation have often proposed requiring major sales websites (e.g. eBay and [[Amazon.com]]) to retain some items' serial numbers and to release information to retailers about major sellers whom the retailers believe to be relying on stolen property.  Such proposals have been opposed by the online retailers who would be required to maintain these records and take these actions.&lt;ref name ="seattletimes"&gt;Spencer, Jim.

[[Minneapolis]] ''[[Star Tribune]]''.  Accessed June 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[eBay]] spokesman has stated, "Perhaps the dumbest place to try to fence stolen materials is on eBay," and news agencies have reported incidents of the police purchasing stolen property directly from thieves, leading to their capture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3443962.htm Online auctions are the newest place to hawk stolen goods] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225090233/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3443962.htm |date=February 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By early 2007, e-fencing had become a $37 billion business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierce |first=Tarik |url= http://www.investortrip.com/how-to-solve-ebays-efencing-problem/ |title=Efencing Theft Problems on eBay |publisher=Investortrip.com |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
'''Forced pregnancy''' is the practice of forcing a woman to become [[pregnant]], often as part of a [[forced marriage]], or as part of a programme of breeding [[slave]]s, or as part of a programme of [[genocide]]. When a forced pregnancy leads to reproduction, it is a form of [[reproductive coercion]].

==Imperial Japan==
{{Main|Unit 731#Rape and forced pregnancy}}
Female prisoners of Unit 731 were forced to become pregnant for use in experiments.

==Bride kidnapping==
{{main|Bride kidnapping|Forced marriage}}
The practices of [[bride kidnapping]] and [[forced marriage]] typically (with the exception of purely symbolic "bride kidnappings" which are actually consensual [[elopement]]s) involve the rape of the "bride" with the intention of forcing her to become pregnant, putting her in a position where she becomes dependent on the rapist and his family and, because of cultural attitudes toward rape, unable to return to her own family.

==Slave breeding in the United States==
{{main|Slave breeding in the United States}}

During the period of [[slavery in the United States]], many slave owners attempted to influence the reproduction of slaves in order to increase the wealth of slaveholders.&lt;ref name="Marable_72"&gt;Marable, Manning, ''How capitalism underdeveloped Black America: problems in race, political economy, and society'' South End Press, 2000, p 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave breeding included coerced sexual relations between male and female slaves, promoting pregnancies of slaves, sexual relations between master and slave with the aim of producing slave children, and favoring female slaves who produced a relatively large number of children.&lt;ref name="Marable_72"/&gt;

The purpose of slave breeding was to produce new slaves without incurring the cost of purchase, to fill labor shortages caused by the termination of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and to attempt to improve the health and productivity of slaves. Slave breeding was condoned in the South because slaves were considered to be subhuman chattels, and were not entitled to the same rights accorded to free persons.

==As a means of genocide==
{{main|Genocidal rape}}
Rape, sexual slavery, and related actions including forced pregnancy and sexual slavery, are now recognized under the Geneva Convention as [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s;&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/877066/Geneva-Conventions-as-discussed-in-rape-crime |title=Geneva Conventions as Discussed in Rape Crime |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular from 1949, Article 27 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], and later also the 1977 Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, explicitly prohibit wartime rape and enforced prostitution. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognises rape, [[sexual slavery]], [[forced prostitution]], and forced pregnancy as [[crimes against humanity]] if part of a widespread or systematic practice.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive – A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |publisher=legal.un.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] identified rape as capable of amounting to [[genocide]] when used systematically or on a mass scale to destroy a people; later the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] also categorized rape as capable of being a [[crime against humanity]]. In 2008 the [[U.N. Security Council]]'s [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]] identified such acts as capable of being "war crimes, crimes against humanity or ... genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm |title=Security Council Demands Immediate and Complete Halt to Acts of Sexual Violence Against Civilians in Conflict Zones, Unanimously Adopting Resolution 1820 (2008) |publisher=UN.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these measures, rape, whether systematic or otherwise, remains widespread in conflict zones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36960">'''France entered World War I''' on  August 3, 1914, when Germany declared war. France played only a small part in the diplomatic crisis of July 1914–its top leaders were out of the country from July 15 to July 29, when most of the critical decisions were taken.&lt;ref&gt;John F. V. Keiger, ''France and the origins of the First World War'' (1983) pp 146-154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. G. Otte, ''July Crisis: The World's Descent into War, Summer 1914'' (2014). pp 198-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Austria and Germany deliberately acted to prevent  the French and Russian leadership from communicating during the last week in July. But this made little difference as French policy in strong support of Russia had been locked in.  Germany realized that a war with Russia meant a war with France, and so its war plans called for an immediate attack on France – through Belgium – hoping for a quick victory before the slow-moving Russians could become a factor. France was a major military and diplomatic player before and after the July crisis, and every power paid close attention to its role.  Historian [[Joachim Remak]] says:
: The nation that...can still be held least responsible for the outbreak of the war is France. This is so even if we bear in mind all the revisions of historical judgments, and all the  revisions of these revisions, to which we have now been treated....The French, in 1914, entered the war because they had no alternative. The Germans had attacked them. History can be very simple at  times.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Remak,  "1914--The Third Balkan War: Origins Reconsidered." ''Journal of Modern History'' 43.3 (1971): 354-366 at pp 354-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the French ambassador to Germany (1907-1914) [[Jules Cambon]] worked hard to secure a friendly détente. He was frustrated by French leaders such as [[Raymond Poincaré]], who decided Berlin was trying to weaken the [[Triple Entente]] of France, Russia and Britain,  and was not sincere in seeking peace.  The French consensus was that war was inevitable.

==Polarization of the main powers==
The war arose from conflict between two alliances: the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of Germany, Austria and Italy, and the [[Triple Entente]] of France, Russia and Britain. France had had a military alliance with Russia since 1894, designed primarily to neutralize the German threat to both countries. Germany had a military alliance with Austria-Hungary. In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austrian throne, was assassinated. The government of Austria decided to destroy Serbia once and for all, for stirring up trouble among ethnic Slavs. Berlin (Germany) secretly gave Austria a blank check, promising to support it militarily no matter what it decided. Both countries wanted a localized war, Austria versus Serbia. They mistakenly assumed that would no other powers would intervene, and failed to negotiate with Russia, France, and England to make sure the war remained localized. Unexpectedly, Russia decided to intervene to protect Serbia, a small fellow Slavic nation, despite there being no treaty requiring Russia to do so. The Tsar had the support of the President of France, who otherwise was hardly involved. Russia mobilized its army against Austria. Germany declared war on Russia and France, and invaded France through Belgium. Britain had an understanding and military and naval planning agreements with France, but no formal treaty obligations. Britain did have a treaty obligation toward Belgium, and as a result Britain joined France and Russia (the Allies) and declared war on Germany and Austria (the Central Powers). Japan, allied with Britain, joined the Allies. The Ottoman Empire (Turkey) joined the Central Powers. Italy, instead of joining Germany and Austria-Hungary with whom it had treaties, entered the war on the side of the Allies in 1915. The United States tried unsuccessfully to broker peace negotiations, and entered the war on the Allied side in April 1917. After very heavy losses on both sides, the Allies were decisively victorious, and divided the spoils of victory, such as the German and Ottoman colonies. France was a winner, while the German, Russian and Ottoman Empires disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt; For a short overview see David Fromkin, ''Europe's Last Summer: Who Started the Great War in 1914?'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic background==
By the late 1880s Bismarck's [[League of the Three Emperors]] was in disarray. Germany remained closely allied to Austria-Hungary (since 1879) but there was growing friction between Russia and Austria-Hungary. Bismarck, in the hope of making the Tsar more amenable to his wishes, had forbidden German banks to lend money to Russia. French bankers quickly replaced the Germans in financing Russia, and helped to speed Russian industrialisation. The Russians had borrowed around 500 million francs by 1888. Bismarck signed a [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia in 1887, but after Bismarck's fall from power in 1890 Kaiser William II refused Russia's request to renew it. 

The advantage of a Franco-Russian alliance was clear to all Frenchmen: France would not be alone against Germany, for it promised a two-front war. Formal visits were exchanged between the two powers in 1890 and 1891, and the Russian Tsar saluted the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The Franco-Russian alliance was announced in 1894. This diplomatic coup was followed by a secret agreement with Italy, allowing the Italians a free hand to expand in Tripoli (modern Libya, then still under Turkish rule). In return, Italy promised she would remain non-belligerent against France in any future war. Meanwhile, as Britain became increasingly anxious over the German naval buildup and industrial rivalry, agreement with France became increasingly attractive.

France competed with Britain, and to a lesser extent with Italy, for control of Africa. There was constant friction between Britain and France over borders between their respective African colonies (see the [[Fashoda Incident]]). The French Foreign Minister Théophile Delcassé was aware that France could not progress if she was in conflict with Germany in Europe and Britain in Africa, and so recalled Captain Marchand's expeditionary force from Fashoda, despite popular protests. This paved the way for Britain joining France in World War I.

[[Edward VII of Britain|Edward VII]]'s visit to Paris in 1903 stilled anti-British feeling in France, and prepared the way for the [[Entente Cordiale]]. Initially however, a colonial agreement against the Kaiser's aggressive foreign policy deepened rather than destroyed the bond between the two countries. The Moroccan Crises of 1905 and 1911 encouraged both countries to embark on a series of secret military negotiations in the case of war with Germany. However, British Foreign Minister [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] realized the risk that small conflicts between Paris and Berlin could escalate out of control. Working with little supervision from the British Prime Minister or Cabinet, Grey deliberately played a mediating role, trying to calm both sides and thereby maintain a peaceful balance of power. He refused to make permanent commitments to France. He approved military staff talks with France in 1905, thereby suggesting, but not promising, that if war broke out Britain would favour France over Germany. In 1911, when there was a second Franco-German clash over Morocco, Grey tried to moderate the French while supporting Germany in its demand for compensation. There was little risk that Britain would have conflicts with anyone leading to war. The Royal Navy remained dominant in world affairs, and remained a high spending priority for the British government. The British Army was small, although plans to send an expeditionary force to France had been developed since the [[Haldane Reforms]].  From 1907 through 1914, the French and British armies collaborated on highly detailed plans for mobilizing a British Expeditionary Force of 100,000 combat troops to be very quickly moved to France, and sent to the front in less than two weeks.&lt;ref&gt; Samuel R. Williamson, Jr., ''The Politics of Grand Strategy: France and Britain Prepare for War, 1904-1914." (1969) pp 313-17..&lt;/ref&gt;    Grey insisted that world peace was in the best interests of Britain and the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Otte, "'Almost a law of nature'? Sir Edward Grey, the foreign office, and the balance of power in Europe, 1905-12." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 14.2 (2003): 77-118.&lt;/ref&gt; 

France could strengthen its position in the event of war by forming new alliances or by enlisting more young men. It used both methods.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Morrow, "Arms versus Allies: Trade-offs in the Search for Security." ''International Organization'' 47.2 (1993): 207-233. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706889 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Russia was firmly in the same camp, and Britain was almost ready to join. In 1913 the controversial "three year law" extended the term of conscription for French draftees from two to three years. Previously young men were in training at ages 21 and 22 then joined the reserves; now they were in training at ages 20, 21, and 22.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Krumeich, ''Armaments and Politics in France on the Eve of the First World War: The Introduction of Three-Year Conscription, 1913-1914'' (1985). &lt;/ref&gt;

When the war began in 1914, France could only win if Britain joined with France and Russia to stop Germany. There was no binding treaty between Britain and France, and no moral commitment on the British part to go to war on France's behalf. The Liberal government of Britain was pacifistic, and also extremely legalistic, so that German violation of Belgium neutrality – treating it like a scrap of paper – helped mobilize party members to support the war effort. The decisive factors were twofold, Britain felt a sense of obligation to defend France, and the Liberal Government realized that unless it did so, it would collapse either into a coalition, or yield control to the more militaristic Conservative Party. Either option would likely ruin the Liberal Party. When the German army invaded Belgium, not only was neutrality violated, but France was threatened with defeat, so the British government went to war.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Wilson,  "Britain's ‘Moral Commitment’ to France in August 1914." ''History'' 64.212 (1979): 380-390. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2441353 online]&lt;/ref&gt;   

Mounting international tensions and the arms race led to the need to increase conscription from two to three years. Socialists, led by [[Jean Jaurès]], deeply believed that war was a capitalist plot and could never be beneficial to the working man. They worked hard to defeat the conscription proposal, often in cooperation with middle-class pacifists and women's groups, but were outvoted.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Rowe, "Globalization, conscription, and anti-militarism in pre-World War I Europe." in Lars Mjoset and Stephen Van Holde, eds. ''The Comparative Study of Conscription in the Armed Forces'' (Emerald Group, 2002) pp. 145-170.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Attitudes toward Germany===
The critical issue for France was its relationship with Germany. Paris had relatively little involvement in the Balkan crisis that launched the war, paying little attention to Serbia, Austria, or the Ottoman Empire. However a series of unpleasant diplomatic confrontations with Germany soured relationships. The [[Franco-Prussian War|defeat in 1870-71]] rankled, especially the loss of [[Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace and Lorraine]]. Although the issue of Alsace-Lorraine faded in importance after 1880, the rapid growth in the population and economy of Germany left France increasingly far behind. It was obvious that Germany could field more soldiers, and build more heavy weapons. In the 1890s relationships remained good as Germany supported France during its difficulties with Britain over African colonies. Any lingering harmony collapsed in 1905, when Germany took an aggressively hostile position on French claims to Morocco. There was talk of war, and France strengthened its ties with Britain and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;J.F.V. Keiger, ''France and the World since 1870 (2001) pp 112-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Even critics of French imperialism, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]], had become impatient with Berlin. [[Raymond Poincaré]]'s speeches as Prime Minister in 1912, and then as President in 1913-14, were similarly firm and drew widespread support across the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Horne|title=A Companion to World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjZHLXRKjtEC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2012|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the socialists were holdouts, warning that war was a capitalist ploy and should be avoided by the working class. In July 1914, socialist leader [[Jean Jaurès]] obtained a vote against war from the French Socialist Party Congress. 1,690 delegates supported a general strike against the war (so long as the German socialists followed suit), with 1,174 opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hall Gardner|title=The Failure to Prevent World War I: The Unexpected Armageddon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-K_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA212|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|pages=212-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Jaurès was assassinated on 31 July, and the socialist parties in both France and Germany – as well as most other countries – strongly supported their national war effort in the first year.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara W. Tuchman, "The Death of Jaurès", chapter 8 of ''[[The Proud Tower|The Proud Tower - A portrait of the world before the War: 1890-1914]]'' (1966) pp. 451-515.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jules Cambon]], the French ambassador to Berlin (1907-1914), worked hard to secure a detente but French leaders decided Berlin was trying to weaken the Triple Entente and was not sincere in seeking peace.  The French consensus was that war was inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;John Keiger, "Jules Cambon and Franco-German Détente, 1907–1914." ''Historical Journal'' 26.3 (1983): 641-659.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Keiger, ''France and the Origins of the First World War'' (1985) pp 37-43, 68-81. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Main players==
[[File:Poincaré Petit Journal 26 janvier 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Poincaré elected president in 1913.]]

As in all the major powers, a handful of men made the critical decisions in the summer of 1914. &lt;ref&gt;T.G. Otte, ''July Crisis: The world's descent into war, summer 1914'' (2014) pp xvii-xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;
President [[Raymond Poincaré]] was the most important decision maker, a highly skilled lawyer with a dominant personality and a hatred for Germany. He increasingly took charge of foreign affairs, but often was indecisive. [[René Viviani]] became Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in spring 1914. He was a cautious moderate, but was profoundly ignorant of foreign affairs, and was baffled by what was going on. The main decisions were made by the foreign office and increasingly by the president. [[Jules Cambon]], the French ambassador to Berlin (1907-1914), was the one major French leader who worked for détente with Germany.  The ambassador to Russia [[Maurice Paléologue]] hated Germany and reassured Russia that France would fight alongside her against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Renzi, "Who Composed 'Sazonov's Thirteen Points'? A Re-Examination of Russia's War Aims of 1914." ''American Historical Review'' 88.2 (1983): 347-357. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1865407 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The central policy goal for  Poincaré was maintaining the close alliance with Russia, which he achieved by a week-long visit to St. Petersburg in mid-July 1914.  French and German leaders were closely watching the rapid rise in Russian military and economic power and capability. For the Germans, this deepened the worry often expressed by the Kaiser that Germany was being surrounded by enemies whose power was growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jo Groebel and Robert A. Hinde, eds.|title=Aggression and War: Their Biological and Social Bases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjIxRLjPR8wC&amp;pg=PA196|year=1989|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; One implication was that time was against them, and a war happening sooner would be more advantageous for  Germany than a war happening later.  For the French, there was a growing fear that Russia would become significantly more powerful than France, and become more independent of France, possibly even returning to its old military alliance with Germany. The implication was that a war sooner could count on the Russian alliance, but the longer it waited the greater the likelihood of a Russian alliance with Germany that would doom France.&lt;ref&gt;Otte, ''July Crisis'' (2014) pp 99, 135-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==July crisis==
On 28 June 1914, the world was surprised, but not especially alarmed, by news of the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;David Fromkin, ''Europe's Last Summer: Who Started the Great War in 1914?'' (2004) p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The July crisis began on 23 July 1914 with the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], containing brutal terms intended to inspire rejection. The crisis was caused not by the assassination but rather by the decision in Vienna to use it as a pretext for a war with Serbia that many in the Austrian and Hungarian governments had long advocated.&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; A year before, it had been planned that French President [[Raymond Poincaré]] would visit St Petersburg in July 1914 to meet Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, [[Count Leopold Berchtold|Count Berchtold]], decided it was too dangerous for Austria-Hungary to present the ultimatum while the Franco-Russian summit was in progress, and decided to wait until Poincaré was on board the battleship that would take him home, so that he could not easily coordinate with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin, pp 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the time of the St Petersburg summit, there were rumours, but little hard evidence, that Vienna might use the assassination to start a war with Serbia. War did not appear imminent when President Poincaré and his new Prime Minister [[René Viviani]] departed by ship for St Petersburg on 15 July, arrived on 20 July and departed for home on 23 July. The meetings were centrally concerned with the crisis unfolding in central Europe. Although Viviani was also foreign minister, he was unfamiliar with foreign affairs and said little. Poincaré was fully in charge of the French side of the discussions. Throughout the visit, he was aggressively hostile toward Germany, and cared little for Serbia or Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Fay, ''Origins of the World War'' (1934) 2:277-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean McMeekin, ''July 1914'' (2014) pp 145-76 covers the visit day-by-day.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French and the Russians agreed that their alliance extended to supporting Serbia against Austria, confirming the already established policy behind the Balkan inception scenario. As Christopher Clark notes, "Poincaré had come to preach the gospel of firmness and his words had fallen on ready ears. Firmness in this context meant an intransigent opposition to any Austrian measure against Serbia. At no point do the sources suggest that Poincaré or his Russian interlocutors gave any thought whatsoever to what measures Austria-Hungary might legitimately be entitled to take in the aftermath of the assassinations".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers'' (2012) pp. 449–50.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vienna and Berlin both wanted to keep the confrontation localized to the Balkans, so that Austria would be the only major power involved. They neglected to negotiate on this point, and indeed systematically deceived the potential adversaries. Thus the delivery of the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia was deliberately scheduled for a few hours after the departure of the French delegation from Russia on 23 July, so that France and Russia could not coordinate their responses. There was a false assumption that if France were kept in the dark, it would nevertheless have a moderating influence and thus localize the war.&lt;ref&gt;John F. V. Keiger, ''France and the origins of the First World War'' (1983) pp 156-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Just the opposite took place: without coordination Russia assumed it had France's full support, so Austria was sabotaging its own hopes for localization. In St Petersburg, most Russian leaders sensed that their national strength was gaining on Germany and Austria, so that it would be prudent to wait until they were stronger. However, they decided that Russia would lose prestige, and forfeit its chance to take a strong leadership role in the Balkans. They might be stronger in a future confrontation, but at present they had France as an ally, and the future was unpredictable. So Tsar Nicholas II decided to mobilize on the southwestern flank against Austria to deter Vienna from an invasion of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;Jack S. Levy, and William Mulligan, "Shifting power, preventive logic, and the response of the target: Germany, Russia, and the First World War." ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 40.5 (2017): 731-769.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christopher Clark]] states: "The Russian general mobilisation [of 30 July] was one of the most momentous decisions of the July crisis. This was the first of the general mobilisations. It came at the moment when the German government had not yet even declared the State of Impending War".&lt;ref&gt; Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2013).  p 509.&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany now felt threatened and responded with her own mobilisation and declaration of war on 1 August 1914.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Lincoln, ''Passage Through Armageddon: The Russians in War and Revolution, 1914–1918'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

All these decisive moves and counter moves took place while Poincaré was slowly returning to Paris on board a battleship. Poincaré's attempts while afloat to communicate with Paris were blocked by the Germans, who jammed the radio messages between his ship and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; When Vienna's ultimatum was presented to Serbia on 23 July, the French government was in the hands of acting Premier [[Jean-Baptiste Bienvenu-Martin]], the Minister of Justice who was unfamiliar with foreign affairs. His inability to take decisions especially exasperated the Quai d'Orsay (the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs). Senior diplomat [[Philippe Berthelot]] complained that France was doing nothing while Europe was threatened with the prospect of war.&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin, p 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that Poincaré was practically incommunicado, the French military command began issuing orders in preparation for its own mobilization in defense against Germany, and ordered French troops to withdraw 10 kilometers from the German border so as not to be provocative. The French war plan called for an immediate invasion of Alsace-Lorraine, and never expected that the main German attack would come immediately and come far to the north, through neutral Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Keiger, ''France and the origins of the First World War'' (1983) pp 152-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

France and Russia agreed that there must not be an ultimatum. On 21 July, the Russian Foreign Minister warned the German ambassador to Russia that "Russia would not be able to tolerate Austria-Hungary's using threatening language to Serbia or taking military measures". The leaders in Berlin discounted this threat of war, and failed to pass on the message to Vienna for a week. German foreign minister [[Gottlieb von Jagow]] noted "there is certain to be some blustering in St Petersburg". German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] told his assistant that Britain and France did not realize that Germany would go to war if Russia mobilized. He thought London saw a German "bluff" and was responding with a "counterbluff".&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Jarausch, "The Illusion of Limited War: Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg's Calculated Risk, July 1914" ''Central European History'' (1969) 2#1 pp 48-76. [ https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545516 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[James Fearon]] argues from this episode that the Germans believed Russia was expressing greater verbal support for Serbia than it would actually provide, in order to pressure Germany and Austria-Hungary to accept some Russian demands in negotiation. Meanwhile, Berlin was downplaying its actual strong support for Vienna so as to not appear the aggressor, for that would alienate German socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fearon |first1=James D. |date=Summer 1995 |title=Rationalist Explanations for War  |url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Rationalist-Explanations-for-War.pdf |journal=International organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=397–98 |doi=10.1017/S0020818300033324 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fête''', or '''fete''', is an elaborate [[festival]], [[party]] or celebration.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;Phillips Mark (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kXzDiG4brTQC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=F%C3%AAte+dictionary&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=S2qCTZaLCsTagQeJwOXVDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK# ''Vocabulary Dictionary and Workbook: 2,856 Words You Must Know''], A.

==Village fêtes==
[[File:Longdon Village Fete - geograph.org.uk - 460535.jpg|thumb|left|An English village fête]]
Village fêtes are common in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. These are usually outdoor shows held on [[village green]]s or [[recreation ground]]s with a variety of activities. They are organised by an [[ad hoc committee]] of volunteers from organisations like religious groups or [[residents' association]]s. Fêtes can also be seen in former British colonies. In [[Australia]], fêtes are often held yearly by schools and sometimes churches to raise funds.

Attractions seen at village fêtes include [[Tombola (raffle)|tombolas]], [[raffle]]s, [[Coconut shy|coconut shies]], [[bat a rat|bat a rat stalls]], [[White elephant sale|white elephant stalls]], cakes, and home produce such as jams and pickles. Competitive baking, such as making [[Victoria sponge]] cake, is part of the classic British fête.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/8753182/The-great-Victoria-sandwich.html "The great Victoria sandwich"].

The English word ''fête'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|eɪ|t}} {{Respell|FAYT}} or  {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛ|t}} {{Respell|FET}}, is borrowed from the [[Mediaeval Latin]] {{lang|la|festus}} via the [[French language|French]] {{wiktfr|fête}}, meaning "holiday" or "party".&lt;ref name="OED-fête"&gt;The New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998) {{ISBN|0-19-861263-X}} - p.677 "'''fête''' {{IPA|/feɪt/}} '''noun''' ''Brit.'' a public function, typically held outdoors and organised to raise funds for charity...".&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th-century [[Middle English]] root ''fest-'' is shared with ''feast'', ''festive'', ''festal'' and ''festival'', ''festoon'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{wiktes|fiesta}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{wiktpt|festa}}, etc. and the proper name ''[[Festus (disambiguation)|Festus]]''.&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5823">The '''GTR Euroseries''' was a short-lived [[auto racing]] series which ran in 1998.  It was created as an alternative to the international [[FIA GT Championship]], while combining elements of the former [[BPR Global GT Series]].  The GTR Euroseries was created by Patrick Peter and the GTR Organisation, who had also been a founder of the BPR.

==Development==
Following the [[1996 BPR Global GT Series season]], the [[FIA]] chose to promote the championship to a more international status and revamp the series into the [[FIA GT Championship]].  This was due to the increased amount of manufacturer support from the series, with makes including [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche]], [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]], [[Panoz]], and [[Chrysler]].  This increase in manufacturer input escalated the cost of being competitive in the series, driving various privateer teams out of the Championship.

At the same time, the FIA began to shorten events in the schedule.  While most races in 1997 remained at four hours as they had been during BPR, others were shortened to just three hours.  This was further revamped in 1998 as all events, besides the [[Suzuka 1000km]], were run for only 500 kilometers, averaging under three hours per race.

Believing that the FIA GT Championship was moving away from the BPR Global GT Series' ideals for [[grand tourer]] racing, the Peter Organisation chose to create a new championship in 1998 as an alternative to FIA GT.  This series would return to some of the concepts of BPR, such as all events being four hours in length.  The series would also have a ban on direct manufacturer input, leaving the series open to small private teams who could not easily compete in the high-cost FIA GT series.

The new GTR Euroseries would also bring back some of the class structure that had been used in BPR.  Besides allowing the GT1 and GT2 classes from FIA GT, the GT3 and GT4 classes also returned.  These classes would be composed of cars from one-make series, such as the [[Porsche Supercup]], [[Ferrari Challenge]], or [[Venturi Automobiles|Venturi]] Trophy.  Because these cars were much closer to their street legal counterparts, they were an even cheaper alternative to the GT1 and GT2 classes.

==1998 season==
The first round of the season in Jarama had twenty competitors appearing, with at least two cars in each class.  The first race was easily won by a GT1 class competitor, Thomas Bscher, using a [[McLaren F1 GTR]], a car which still competed in FIA GT Championship.  However, the next round at Paul Ricard would not feature the McLaren, and instead the GT1 class was left with only a [[Porsche 911 GT2]] Evo.  GT2 class was the most prevalent, with nine competitors, while the GT4 class also had a variety of machines.

By the third round of the season, the series mostly became a competition with the GT2 and GT4 classes, of which most of the competitors used Porsches.  A mere 12 entrants showed at Misano, while only ten arrived at the Nürburgring.  The series saw some revival in its final round of the season at Spa-Francorchamps, as 19 cars were entered, but the field still consisted mostly of GT2 and GT4 teams.

During the 1998 season, the FIA GT Championship announced their plans to eliminate their GT1 class due to the high cost of the machines which ran it and the dominance of Mercedes-Benz in the Championship. This left only the smaller GT2 class, of which only Chrysler ran a factory squad. Believing the smaller FIA GT Championship would be more open to privateer teams in 1999 and due to a lack of competitors during the 1998 season, the GTR Euroseries was cancelled after five rounds due to a lack of teams entering and no desire to run a separate series in 1999.

===Results===
All races were four hours in length.  The Misano Gold Cup allowed [[sports-prototype]]s to compete alongside the GT cars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10996">Students of [[George Mason University]], as part of Professor T. Mills Kelly's course – "Lying about the past", have created two popular [[hoax]]es: the "Edward Owens hoax," and the "Reddit serial killer hoax." It is a goal of the course to create a sweeping internet deception. As Prof. Kelly stated in the course's syllabus:

{{Cquote|What's our goal? Buzz, of course! Viral! We want our hoax to be picked up and spread around the Internet like wildfire!}}

==Edward Owens hoax==&lt;!--Anchor for redirect; caution.--&gt;
The Edward Owens hoax was a historical hoax created by students at [[George Mason University]] in 2008 as a class project for "Lying About the Past". The students created a website and a [[fictitious entry]] on [[English Wikipedia]] about Edward Owens, purportedly a [[Virginia]] oyster fisherman born in 1853 who became a [[piracy|pirate]]. The hoax was reported as true in some media outlets.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Professor Who Fooled Wikipedia Got Caught by Reddit |author=Yoni Appelbaum |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/05/how-the-professor-who-fooled-wikipedia-got-caught-by-reddit/257134/ |newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax description===
Students published a blog and videos about then fictional Owens, created by the fictional student "Jane Browning". The blog asserted that Owens fell on hard times during the [[Long Depression]] of the 1870s and took up piracy in [[Chesapeake Bay]] to survive. The students wrote that he robbed smaller [[commercial vessel]]s and wealthy pleasure boaters from [[Maryland]] using a [[punt gun]] to threaten his victims. The class created a fake [[Will (law)|will]], which asserted that Owens and his crew eventually went back to oyster fishing.&lt;ref name="Chron"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 10 biggest hoaxes in Wikipedia's first 10 years |author=Jon Brodkin |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/011411-wikipedia-hoaxes.html |newspaper=[[Network World]] |date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013195214/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/011411-wikipedia-hoaxes.html |archivedate=October 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playingwithhistory.com/www.playingwithhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/Kelly_samplechapter.pdf |title=True Facts or False Facts—Which Are More Authentic? |author=T.

After some media outlets and academics reported the hoax as factual, the class divulged the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, Whitney. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081205232921/http://blogs.usatoday.com/popcandy/2008/12/ahoy-delve-into.html Pop Candy blog], USAToday.com, December 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bavatuesdays.com/the-last-american-pirate/ "The Last American Pirate"], December 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reddit serial killer hoax==&lt;!--Anchor for redirect; caution.--&gt;
The Reddit serial killer hoax was a second historical hoax perpetrated by "Lying about the past" class members. This one quickly failed, unlike the Owens hoax. In 2012, Professor Kelly taught the course for a second time in a similar format. The Reddit hoax, about an alleged serial killer named Joseph Scafe, was launched on the [[Reddit]] site on the 28th of April, and was first debunked in just over an hour.&lt;ref name="Atlantic" /&gt;&lt;ref name=HatesRedditors&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sxkig/opinions_please_reddit_do_you_think_my_uncle_joe/c4htt9n |title=HatesRedditors comments on Opinions: "Please, Reddit. Do you think my 'Uncle' Joe was just weird or possibly a serial killer?" |publisher=Reddit.com |date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax description===
The participating students created a [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppet]] named Lisa Quinn, and under her name opened a [[Wordpress.com]] blog entitled: "I think my uncle was a serial killer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lisaquinn565.wordpress.com/ |title=I Think My Uncle Was A Serial Killer |publisher=Lisaquinn565.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her blog, Lisa wrote that she found some odd items in a Saratoga steamer trunk that she received upon the death of her grandparents. Lisa posted pictures of the trunk; ladies shoes she presumably found inside the trunk; and newspaper clippings from 1895; one of which was about the murder of Alice Walsh—later identified as having been taken from the April 22, 1895 edition of ''[[The Evening World]]''.&lt;ref name="The evening world"&gt;{{cite news | title=Who Killed Alice Walsh? |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1895-04-22/ed-1/seq-1/ |newspaper=''[[The Evening World]]'' |date=April 22, 1895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lisa's post, the trunk belonged to a relative, Joseph Scafe, (also called 'Uncle Joe'), and that it contained—in a false panel—ladies' jewelry and a "disturbing" journal. Lisa supposedly wanted to know if—in the opinion of her readers—her uncle was a serial killer.

With a new [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppet]], DisturbedThrowaway, the students attempted to start the spread of the hoax with a posting of a question on AskReddit: "Do you think my uncle Joe was just weird or possibly a serial killer?"&lt;ref name=HatesRedditors/&gt; Through Reddit, the hoax was expected to spread. At first, the hoax aroused interest. Many posters requested more photos (which DisturbedThrowaway declined) and alluded to the commercial success the case could lead to. The name of [[Jack the Ripper]] was mentioned as well. Yet, within 26 minutes, suspicions were rising. DisturbedThrowaway, the poster of the question, claimed to have found the names of two victims, Alice Walsh and Diamond Flossie, in the documents she retrieved. She asked the redditors for assistance in research; however, a quick Wikipedia search brought forth information connected with the two names, and posters at the site wondered why DisturbedThrowaway hadn't perform such a simple search herself.

===Discovery===
Just over an hour after the initial posting, HatesRedditors suggested that the post was [[viral marketing]].&lt;ref name=HatesRedditors /&gt; He noted that the Wikipedia entries for the victims had been created within two weeks of the posting and the pictures in the articles looked faked. The students tried to keep the deception going for several weeks, but the story was exposed. On May 14, Kelly revealed the serial killer hoax on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edwired.org/2012/05/14/serial-killers-beer-and-lies-about-the-past/ |title=Serial Killers, Beer, and Lies About the Past |publisher=edwired |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
With the latest hoax exposed, Wikipedia deleted the two entries about Alice Walsh and Diamond Flossie which had been written by the students’ sockpuppets. The professor and students claimed that the subjects were factual, but Wikipedia found them to be of insufficient notability. Wikipedia administrators did raise questions about the course's [[situational ethics]], however, as some claimed that Professor Kelly legitimized [[Vandalism on Wikipedia|Wikipedia vandalism]].&lt;ref name=Wikipedia&gt;{{cite web | title=Admin discussion|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive235#Articles_created_for_the_good_of_education|date= 16–19 May 2012|accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2017}}

Professor Kelly did not express regret in this matter, "I don't think there were any real victims here", he blogged: {{cquote|I will also continue to teach Lying About the Past. Given the ubiquitous nature of Wikipedia in the information landscape, I think it's fair to say that whenever I teach the course again, Wikipedia will be a part of it some way, some how.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edwired.org/2012/06/01/wikipedia-and-me/ |title=Wikipedia and Me |publisher=edwired |date=2012-06-01 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Results==
Yoni Appelbaum wrote in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' an article, "How the Professor Who fooled Wikipedia Got Caught by Reddit," in which he compared the serial killer hoax and the last pirate hoax. In his article, he wondered why the 2008 hoax was successful, while this hoax failed in minutes. One answer he suggested was that Wikipedia has a trusting community, while Reddit has a critical and skeptical community.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt;

In March 2013, Kelly announced that he would no longer be teaching the course, after the university declined to make it part of the regular curriculum of his department,&lt;ref name="Mills Kelly"&gt;{{citation | url=http://edwired.org/2013/03/31/no-more-lying-about-the-past/ |title=No More Lying About the Past |publisher=Center for History and New Media, George Mason University |date=March 31, 2013 |author=Mills Kelly }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, as of February 2015 Professor Mills continues to delve into topics dealing with editing and/or manipulating Wikipedia in his [[digital history]] class&lt;ref&gt;[http://edwired.org/courses/h390sp15/ History 390 Digital History Class]&lt;/ref&gt; at George Mason University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edwired.org/courses/h390sp15/ The Digital Past 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of February 2016, all references to the hoaxes and classes have been removed from the university's web pages.

'''Golden Boy Promotions''', Inc. is an American boxing and mixed martial arts promotion firm based in [[Los Angeles, California]] which was established in 2002 by 10-time world champion (in six divisions) [[Oscar De La Hoya]]. "Golden Boy" is one of boxing’s most active and high profile promoters, presenting shows worldwide.

== History ==
In 2005 Golden Boy Enterprises announced the formation of Golden Boy Partners, a company focused on urban development in Latino communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenboypromotions.com/media/2005/april/goldenboy_partners.html :: Golden Boy Promotions Inc. ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927191135/http://www.goldenboypromotions.com/media/2005/april/goldenboy_partners.html |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Richard Schaefer with Mayweather and Ortiz.jpg|thumb|Richard Schaefer making a speech at the press conference for the fight between [[Victor Ortiz vs. Floyd Mayweather|Victor Ortiz and Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]]]]

Golden Boy promoted the May 5, 2007, [[De La Hoya-Mayweather|"super fight"]] between De La Hoya and [[Floyd Mayweather]] at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena|MGM Grand]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Mayweather won the bout by a split decision. The fight once held the record for most pay-per-view buys and once held the record as the second highest grossing fight in the history of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenboypromotions.com/media/2006/dec/5.5.07_0scar_banner.htm|title=:: Golden Boy Promotions Inc. ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They also co-promoted along with Top Rank, The Dream Match: Oscar De La Hoya Vs Manny Pacquiao on December 6, 2008.

In June 2009, Golden Boy Enterprises became embroiled in a dispute over who would fight for the WBA junior welterweight title.  On the one hand, undefeated [[Dmitry Salita]] (the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]]'s No. 1-ranked 140-pounder) was told by the WBA in writing that he will face the winner of the June 27 fight between titleholder [[Andreas Kotelnik]] and [[Amir Khan (British boxer)|Amir Khan]].  On the other hand, [[Richard Schaefer]] of Golden Boy said that ''he'' had it "in writing" that that fight would face the winner of the [[Victor Ortíz]]-Marcos Maidana fight.&lt;ref name=ringtv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ringtv.com/blog/712/salita_could_be_odd_man_out_in_wba_junior_welterweight_derby/|title=Data|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WBA's top executives were unavailable for comment.  Salita was extremely upset over the prospect that he could lose what would be his first title shot.  "They're a big company", he said of Golden Boy. "They're trying to bend the rules. They're trying to kick everyone to the side and get their way, rules or no rules. When Oscar De La Hoya formed Golden Boy, he said he wanted to change boxing, to bring honor to the sport. This isn't the honorable thing to do.  This isn't good for boxing. This isn't justice. This goes against the right to pursue happiness, which is why my family immigrated to this country (from Ukraine) and why I've worked so hard. We'll see what happens."&lt;ref name=ringtv/&gt; Salita ended up fighting Khan, losing by 1st-round TKO.

In January 2017, Golden Boy signed a contract to bring their boxing promotions to ESPN under a two year deal of a total of 48 fights&lt;ref name="ESPNJan2017"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/18508305/golden-boy-promotions-espn-enter-partnership-42-fight-cards-next-two-years |title='Golden Boy Boxing on ESPN' begins partnership in March |last=Rafael |first=Dan |date=2017-01-19 |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Inc |access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In October 2018, [[Canelo Álvarez|Canelo Alvarez]] (50-1-2, 34 KOs), the undisputed king of pay-per-view boxing will usher in a new era in the sport by signing an 11-fight deal with sports streaming site [[DAZN]]. The journey begins Saturday, Dec. 15 when Canelo makes his first appearance at the historic [[Madison Square Garden]] challenging [[Rocky Fielding]] (27-1, 15 KOs) for the [[List of WBA world champions#Super middleweight|WBA Super Middleweight World Championship]]. This groundbreaking deal with Canelo will be the richest athlete contract in sports history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canelo-alvarez--golden-boy-promotions-sign-historic-five-year-partnership-with-global-sports-streaming-leader-dazn-300732482.html|title=Canelo Alvarez &amp; Golden Boy Promotions Sign Historic Five-Year Partnership With Global Sports Streaming Leader DAZN|last=Promotions|first=Golden Boy|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hong Kong People's Fringe Festival''' (in Chinese, 香港藝穗民化節) is a month-long open-access multi-arts festival held annually in [[Hong Kong]]. Initiated by the arts community in 2012, proposed by Hong Kong People's Fringe Association, the first festival showcased more than 50 art groups, 72 events and 42 alternative venues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pplsfringe.com/index.php/en/hkpff-en |title=HKPFF |publisher=Hong Kong People's Fringe Festival |accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; all over Hong Kong. The 4th Hong Kong People's Fringe Festival 2015 is going to take place from November 21 to December 20, 2015. The festival is having its sabbatical in 2016. 

== History ==
The founders of the Hong Kong People's Fringe Festival were stage director, Chan Chu Hei, choreographer-musician Julia Mok, composer-guitarist Chan Wai Fat and lighting-designer-cinematographer, Gabriel Fung. After a recent visit to Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the four friends discussed possibilities of organizing a similar festival that would encompass every possible form of art. It was also an effort to build a network amongst the smaller alternative venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Choi |first=Joyce |title=Hong Kong People's Fringe Festival |publisher=TimeOut Hong Kong |date=21 Nov 2012 |url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/stage/features/54543/hong-kong-peoples-fringe-festival.html |accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong People's Fringe Association was formed. It only took a year from the announcement of the festival in November 2011 to the actual festival period, November 23 to December 15, 2012. Ho Ying Fung, stage director and scenographer, contributed the festival's first logo.

== Festival Period ==
The first festival spanned from November 23 to December 15, 2012. The three-week festival then stretched one week longer in the second year and took place earlier in the year from November 1 to December 1, 2013. The third festival starts from October 18 to November 15, 2014 and the fourth one is from November 21 to December 20, 2015.

== Slogan ==
* 2015 Invigorate Freely, the City Blossoms!
* 2014 Space.Revolution.Freedom.Senses
* 2013 Space, Imagination, Freedom, Flight!
* 2012 When People Act, the City Reacts!

== Categories ==
The registered events are roughly organized into categories. Categories vary each year. Initially they were Theatre, Dance and Physical Theatre, Music, Site Specific, Multi-media, Children's Show, Poetry and Literature, Festival-in-Festival, Workshop and Seminar, Film, Visual Art, Miscellaneous. In 2013, the Music+Dance category was introduced. In 2014, Puppetry and Comedy were added. In 2015, Magic became a category.

== Venues ==
The wide variety of venues sets People's Fringe apart from other mainstream festivals in Hong Kong. In 2012, There were 42 alternative venues consisting of rehearsal rooms, studio theatres, live houses, bookstores, tailor shops, cafés, hair salons, galleries, rooftops, beaches and on the street. In 2013, churches, a rural village, a fruit plantation were added to the list.

== How to Join ==
* '''Show Registration'''
A participant needs to choose a venue to present the work, liaise with the venue so the show time can be set. The policy of every venue is different but there are some venues that would give discount to participants to People's Fringe participants. There is a list of venues on the festival website but the participant is not limited to it. Then a registration form is to be completed, together with images for the show. There is no selection process. Everyone is welcome. Registration is open until the end of the festival and is for free.
* '''Venue Registration'''
Venue registration is open for any venue that intends to offer space and services for the festival participants. There is no charge.
* '''Volunteer Registration'''
There is a spectrum of work that volunteers can be involved. From poster-posting to onsite-helping to foreign guests assisting, a young volunteer gets to be involved in festival management.

== Partners ==
One of the focuses of HK People's Fringe Festival is to encourage collaboration and partnership between art and society. In 2014, People's Fringe partnered with FringeBacker to crowd fund for the events. A media partner from 2014, Arttalk is a collective of writers and critics for the theatre. HKELD.com, also a media partner from 2014, is a website introducing theatre events to non-Chinese speakers in Hong Kong. Art-mate, a ticketing partner, offers discount to participants of the festival to use their online ticketing service.

      <comment>I have removed the nonsense about the etymology of Hop-tu-naa as it is clearly a nonsense rhyme and makes NO sense in Manx or in Irish or Scottish Gaelic but such rhymes are very common. I have also explained that 'Oie Houney' is the same as Irish  Oíche Shamhna (which is pronounced the same) and which IS halloween.</comment>

'''Hop-tu-Naa''' is a [[Celt]]ic festival celebrated in the [[Isle of Man]] on 31 October. It is the celebration of the original New Year's Eve ({{lang|gl|Oie Houney}}). It is thought to be the oldest unbroken tradition in the Isle of Man.&lt;ref name="woolley"&gt;[http://www.culturevannin.im/oral_history_article_452607.html Oral history interview with Sue Woolley conducted by [[Culture Vannin]], 19 October 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hop-tu-naa turnip with witch and cat.jpg|thumb|Hop-tu-naa turnip with witch and cat]]

==Etymology==
Hop-tu-Naa is a continuation of the Manx Oie Houiney, which is exactly the same as the Irish Oíche Shamhna and which is pronounced the same. The exact status of Oíche Shamhna and its role in the Celtic calendar has been a matter of debate. Oíche Shamhna eventually mutated in to Halloween in northern England and in Ireland, it was carried to America by Irish immigrants and developed in to the modern Halloween. 

The term ‘Hop-tu-naa’ comes from a Manx Gaelic song traditionally sung during the festival which included the nonsense Hop-tu-naa as part of the rhyme scheme, such nonsense rhymes are common theme in Irish and Scottish Gaelic music. 

==Traditions==
On the Isle of Man today, many groups of people continue the tradition of singing Hop-tu-Naa songs "around the houses"{{clarifyme|date=April 2018}} with turnip lanterns.&lt;ref name="woolley" /&gt; In addition to this, many Hop-tu-Naa events take place across the Isle of Man each year, most of which today include competitions for turnip{{clarifyme|date=April 2018}} and the singing of traditional songs. As well as the many events run within local communities, the National Folk Museum at [[Cregneash]] hosts an event to teach the traditional Hop-tu-Naa song and to help people to carve turnips.&lt;ref name=manx&gt;[http://www.manx.net/isle-of-man-news/595/hop-tu-naa-celebrations-at-cregneash Manx National Heritage. "Hop Tu Naa Celebrations at Cregneash", ''Isle of Man News'', 26 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turnip lanterns===
At the modern Hop-tu-Naa, children dress up and go from house to house hoping to be given sweets or money, as elsewhere. The children carry carved "[[Swede (vegetable)|turnip]]" lanterns (which are known as "moots" by the Manx) and sing Hop-tu-Naa songs. There are regional varieties of how turnips should be carved for Hop-tu-Naa, with variations focusing on which way up the turnip is and the nature of the decorations.&lt;ref name="woolley" /&gt; It is believed that turnip-lanterns do not date earlier than the start of the 19th century, as the vegetable had only been introduced at the end of the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/188829706 ''When did the Manx first carve turnips?'' by [[Culture Vannin]], available on [[Vimeo]]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the past children would bring the stumps of turnips with them and batter the doors of those who refused to give them any money, in an ancient form of [[trick or treat]]. This practice appears to have died out.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/folklore/ch06.htm ''Folk Lore of the Isle of Man'' by A. W. Moore, Isle of Man: Brown &amp; Son, Isle of Man, 1891]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dancing===
A [[Hop-tu-Naa (dance)|hop-tu-naa dance]] was collected by both [[Mona Douglas]] and Leighton Stowell. It was believed to have been danced through the streets on Hop-tu-Naa night by couples carrying their turnip-lanterns.&lt;ref&gt;''Rinkaghyn Vannin: Dances of Mann'' Isle of Man: Sleih gyn Thie. 1983&lt;/ref&gt; It is a simple procession dance for pairs of dancers which involves the Manx reel step and a combination of arches only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturevannin.im/media//media%20-%20Customs%20and%20traditions/Hop%20tu%20Naa/Hop-tu-naa%20dance%20instructions.pdf 'Hop tu naa – Hollantide Dance' instructions (accessed 18 October 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; This dance is taught in many schools on the Isle of Man during October each year, and it is danced at many of the Hop-tu-Naa events across the island.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDeM6DJga20&amp;t=1s 'Hop-tu-naa: A traditional Manx celebration in Maughold'] on YouTube (accessed 18 October 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divination===
Some of the older customs are similar to those now attached to the January New Year. It was a time for prophesying, weather prediction and fortune-telling.&lt;ref name="clague"&gt;[http://smo.uhi.ac.uk/~stephen/chiollaghbooks/JC_MXREM_S.pdf ''Cooinaghtyn Manninagh: Manx Reminiscences'' by Dr John Clague, ed. Stephen Miller, Chiollagh Books, 2005 (originally published 1911)]&lt;/ref&gt; Last thing at night, the ashes of a fire were smoothed out on the hearth to receive the imprint of a foot. If, next morning, the track pointed towards the door, someone in the house would die, but if the footprint pointed inward, it indicated a birth.

A cake was made which was called Soddag Valloo or Dumb Cake, because it was made and eaten in silence. Young women and girls all had a hand in baking it on the red embers of the hearth, first helping to mix the ingredients (flour, eggs, eggshells, soot and salt) and kneading the dough. The cake was divided up and eaten in silence and, still without speaking, all who had eaten it went to bed, walking backwards, expecting and hoping to see their future husband in a dream or vision. The future husband was expected to appear in the dream and offer a drink of water.&lt;ref name="Paton"&gt;''Manx Calendar Customs'' by Cyril Ingram Paton, Cribyn: Llanerch Press, 2004 (originally published 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other means of divination was to steal a salt herring from a neighbour, roast it over the fire, eat it in silence and retire to bed.;&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; or to hold a mouthful of water in your mouth and a pinch of salt in each hand as you listen to a neighbour's conversation, whereupon the first name mentioned would be that of your future spouse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/188833786 ''A Manx Superstition for Hop-tu-naa'' by [[Culture Vannin]], available on [[Vimeo]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional foods===
Traditional food for Hop-tu-Naa includes ''mrastyr'': potatoes, parsnips and fish mashed up with butter. Any leftovers from this evening meal would be left out with crocks of fresh water for the [[fairies]].&lt;ref name="curriculum"&gt;[https://wiki1.sch.im/wiki/pages/5540B66/RECIPES_(hop_tu_naa).html Recipes, Hop-tu-naa] on the Manx curriculum website&lt;/ref&gt; Toffee would also be made, with just sugar and water, as a communal activity on the evening of Hop-tu-Naa.&lt;ref name="curriculum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://soundcloud.com/manxliterature/hilda-cowin-november-12th-read-by-constance-radcliffe ''November 12th''] by Hilda Cowin, read by Constance Radcliffe in 1986.

===Modern Hop-tu-Naa songs===

Different versions of Hop-tu-naa songs were sung in different areas of the island.

"Jinnie the Witch" is a modern [[Manx English]] song, which was sung around the Douglas area.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;[http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/~stephen/manxnotes/MN144.pdf ‘How Old is Jinny the Witch?’] ed. Stephen Miller, ‘’Manx Notes’’ 144 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hampton Creer, Jinny's real name was Joney Lowney. She lived in [[Braddan]] and was tried at Bishop's Court for [[witchcraft]] in 1715 and 1716. Her greatest "crime" was stopping the Ballaughton Corn Mill. She was sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment, fined £3 and made to stand at the four market crosses dressed in sackcloth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturevannin.im/oral_history_article_288508.html Oral history interview with Hampton Creer] conducted by [[Culture Vannin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern song goes as follows :
[[File:Hop-tu-naa turnip with face.jpg|thumb|A Hop-tu-Naa turnip carved with a face]]

:Hop-tu-Naa
:My mother's gone away
:And she won't be back until the morning

:Jinnie the Witch flew over the house
:To fetch the stick to lather the mouse

:Hop-tu-Naa
:My mother's gone away
:And she won't be back until the morning

:Hop-tu-Naa, Traa-la-laa&lt;ref name=Caine&gt;[http://namanx.blogspot.com/2014/10/hop-tu-naa-who-was-jinny-witch.html Caine, Valerie. "Hop tu Naa - Who Was Jinny the Witch?", North American Manx Association, 31 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West of the Island a longer version was sung, which is more closely related to the Manx version.

The following version dates from the 1930s – a similar version is recorded in "A Vocabulary of the Anglo-Manx Dialect" by [[Arthur William Moore|A. W. Moore]], [[Sophia Morrison]] and Edmund Goodwin (1924):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/am1924/index.htm ''A Vocabulary of the Anglo-Manx Dialect'' compiled by A. W. Moore with the co-operation of Sophia Morrison and Edmund Goodwin, Oxford University Press, 1924]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Manx Ballads and Music by A. W. Moore - 1st edition front cover.jpg|thumb|350px|''Manx Ballads and Music'' by A. W. Moore; the earliest book published featuring the Hop-tu-naa song and music]]

:Hop-tu-naa! put in the pot
:Hop-tu-naa! put in the pan
:Hop-tu-naa! I burnt me throt (throat)
:Hop-tu-naa! guess where I ran?
:Hop-tu-naa! I ran to the well
:Hop-tu-naa! and drank my fill
:Hop-tu-naa! and on the way back
:Hop-tu-naa! I met a witch cat
:Hop-tu-naa! the cat began to grin
:Hop-tu-naa! and I began to run
:Hop-tu-naa! I ran to Ronague
:Hop-tu-naa! guess what I saw there?
:Hop-tu-naa! I saw an old woman
:Hop-tu-naa! baking bonnags
:Hop-tu-naa! roasting sconnags
:Hop-tu-naa! I asked her for a bit
:Hop-tu-naa! she gave me a bit
:as big as me big toe
:Hop-tu-naa! she dipped it in milk
:Hop-tu-naa! she wrapped it in silk
:Hop-tu-naa! Traa la lay!
:If you're going to give us anything, give it to us soon
:before we run away with the light of the moon!

The 1970s Southern version from Castletown includes the mention of the Witches Mill, the Smelt Monument and the Old House of Keys:

:This is auld hollantide night, the moon shines clear and bright
:Hop-tu-naa, traa-la-laa
:Jinnie the witch jumped over the college to fetch the stick to stir the porridge
:Hop-tu-naa, traa-la-laa
:Castletown square is mighty bare, there isn't a statue that should have been there
:Hop-tu-naa, traa-la-laa
:The castle is grey, and Parliament gone, the harbour is quiet no smugglers run
:Hop-tu-naa, traa-la-laa

:when lights were turned out and no sweets were given, there was a further chorus:-

:This is old hollantide night, the moon is shining bright
:if you're going to bring us money 
:You better bring it quick
:as we may start to sing again, and your neighbours will think you're thick
:Hop-tu-naa, traa-la-laa
:Jinnie the witch is over the mill if you don't give us something quick 
:she will come and get you.

New songs for Hop-tu-Naa continue to be created, the most notable of which was written by Scaanjoon in 2015, having been commissioned by [[Culture Vannin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCklUnMN0Ks ''Creepy Folk Come Down''] by Scanjoon on [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; This has been taken up by the Manx traditional music youth group, Bree, as a part of their repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/148399448 ''"Creepy Folk Come Down" - Big Bree Workshop Weekend 2015 Concert 1''] released by [[Culture Vannin]] on [[Vimeo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Virgin Killer.jpg|thumb|The cover of the album ''[[Virgin Killer]]'', the image which instigated the controversy]]
On 5 December 2008, the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] (IWF), a British [[watchdog group]], [[Blacklist (computing)|blacklisted]] content on the [[English Wikipedia]] related to [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions']] 1976 studio album ''[[Virgin Killer]]'', due to the presence of its controversial [[cover art]]work, depicting a young girl posing nude, with a faux glass shatter obscuring her genitalia. The image was deemed to be "potentially illegal content" under [[Protection of Children Act 1978|English law]] which forbids the possession or creation of indecent photographs of children.

== Background ==
{{further|Virgin Killer#Cover art}}
The album art of the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions']] album ''[[Virgin Killer]]'', featuring a young girl fully nude with a "smashed glass" effect covering her genitalia,&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; was deemed controversial at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt; The cover was replaced in some markets with an alternate cover image featuring a photo of the band members. [[RCA Records]] refused to sell the controversial album cover in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Yasui, Todd.

In the United Kingdom, access to illegal content (such as [[child pornography]]) was strictly self-regulated by individual [[internet service provider]]s. This began when [[BT Group]] introduced [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]], a server-side [[Content-control software|filtering system]] which uses data obtained from the [[Internet Watch Foundation]]. The IWF is a [[Quango]] organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content to be added to their blacklists.&lt;ref name="cleanfeedbegin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1232422,00.html|title=BT puts block on child porn sites|work=The Observer |location=UK |accessdate=10 December 2008  | first=Martin | last=Bright | date=6 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the [[Protection of Children Act 1978|Protection of Children Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Internet Watch Foundation&amp;nbsp;— R v Bowden {{cite web |url=http://www.iwf.org.uk/police/page.99.209.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929093650/http://www.iwf.org.uk/police/page.99.209.htm |archivedate=29 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.&lt;ref name="LINX"&gt;"[http://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?p=497 Government sets deadline for universal network-level content blocking] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601194532/http://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?p=497 |date=1 June 2006 }}", LINX, 29 May 2006.

== Addition to IWF blacklist ==
On 5 December 2008 the Internet Watch Foundation added the [[Wikipedia]] [[URL]]s for the ''Virgin Killer'' article and the [[:Image:Virgin Killer.jpg|description page of the image]] to its blacklist.&lt;ref name="gamazon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/08/amazon-internet-censorship-iwf|title=Internet watchdog considers censoring Amazon US over Scorpions image|last=Arthur|first=Charles|date=8 December 2008|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=8 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the blacklisting, users of major UK ISPs, including [[BT Group|BT]], [[Vodafone]], [[Virgin Media]]/[[Tesco|Tesco.net]], [[Be Unlimited|Be]]/[[Telefónica Europe|O2]], [[UK Online|EasyNet/UK Online]]/[[Sky Broadband]], [[Orange United Kingdom|Orange]], [[Demon Internet|Demon]], and [[TalkTalk (telecommunications company)|TalkTalk]] (Opal Telecom), were unable to access the content.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

Sarah Robertson, director of communications for the IWF, said that the image was rated "1 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the least offensive". She described the picture as "erotic posing with no sexual activity".&lt;ref name="gamazon"/&gt;  While the image itself has not been flagged as "illegal", IWF determined it to be a "potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18".&lt;ref name="WDP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/155156/wikipedia_censorship_sparks_free_speech_debate.html|title=Wikipedia Censorship Sparks Free Speech Debate|last=Raphael|first=JR|date=8 December 2008|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWF said they were first notified of the Wikipedia URL on 4 December 2008. This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by U.S.-based social conservative site ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/09/scorpions-virgin-killer-censorship|title=A nasty sting in the censors' tail|last=Fisher|first=Frank|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''EContent'' magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the ''Virgin Killer'' cover will not be removed", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors "favour inclusion in all but the most extreme cases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Wikipedia-Weighs-Information-Against-Indecency-49659.htm|title=Wikipedia Weighs Information Against Indecency|first=Jessica|last=Dye|date=1 July 2008|work=EContent|accessdate=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to ''[[The Guardian]]'' because "the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on". Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that "We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win", before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly "given that you can go into [[HMV Group|HMV]] and buy a copy on the high street".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/dec/09/wikipedia-censorship|title=Wikipedia censor mess 'a no-win'|last=Johnson|first=Bobbie|date=9 December 2008|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=9 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 9 December 2008 the IWF reversed its blacklist of the Wikipedia pages on the basis of the "contextual issues involved in this specific case and, in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability".&lt;ref name="IWF9"/&gt;

== Effects on Wikipedia ==
{{See also|Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Proxy server}}

[[File:VK WikipediaBlock.png|thumb|left|Users attempting to access the ''Virgin Killer'' article or image were met with pseudo-[[404 error]]s or other messages.]]

The blacklisting of ''Virgin Killer'' also caused other inadvertent issues for Wikipedia users in the United Kingdom. Usually most Internet users have a unique [[IP address]] visible to websites. However, as a result of ISPs using the IWF blacklist implemented through [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]] technology, traffic to Wikipedia via those affected ISPs was then routed through a small number of [[proxy server]]s.&lt;ref name="pcworld"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/155112/wikipedia_article_censored_in_uk_for_the_first_time.html|title=Wikipedia Article Censored in UK for the First Time|last=Kirk|first=Jeremy|date=8 December 2008|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused problems for users of the site. Since Wikipedia allows users to anonymously edit its encyclopaedia articles, these individuals are identified only through their IP addresses, which are used to selectively block users who vandalise the site or otherwise break its rules. The proxy filtering makes it impossible to uniquely distinguish users, and to prevent vandalism Wikipedia "instituted a blanket ban on anonymous edits from the six ISPs, which account for 95% of British residential internet users".&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/web/wikipedia-added-to-child-pornography-blacklist/2008/12/08/1228584723764.html |title=Wikipedia added to child pornography blacklist |last=Moses |first=Asher |date=8 December 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had the immediate effect of requiring nearly all registered users in the UK to request the lifting of {{srlink|Wikipedia:Autoblock|IP Autoblocks}} on their accounts before they could edit again, and the de facto permanent effect of barring any contribution from people without {{srlink|Wikipedia:Why create an account?|user accounts on the site}}, who contribute merely under an IP address and not a user name.

The [[MediaWiki]] software that Wikipedia runs on can interpret [[X-Forwarded-For]] (XFF) headers, allowing Wikipedia to identify a user's main IP address rather than the proxy IP address, allowing the ability to block proxy users individually by their client's IP rather than the proxy server IP (avoiding the need to block the whole proxy due to the actions of a single user).&lt;ref name="pcworld"/&gt; However, none of the ISPs subscribing to this system pass XFF information to Wikipedia, having the impact of reversing the normal method of identification and blocking on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/155112/wikipedia_article_censored_in_uk_for_the_first_time.html |title=Wikipedia Article Censored in UK for the First Time |last=Kirk|first=Jeremy |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |accessdate=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IP addresses assumed to be assigned to an individual person or organisation were assigned instead to millions of people and thousands of registered editors.&lt;ref name="ORG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2008/12/08/iwf-censors-wikipedia-chaos-ensues/ |title=IWF censors Wikipedia, chaos ensues |last=Hogge|first=Becky |publisher=[[Open Rights Group]] |accessdate=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia servers saw them all as the IP of the proxy rather than each as the IP of their own machine.

Due to erroneous use of [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP) and other routing technology to redirect the connections to the filtering proxies, users of some networks were temporarily prevented from accessing or editing any content hosted by Wikimedia, a problem reminiscent of [[Blocking of YouTube#Pakistan|Pakistan's accidental blocking]] of YouTube for much of the world instead of only their own citizens.&lt;ref name=CNN-pak-block&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookchin.net/trip-research/youtube/pakistanBlocksYoutube.html |title=Pakistan move knocked out YouTube |work=CNN.com (Asia) |publisher=Natalie Bookchin (bookchin.net) |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=28 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014220714/http://bookchin.net/trip-research/youtube/pakistanBlocksYoutube.html |archivedate=14 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2008, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], a non-profit organisation which supports Wikipedia, issued a press release about the blacklisting of their sites by the IWF stating that they had "no reason to believe the article, or the image contained in the article, has been held to be illegal in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world", and noting that not just the image but the article itself had been blocked.&lt;ref name="wikimediapr"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Censorship_of_WP_in_the_UK_Dec_2008|title=Censorship of WP in the UK December 2008|publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]]|date=7 December 2008|last=|accessdate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

The incident was commented in some countries implementing or considering to implement Internet filtering or censorship plans. In Australia, [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]] vice-chairman Colin Jacobs said that "[the] incident in Britain, in which virtually the entire country was unable to edit Wikipedia because the country's Internet Watch Foundation had blacklisted a single image on the site, illustrated the pitfalls of mandatory ISP filtering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/home/technology/labor-plan-to-censor-internet-in-shreds/2008/12/09/1228584820006.html?page=2|title=Labor plan to censor internet in shreds|last=Moses|first=Asher|date=9 December 2008|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4788463a28.html| title = Aussie plan to censor Web in shreds|accessdate =10 December 2008|date=10 December 2008|last = Moses|first = Asher| publisher=stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' has commented that "Ironically, the banning of the image has only made it visible to more people as news sites publicise the issue and the image spreads across sites other than Wikipedia." an example of the [[Streisand effect]].&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

At the time of the incident [[Amazon.com|Amazon US]] were also displaying the image on their site and the IWF stated that it "might yet add Amazon US to its list of 'blocked' sites for hosting the picture";&lt;ref name="gamazon"/&gt; however, Amazon subsequently took the decision to remove the image from their site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/09/wikipedia-censorship-iwf-reconsiders|title=Internet Watch Foundation reconsiders Wikipedia censorship|last=Arthur|first=Charles|date=9 December 2008|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=10 December 2008 }}: "However Amazon US no longer risks being blocked under IWF's rulings. The image, as an album cover, had been on its site earlier this week, but has now been removed, apparently on the site's own initiative."&lt;/ref&gt; In an impact study preparing a bill dealing with [[cybercrime]], the [[Cabinet of France]] listed the ''Virgin Killer'' block as an example of indiscriminate filtering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Appendix to the LOPPSI bill |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/pdf/projets/pl1697.pdf |publisher=[[National Assembly (France)|Assemblée nationale]] |format=PDF |page= 12 |date=27 May 2009 |quote=''Le récent blocage, au mois de décembre 2008, en Angleterre du site Wikipédia par le filtre de l’Internet Watch Foundation du fait de la présence d’une photo de l’album « virgin killer » du groupe rock Scorpion a été commenté comme un exemple des limites d’un filtre qui ne discrimine pas.'' The recent blocking of Wikipedia in England in December 2008 by a filter from the Internet Watch Foundation, because of a photo from the album "virgin killer" by the rock band Scorpions, has been given as an example of the effect of an indiscriminate filter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] criticised the IWF's reasoning:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/12/internet-censors-must-be-accountable-things-they-b Internet Censors Must Be Accountable For The Things They Break,], Peter Eckersley, 9 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We agree with their decision [to reverse the ban], but they have the wrong reasoning [for the reversal]: they had no business censoring that article in the first place&amp;nbsp;— the community of Wikipedia editors is if anything the more legitimate, reliable and grown-up adjudicator of which images are appropriate subject matter for an encyclopaedia.}}

The IWF continues to assert that the image is indeed child porn, and asserts that the image would be blocked if it were on a British server.&lt;ref name="Doctorow"&gt;Doctorow, Cory. [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/16/cory-doctorow-wikipedia “How to make child-porn blocks safe for the internet”], ''The Guardian'' (16 December 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jayson Thomas Blair''' (born March 23, 1976) is a former American journalist who worked for ''[[The New York Times]]''. He resigned from the newspaper in May 2003 in the wake of the discovery of [[plagiarism]] and fabrication in his stories.

Blair published a memoir of this period, entitled ''Burning Down My Master's House'' (2004), recounting his career, a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]] after his resignation, and his view of race relations at the newspaper. He later established a support group for people with bipolar disorder.

==Background==
Blair was born in [[Columbia, Maryland]], the son of a federal executive and a schoolteacher. While attending the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], he was a student journalist. For 1996–1997, he was selected as the second African-American editor-in-chief of its student newspaper, ''[[The Diamondback]]''. According to a 2004 article by the ''Baltimore Sun'', some of his fellow students opposed his selection.&lt;ref name="making"/&gt;

After a summer interning at ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1998, Blair was offered an extended internship there. He declined in order to complete more coursework for graduation. But he returned to the ''Times'' in June 1999, with a year of coursework left to complete.&lt;ref name="deception"&gt;{{cite news |title=Times Reporter Who Resigned Leaves Long Trail of Deception |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 11, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/national/11PAPE.html?ex=1367985600&amp;en=d6f511319c259463&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND}}&lt;/ref&gt; That November, he was classified as an "intermediate reporter".&lt;ref name="deception"/&gt; He was later promoted to a full reporter and then to editor.

==Plagiarism and fabrication scandal==
On April 28, 2003, Blair received a call from ''Times'' national editor [[Jim Roberts (New York Times journalist)|James Roberts]] asking him about similarities between a story he had written two days earlier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E7DE153DF935A15757C0A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=AFTEREFFECTS: THE MISSING; Family Waits, Now Alone, for a Missing Soldier | first=Jayson | last=Blair | date=April 26, 2003 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one published April 18 by ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' reporter [[Macarena Hernandez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MySA.com: Iraq: After the War | url = http://www.mysanantonio.com/specials/battlefield/stories/MYSA982379.xml.d7d1e3.html | accessdate = February 24, 2008 | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083427/http://www.mysanantonio.com/specials/battlefield/stories/MYSA982379.xml.d7d1e3.html | archivedate = September 29, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The senior editor of the ''Express-News'' had contacted the ''Times'' about the similarities between Blair's article in the ''Times'' and Hernandez's article in his paper.&lt;ref name="making"/&gt;

The resulting inquiry led to the discovery of fabrication and plagiarism in a number of articles written by Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rosen |first= Jill |title= All about the retrospect: Jayson Blair charmed and dazzled the right people on his rapid rise from cocky college student to ''New York Times'' national reporter.

Suspect articles include the following:&lt;ref name="correcting"/&gt;
*In the October 30, 2002 piece "US Sniper Case Seen as a Barrier to a Confession", Blair wrote that a dispute between police authorities had ruined the interrogation of [[Beltway sniper attacks|Beltway sniper]] suspect [[John Muhammad]] and that Muhammad was about to confess, quoting unnamed officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E3DC133FF933A05753C1A9649C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Retracing A Trail: The Investigation; U.S. Sniper Case Seen As A Barrier To A Confession | first=Jayson | last=Blair | date=October 30, 2002 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was swiftly denied by everyone involved. Blair also named certain lawyers, who were not present, as having witnessed the interrogation.&lt;ref name="correcting"&gt;{{cite news|title=CORRECTING THE RECORD; Witnesses and Documents Unveil Deceptions In a Reporter's Work|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/us/correcting-record-witnesses-documents-unveil-deceptions-reporter-s-work.html|accessdate=17 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=May 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the February 10, 2003 piece "Peace and Answers Eluding Victims of the Sniper Attacks", Blair claimed to be in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E7DD113BF933A25751C0A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Peace and Answers Eluding Victims of the Sniper Attacks |first=Jayson | last=Blair | date=February 10, 2003 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He allegedly plagiarized quotations from a ''Washington Post'' story and fabricated quotations from a person he had never interviewed. Blair ascribed a wide range of attributes to a man featured in the article, almost all of which the man in question denied. Blair also published information that he had promised was to be [[Journalism sourcing#Using confidential information|off the record]].&lt;ref name="correcting"/&gt;
*In the March 3, 2003 piece "Making Sniper Suspect Talk Puts Detective in Spotlight", Blair claimed to be in [[Fairfax, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E3DD1F3CF930A35750C0A9659C8B63%20 | work=The New York Times |title=Making Sniper Suspect Talk Puts Detective in Spotlight | first=Jayson | last=Blair | date=March 3, 2003 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described a videotape of [[Lee Malvo]], the younger defendant in the case, being questioned by police and quoted officials' review of the tape. No such tape existed. Blair also claimed a detective noticed blood on a man's jeans leading to a confession, which had not occurred.&lt;ref name="correcting"/&gt;
*In the March 27, 2003 piece "Relatives of Missing Soldiers Dread Hearing Worse News", Blair claimed to be in [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3DE1E30F934A15750C0A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times| title=A NATION AT WAR: MILITARY FAMILIES; Relatives of Missing Soldiers Dread Hearing Worse News | first=Jayson | last=Blair | date=March 27, 2003 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He allegedly plagiarized quotations from an Associated Press article. He claimed to have spoken to the father of [[Jessica Lynch]], who had no recollection of meeting Blair; said "tobacco fields and cattle pastures" were visible from Lynch's parents' house when they were not; erroneously stated that Lynch's brother was in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]; misspelled Lynch's mother's name; and fabricated a dream that he claimed she had had.&lt;ref name="correcting"/&gt;
*In the April 3, 2003 piece "Rescue in Iraq and a 'Big Stir' in West Virginia", Blair claimed to have covered the Lynch story from her hometown of [[Palestine, Wirt County, West Virginia|Palestine, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E6D61F39F930A35757C0A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=A NATION AT WAR: THE HOMETOWN; Rescue in Iraq and a 'Big Stir' in West Virginia | first1=Douglas | last1=Jehl | first2=Jayson | last2=Blair | date=April 3, 2003 |accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair never traveled to Palestine, and his entire contribution to the story consisted of rearranged details from [[Associated Press]] stories.&lt;ref name="correcting"/&gt;
*In the April 7, 2003 piece "For One Pastor, the War Hits Home", Blair wrote of a church service in [[Cleveland]] and an interview with the minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DB1338F934A35757C0A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=A NATION AT WAR: THE FAMILIES; For One Pastor, the War Hits Home | first=Jayson | last=Blair | date=April 7, 2003 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair never went to Cleveland; he spoke to the minister by telephone, and copied portions of the article from an earlier ''[[Washington Post]]'' article. He also plagiarized quotations from ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' and ''[[New York Daily News]]''. He fabricated a detail about the minister keeping a picture of his son inside his Bible and got the name of the church wrong.&lt;ref name="correcting"/&gt;
*In the April 19, 2003 piece "In Military Wards, Questions and Fears from the Wounded", Blair described interviewing four injured soldiers in a naval hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407EFDD153AF93AA25757C0A9659C8B63 |work=The New York Times | title=A NATION AT WAR: VETERANS; In Military Wards, Questions and Fears From the Wounded | first=Jayson | last=Blair| date=April 19, 2003 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had never gone to the hospital and had spoken to only one soldier by telephone, to whom he later attributed made-up quotes. Blair wrote that the soldier "will most likely limp the rest of his life and need to use a cane", which was untrue. He said another soldier had lost his right leg when it had been amputated below the knee. He described two soldiers as being in the hospital at the same time, but they were admitted five days apart.&lt;ref name="correcting"/&gt;

After internal investigations, ''The New York Times'' reported on Blair's [[journalism ethics and standards|journalistic misdeeds]] in an "unprecedented"&lt;ref name="cq-cx"/&gt; 7,239-word front-page story on May 11, 2003, headlined "Times Reporter Who Resigned Leaves Long Trail of Deception."&lt;ref name="deception"/&gt; The story called the affair "a low point in the 152-year history of the newspaper."&lt;ref name="deception"/&gt; On the [[NPR]] radio show ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'', Blair explained that his fabrications started with what he thought was a relatively innocent infraction: using a quote from a press conference which he had missed. He described a gradual process whereby his ethical violations became worse, and contended that his main motivation was a fear of not living up to the expectations that he and others had for his career.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

After the scandal broke, some 30 former staffers of ''The Diamondback'', who had worked with Blair when he was editor-in-chief at the university newspaper, signed a 2003 letter alleging that Blair had made four serious errors as a reporter and editor while at the University of Maryland. They said these and his work habits brought his integrity into question. The letter-signers alleged that questions raised by some of these staffers at the time were ignored by Maryland Media, Inc. (MMI), the board that owned the paper.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Making of Jayson Blair |first=David |last=Folkenflik |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/bal-as.blair23,0,5336838.story |work=[[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]] |date=February 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diamondback"&gt;{{cite web |title=Former Blair co-workers claim warnings ignored |author=Jason Flanagan |work=[[The Diamondback]] |publisher=[[UWIRE]].com |url=http://www.uwire.com/content/topnews061303002.html  |accessdate = June 13, 2003 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060115191349/http://www.uwire.com/content/topnews061303002.html |archivedate = January 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The investigation, known as the Siegal committee, found heated debate among the staff over [[affirmative action]] hiring, as Blair is African American. Jonathan Landman, Blair's editor, told the Siegal committee he felt that Blair's being [[Black people|black]] played a large part in the younger man's initial promotion in 2001 to full-time staffer. "I think [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] was the decisive factor in his promotion," he said. "I thought then and I think now that it was the wrong decision."&lt;ref name="NewsHour-20080224"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jayson Blair: A Case Study of What Went Wrong at The New York Times |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/media/media_ethics/casestudy_blair.php |accessdate=February 24, 2008 |year=2008 |work=PBS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819012801/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/media/media_ethics/casestudy_blair.php |archivedate=August 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others disagreed. Five days later, ''New York Times'' op-ed columnist [[Bob Herbert]], an African American, asserted in his column that race had nothing to do with the Blair case: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Listen up: the race issue in this case is as bogus as some of Jayson Blair's reporting." Herbert said, "[F]olks who delight in attacking anything black, or anything designed to help blacks, have pounced on the Blair story as evidence that there is something inherently wrong with ''The New York Times''{{'}}s effort to diversify its newsroom, and beyond that, with the very idea of a commitment to diversity or affirmative action anywhere. And while these agitators won't admit it, the nasty subtext to their attack is that there is something inherently wrong with blacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0DF133EF93AA25756C0A9659C8B63|title=Truth, Lies and Subtext|first=Bob|last=Herbert|work=The New York Times|date=May 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two senior editors, Executive Editor [[Howell Raines]] and Managing Editor [[Gerald M. Boyd|Gerald Boyd]], resigned after losing newsroom support in the aftermath of the scandal.

After resigning from ''The New York Times'', Blair struggled with severe depression and, according to his memoir, entered a hospital for treatment. He was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] for the first time. He has acknowledged that he had been self-medicating when he was dealing with substance abuse of alcohol and cocaine in earlier years.&lt;ref name="poynter"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050618081724/http://poynter.org/forum/?id=letters Letter by Jayson Blair: "Blair: Outsourcing EAP is a mistake"], ''Poynter Online'', 15 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Blair later returned to college to complete his postponed degree. At one time he said he considered going into [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timescommunity.com/site/tab5.cfm?newsid=14666157&amp;BRD=2553&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=506096&amp;rfi=6 |title=Jayson Blair searches for new life, reflects ...|work=[[Times Community Newspapers|Fairfax County Times]] |author=Perrone, Matthew |date=June 9, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201111446/http://www.timescommunity.com/site/tab5.cfm?newsid=14666157&amp;BRD=2553&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=506096&amp;rfi=6 |archivedate=December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year after he left the ''Times'', Blair wrote a memoir, ''[[Burning Down My Master's House]]'', published by New Millennium Books in 2004. Its initial print run was 250,000 copies; some 1,400 were sold in its first nine days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/20/entertainment/et-quick20.4 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Ex-journalists' books not selling | date=March 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press reported that the potential audience for his book may have gained enough information from the ''New York Times'' coverage of the reporting scandal. Although most reviews were critical, sales of the book increased after Blair was interviewed by King and Fox News Channel host [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]].&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-03-18-blair-book_x.htm Associated Press, "Few buyers for books by disgraced journalists Jayson Blair and Stephen Glass"], ''USA Today'', 18 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book Blair revealed extended substance abuse, which he had ended before he resigned from the newspaper, and a struggle with [[bipolar disorder]], which was diagnosed and first treated after he resigned. He also discussed journalistic practices at the ''Times'', and his view of race relations and disagreements among senior editors at the newspaper.

In 2006 Blair was running a support group for people with [[bipolar disorder]], for which he has received continuing treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jayson-blair-the-man-who-fooled-america-6101932.html|title=Jayson Blair: The man who fooled America|last=Caesar|first=Ed|date=May 3, 2006|accessdate=July 2, 2017|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* ''Choke Point'', the play written by [[Colm Byrne]] and produced in 2007 in Los Angeles by Che'rae Adams, is based on Blair's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://archive.org/stream/chokePointByColmByrne-EngrossingIntelligent-3weeksMagazine/ThreeWeeks#page/n0/mode/2up | work=Three Weeks Magazine | title=Choke Point Theatre Review|author= Colm Byrne | date=September 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the television series ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'', the Blair story inspired an episode about a young journalist in the third season episode "Pravda" (3.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjerk.com/news/article.php?id_new=299|last=Faile|first=Chris|title="Law &amp; Order" Franchise to Give Jayson Blair/New York Times Saga One More|work=Filmjerk.com|date=September 22, 2003|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Season 5 of the HBO series ''[[The Wire]]'' dealt with the subject of journalist fabrication, as well as the decline of print journalism. It mentions Jayson Blair in the last episode.

* An episode of the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' based a joke on the Blair story in Episode 15.22: "Fraudcast News".

[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -31- - Kiss of Judas.jpg|thumb|''Kiss of Judas'' (1304–06), fresco by [[Giotto]], [[Scrovegni Chapel]], [[Padua]], Italy]]

The '''kiss of Judas''', also known (especially in art) as the '''Betrayal of Christ''', is how [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] identified [[Jesus]] to the multitude with swords and clubs who had come from the [[Kohen|chief priests]] and elders of the people to arrest him, according to the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. The [[kiss]] is given by Judas in the Garden of [[Gethsemane]] after the [[Last Supper]] and leads directly to the [[arrest of Jesus]] by the police force of the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin]].

Within the [[life of Jesus in the New Testament]], the events of his identification to hostile forces and subsequent execution are directly foreshadowed both when [[Jesus predicts his betrayal]] and [[Jesus predicts his death]].

More broadly, a ''Judas kiss'' may refer to "an act appearing to be an act of friendship, which is in fact harmful to the recipient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Judas+kiss|title=Judas kiss|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the New Testament ==
The gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (26:47–50) and [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] (14:43–45) both use the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] verb καταφιλέω (''kataphileó''), which means to "kiss, caress; distinct from φιλεῖν (''philein''); especially of an amorous kiss"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|katafile/w|καταφιλέω|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the same verb that [[Plutarch]] uses to describe a famous kiss that [[Alexander the Great]] gave [[Bagoas (courtier)|Bagoas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plutarch|author-link=Plutarch|title= Alexander|chapter=67.4|translator=Bernadotte Perrin|translator-link=Bernadotte Perrin|year=1919|quote=λέγεται δὲ μεθύοντα αὐτὸν θεωρεῖν ἀγῶνας χορῶν, τὸν δὲ ἐρώμενον Βαγώαν χορεύοντα νικῆσαι καὶ κεκοσμημένον διὰ τοῦ θεάτρου παρελθόντα καθίσαι παρ᾽ αὐτόν: ἰδόντας δὲ τοὺς Μακεδόνας κροτεῖν καὶ βοᾶν φιλῆσαι κελεύοντας, ἄχρι οὗ περιβαλὼν κατεφίλησεν|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound verb (κατα-) "has the force of an emphatic, ostentatious salute".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/26.htm Vincent's Word Studies] on Matthew 26, accessed 27 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheran]] theologian [[Johann Albrecht Bengel|Johann Bengel]] suggests that Judas kissed Him ''repeatedly'': "he kissed Him more than once in opposition to what he had said in the preceding verse: {{lang-gr|φιλήσω}}, ''philēsō'', a single kiss ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:48|NKJV}}), and did so as if from kindly feeling".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/26.htm Bengel's Gnomon] on Matthew 26, accessed 27 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matthew 26:50, Jesus responded by saying: "Friend, do what you are here to do". Elaine Pagels and Karen King have speculated that Jesus and Judas were actually in agreement with each other and that there was no real betrayal.&lt;ref name=PagelsKing&gt;Pagels, Elaine and King, Karen L., ''Reading Judas, The Gospel of Judas and the Shaping of Christianity'', Penguin Books, New York, 2007, pages 3–4, {{ISBN|978-0-14-311316-4}}: "The Gospel of John suggests that Jesus himself was complicit in the betrayal, that moments before Judas went out, Jesus had told him, 'Do quickly what you are going to do' (John 13:27)".&lt;/ref&gt; Luke 22:48 quotes Jesus saying "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Humanity with a kiss?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/road-peace/holy-thursday-betrayal-and-friendship Dear, John. "On Holy Thursday, betrayal and friendship", ''National Catholic Reporter'', March 27, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus' arrest follows immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:50|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In liturgics ==
In the [[Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom]] the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] uses the [[troparion]] ''Of thy Mystical Supper..'', in which the hymnist vows to Jesus that he will "...not kiss Thee as did Judas..." («...οὐ φίλημά σοι δώσω,καθάπερ ὁ Ἰούδας...»):
{{Text and translation|Τοῦ Δείπνου σου τοῦ μυστικοῦ, σήμερον, Υἱὲ Θεοῦ, κοινωνόν με παράλαβε· οὐ μὴ γὰρ τοῖς ἐχθροῖς σου τὸ Μυστήριον εἴπω· οὐ φίλημά σοι δώσω, καθάπερ ὁ Ἰούδας· ἀλλ’ ὡς ὁ Λῃστὴς ὁμολογῶ σοι· Μνήσθητί μου, Κύριε, ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ σου.|Of Thy Mystic Supper receive me today, O Son of God, as a partaker; for I will not speak of the mystery to Thine enemies; I will not kiss Thee as did Judas; but as the thief, I will confess Thee: Lord, remember me in Thy kingdom.&lt;ref name=revelias&gt;{{cite book|author=Rev. Nicholas M. Elias|title=The Divine Liturgy Explained|orig-year=1966|publisher=Papadimitriou Publishing Co.|place=Athens|edition=4|publication-date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194–195}}}}

== In art ==
The scene is nearly always included, either as the Kiss itself, or the moment after, in the [[Arrest of Jesus]], or the two combined (as above), in the cycles of the [[Life of Christ]] or [[Passion of Jesus]] in various media.
* Probably the best known is from [[Giotto]]'s cycle in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]].
* There is also a version called ''[[The Taking of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Taking of Christ]]'' by [[Caravaggio]] or one of his disciples.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the kiss of Judas with respect to Caravaggio's ''The Taking of Christ'' (now in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]], Dublin), together with a summary of traditional ecclesiastical interpretation of that gesture, see Franco Mormando, "Just as your lips approach the lips of your brothers: Judas Iscariot and the Kiss of Betrayal" in ''Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' ed. F. Mormando, Chestnut Hill, MA: The McMullen Museum of Art of Boston College, 1999, 179–90.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A  sixth-century Byzantine Mosaic in [[Ravenna]].
* A [[fresco]] by [[Barna da Siena]].
* A sculpture representing the Kiss of Judas appears on the Passion façade of the [[Sagrada Família]] basilica in [[Barcelona]].

{{See also|Air engagements of the Gulf War}}
*
USAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-29

USAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Mirage F1s
Later on the same night, an F-15C scored a double-kill against two Mirages with AIM-7 Sparrow missile. His wingman scored another kill on a third Mirage F1, for a total of three kills in the dogfight.

USN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-25s
On the first night of the war, two F/A-18s from the carrier USS Saratoga were flying outside of Baghdad when two Iraqi MiG-25PDs interceptors from the 96th Squadron engaged them. In the beyond-visual-range (BVR), one of the Iraqi MiGs, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Zuhair Dawood, fired an R-40 missile, shooting down one of the F/A-18's as it was travelling Mach 0.92. The pilot, Lieutenant Commander [[Scott Speicher]], was killed. It is widely believed he died upon the impact of the missile.

USN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-21s
Two F/A-18s from VFA-81 shot down two Iraqi MiG-21s, one with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, in a brief dogfight with their bombs still latched on.

USAF F-15Es vs IRAF MiG-29s
On the opening night of the war two Iraqi MiG-29s attempted to engage a flight of USAF F-15Es. One of the MiGs crashed while flying at low altitude but the other MiG pressed on. One of the F-15Es fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder when the MiG locked him up but missed. Several other F-15Es simultaneously tried to engage the lone MiG-29 but were unable to get the kill. One F-15E was actually flying past the Iraqi jet and maneuvered in for the kill but the pilot hesitated to take the shot because he was unsure of his wingmen's location and because he did not get a good tone with the Sidewinder missile.

USAF EF-111 vs. IRAF Mirage F-1
On the first night of the war a USAF EF-111A Raven "Spark Vark", flown by pilot Captain James Denton and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) Captain Brent Brandon, was on an electronic warfare mission ahead of a group of jets on a bombing run. Several IRAF Dassault Mirage F1s came in and engaged the flight. One of them went after the unarmed EF-111. Denton executed a tight turn while Brandon launched chaff to avoid missiles fired by the Mirage. An F-15C on the same flight, piloted by Robert Graeter, went after the Mirage to protect the EF-111. The Mirage launched a missile, spotted by Brandon, which the Raven avoided by turning and launching chaff. Denton decided to head for the deck to try to evade his pursuer. As he went down he pulled up to avoid the ground, the Mirage followed him through, but did not pull up in time and crashed. An unarmed EF-111 had thus scored an air-air victory against a Dassault Mirage F1, although Graeter was credited with a kill. The EF-111A crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

USAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s
Two IRAF MiG-25s fired missiles at a group of F-15Cs escorting a bombing run in Iraq (which were evaded by the F-15s). The F-15Cs gave chase, but were forced to give up when the MiGs outran them. A total of 10 missiles were fired at the MiGs.

USAF F-111s vs. IRAF MiG-23
An Iraqi MiG-23 fired a R-24T missile at a F-111 on a bombing run and scored a hit, although the bomber made it safely back to base. Another similar incident occurred with the same Iraqi interceptor several minutes later, this F-111 also made it back to base despite the severe damage to the aircraft. This is Iraq's only success of the Persian Gulf War using MiG-23s.

IRAF MiG-29 vs USAF F-111 and B-52G
An Iraqi MiG-29 struck an F-111 aircraft with an R60 missile, though the sturdy F-111 stayed airworthy. Several minutes later the same pilot fired a R27 missile at a B-52G on a bombing run, severely damaging it.[4]

19 January 1991
USAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s
In a brief dogfight, two F-15Cs engaged and shot down two Iraqi MiG-25s attempting to engage them, both using AIM-7 missiles. One was destroyed by Captain Rick Tuleni and the second by Captain Larry Pitts.

USAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-29s
Two F-15Cs, piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez gave chase to a pair of MiG-29s detected by AWACS. The Iraqi aircraft, one piloted by Captain Jameel Sayhood, promptly turned and engaged the two American fighters, and one of the most dramatic dogfights of the Persian Gulf War ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify the other. Underhill was facing Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself was facing Rodriguez. Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood's wingman, scoring a head-on hit and killing the opposing pilot instantly. Simultaneously, Sayhood gained a lock on Rodriguez, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove to low altitude in order to clutter Sayhood's radar and break the lock-on, and dropped flares to counter his adversary's infra-red search-and-track. However, after seeing his wingman shot down, Sayhood disengaged and fled to the north. Considering the engagement over, Rodriguez and Underhill turned south to rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker in order to refuel, but Sayhood reversed course and set off after them, prompting them to reengage. With the now lone MiG-29 closing head-on with the pair of F-15s, Underhill gained radar lock-on, but did not fire due to a glitch in his IFF interrogator system keeping him from being certain he wasn't about to shoot down a Coalition aircraft. Underhill initially thought he shot down an allied aircraft. Sayhood sliced into the American formation, causing a classic merge. Underhill kept Sayhood locked-on and climbed, while Rodriguez committed to the merge in order to visually identify the opposing aircraft as hostile. As they passed head-on, Rodriguez identified it as an Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on his MiG's better turning radius to get into a firing position on Rodriguez' tail but Rodriguez was very close to firing position on him. Both aircraft lost altitude through the sustained hard turning, bringing them perilously close to the ground. Fearing that Rodriguez would obtain infra-red lock-on and shoot him down with an AIM-9, Sayhood attempted to disengage using a split-s. Rodriguez didn't match Sayhood's manoeuver, and observed him eject just prior to his MiG impacting the ground – he'd commenced his escape maneuver too low. It was reported years later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg and evacuated to a local hospital.

RAF Tornado GR.1 vs. IRAF MiG-29
It has been claimed by some sources that an RAF Tornado (ZA467) crewed by Squadron Leader Gary Lennox and Squadron Leader Adrian Weeks was shot down on 19 January by an R-60MK (NATO reporting name: AA-8 Aphid) missile fired from an Iraqi MiG-29 piloted by Jameel Sayhood, however this aircraft is officially recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah.

USAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Mirage F1s
Two F-15Cs destroyed two Mirage F1s with AIM-7 missiles.

24 January 1991
RSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mirage F1s
The Iraqi Air Force attempted to mount a rare offensive bombing operation and loaded two F1s with incendiary bombs. The Royal Saudi Air Force sent up two F-15Cs to intercept the bombers. One of the F-15s piloted by Captain Ayedh Al-Shamrani maneuvered behind the F1s and shot them both down with AIM-9 missiles.

26 January 1991
USAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s
In what is considered a textbook "beyond visual range" or BVR kill, four MiG-23s took off from an Iraqi airbase. One of them turned back with mechanical problems, however the other three pressed on. Four F-15Cs were flying when AWACS reported the MiGs. The four F-15s lined up, were assigned targets and fired AIM-7 missiles at all of them, destroying all three MiGs within seconds of each other. Only three of the F-15C pilots were granted kills, as the fourth missile didn't reach the MiG until after it had already been brought down.

27 January 1991
USAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s and Mirage F1
Two F-15Cs managed to get kills on three MiG-23s and one Mirage F1, after they caught them trying to flee to Iran. They were brought down with AIM-9 and AIM-7 missiles after a brief dogfight.

Notable '''[[book burning]]s''' have taken place throughout history.
&lt;!--keep this list in chronological order, please--&gt;

==Antiquity==
===Destruction of Ebla===

Destruction of [[Ebla]] 2240 BC, then in 1600 BC.

===Destruction of Mari===

Destruction of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in 1765 BC.

===Destruction of Alalakh===

Destruction of [[Alalakh]] circa 1200 BC.

===Destruction of Ugarit===

Destruction of [[Ugarit]] 1180 BC.

===Library of Ashurbanipal (by Babylonians, Scythians and Medes)===

In 612 BC the Assyrian capital [[Nineveh]] was destroyed by a coalition of [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Scythians]] and [[Medes]]. During the burning of the Royal Palace, a great fire ravaged the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] where the scholar King [[Ashurbanipal]] had amassed a great number of texts and tablets from various countries. Modern historians believe the library may have contained a considerable number of texts written on such mediums as leather scrolls, wax boards, and possibly [[papyrus|papyri]] – all of them vulnerable to fire. However, the considerable number of clay cuneiform tablets became partially baked.&lt;ref name="Polastron, Lucien X. 2007, page 3"&gt;Polastron, Lucien X.: "Books on Fire: The Tumultuous Story Of The World's Great Libraries" 2007, page 3, Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, London&lt;/ref&gt; This destructive event helped preserve the tablets, which lay in the earth and were eventually found by 19th century archaeologists.

===A scroll written by the Hebrew prophet Jeremiah (burnt by King Jehoiakim)===
About 600 BC, Jeremiah of Anathoth wrote that the King of Babylon would destroy the land of Judah. As recounted in Jeremiah 36, Jeremiah's scroll was read before Jehoiakim, King of Judah, in the presence of important officials; King Jehoiakim destroyed the scroll in a fire, and then sought to have Jeremiah arrested.

===Protagoras's "On the Gods" (by Athenian authorities)===
The Classical Greek philosopher [[Protagoras]] (c. 490 – c. 420 BC) was a proponent of agnosticism, writing in a now lost work entitled ''On the Gods'': ''"Concerning the gods, I have no means of knowing whether they exist or not or of what sort they may be, because of the obscurity of the subject, and the brevity of human life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/protagor.htm |title=Protagoras &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |website=Iep.utm.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], the above outspoken Agnostic position taken by Protagoras aroused anger, causing the Athenians to expel him from their city, where the authorities ordered all copies of the book to be collected and burned in the marketplace. The same story is also mentioned by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, de Natura Deorum, 1.23.6&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Classicist [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] doubts this account, as both Diogenes Laertius and Cicero wrote hundreds of years later and no such persecution of Protagoras is mentioned by contemporaries who make extensive references to this philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;John Burnet, "Greek Philosophy: From Thales to Plato", 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Burnet notes that even if some copies of Protagoras' book were burned, enough of them survived to be known and discussed in the following century.

===Democritus' writings (by Plato)===

The philosopher [[Plato]] is said to have greatly disliked fellow-philosopher [[Democritus]] and wanted all of Democritus' books burned. [[Aristoxenus]] in his ''Historical Notes'' affirms that "Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus that he could collect"&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristoxenus]]' book is lost, but the Plato reference survives in a quote in  [[Diogenes Laërtius]]' ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', ix. 40&lt;/ref&gt;. In his own lifetime, Plato was not in a position to destroy all copies of his rival's writings, but Plato's purpose was largely achieved through the choices made by scribes in later Classical times. Plato's own writings were frequently copied, and unlike nearly all of his [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophical contemporaries]], Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John M.; Hutchinson, D. S., eds. (1997): "Introduction".&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, none of Democritus' writings have survived, and only fragments are known from his vast body of work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/ Democritus at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these fragments are enough to let many consider Democritus to be "The Father of Modern Science".&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Gossin, ''Encyclopedia of Literature and Science'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrian scriptures and Persian Royal Archives (by Alexander the Great)===
The burning of [[Persepolis]], the ceremonial capital of the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]], about 330 BC, was one of the stains on the record of
[[Alexander the Great]], contrasting with the efforts he otherwise made to act humanely towards the defeated Persians. Various accounts
attribute it to an accident, a drunken revelry by Alexander's soldiers, or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] by the Achaemenid army centuries before. There was evidently no deliberate targeting of books and written material, but – though not mentioned in Greek and Latin accounts – such destruction did result from the setting on fire of palaces made mostly of highly combustible [[cedar wood]]. The ''[[Book of Arda Wiraz]]'', a [[Zoroastrian]] work composed in the 3rd or 4th century CE, mentions the destruction of Royal Archives and of "all the [[Avesta]] (Zoroastrian scriptures) and [[Zend]] (commentraries)" which were "written with gold ink upon prepared cow-skins". The ''[[Bundahishn]]'' – an [[encyclopædia]]ic collection of [[Zoroastrian cosmogony]] and [[Zoroastrian cosmology|cosmology]] – also refers to "Aleskandar" (Alexander) having burned the Avesta following his defeat of "Dara" ([[Darius III]]). For this act of sacrilege, Alexander's name was regularly accompanied in [[Middle Persian]] Zoroastrian texts by the appelation ''Gujastak'' ("the Damned", or "the Evil"). As late as the 10th century CE, the native Iranian writer [[Biruni]], in his ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Nations]]'', mentioned regretfully the loss of historiographical sources due to that burning.

The fall of Persepolis paradoxically contributed to the preservation of the [[Persepolis Administrative Archives|Achaemenid administrative archives]] that might have been lost due to passage of time and natural and man-made causes.&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer 10-11"&gt;Wiesehöfer 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; According to archaeological evidence, the partial burning of Persepolis did not affect the Persepolis Fortification Archive tablets, but may have caused the eventual collapse of the upper part of the northern Fortification wall that preserved the tablets until their recovery by the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]]'s archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Henkelman 2008:Ch 2"&gt;Henkelman 2008:Ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese philosophy books (by Emperor Qin Shi Huang and anti-Qin rebels)===
{{Main|Burning of books and burying of scholars}}

During the [[Warring States Period]], China was divided into various states - each of which had its own historians, writing over centuries their version of the history of their state and its relations with neighbors and rivals. Following [[Qin (state)|Qin]]'s conquest of all the others, Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] - on the advice of his minister [[Li Si]]  - ordered the burning of all philosophy books and history books from states other than Qin  – beginning in 213 BC. This was followed by the live burial of a large number of intellectuals who did not comply with the state dogma.

Li Si is reported to have said: "I, your servant, propose that all historian's records other than those of [[Qin dynasty|Qin's]] be burned. With the exception of the academics whose duty includes possessing books, if anyone [[all under heaven|under heaven]] has copies of the [[Shi Jing]], the [[Classic of History]], or the writings of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought|hundred schools of philosophy]], they shall deliver them [the books] to the governor or the commandant for burning. Anyone who dares to discuss the Shi Jing or the Classic of History shall be publicly executed. Anyone who uses history to criticize the present shall have his family executed. Any official who sees the violations but fails to report them is equally guilty. Anyone who has failed to burn the books after thirty days of this announcement shall be subjected to tattooing and be sent to build the [[Great Wall]]. The books that have exemption are those on medicine, [[divination]], agriculture and [[forestry]]. Those who have interest in laws shall instead study from officials."&lt;ref&gt;In Chinese: "相李斯曰：「臣請史官非秦記皆燒之。非博士官所職，天下敢有D詩、書、百家語者，悉詣守、尉雜燒之。有敢偶語詩書者棄市。以古非今者族。吏見知不舉者與同罪。令下三十日不燒，黥為城旦。所不去者，醫藥卜筮種樹之書。若欲有学法令，以吏为师」", from [[Shiji]] Chapter 6. "The Basic Annals of the First Emperor of Qin," thirty-fourth year (213 BC).&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to Chinese culture was compounded during the revolts which ended the short rule of [[Qin Er Shi]], Qin Shi Huang's son. The imperial palace and state archives were burned, destroying many of the remaining written records that had been spared by the father.

Several other large book burnings also occurred in Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;Jing Liao, [http://www.uri.edu/personal/yanma/597cl/userservicesjingliao.pdf A historical perspective : the root cause for the underdevelopment of user services in Chinese academic libraries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607050458/http://www.uri.edu/personal/yanma/597cl/userservicesjingliao.pdf |date=June 7, 2011 }}, [[The Journal of Academic Librarianship]], vol.30, num. 2, pages 109–115, march 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears they occurred in every dynasty following the Qin, but it is unknown how often.&lt;ref&gt;Chieh-Kang and Goodrich 1938, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books of Pretended Prophecies (by Roman authorities)===
In 186 BC, in an effort to suppress the [[Bacchanalia]] practices that had been led in part by [[Minius Cerrinius]], a Consul of Rome claimed that the fathers and grandfathers of the Romans had suppressed foreign rites and ceremonies, "seeking out and burning all books of pretended prophecies"&lt;ref&gt;Livy: History of Rome; 39.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish holy books (by the Seleucid monarch Antiochus IV)===
In 168 BC the [[Seleucid]] monarch [[Antiochus IV]] ordered Jewish 'Books of the Law' found in [[Jerusalem]] to be 'rent in pieces' and burned&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Maccabees]] 1:56&lt;/ref&gt; – part of the series of persecutions which precipitated the revolt of the [[Maccabees]].

===Aeneid (unsuccessfully ordered by Virgil)===
In 17 BC, [[Virgil]] died and in his will ordered that his masterpiece, the [[Aeneid]], be burned, as it was a draft and not a final version. However, his friends disobeyed him and released the epic poem after editing it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/suet-vergil.html |title=Suetonius: The Life of Vergil |website=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman history book (by the aediles)===
In 25 AD Senator [[Aulus Cremutius Cordus]] was forced to commit suicide and his ''History'' was burned by the [[aedile]]s, under the order of the [[Roman Senate|senate]]. The book's praise of [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]], who had assassinated [[Julius Caesar]], was considered an offence under the ''[[law of majestas|lex majestatis]]''. A copy of the book was saved by Cordus' daughter Marcia, and it was published again under [[Caligula]]. However, only a few fragments survived to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Bellemore, Jane. "The Dating of Seneca's Ad Marciam De Consolatione". The Classical Quarterly 42, no.1 (1992): 219–234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Frederick H. "Bookburning and Censorship in Ancient Rome". Journal of the History of Ideas 6, no.2 (April 1945): 157–196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]]. The Annals of Imperial Rome, translated by Michael Grant, p. 34. London: Harmondsworth, 1964; cited in Cramer, Frederick H. "Bookburning and Censorship in Ancient Rome". Journal of the History of Ideas 6, no.2 (April 1945): 157–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek and Latin prophetic verse (by the Emperor Augustus)===
Suetonius tells us that, at the death of Marcus Lepidus (about 13 BC), Augustus assumed the office of Chief Priest, and burned over two thousand copies of Greek and Latin prophetic verse then current, the work of anonymous or unrespected authors (preserving the Sibylline Books).&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius:Twelve Caesars; Augustus. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torah scroll (by Roman soldier)===
[[Flavius Josephus]]&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." xx. 5, § 4; "B. J." ii. 12, § 2.&lt;/ref&gt; relates that about the year 50 a Roman soldier seized a Torah scroll and, with abusive and mocking language, burned it in public. This incident almost brought on a general Jewish revolt against Roman rule, such as broke out two decades later. However, the Roman [[Procurator (Roman)|Procurator]] [[Cumanus]] appeased the Jewish populace by beheading the culprit.

===Sorcery scrolls (by early converts to Christianity at Ephesus)===
{{main|Book burning at Ephesus}}
About the year 55 according to the [[New Testament]] book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], early converts to Christianity in [[Ephesus]] who had previously practiced sorcery burned their scrolls: "A number who had practised sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand [[drachma]]s." (Acts 19:19, [[New International Version|NIV]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/curiousarts.html |title=Curious arts (WebBible Encyclopedia) – |publisher=Christiananswers.net |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbi Haninah ben Teradion burned with a Torah scroll (under Hadrian)===
Under the Emperor [[Hadrian]], the teaching of the [[Jewish Scriptures]] was forbidden, as, in the wake of the [[Bar Kochva]] Rebellion, the Roman authorities regarded such teaching as seditious and tending towards revolt. [[Haninah ben Teradion]], one of the Jewish [[Ten Martyrs]] executed for having defied that ban, is reported to have been [[burned at the stake]] together with the forbidden [[Torah]] scroll which he had been teaching. According to Jewish tradition, when the flame started to burn himself and the scroll he still managed to say to his pupils: "I see the scrolls burning but the letters fly up in the air" – a saying considered to symbolize the superiority of ideas to brute force. While in the original applying to sacred writings only, 20th Century Israeli writers also quoted this saying in the context of secular ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avodah Zarah]] 17b et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=221&amp;letter=H&amp;search=Hanina%20ben%20Teradion |title=Hananiah (Ḥanina) B. Teradion |website=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burning of the Torah by Apostomus (precise time and circumstances debated)===
Among five catastrophes said to have overtaken the Jews on the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]], the ''[[Mishnah]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ta'anit]] iv. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; includes "the burning of the [[Torah]] by [[Apostomus]]". Since no further details are given and there are no other references to Apostomus in Jewish or non-Jewish sources, the exact time and circumstances of this traumatic event are debated, historians assigning to it different dates in Jewish history under Seleucid or Roman rule, and it might be identical with one of the events noted above (see [[Apostomus]] page).

===Epicurus's book (in Paphlagonia)===
The book ''Established beliefs'' of [[Epicurus]] was burned in a [[Paphlagonia]]n marketplace by order of the charlatan [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]], supposed prophet of [[Glycon]], the son of [[Asclepius]] ca 160&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm |title=Lucian of Samosata : Alexander the False Prophet |website=Tertullian.org |date=August 31, 2001 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--keep this list in chronological order, please. Added the appropriate name of Alexander's deity he was the prophet of, this is from Lucian's text Alexander the False Prophet. --&gt;

===Manichaean and Christian scriptures (by Diocletian)===
The [[Diocletianic Persecution]] started on March 31, 302, with the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]], in a rescript from Alexandria, ordering that the leading [[Manichaean]]s be burnt alive along with their scriptures.&lt;ref name="GHH"&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 20; Clarke, 648, citing ''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' 660 and ''Mosiacarum et Romanarum Legum Collatio'' 25.36–8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time a Roman Imperial persecution ever called for the destruction of sacred literature.&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Gwatkin, "Notes on Some Chronological Questions Connected with the Persecution of Diocletian," ''English Historical Review'' 13:51 (1898): 499.&lt;/ref&gt;
On the following year, on February 23, 303, Diocletian ordered that the newly built Christian church at [[Nicomedia]] be razed, its scriptures burned, and its treasures seized.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22; Clarke, 650; Odahl, 67–69; Potter, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; Later persecutions included the burning of both the Christians themselves and of their books. As related in later Christian [[Hagiography]], at that time the governor of [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] offered the [[deacon]] who would become known as [[Saint Vincent of Saragossa]] to have his life spared in exchange for his consigning [[Scripture]] to the fire. Vincent refused and let himself be executed instead. In religious paintings he is often depicted holding the book whose preservation he preferred to his own life (see illustration in [[Saint Vincent of Saragossa]] page.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Prudentius]], ''Peristephanon'' ("Crowns of Martyrdom")&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, many other Christians, less courageous, did save their lives by giving away their Scriptures to be burned. These came to be known as [[Traditores]] (literally, "those who give away") from which the modern word "traitor" is derived.

===Books of Arianism (after Council of Nicaea)===
[[File:Constantine burning Arian books.jpg|thumb|Burning of Arian books at Nicaea (illustration from a compendium of canon law, ca. 825, MS. in the Capitular Library, Vercelli)]]

The books of [[Arianism|Arius]] and his followers, after the [[first Council of Nicaea]] (325 C.E.), were burned for [[heresy]] by the Roman emperors Constantine, Honorius, and [[Theodosius I]], who published a decree commanding that, "the doctrine of the Trinity should be embraced by those who would be called catholics; that all others should bear the infamous name of heretics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Priestley, Joseph|Joseph Priestley]]. [https://archive.org/stream/historyofcorrupt02prieiala#page/172/mode/2up An history of the corruptions of Christianity] (1782) pg. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosius I]] at [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14577d.htm New Advent Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library of Antioch (by Jovian)===
In 364, the Roman Catholic [[Jovian (Emperor)|Emperor Jovian]] ordered the entire [[Library of Antioch]] to be burnt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael von Albrecht]], and Gareth L.

==="Unacceptable writings" (by Athanasius)===
[[Elaine Pagels]] is the first to claim that in 367, [[Athanasius]] ordered monks in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in his role as bishop of [[Alexandria]] to destroy all "unacceptable writings" in [[Egypt]], the list of writings to be saved constituting the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Athanasius of Alexandria]]: Paschal letter (letter 39), 367 AD&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no evidence that Athanasius decreed all unacceptable writings to be burned, this unsubstantiated claim by Pagels is frequently cited as fact on the internet.

===The Sibylline books (various times)===
The [[Sibylline Books]] were a collection of oracular sayings. According to myth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]]: ''Institutiones divinae'' (I: 6) quoting a lost work by [[Varro]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cumae]]an [[sibyl]] offered [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] the books for a high price, and when he refused, burned three. When he refused to buy the remaining six at the same price, she again burned three, finally forcing him to buy the last three at the original price. The [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]] watched over the surviving books in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]], but could not prevent their being burned when the temple burned down in 83 BC. They were replaced by a similar collection of oracular sayings from around the Mediterranean in 76 BC, along with the sayings of the [[Tiburtine sibyl]], and then checked by priests for perceived accuracy as compared to the burned originals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annales'', VI, 12&lt;/ref&gt; These remained until for political reasons they were burned by Flavius [[Stilicho]] (died 408).&lt;ref&gt;[[Rutilius Claudius Namatianus]], ''De reditu suo''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings of Priscillian===
In 385, the theologian [[Priscillian]] of [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]] became the first Christian to be executed by fellow-Christians as a [[Heresy|heretic]]. Some (though not all) of his writings were condemned as heretical and burned. For many centuries they were considered irreversibly lost, but surviving copies were discovered in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Mckenna |url=http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/pagan3.htm |title=The Library of Iberian Resources On-line: Paganism and Pagan Survivals in Spain up to the Fall of the Visigothic Kingdom by Stephen McKenna |publisher=Libro.uca.edu |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
===Patriarch Eutychius' book (by Emperor Tiberius II Constantine)===

[[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople]] published a treatise, on the [[Resurrection of the dead|General Resurrection]], maintaining that the resurrected body "will be more subtle than air, and no longer palpable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines: Being a Continuation of 'The Dictionary of the Bible': VolumeII Eaba – Hermocrates|first=William|last=Smith|author2=Henry Wace|year=1880|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|page=415}} The dictionary account is apparently based on [[Bede]], Book II, Chapter 1, who used the expression "...impalpable, of finer texture than wind and air."&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Gregory the Great]] opposed the palpability of the risen Christ in {{bibleverse||Luke|24:39|KJV}}. As the dispute could not be settled, the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Tiberius II Constantine]], undertook to arbitrate. He decided in favor of palpability and ordered Eutychius' book to be burned. Eutychius died soon afterwards, on 5 April 582.

===Japanese books and manuscripts (during power struggle at the Imperial court)===

During the "[[Isshi Incident]]" of 645, a transformative event in early Japanese Imperial history, the influential [[Soga no Iruka]] was assassinated and enemies of the Soga Clan seized power. Shortly afterwards, Iruka's father [[Soga no Emishi]] killed himself by setting fire to his residence. The conflagration destroyed the manuscript copy of the ''[[Tennōki]]'', an important historical text which was forever lost, as well as many other Imperial treasures which had been taken for safe-keeping by the Soga,.&lt;ref name="pf50"&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fune no Fubitoesaka]] quickly grabbed out of the flames another unique historical text known as ''[[Kokki]]'' and is said to have afterwards presented it to [[Emperor Tenji]] – though it was at some later time lost in unknown circumstances, and no known extant copies of it remain.&lt;ref&gt;Sakamoto, Tarō ''et al.''

===Repeated destruction of Alexandria libraries===
{{Main|Library of Alexandria#Destruction of the Library}}
The library of the [[Serapeum]] in Alexandria was trashed, burned and looted, 392, at the decree of [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]], who was ordered so by [[Theodosius I]]. Around the same time, [[Hypatia]] was murdered. One of the largest destructions of books occurred at the [[Library of Alexandria]], traditionally held to be in 640; however, the precise years are unknown as are whether the fires were intentional or accidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01303a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: The Alexandrian Library |website=Newadvent.org |date=March 1, 1907 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Venerable Bede |url=http://www.bede.org.uk/library.htm#omar |title=The Mysterious Fate of the Great Library of Alexandria |website=Bede.org.uk |date=May 28, 2013 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconoclast writings (by Byzantine authorities)===
Following the "[[Triumph of Orthodoxy]]" in 843, when the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Byzantine Iconoclasts]] were decisively defeated and the worship of Icons formally restored, the Byzantine secular and religious authorities destroyed almost all Iconoclast writings – making it difficult for modern researchers to determine what exactly were the Iconoclasts' reasons to oppose the use of Icons in Christian worship.

===Qur'anic texts with varying wording (ordered by the 3rd Caliph, Uthman)===
{{Main|Origin and development of the Qur'an#First standardization of Qur'an}}
[[Uthman|Uthman ibn 'Affan]], the third [[Caliph]] of Islam after [[Muhammad]], who is credited with overseeing the collection of the verses of the [[Qur'an]], ordered the destruction of any other remaining text containing verses of the Quran after the Quran has been fully collected, circa 650. This was done to ensure that the collected and authenticated Quranic copy that Uthman collected became the primary source for others to follow, thereby ensuring that Uthman's version of the Quran remained authentic. Although the Qur'an had mainly been propagated through oral transmission, it also had already been recorded in at least three [[Codex|codices]], most importantly the codex of Abdullah ibn Mas'ud in [[Kufa]], and the codex of Ubayy ibn Ka'b in [[Syria]]. Sometime between 650 and 656, a committee appointed by Uthman is believed to have produced a singular version in seven copies, and Uthman is said to have "sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered any other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/061.sbt.html#006.061.510 |title=Volume 6, Book 61, Number 510 |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=2014-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823104808/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/061.sbt.html#006.061.510 |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competing prayer books (at Toledo)===
After the conquest of [[Toledo, Spain]] (1085) by the king of Castile, whether [[History of Christianity in Spain|Iberian Christians]] should follow the foreign [[Roman rite]] or the traditional [[Mozarabic rite]] became a subject of dispute. After other [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]]s, the dispute was submitted to the [[trial by ordeal|trial by fire]]: One book for each rite was thrown into a fire. The Toledan book was little damaged after the Roman one was consumed. [[Henry Jenner]] comments in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]: "No one who has seen a [[Mozarabic manuscript]] with its extraordinarily solid [[vellum]], will adopt any hypothesis of Divine Interposition here."&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10611a.htm Mozarabic Rite], by [[Henry Jenner]] in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abelard forced to burn his own book (at Soissons)===
The provincial [[synod]] held at [[Soissons]] (in France) in 1121 condemned the teachings of the famous theologian [[Peter Abelard]] as [[heresy]]; he was forced to burn his own book before being shut up inside the [[convent]] of St. Medard at Soissons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070814055518/http://robertfripp.ca/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ArticleDisplay&amp;ArticleID=483&amp;SectionID=152 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The writings of Arnold of Brescia (at France and Rome)===
The rebellious monk [[Arnold of Brescia]] – Abelard's pupil and colleague – refused to abjure his views after they were condemned at the [[Synod of Sens]] in 1141, and went on to lead the [[Commune of Rome]] in direct opposition to the Pope, until being executed in 1155.
The Church ordered the burning of all his writings, which was carried out so thoroughly than none of them survives and it is unknown even what they were – except for what can be inferred from polemics against him.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold's life depends for its sources on [[Otto of Freising]] and a chapter in [[John of Salisbury]]'s ''Historia Pontificalis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, though no written word of Arnold's has survived, his teachings on [[apostolic poverty]] continued potent after his death, among "Arnoldists" and more widely among [[Waldensians]] and the [[Spiritual Franciscans]].

===Nalanda University===
The library of [[Nalanda]], known as Dharma Gunj (Mountain of Truth) or Dharmagañja (Treasury of Truth), was the most renowned repository of Hindu and Buddhist knowledge in the world at the time. Its collection was said to comprise hundreds of thousands of volumes, so extensive that it burned for months when set aflame by [[Muslim invasions of India|Muslim invaders]] in 1193.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of Early Indian Civilization'' by Gertrude Emerson Sen. Orient Longmans: 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samanid Dynasty Library===
The Royal Library of the [[Samanid Dynasty]] was burned at the turn of the 11th century during the Turkic invasion from the east.

===Buddhist writings in the Maldives (by Royal dynasty converted to Islam)===
Following the conversion of the [[Maldives]] to Islam in 1153 (or by some accounts in 1193), the [[Buddhist]] religion – hitherto state religion for more than a thousand years – was suppressed. The copper-plate document known as Dhanbidhū [[Lōmāfānu]] gives information about events in the southern [[Haddhunmathi Atoll]], which had been a major center of Buddhism – where monks were beheaded, and statues of [[Vairocana]], the transcendent [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], were destroyed. At that time, also the wealth of Buddhist manuscripts written on [[screwpine]] leaves by Maldivian monks in their Buddhist monasteries was either burnt or otherwise so thoroughly eliminated that it has disappeared without leaving any trace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom.''

===Buddhist writings in the Gangetic plains region of India (by Turk-Mongol raiders)===

According to William Johnston, as part of the [[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] there was a persecution of the Buddhist religion, considered idolaterous from the Muslim point of view. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Buddhist texts were burnt by the Muslim armies in the Gangetic plains region, which also destroyed hundreds of Buddhist monasteries and shrines and killed monks and nuns.&lt;ref name="Johnston2000p335"&gt;{{cite book|author=William M.

===Destruction of Cathar texts (Languedoc region of France)===
[[File:Santo Domingo y los albigenses-detalle.jpg|thumb|Detail of a [[Pedro Berruguete]] painting of a disputation between [[Saint Dominic]] of Guzman and the [[Albigensians]] ([[Catharism|Cathars]]) in which the books of both were thrown on a fire, with St. Dominic's books miraculously preserved from the flames. ''[[:Image:Talmudtrial.jpg|See the whole picture]]''.]]

During the 13th century, the Catholic Church waged a brutal campaign against the [[Cathar]]s of [[Languedoc]] (smaller numbers also lived elsewhere in Europe), culminating in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. Nearly every [[Catharism|Cathar]] text that could be found was destroyed, in an effort to completely extirpate their heretical beliefs; only a few are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sumption|first=Jonathan|title=The Albigensian Crusade|year=1978|publisher=Faber and Faber, Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-571-20002-8|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians researching the Cathar religious principles are forced to largely rely on information provided by the manifestly hostile writings of their sworn opponents.

===Maimonides' philosophy (at Montpellier)===
[[Maimonides]]' major philosophical and theological work, "[[Guide for the Perplexed]]", got highly mixed reactions from fellow-Jews of his and later times – some revering it and viewing it as a triumph, while others deemed many of its ideas [[heresy|heretical]], banning it and on some occasions burning copies of it.&lt;ref&gt;See the entry "Maimonidean Controversy, under Maimonides, in volume 11 of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', Keter Publishing, and ''Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought'' by Menachem Kellner.&lt;/ref&gt;
One such burning took place at [[Montpellier]], Southern France, in 1233.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, Lister M. ''Icons of the Middle Ages : Rulers, Writers, Rebels, And Saints.'' p. 464: ABC-CLIO, 2012. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Talmud (at Paris), first of many such burnings over the next centuries===
In 1242, The French crown burned all [[Talmud]] copies in Paris, about 12,000, after the book was "charged" and "found guilty" in the [[Disputation of Paris]] sometimes called "the Paris debate" or the "Trial of the Talmud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossel|first=Seymour|title=Journey Through Jewish History (Book 2)|year=1983|publisher=Behrman House, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-87441-367-2|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These burnings of Jewish books were initiated by [[Pope Gregory IX]], who persuaded [[Louis IX of France|French King Louis IX]] to undertake it. This particular book burning was commemorated by the German Rabbi and poet [[Meir of Rothenburg]] in the [[Kinnot|elegy (kinna)]] called "Ask, O you who are burned in fire" (שאלי שרופה באש), which is recited to this day by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] on the fast of [[Tisha B'av]].

The Church's original stance alleged that the Talmud contained blasphemous writings towards Jesus Christ and his mother Mary, attacks against the Church and other offensive pronouncements against non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/burning-of-the-talmud Christian-Jewish Relations: Burning of the Talmud]&lt;/ref&gt; which lead subsequent popes to organize public burnings of Jewish books. The most well known of them were [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] (1243–1254), [[Pope Clement IV|Clement IV]] (1256–1268), [[Pope John XXII|John XXII]] (1316–1334), [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] (1555–1559), [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]] (1566–1572) and [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] (1592–1605).

Once the printing press was invented, the Church found it impossible to destroy entire printed editions of the Talmud and other sacred books. [[Johann Gutenberg]], the German who invented the printing press around 1450, certainly helped stamp out the effectiveness of further book burnings. The tolerant (for its time) policies of Venice made it a center for the printing of Jewish books (as of books in general), yet the Talmud was publicly burned in 1553&lt;ref&gt;Stow, Kenneth R.

===Rabbi Nachmanides' account of the Disputation of Barcelona (by Dominicans)===
In 1263 the [[Disputation of Barcelona]] was held before King [[James I of Aragon]] between the [[monk]] [[Pablo Christiani]] (a convert from Judaism) and [[Rabbi]] [[Moses ben Nachman]] (also known as [[Nachmanides]]). At the end of disputation, king awarded Nachmanides a monetary prize and declared that never before had he heard "an unjust cause so nobly defended."&lt;ref&gt;
Slater, Elinor &amp; Robert (1999): ''Great Moments in Jewish History.'' Jonathan David Company, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8246-0408-3}}. p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Dominicans nevertheless claimed the victory, Nahmanides felt compelled to publish the controversy. The Dominicans asserted that this account was blasphemies against Christianity. Nahmanides admitted that he had stated many things against Christianity, but he had written nothing which he had not used in his disputation in the presence of the King, who had granted him freedom of speech. The justice of his defense was recognized by the King and the commission, but to satisfy the Dominicans Nahmanides was exiled and his pamphlet was condemned to be burned.

===The House of Wisdom library (at Baghdad)===

===Lollard books and writings (By English Law)===

The [[De heretico comburendo]] ("On the Burning of Heretics"), a law passed by the English Parliament under King [[Henry IV of England]] in 1401, was intended to stamp out "[[heresy]]" and in particular the [[Lollard]] movement, followers of [[John Wycliffe]]. The law stated that "...divers false and perverse people of a certain new sect ...make and write books, [and] do wickedly instruct and inform people". The law's purpose was to "utterly destroy" all "preachings, doctrines, and opinions of this wicked sect". Therefore, all persons in possession of "such books or writings of such wicked doctrine and opinions" were ordered to deliver all such books and writings to the diocesan authorities, within forty days of the law being enacted, so as to let them be burned and destroyed. Those failing to give up their heretical books would face the prospect of being arrested and having their bodies as well as their books burned.

===Wycliffe's books (at Prague)===
In 1410 [[John Wycliffe]]'s books were burnt by the illiterate [[Prague]] archbishop [[Zbyněk Zajíc|Zbyněk Zajíc z Házmburka]] in the court of his palace in [[Malá Strana|Lesser Town of Prague]] to hinder the spread of [[Jan Hus]]'s teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Huss|url=http://www.theopedia.com/John_Huss|publisher=Theopedia|accessdate=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gemistus Pletho's ''Nómoi'' (by Partiarch Gennadius II)===

After the death of the prominent late Byzantine scholar [[Gemistus Pletho]], there was discovered among his papers a major work called ''[[Gemistus Pletho#Nómoi|Nómon singrafí]]'' (Νόμων συγγραφή) or ''Nómoi'' (Νόμοι "Book of Laws"). He had been compiling it throughout most of his adult life, but never published it. It contained his most esoteric beliefs, including an objection to some of the basic tenets of Christianity and an explicit advocacy of a restoration (in modified form) of the worship of gods of the Classical [[Greek mythology]] – obviously [[heresy|heretical]] as the Orthodox Church understood the term. The manuscript came into the possession of Princess Theodora, wife of [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], [[despot of Morea]]. Theodora sent the manuscript to [[Gennadius II]], Patriarch of Constantinople, asking for his advice on what to do with it; he returned it, advising her to destroy it. Morea was under invasion from Sultan [[Mehmet II]], and Theodora escaped with Demetrios to Constantinople where she gave the manuscript back to Gennadius, reluctant to herself destroy the only copy of such a distinguished scholar's work. Gennadius finally burnt it in 1460. However, in a letter to the Exarch Joseph (which still survives) Gennadius details the book, providing chapter headings and brief summaries of the contents. Plethon's own summary of the ''Nómoi'', titled ''Summary of the Doctrines of Zoroaster and Plato'', also survived among manuscripts held by his former student Bessarion – though the full detailed text was lost with Gennadius' burning.

==Early Modern Period (from 1492 to 1650)==
===Library and archives of the Novgorod Republic (by Ivan III and Ivan IV)===

In the course of the [[Novgorod Republic]] being conquered and subjugated by the rising power of [[Muscovy]], the Republic's library and archives were destroyed, simultaneously with many of the republic's citizens being massacred and tortured and its wealth being looted. The library's destruction can be variously dated either to Novgorod's conquest by [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] in 1478, or to the 1570 [[Massacre of Novgorod]] perpetrated by his grandson [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, page 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decameron, Ovid and other "lewd" books (by Savonarola)===
{{Main|Bonfire of the Vanities}}
In 1497, followers of the Italian priest [[Girolamo Savonarola]] collected and publicly burned books and objects which were deemed to be "immoral", some – but by no means all – of which might fit modern criteria of pornography or "lewd pictures", as well as pagan books, gaming tables, cosmetics, copies of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[Decameron]]'', and all the works of [[Ovid]] which could be found in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomtoread.ca/links-and-resources/bannings-and-burnings-in-history/#.WqYoxejwbIU Bannings and Burnings in History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic and Hebrew books (in Andalucía)===
In 1490 a number of Hebrew Bibles and other Jewish books were burned at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition. In 1499 or early 1500 about 5000 Arabic manuscripts, including a school library—all that could be found in the city—were consumed by flames in a public square in [[Granada, Spain]], on the orders of Cardenal [[Ximénez de Cisneros]], Archbishop of Toledo and head of the [[Spanish Inquisition]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Spanish Inquisition'', Henry Kelsea, London, White Lion, 1965, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eastern Wisdome and Learninge.

===Arabic books and archives in Oran (by Spanish conquerors)===
In 1509 Spanish forces commanded by Count [[Pedro Navarro, Count of Oliveto|Pedro Navarro]], on the orders of Cardinal [[Cardinal Cisneros|Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]], [[Spanish conquest of Oran (1509)|conquered]] the city of [[Oran]] in North Africa. Thereupon, the occupying forces set fire to the books and archives of the town – a direct continuation of Cardenal Cisneros' book destruction in Granda, a few years before (see above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Urzainqui, Tomas |author2 = Esarte, Pello |author3 = García Manzanal, Alberto |author4 = Sagredo, Iñaki |author5 = Sagredo, Iñaki |author6 = Sagredo, Iñaki |author7 = Del Castillo, Eneko |author8 = Monjo, Emilio |author9 = Ruiz de Pablos, Francisco |author10 = Guerra Viscarret, Pello |author11 = Lartiga, Halip |author12 = Lavin, Josu |author13 = Ercilla, Manuel |year = 2013 |title = La Conquista de Navarra y la Reforma Europea |publisher = Pamiela |location=Pamplona-Iruña|isbn = 978-84-7681-803-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic theological works (by Martin Luther)===
At the instruction of Reformer [[Martin Luther]], a public burning of books was held in the public square outside [[Wittenberg]]'s Elster Gate on December 10, 1520. Together with the Papal Bull of Excommunication ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'', issued against Luther himself, were burned works which Luther considered as symbols of Catholic orthodoxy – including the ''Code of Canon Law'', the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] and the ''[[Summa Angelica]]'', [[Blessed Angelo Carletti di Chivasso|Angelo Carletti]]'s work on [[Scotist]] theology.&lt;ref name=Bolognini&gt;[http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://santiebeati.it/Detailed/90363.html&amp;langpair=it%7Cen&amp;hl=it&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;prev=%2Flanguage_tools Bolognini, Daniele.

===Lutheran and other Protestant writings (in the Habsburg Netherlands)===

On March 1521 Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] published in [[Flanders]] a ban prohibiting the "books, sermons and writings of the said [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and all his followers and adherents" and ordering all such materials to be burnt. This was followed by a stream of local bans throughout the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] and in neighboring states, particularly the ecclesiastical principalities of [[Liege]], [[Utrecht]], [[Cologne]] and [[Munster]]. Implementation was intensive in the southern part of the Habsburg Netherlands (present-day [[Belgium]]). At [[Leuven]] eighty copies of Luther's works were burned in October 1520 (even before publication of the official ban). At [[Antwerp]] no less than 400 Lutheran works – 300 of them confiscated from booksellers – were destroyed in the Emperor's presence in July 1521. In the same month 300 Lutheran works were destroyed at [[Ghent]]. More public book burnings followed in 1522, at [[Bruges]] and twice more at Antwerp. Implementation of the Emperor's ban was less swift in the northern part (present day [[Netherlands]]). In 1522 the authorities at [[Leiden]] ordered confiscation of all Lutheran works in the town, but apparently did not burn them. The first mass book burning in the North was in 1521 in the ecclesiastical territory of [[Utrecht]]. The first mass book burning in [[Amsterdam]] took place later, in 1526. Thereafter, public book burning remained part of life in the Habsburg Netherlands for much of the 16th Century, [[Anabaptist]] and [[Calvinist]] writings later joining the Lutheran ones in the flames. Yet despite this relentless campaign, Protestant writings continued to proliferate. As well as the books being burned, many of the printers and booksellers involved in disseminating them were themselves burned at the stake by the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan I. Israel]], "The Dutch Republic", [[Clarendon Press]], Oxford, 1995, Ch. 5, "Early Dutch Reformation P.79-81, quoting Kronenberg, "Veboden boeken", p.31-33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyndale's New Testament (in England)===
In October 1526 [[William Tyndale]]'s English translation of the ''[[New Testament]]'' was burned in London by [[Cuthbert Tunstall]], Bishop of London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tudorsociety.com/william-tyndale/ William Tyndale]&lt;/ref&gt; Tunstall claimed that Tyndale's version was filled with lies and errors.

===The works of  Galen  and  Avicenna  (by  Paracelsus)===
In 1527, the innovative physician [[Paracelsus]] was licensed to practice in [[Basel]],  with the privilege of lecturing at the [[University of Basel]].  He published harsh criticism of the Basel physicians and apothecaries, creating political turmoil to the point of his life being threatened. He was prone to many outbursts of abusive language, abhorred untested theory, and ridiculed anybody who placed more importance on traditional medical texts than on practice ('The patients are your textbook, the sickbed is your study. If disease put us to the test, all our splendor, title, ring, and name will be as much help as a horse's tail')&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Edward, "The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus", published by James Elliott and Co., London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;. In a display of his contempt for conventional medicine, Paracelsus publicly burned editions of the works of [[Galen]] and [[Avicenna]] - two of the most highly respected traditional medical texts, which established physicians tended to trust without reservations, but which according to Paracelsus contained many serious medical errors.

===English Monastic Libraries (during the Dissolution of the Monasteries)===

During the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in England (1536–1541), many monastic libraries were destroyed. [[Worcester Abbey]] had 600 books at the time of the dissolution. Only six of them have survived intact to the present day. At the abbey of the Augustinian Friars at York, a library of 646 volumes was destroyed, leaving only three surviving books. Some books were destroyed for their precious bindings, others were sold off by the cartload, including irreplaceable early English works. It is believed that many of the earliest [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] manuscripts were lost at this time. The favorites of King [[Henry VIII]] and his minister [[Thomas Cromwell]], into whose hands the former Monasteries passed, had no interest in or appreciation of the value of the old manuscripts, treating them simply as raw material:
:: "A great nombre of them whych purchased those supertycyous mansyons, resrved of those lybrarye bokes, some to serve theyr jakes [i.e., as [[toilet paper]]], some to scoure candelstyckes, and some to rubbe their bootes. Some they solde to the grossers and soapsellers…" – [[John Bale]], 1549

===Servetus's writings (burned with their author at Geneva, and also burned at Vienne)===
In 1553, [[Servetus]] was burned as a heretic at the order of the city council of Geneva, dominated by [[John Calvin|Calvin]] – because a remark in his translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' was considered an intolerable heresy. As he was placed on the stake, "around [Servetus'] waist were tied a large bundle of manuscript and a thick [[octavo]] printed book", his ''[[Christianismi Restitutio]]''. In the same year the Catholic authorities at [[Vienne]] also burned Servetus in effigy together with whatever of his writings fell into their hands, in token of the fact that Catholics and Protestants – mutually hostile in this time – were united in regarding Servetus as a heretic and seeking to extirpate his works. At the time it was considered that they succeeded, but three copies were later found to have survived, from which all later editions were printed.&lt;ref&gt;Hillar, Marian. "Miguel Servet: Obras completas." ''Catholic Historical Review'' 93, no. 2 (April 2007): 401–403. ''Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost'' (accessed March 7, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Historie of Italie'' (In England)===
''The Historie of Italie'' (1549), a scholarly and in itself not particularly controversial book by [[William Thomas (scholar)|William Thomas]], was in 1554 "suppressed and publicly burnt" by order of Queen [[Mary I of England]] – after its author was executed on charges of treason. Enough copies survived for new editions to be published in 1561 and 1562, after [[Elizabeth I]] came to power.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati56stepuoft ''Dictionary of National Biography'', volume LVI] (1898), scanned volume from [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maya codices (by Spanish Bishop of Yucatan)===
July 12, 1562, Fray [[Diego de Landa]], acting [[Bishop of Yucatán]] – then recently conquered by the Spanish – threw into the fires the books of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Neil: ''Legends of the Plumed Serpent: Biography of a Mexican God'', HarperCollins Canada, 1998 {{ISBN|978-1-891620-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of destroyed books is greatly disputed. De Landa himself admitted to 27, other sources claim "99 times as many"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Translating Maya Hieroglyphs|last=Johnson|first=Scott A. J.|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2013|isbn=9780806143330|location=|pages= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Road Encyclopedia|last=Su-Il|first=Jeong|publisher=Seoul Selection|year=2016|isbn=9781624120763|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the later being disputed as an exaggeration motivated by anti-Spanish feeling, the so-called [[Black Legend]]. Only three [[Maya codices]] and a fragment of a fourth survive. Approximately 5,000 Maya [[cult image]]s were also burned at the same time. The burning of books and images alike were part of de Landa's effort to eradicate the Maya "[[idolatry|idol worship]]", which he considered "diabolical". As narrated by de Landa himself, he had gained access to the sacred books, transcribed on deerskin, by previously gaining the natives' trust and showing a considerable interest in their culture and language:&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga. ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517–1570''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roys, Ralph L. Review of ''Landa's Relacion De Las Cosas De Yucatan: A Translation by Alfred M. Tozzer'', by Alred M. Tozzer. ''The American Historical Review'' (October 1943): 133.&lt;/ref&gt; "''We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they [the Maya] lamented to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.''"&lt;ref name="users.ipfw.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, 70&lt;/ref&gt; De Landa was later recalled to Spain and accused of having acted illegally in Yucatán, though eventually found not guilty of these charges. Present-day apologists for de Landa assert that, while he had destroyed the Maya books, his own ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]'' is a major source for the Mayan language and culture. Allen Wells calls his work an "ethnographic masterpiece",&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Allen. "Forgotten Chapters of Yucatán's Past: Nineteenth-Century Politics in Historiographical Perspective." ''Mexican Studies / Estudios Mexicanos'' (1996): 201.&lt;/ref&gt; while William J. Folan, Laraine A. Fletcher and Ellen R.

===Cluny Abbey's library (by Huguenots)===

During the [[French Wars of Religion]], in 1562 [[Huguenot]]s sacked the [[Abbey of Cluny]], destroying or dispersing many of the manuscripts in its library –  one of the richest and most important in France and Europe. The surviving part of the library would be targeted again during the [[French Revolution]].

===Monastic library in Utrecht (by militant Protestants)===

In the 1566 iconoclastic wave known as "[[Beeldenstorm]]" (or ''Bildersturm'' in German ("image/statue storm"), also the ''Great Iconoclasm'' or ''Iconoclastic Fury''), militant Protestants throughout the [[Habsburg Netherlands]]
attacked the Catholic Churches (at the time, the only Churches allowed), tore down and destroyed icons and holy pictures, visible symbols of Catholicism. Books were not particularly targeted, but in some cases they too were caught up in the wave of destruction. For example, in the outbreaks at [[Utrecht]], when great heaps of art treasures and vestments were piled in the streets and put to the torch, the entire library of the [[Friars Minor]] was destroyed as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan I. Israel]], ''The Dutch Republic'', [[Clarendon Press]], Oxford, 1995, Ch. 7, ''Breakdown of the Habsburg Regime'', P.149, quoting Freedberg, ''Art and Iconoclasm'', P.74, Duke, ''Reformation and Revolt'', P.132&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic books in Spain (owners ordered to destroy their own books by King Philip II) ===

In 1567, [[Philip II of Spain]] issued a royal decree in Spain forbidding [[Moriscos]] (Muslims who had been converted to Christianity but remained living in distinct communities) from the [[Language death|use of Arabic on all occasions]], formal and informal, speaking and writing. Using Arabic in any sense of the word would be regarded as a crime. They were given three years to learn a "Christian" language, after which they would have to get rid of all Arabic written material. It is unknown how many of the Moriscos complied with the decree and destroyed their own Arabic books and how many kept them in defiance of the King's decree; the decree is known to have triggered one of the largest [[Morisco Revolt]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Kees Versteegh]], et al.: ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics'', [[Brill Publishers]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Obscene" Maltese poetry (by the Inquisition)===
In 1584 Pasquale Vassallo, a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], wrote a collection of songs, of the kind known as "canczuni", in Italian and [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. The poems fell into the hands of other Dominican friars who denounced him for writing "obscene literature". At the order of the [[Inquisition]] in 1585 the poems were burned for this allegedly 'obscene' content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 |title=Maltese Language Academy on landmarks in the language's development |publisher=Akkademjatalmalti.com |accessdate=2014-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923054701/http://www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arwi books (by Portuguese in India and Ceylon)===
With the 16th-century extension of the [[Portuguese Empire]] to India and Ceylon, the staunchly Catholic colonizers were hostile to [[Muslim]]s they found living there. An aspect of this was a Portuguese hostility to and destruction of writings in the [[Arwi]] language, a type of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] with many Arabic words, written in a variety of the Arabic script and used by local Muslims. Much of Arwi cultural heritage was thus destroyed, though the precise extent of the destruction might never be known.

===Bernardino de Sahagún's manuscripts on Aztec culture (by Spanish authorities)===
The 12-volume work known as the [[Florentine Codex]], result of a decades-long meticulous research conducted by the Fransciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] in Mexico, is among the most important sources on [[Aztec]] culture and society as they were before the Spanish conquest, and on the [[Nahuatl]] language. However, upon Sahagún's return to Europe in 1585, his original manuscripts – including the records of conversations and interviews with indigenous sources in [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]], and [[Tenochtitlan]], and likely to have included much primary material which did not get into the final codex – were confiscated by the Spanish authorities, disappeared irrevocably, and are assumed to have been destroyed. The Florentine Codex itself was for centuries afterwards only known in heavily censored versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Censorship: A World Encyclopedia|last=Jones|first=Derek|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1-57958-135-0|location=New York|pages= 1575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iberlibro.com/servlet/SearchResults?cm_sp=pan-_-srp-_-loc&amp;sortby=1&amp;an=bernardino+sahagun&amp;n=-1|title=Florentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain|last=Sahagún|first=Bernardino de|date=|website=iberlibro|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books from the Bibliotheca Palatina (by Catholic troops)===

In 1622, during the [[Thirty Years War]], [[Heidelberg]] was sacked by the troops of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] under general [[Count von Tilly|Von Tilly]]. The [[Bibliotheca Palatina]], most important library of the [[German Renaissance]], greatly suffered, many books being torn up by rampaging soldiers or "dispersed among private hands". Fortunately, Von Tilly and his employer, [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]], intervened to confiscate the remaining manuscripts and present them to Pope [[Gregory XV]] – their transfer from Protestant custody to a Catholic one saving them from destruction.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;The ''Classical Journal'' for March and June 1816, page 212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luther: Lectures on Romans'', ed. by Wilhelm Pauck.

The 1624 book ''An Examination of the Traditions of the Pharisees'', written by the dissident Jewish intellectual [[Uriel da Costa]], was burned in public by joint action of the Amsterdam Jewish Community and the city's Protestant-dominated City Council. The book, which questioned the fundamental idea of the [[immortality#Spiritual|immortality of the soul]], was considered [[heretical]] by the Jewish community, which excommunicated him, and was arrested by the Dutch authorities as a public enemy to religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/costa-uriel-da-1585-1640 Uriel da Costa]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socinian and Anti-Trinitarian books (by secular and church authorities in the Dutch Republic)===

As noted by [[Jonathan Israel]], the [[Dutch Republic]] was more tolerant than other 17th Century states, allowing a wide range of religious groups to practice more or less freely and openly disseminate their views. However, the dominant Calvinist Church drew the line at [[Socinian]] and [[Anti-Trinitarian]] doctrines which were deemed to "undermine the very foundations of Christianity". In the late 1640s and 1650s, Polish and German holders of such views arrived in the Netherlands as refugees from persecution in Poland and Brandenburg. Dutch authorities made an effort to stop them spreading their theological writings, by arrests and fines as well as book-burning. For example, in 1645, the burgomasters at [[Rotterdam]] discovered a stock of a 100 books by [[Cellius]] and destroyed them. In 1659 [[Lancelot van Brederode]] published anonymously 900 copies of a 563-page book assailing the dominant Calvinist Church and the doctrine of the Trinity. The writer's identity was discovered and he was arrested and heavily fined, and the authorities made an effort to hunt down and destroy all copies of the book – but since it had already been distributed, many of the copies survived. The book ''Bescherming der Waerheyt Godts'' by [[Foeke Floris]], a liberal [[Anabaptist]] preacher, was in 1687 banned by authorities in [[Friesland]] which deemed it to be Socinian, and all copies were ordered to be burned. In 1669 the Hof (high court) of Holland ordered the Amsterdam municipal authorities to raid booksellers in the city, seize and destroy Socinian books – especially the ''[[Biblioteca fratrum Polonorum]]'' ("Book of the [[Polish Brethren]]"), at the time known to be widely circulating in Amsterdam. The Amsterdam burgomasters felt obliged to go along with this, at least formally – but in fact some of them mitigated the practical effect by warning booksellers of impending raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan I.

===Book criticising Puritanism (in Boston)===
The first book burning incident in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] occurred in Boston in 1651 when [[William Pynchon]], founder of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], published ''The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption'', which criticised the [[Puritan]]s, who were then in power in [[Massachusetts]]. The book became the first banned book in North America, and subsequently all known copies were publicly burned.

===Manuscripts of John Amos Comenius (by anti-Swedish Polish partisans)===
During the [[Northern Wars]] in 1655, the well-known Bohemian Protestant theologian and educator [[John Amos Comenius]], then living in exile at the city of [[Leszno]] in Poland, declared his support for the Protestant Swedish side. In retaliation, Polish partisans burned his house, his manuscripts, and his school's printing press. Notably, the original manuscript of Comenius' ''Pansophiæ Prodromus'' was destroyed in the fire; fortunately, the text had already been printed and thus survived.

===Quaker books (in Boston)===
In 1656 the authorities at Boston imprisoned the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] women preachers [[Ann Austin]] and [[Mary Fisher (missionary)|Mary Fisher]], who had arrived on a ship from [[Barbados]].

As part of his intensive campaign against the [[Jansenist]]s, King [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1660 ordered the book "[[Lettres provinciales]]" by [[Blaise Pascal]] – which contained a fierce defense of the Jansenist doctrines – to be shredded and burnt. Despite Louis XIV absolute power in France, this decree proved ineffective. "Lettres provinciales" continued to be clandestinely printed and disseminated, eventually outliving the Jansenist controversy which gave it birth and becoming recognized as a masterpiece of French prose.

===Great Fire (London)===
In 1666, during the [[Great Fire of London]], many booksellers moved their books to the stone crypts of [[Old St. Paul's Cathedral]] to escape destruction of their books, but falling masonry broke through into the crypt and let the fire in and all the books were burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://talkinghumanities.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2016/08/30/burning-books-the-great-fire-of-london/|title=Burning books: the Great Fire of London|last=Shaw|first=Dr. Matthew|date=30 August 2016|website=Talking Humanities|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim and Jewish books (during capture of Buda by Austrian troops)===

Following the 1686 [[Battle of Buda (1686)|capture]] of the Hungarian capital [[Buda]] by the Austrian-led [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]], the victorious troops rampaged in the city and carried out a large-scale massacre of the resident Muslim population – as well as of the Buda Jews, who were considered allies of the Ottomans. The mosques and [[minaret]]s of Buda were burned and destroyed, as were three synagogues. Numerous valuable books perished in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation, by Jonathan Rose, 2008, p.268-270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swedish National Archives===

===Mythical (and/or mystical) writings of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (by rabbis)===
During the 1720s rabbis in Italy and Germany ordered the burning of the [[kabbalist]] writings of the then young [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. The [[Messianic prophecies|Messianic]] messages which Luzzatto claimed to have gotten from a being called "The Maggid" were considered heretical and potentially highly disruptive of the Jewish communities' daily life, and Luzzatto was ordered to cease disseminating them. Though Luzzatto in later life got considerable renown among Jews and his later books were highly esteemed, most of the early writings were considered irrevocably lost until some of them turned up in 1958 in a manuscript preserved in the [[Bodleian Library|Library of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azamra.org/TempleSecrets/Ramchal.htm|title=Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|last=|first=|date=2007|website=Azamra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rabbiyaakovfeldman.aishdas.org/daattevunot/2015/11/15/daat-tevunot-the-life-of-rabbi-moshe-chaim-luzzatto/|title=Part One: Da’at Tevunot — The Life of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|last=Feldman|first=Rabbi Yaakov|date=15 November 2015|website=Yaakov Feldman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.jewishcurrents.org/tag/moshe-chaim-luzzatto/|title=THE MYSTICAL ETHICIST|last=Bush|first=Lawrence|date=15 May 2017|website=Jewish Currents|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant books and Bibles (by Archbishop of Salzburg)===
In 1731 Count Leopold Anton von Firmian – [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] as well as its temporal ruler – embarked on a savage persecution of the [[Lutheran]]s living in the rural regions of Salzburg. As well expelling tens of thousands of Protestant Salzburgers, the Archbishop ordered the wholesale seizure and burning of all Protestant books and Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&amp;artid=561 Catholics Cleanse Salzburg of Protestants]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays of the John Warburton collection===
[[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]] was an avid collector of old book and manuscripts, but often careless. At one occasion, he left a pile of drama manuscripts in the kitchen. When he came looking for them a year later, nearly all were gone. His cook, Betsy Baker, had used over fifty manuscripts as scrap paper while cooking—either for lighting fires or for lining the bottoms of pie pans while baking pies.&lt;ref name="dnb2"&gt;[[s:Warburton, John (DNB00)|"Warburton, John"]] entry in ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 59''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The writings of Johann Christian Edelmann (by Imperial authorities in Frankfurt)===
In 1750, the Imperial Book Commission of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at [[Frankfurt/Main]] ordered the wholesale burning of the works of Johann Christian Edelmann, a radical disciple of [[Spinoza]] who had outraged the [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] clergies by his [[Deism]], his championing of [[sexual freedom]] and his asserting that Jesus had been a human being and not the Son of God. In addition, Edelmann was also an outspoken opponent of [[royal absolutism]]. With Frankfurt's entire magistracy and municipal government in attendance and seventy guards to hold back the crowds, nearly a thousand copies of Edelmann's writings were tossed on to a tower of flaming birch wood. Edelmann himself was granted refuge in Berlin by [[Friedrich the Great]], but on condition that he stop publishing his views.&lt;ref&gt;Christopehr Clark, ''The Iron Kingdom'' (London, 2006), pp. 254–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books that offended Qianlong Emperor===

China's [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1711–1799) embarked on an ambitious program – the [[Siku Quanshu]], largest compilation of books in [[Chinese history]] (possibly in human history in general). The enterprise included, however, also the systematic banning and burning of books considered "unfitting" to be included – especially those critical, even by subtle hints, of the ruling [[Qing Dynasty]]. During this Emperor's nearly sixty years on the throne, the destruction of about 3000 "evil" titles (books, poems, and plays) was decreed, the number of individual copies confiscated and destroyed is variously estimated at tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. As well as systematically destroying the written works, 53 authors of such works were executed, in some cases by lingering torture or along with their family members (see [[literary inquisition#Qing]], [[Qianlong Emperor#Burning of books and modification of texts]]). A famous earlier Chinese encyclopedia, ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' (Chinese: 天工開物) was included among the works banned and destroyed at this time, and was long considered to be lost forever – but some original copies were discovered, preserved intact, in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;needham volume 4 part 2 172&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s own masterpiece – the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'', produced only in seven hand-written copies – was itself the target of later book burnings: the copies kept in [[Zhenjiang]] and [[Yangzhou]] were destroyed during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], and in 1860, during the [[Second Opium War]] an Anglo-French expedition force burned most of the copy kept at Beijing's Old Summer Palace. The four remaining copies, though suffering some damage during [[World War II]], are still preserved at four Chinese museums and libraries.

===Anti-Wilhelm Tell tract (at Canton of Uri)===
The 1760 tract by Simeon Uriel Freudenberger from [[Luzern]], arguing that [[Wilhelm Tell]] was a myth and the acts attributed to him had not happened in reality, was publicly burnt in [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]], capital of the [[Swiss canton]] of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] – where, according to the legend, [[William Tell]] shot the apple from his son's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/in-search-of-william-tell-2198511/|title=In Search of William Tell|last=Wernick|first=Robert|date=August 2004|website=Smithsonian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books of Voltaire (by French authorities)===
[[Voltaire]], the pen name of François-Marie Arouet, was a writer whose works were burnt several times in pre-[[French Revolution|revolutionary]] France. In his ''Lettres philosophique'', published in [[Rouen]] in 1734, he described British attitudes toward government, literature, and religion, and clearly implied that the British constitutional monarchy was better than the French absolute one – which led to the book being burned.

Later, Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', which was originally called the ''Dictionnaire philosophique portatif'', had its first volume, consisting of 73 articles in 344 pages, burnt upon release in June 1764.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurois|first=André|title=The Sage of Ferney: An Appreciation (extracted from Voltaire, reprinted in Candide)|origyear=1932|year=1959|publisher=D.

An "economic [[pamphlet]]", ''Man With Forty Crowns'', was ordered to be burnt by [[French Parliament|Parliament]], and a bookseller who had sold a copy was [[pilloried]].

===Vernacular Catholic hymn books (at Mainz)===
In 1787, an attempt by the Catholic authorities at [[Mainz]] to introduce [[vernacular]] hymn books encountered strong resistance from conservative Catholics, who refused to abandon the old Latin books and who seized and burned copies of the new German language books.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Blanning]], ''[[The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648-1815]]'', Penguin, 2007, p.388&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cluny Abbey's library (in the French Revolution)===

In 1790 and 1793 much of [[Cluny Abbey]]'s library – earlier targeted in 1562 by [[Huguenot]]s – was burnt during [[French Revolution]]ary violence.

===The Libro d'Oro (in the French-ruled Ionian Islands)===
With the [[Treaty of Leoben]] and the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] in 1797, the [[First French Republic|French Republic]] gained the [[Ionian Islands]], hitherto ruled by the [[Venetian Republic]]. France proceeded to annex the islands, organize them as the [[Département in France|départements]] of [[Mer-Égée]], [[Ithaque]] and [[Corcyre]], and introduce there the principles and institutions of the [[French Revolution]] – initially getting great enthusiasm among the islands' inhabitants. The abolition of aristocratic privileges was accompanied by the public burning of the ''[[Libro d'Oro]]'' – formal directory of nobles in the [[Republic of Venice]] which included those of the Ionian Islands.

===Egyptian archaeological finds (threatened burning by French scholars)===
Many French scholars accompanied [[Napoleon's invasion of Egypt]] in 1799, where they made many important finds. When forced to surrender to the British in 1801, the scholars initially strongly resisted the claim made by the British to have the collections of the expedition handed over. [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] ominously threatened that, were that British demand persisted in, history would record "a second burning of a library in [[Alexandria]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wonderful Things: A History of Egyptology: 1: From Antiquity to 1881|last=Thompson|first=Jason|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|year=2015|isbn=978-977-416-599-3|location=|pages= 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egyptologyforum.org/bbs/Rosetta.htm|title=Bicentenary of the discovery of the Rosetta Stone|last=Tilgner|first=Michael|date=|website=THE EGYPTOLOGISTS' ELECTRONIC FORUM|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat was, however, not carried out, and the finds were finally handed over and ended up in the [[British Museum]].

==Industrial Revolution period==
==="The Burned Book" (by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov)===
In 1808, [[Rabbi]] [[Nachman of Breslov]] burned the only copy or copies of one of his own books for an unknown reason. Many [[Hasidic]] Jews continue to search for "The Burned Book," as they call it, by looking for clues in his other writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Aryeh|title=Gems of Rabbi Nachman|year=1980|publisher=Yeshiva Chasidei Breslov|location=Jerusalem|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musin-Pushkin's library (In Great Moscow Fire)===
The vast destruction caused by the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|great Moscow fire]] of 1812 (during the [[Napoleon]]ic occupation) included destruction of the entire library of Count [[Aleksei Musin-Pushkin]] – statesman, historian and art collector. Among the irreplaceable old books destroyed was the only known manuscript of the Medieval ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Tale of Igor's Campaign]]''. Fortunately, Musin-Pushkin had already published the text; still, historians mourn the lost original.

===Records of the Goa Inquisition (by Portuguese colonial authorities)===
In 1812 the [[Goa Inquisition]] was suppressed, after hundreds of years in which it had been enacting various kinds of religious persecution in the Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], India. In the aftermath, most of the Goa Inquisition's records were destroyed – a great loss to historians, making it is impossible to know the exact number of the Inquisition's victims.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, H. P 2001 pp. 345–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original Library of Congress Collection (by British troops)===
On August 24, 1814,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021122145323/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trm001.html]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Burning of Washington]], British and Canadian troops set fire to the Capitol building, thereby destroying some 3,000 volumes in the initial collection of the [[Library of Congress]] which was established fourteen years earlier. Most of these books had been ordered from London before the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]]. Immediately following the British withdrawal, former President [[Thomas Jefferson]] sold to the US Government his entire private library, 6700 volumes, to replace the loss – from which the Library of Congress went on to expand to its enormous present size though a fire in 1851 destroyed around two-thirds of Jefferson's collection. The material destroyed in 1814 is the modern digital storage equivalent of 3.42 gigabytes and could easily be hosted on one single present-day smartphone, tablet, or SD card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.globaldatavault.com/blog/information-destruction-history/ |title=Information Destruction Through History &amp;#124; Data Protection |website=Globaldatavault.com |date=January 14, 2014 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Code Napoléon (by German Nationalist students)===
On October 18, 1817 about 450 students, members of the newly founded German [[Burschenschaft]]en ("fraternities"), [[Wartburg festival|came together at Wartburg Castle to celebrate]] the German victory over Napoleon two years before, condemn conservatism and call for German unity. The [[Code Napoléon]] as well as the writings of German conservatives were ceremoniously burned 'in effigy': instead of the costly volumes, scraps of parchment with the titles of the books were placed on the bonfire. Among these was [[August von Kotzebue]]'s ''History of the German Empires''. [[Karl Ludwig Sand]], one of the students participating in this gathering, would assassinate Kotzebue two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dumas|first1=Alexandre|title=Celebrated Crimes|date=1843|publisher=Chapman and Hall|page=324|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Blake manuscripts (by Frederick Tatham)===

The poet [[William Blake]] died in 1827, and his manuscripts were left with his wife [[Catherine Blake| Catherine]]. After her death in 1831, the manuscripts were inherited by [[Frederick Tatham]], who burned some that he deemed heretical or politically radical. Tatham was an [[Edward Irving|Irvingite]], one of the many fundamentalist movements of the 19th century, and opposed to any work that smacked of "blasphemy".&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, ''Blake'', p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Blake was nearly forgotten, and Tatham could act with impunity. When Blake was re-discovered some decades later and recognized as a major English poet, the damage was already done.

===Early braille books (in Paris)===
In 1842, officials at the school for the blind in Paris, France, were ordered by its new director, [[Armand Dufau]], to burn books written in the new [[braille]] code. After every braille book at the institute that could be found was burned, supporters of the code's inventor, [[Louis Braille]], rebelled against Dufau by continuing to use the code, and braille was eventually restored at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/LouisBrailleMuseum/braillegallery.asp?GalleryID=49 |title=Changing of the Guard – Recognition of the Braille Code |website=Afb.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 1844, the Irish [[St. Augustine Church, Philadelphia]] was burned down by anti-Irish [[Nativism (politics)|Nativist]] rioters (see Philadelphia Nativist riots). The fire also destroyed the nearby St. Augustine Academy, with many of the rare books in its library – though in this case the arsonists did not specifically target the books, but rather sought to destroy indiscriminately everything belonging to Irish Catholic immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.library.villanova.edu/chaos-in-the-streets-the-philadelphia-riots-of-1844/churches/ Destruction of Catholic Churches]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese literary works (By Anglo-French troops in Beijing)===
In 1860, during the [[Second Opium War]], twenty captive Westerners were tortured and killed by the Chinese government. In retaliation, the British High Commissioner to China, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], ordered the destruction of The [[Old Summer Palace]] in Beijing, which was then carried out by French and British troops. The palace complex had been built up by succeeding Chinese dynasties for nearly a thousand years, and many unique works of art were destroyed or looted by the soldiers. Also unique copies of Chinese literary work and compilations, stored there, were burned down as part of the general destruction.

==="The Bonnie Blue Flag" (by Union General Benjamin Butler)===
During the [[American Civil War]], when Union Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] captured [[New Orleans]] he ordered the destruction of all copies of the music for the popular Confederate song "[[The Bonnie Blue Flag]]", as well as imposing a $500 fine on A. E. Blackmar who published this music.

===Libraries in Confederate cities (during Sherman's March to the Sea)===

During the [[American Civil War]] Union campaign known as [[Sherman's March to the Sea]], whole Confederate cities such as [[Atlanta]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina in the American Civil War|Columbia]] were burned down. Though books were not specifically targeted, the conflagration destroyed various private and public libraries. For example, the wartime diaries of Columbia resident Emma LeConte include the following reference: "The library building opposite us seemed framed by the gushing flames and smoke, while through the windows gleamed the liquid fire".&lt;ref&gt;Earl Schnek Miers (ed.)

===Edmond Potonie's papers (by French Police)===
In 1868 the French police, under [[Napoleon the Third]], seized the extensive papers and Europe-wide correspondence of the Parisian Pacifist and Social Reformer Edmond Potonie.

===On the Ancient Cypriots (by Ottoman Authorities)===
Following its publication in 1869, the book on the Ancient Cypriots by [[Greek Cypriot]] priest and scholar Ieronymos Myriantheus was banned by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and 460 copies of it were burned. In a punitive measure towards Myriantheus the Ottomans refused to recognize him as Bishop of [[Kyrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/80|title=Περί των αρχαίων Κυπρίων|website=Cyprus Digital Library|date= |accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library of Strasbourg (in German bombardment)===
In the [[Siege of Strasbourg]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Strasbourg was heavily and indiscriminately bombarded by the [[Prussian Army]], aiming to break the inhabitants' morale.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jacob, Histoire-Géographie – Alsachroniques – Strasbourg bombardé, in Lycée Marcel Rudloff, Strasbourg 2013, quoting "Illustrierte Geschichte des Krieges 1870/71, Stuttgart, Berlin, Leipzig";Raymond BONGRAND, 1870, Alsace, Metz-Sedan, Strasbourg, 1970.

Many of the destroyed books and artifacts formed part of the German historical and cultural heritage, dating to periods long before Strasbourg became a French city.

===Library of the Louvre (during suppression of the Paris Commune)===

On May 23, 1871, during the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]], 12 men under the orders of a ''Communard'', Dardelle, set various public buildings in Paris on fire. The library and other portions of the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]] were also set on fire and entirely destroyed. The museum itself was only miraculously saved.

==="Lewd" books (by Anthony Comstock and the NYSSV)===
[[Anthony Comstock]] founded the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]](NYSSV) in 1873 and over the years burned 15 tons of books, 284,000 pounds of plate, and almost 4 million pictures. The NYSSV was financed by wealthy and influential New York philanthropists. Lobbying the [[United States Congress]] also led to the enactment of the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/5508/Comstock-Law-1873.html Comstock Law of 1873]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedigrees and books of Muslim law and theology (By the Mahdi in Sudan)===

After establishing his rule over [[Mahdist Sudan|Sudan]] in 1885, [[Muhammad Ahmad]], known as the Mahdi, authorized the burning of lists of pedigrees – which is his view accentuated tribalism at the expense of religious unity – as well as books of Muslim law and theology because of their association with the old order which the Mahdi had overthrown.

===Emily Dickinson's correspondence (on her orders)===
Following the death of noted American poet [[Emily Dickinson]] in 1890, her sister Lavinia Dickinson burned almost all of her correspondences in keeping with Emily's wishes, but as it was unclear whether the forty notebooks and loose sheets all filled with almost 1800 poems were to be included in this, Lavinia saved these and began to publish the poems that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Habegger|first=Alfred|title=My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson|year=2001|page=604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farr (ed.)|first=Judith|title=Emily Dickinson: A Collection of Critical Essays|year=1996|publisher=Prentice Hall International Paperback Editions|isbn=978-0-13-033524-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ivan Bloch's research on Russian Jews (by Tsarist Russian government)===
In 1901 the [[Russian Council of Ministers]] banned a five-volume work on the socio-economic conditions of [[Russian Jew|Jews in the Russian Empire]], the result of a decade-long comprehensive statistical research commissioned by [[Iwan Bloch|Ivan Bloch]]. (It was entitled "Comparison of the material and moral levels in the Western Great-Russian and Polish Regions"). The research's conclusions – that Jewish economic activity was beneficial to the Empire – refuted antisemitic demagoguery and were disliked by the government, which ordered all copies to be seized and burned. Only a few survived, circulating as great rarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World War I: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection [5 volumes]: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2016|isbn=978-1-85109-964-1|location=|pages= 268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian Nationalist literature (by Austrian authorities in Trieste)===

In the tense period following the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908–09, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] authorities in [[Trieste]] cracked down on the [[Italian irredentism|Italian Irredentists]] in the city, who were seeking to end Austrian rule there and annex Trieste to Italy (which would actually happen ten years later, at the end of [[World War I]]). A very large quantity of Italian-language books and periodicals whose contents were deemed "subversive" were confiscated and consigned to destruction. The authorities had the condemned material meticulously weighted, it was found to measure no less than 4.7 metric tons. Thereupon, on February 13, 1909, the books and periodicals were officially burned at the Servola blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;The Trieste book burnings are referenced in John Gatt-Rutter's comprehensive autobiographical work, ''Italo Svevo, A Double Life'' ([[Clarendon Press]], Oxford, 1988, Ch. 47, p.242). The site of the book burnings was very near the home of the writer [[Italo Svevo]], though Svevo's own works were spared. Servola is a suburb of Trieste.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early edition of ''Dubliners'' (by publisher)===

[[James Joyce]] had to go through considerable trouble before seeing his early book of short stories, ''[[Dubliners]]'', in print. Various publishers objected to sexually-explicit passages in the stories – in particular in ''[[Two Gallants (short story)|Two Gallants]]'' – which might have led to prosecution under British law as it then stood. In 1909 Joyce thought his trouble was over when Maunsel &amp; Roberts of Dublin consented to publish it and went as far as setting the book and printing sheets – at which stage the publisher suddenly got cold feet and refused to go through with publishing. Joyce offered to pay the printing costs himself if the sheets were turned over to him and he was allowed to complete the job elsewhere and distribute the book, but when Joyce arrived at the printers they refused to surrender the sheets. They burned them the next day. Joyce managed to save one copy, which he obtained "by ruse". These [[page proofs]] saved from Maunsel were used as [[copy (written)|copy]] when five years later Joyce found the publisher ready to publish the book.&lt;ref&gt;Jeri Johnson, "Composition and Publication History", in James Joyce, ''Dubliners'' (Oxford University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and interbellum era==
===Leuven University Library (by World War I German Army)===
On August 25, 1914, in the early stage of the First World War, the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|university library]] of [[Leuven]], Belgium was destroyed by the German army, using petrol and incendiary pastilles, as part of brutal retaliations for the extensive activity of "[[francs-tireurs]]" against the occupying German forces. Among the 300,000 books destroyed were many irreplaceable books, including [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance]] [[manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Dynamic of Destruction, Culture and mass killing in the first world war |last= Kramer|first= Alan |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin |isbn= 978-1-84614-013-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Gibson  |first= Craig |title= The culture of destruction in the First World War |journal=Times Literary Supplement |issue= January 30, 2008 |id= |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article3277792.ece |accessdate= 2008-02-18  |quote=  |location=London | date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this destruction aroused shock and dismay around the world.

One of the notable losses was that of [[Rongorongo text E]], which was one of only two dozen surviving examples of the as yet undeciphered [[rongorongo]] script of [[Easter Island]]. Rubbings and possibly 3-dimensional replicas were preserved in libraries and collections elsewhere.

===Books in Serbian (by World War I Bulgarian Army)===
In the aftermath of the Serbia defeat in the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I]], the region of [[Old Serbia]] came under the control of Bulgarian occupational authorities. Bulgaria engaged in a campaign of [[cultural genocide]]. Serbian priests, professors, teachers and public officials, were deported into prison camps in pre–war Bulgaria or executed, they were later replaced by their Bulgarian counterparts. The use of the Serbian language was banned. Books in Serbian were confiscated from libraries, schools and private collections to be burned publicly. Books deemed to be of particular value were selected by Bulgarian ethnographers and sent back into Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Pissari |first=Milovan |date=2013 |title=Bulgarian Crimes against Civilians in Occupied Serbia during the First World War|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-7653/2013/0350-76531344357P.pdf|journal=Balcanica |publisher=Institute for Balkan Studies  |issue=44 |pages=373–380 |doi=10.2298/BALC1344357P |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Valley of the Squinting Windows'' (at Delvin, Ireland)===
In 1918 the ''[[Valley of the Squinting Windows]]'', by [[Brinsley MacNamara]], was burned in [[Delvin]], Ireland. MacNamara never returned to the area, his father James MacNamara was [[boycott]]ed and subsequently emigrated, and a court case was even sought. The book criticised the village's inhabitants for being overly concerned with their image towards neighbours, and although it called the town "Garradrimna," geographical details made it clear that Delvin was meant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-valley-of-the-squinting-windows-and-the-various-lives-of-marcus-igoe-by-brinsley-macnamara-anvil-books-6-95-each-in-uk-1.104550 The Valley of the Squinting Windows and The Various Lives of Marcus Igoe, by Brinsley MacNamara]&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Grosz's cartoons (By court order in Weimar Germany)===

In June 1920 the left-wing German cartoonist [[George Grosz]] produced a lithographic collection in three editions entitled ''[[Gott mit uns]]''. A satire on German society and the counterrevolution, the collection was swiftly banned. Grosz was charged with insulting the [[Reichswehr|army]], which resulted in a court order to have the collection destroyed. The artist also had to pay a 300 [[Deutsche Mark|German Mark]] fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQzdp1zN--oC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Gott+mit+uns&amp;lr=#PPA29,M1 |last=Crockett |first=Dennis |title=German Post-Expressionism: The Art of the Great Disorder, 1918–1924 |pages=28–29 |publisher=Penn State University Press |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-271-01796-9 |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish National Archives (in Civil War)===
At the culmination of the April 1922 fighting in and around the [[Four Courts]] in Dublin, as the Republican forces hitherto barricaded in the building were surrendering, the west wing was obliterated in a huge explosion, destroying the Irish [[National Archives of Ireland|Public Record Office]] located at the rear, with nearly one thousand years of irreplaceable archives being destroyed. Responsibility for the incident has never been established. Blame has been placed on either the national army which was shelling anti-Treaty forces or anti-Treaty forces who were believed to have purposely blown up the records in an act of defiance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/census-records-thought-lost-in-civil-war-explosion-put-online-1.1776778 Census Records Thought Lost in Civil War Explosion Put Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Irish Civil War]] in 1923, the IRA [[Irish Civil War#Attacks on former Loyalists|targeted]] various country houses – among them Kilteragh in [[Foxrock]], County Dublin, home of Sir [[Horace Plunkett]], hated by Irish Nationalists for his support of Ireland remaining part of the British Commonwealth. He himself was abroad at the time, but the fire took with it many of the records of the Plunkett family, which had played a significant part in Irish history for several generations, and which Sir Horace had gathered to prepare a work on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid Ferriter|Ferriter, Diarmaid:]]''The Transformation of IRELAND 1900–2000'' p.210, Profile Books (2004)({{ISBN|1 86197 443-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaret Sanger's ''Family Limitation'' (by British court order)===

In 1923 the anarchist [[Guy Aldred]] and his partner and co-worker [[Rose Witcop]], a [[birth control]] activist, published together a British edition of [[Margaret Sanger]]'s ''Family Limitation'' – a key pioneering work on the subject. They were denounced by a London magistrate for this "indiscriminate" publication.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', January 11, 1923, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The two lodged an appeal, strongly supported in their legal struggle by [[Dora Russell]] – who, with her husband [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]], paid the legal costs.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Dora, (1975) ''The Tamarisk Tree''&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was to no avail. Despite expert testimony from a consultant to [[Guy's Hospital]] and evidence at the appeal that the book had only been sold to those aged over twenty-one, the court ordered the entire stock to be destroyed.&lt;ref name="Times19230210"&gt;''The Times'', February 12, 1923, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish, anti-Nazi and "degenerate" books (by the Nazis)===

[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|In 1933, Nazis burned works of Jewish authors, and other works considered "un-German", at the library of the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] in Berlin.]]

The works of some Jewish authors and other so-called "degenerate" books were burnt by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in the 1930s and 1940s. [[Richard Euringer]], director of the libraries in [[Essen]], identified 18,000 works deemed not to correspond with Nazi ideology, which were publicly burned.

On May 10, 1933 on the [[Bebelplatz|Opernplatz]] in Berlin, [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and Nazi youth groups burned around 25,000 books from the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] and the [[Humboldt University]], including works by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Vicki Baum]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Helen Keller]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Erich Maria Remarque]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[H.G. Wells]]. Student groups throughout Germany in 34 towns also carried out their own book burnings on that day and in the following weeks. [[Erich Kästner]] wrote an ironic account (published only after the fall of Nazism) of having witnessed the burning of his own books on that occasion. Radio broadcasts of the burnings were played in Berlin and elsewhere, and 40,000 turned up to hear [[Joseph Goebbels]] make a speech about the acts.

===Works of Goethe, Shaw, and Freud (by Metaxas dictatorship in Greece)===

[[Ioannis Metaxas]], who held dictatorial power in [[Greece]] between 1936 and 1941, conducted an intensive campaign against what he considered ''Anti-Greek literature'' and viewed as ''dangerous to the national interest''. Targeted under this definition and put to the fire were not only the writings of dissident Greek writers, but even works by such authors as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].&lt;ref name="petrakis37"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Petrakis|first=Marina|title=The Metaxas myth: dictatorship and propaganda in Greece|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|page=37|isbn=1-84511-037-4|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works in the British Museum (by German bomber planes)===
In September 1940 during [[the Blitz]] in London, a plane commanded by [[Nazi Germany]] dropped a bomb on the [[British Museum]]. It is not believed that it was intended to hit the Museum in particular, but 124 volumes were destroyed and 304 other volumes were damaged past repair.

From May 10–11, 1941, the Museum's book collections (now the [[British Library]]) were bombed again, this time burning more than 150,000 books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caygill|first=Marjorie and Christopher Date|title=Building the British Museum|year=1999|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishers and booksellers in Paternoster Row, London (by German bomber planes)===

On night of 29–30 December 1940, the German Air Force conducted one of the most destructive air raids of [[the Blitz]].

===Jean Genet's ''Our Lady of the Flowers'' (by French prison guard)===

In 1943 [[Jean Genet]] – then an obscure petty criminal – underwent one of the many prison terms in his life. The prison authorities provided to prisoners sheets of rough brown paper, from which they were supposed to make bags. Instead, Genet used the paper to write a largely autobiographical book which would eventually be named ''[[Notre Dame des Fleurs]]'' (''[[Our Lady of the Flowers]]''). As later recounted by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in his forward to the book, a prison guard discovered that the prisoner Genet had been making this "unauthorized" use of the paper, confiscated the manuscript and burned it. Undaunted, Genet wrote it all over again. The second version survived and Genet took it with him when leaving the prison.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre Forward to the 1951 Gallimard edition of ''Notre Dame des Fleurs'', here quoted from the 1964 Bantam English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this book which eventually established Genet's literary credentials and enabled him to leave the world of crime and become an internationally known author.

===Jewish books in Alessandria (by pro-Nazi mob)===

On December 13, 1943 in [[Alessandria]], Italy, a mob of supporters of the German-imposed [[Italian Social Republic]] attacked the synagogue of the city's small Jewish community, on Via Milano. Books and manuscripts were taken out of the synagogue and set on fire at Piazza Rattazzi. The burning of the Jewish books was a prelude to a mass arrest and deportation of the Jews themselves, most of whom perished in [[Auschwitz]].

===André Malraux's manuscript (by the Gestapo)===
During [[World War II]] the French writer and anti-Nazi resistance fighter [[André Malraux]] worked on a long novel, ''The Struggle Against the Angel'', the manuscript of which was destroyed by the Gestapo upon his capture in 1944. The name was apparently inspired by the [[Jacob]] story in the Bible. A surviving opening part named ''The Walnut Trees of Altenburg'', was published after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacoue-Labarth|first1=Philippe|title=Ending and Unending Agony: On Maurice Blanchot|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780823264599|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Various libraries in Warsaw, Poland (during World War II)===

Much of [[Warsaw]], Poland was destroyed during World War II by the [[Nazi]]s: an approximated 85% of buildings, including 16,000,000 volumes. 10% of the buildings were destroyed in the [[Invasion of Poland]] that ignited the war in 1939, 15% in the reorganization of Warsaw and the first [[Warsaw Ghetto uprising]], 25% in the second and far more famous Uprising, and the last 35% due to systematic German actions after the Uprising was defeated. 14 libraries, not including the libraries in the [[University of Warsaw]] and the [[Warsaw Institute of Technology]] that were also razed, were completely burned to the ground. German ''Verbrennungskommandos'' (Burning detachments) were responsible for much of the [[Planned destruction of Warsaw#Burning of libraries|targeted attacks on libraries]] and other centers of knowledge and learning.

In October 1944, the [[National Library of Poland]]'s manuscript collection was burned to erase [[History of Poland|Polish national history]].

Part of the [[Krasiński Library]]'s building was destroyed in September 1939, leading to its collections, which had almost all survived, being moved in 1941. In September 1944, an original collection of 250,000 items was shelled by German artillery, although many books were saved by being thrown out the windows by library staff. In October, what had survived was deliberately burned by the authorities, including 26,000 manuscripts, 2,500 [[incunable]]s (printed before 1501), 80,000 early printed books, 100,000 drawings and printmakings, 50,000 note and theatre manuscripts, and many maps and atlases.

The [[Załuski Library]] – established in 1747 and thus the oldest [[public library]] in Poland and one of the oldest and most important libraries in Europe – was burned down during the Uprising in October 1944. Out of about 400,000 printed items, maps and [[manuscript]]s, only some 1800 manuscripts and 30,000 printed materials survived. Unlike earlier Nazi book burnings where specific books were deliberately targeted, the burning of this library was part of the general setting on fire of a large part of the city of Warsaw.

The extensive library of the [[Polish Museum, Rapperswil]], founded in 1870 in [[Rapperswil]], Switzerland, had been created when Poland was not a country and was thus moved to Warsaw in 1927. In September 1939, the National Polish Museum in Rapperswil along with the Polish School at Batignolles, lost almost their entire collection during the German bombardment of Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stam|first1=David|title=International Dictionary of Library Histories|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136777844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Douai Municipal Library===

on August 11, 1944, the [[Bibliothèque municipale de Douai]], France, was burned in an Allied bombing of the city following the [[Normandy landings]]. The library had been founded by [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1767 and included many rare and valuable books. Also destroyed in the fire were many of the former holdings of the [[University of Douai]] and the collections of the Jesuits of the College of [[Anchin Abbey|Anchin]], both of which had been transferred to the Municipal Library during the [[French Revolution]].

===Books in German libraries (by World War II Allied bomber planes)===

As a consequence a list was drawn up of over 30,000 titles, ranging from school textbooks to poetry, which were then banned. All copies of books on the list were to be confiscated and destroyed; the possession of a book on the list was made a punishable offence. All the millions of copies of these books were to be confiscated and destroyed. The representative of the Military Directorate admitted that the order was no different in intent or execution from [[Nazi book burnings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776847,00.html |title=GERMANY: Read No Evil |website=TIME.com |date=May 27, 1946 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; All confiscated literature was reduced to pulp instead of burning. In August 1946 the order was amended so that "In the interest of research and scholarship, the Zone Commanders (in Berlin the Komendantura) may preserve a limited number of documents prohibited in paragraph 1. These documents will be kept in special accommodation where they may be used by German scholars and other German persons who have received permission to do so from the Allies only under strict supervision by the Allied Control Authority.

Following the suppression of the pro-Soviet Kurdish [[Republic of Mahabad]] in north [[Iran]] in December 1946 and January 1947, members of the victorious Iranian Army burned all [[Kurdish language|Kurdish-language]] books that they could find, as well as closing down the Kurdish printing press and banning the teaching of Kurdish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sami Moubayed,|title=Roots of the Kurdish struggle run deep|date=November 3, 2007|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/IK03Ak01.html|website=Atimes.com|accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic book burnings, 1948===
In 1948, children – overseen by priests, teachers, and parents – publicly burned several hundred comic books in both [[Spencer, West Virginia]], and [[Binghamton, New York]].

In 1953 United States Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] recited before his subcommittee and the press a list of supposedly pro-communist authors whose works his aide [[Roy Cohn]] found in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] libraries in Europe. The Eisenhower State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves "material by any controversial persons, Communists, [[fellow traveler]]s, etc." Some libraries burned the newly forbidden books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/espionage/Lo-Mo/McCarthyism.html|title=McCarthyism|last=PATTERSON HYDER|first=JOSEPH|date=|website=faqs.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Dwight D.

===Memoirs of Yrjö Leino (By Finnish government, under Soviet pressure)===

[[Yrjö Leino]], a [[Communist]] activist, was [[Finland]]'s Minister of the Interior in the crucial 1945–1948 period. In 1948 he suddenly resigned for reasons which remain unclear and went into retirement. Leino returned to the public eye in 1958 with his memoirs of his time as Minister of the Interior. The manuscript was prepared in secret – even most of the staff of the publishing company [[Tammi (publishing company)|Tammi]] were kept in ignorance – but the project was revealed by Leino because of an indiscretion just before the planned publication. It turned out the [[Soviet Union]] was very strongly opposed to publication of the memoirs. The Soviet Union's [[Chargé d'affaires]] in Finland Ivan Filippov (Ambassador Viktor Lebedev had suddenly departed from Finland a few weeks earlier on October 21, 1958) demanded that Prime Minister [[Karl-August Fagerholm]]'s government prevent the release of Leino's memoirs. Fagerholm said that the government could legally do nothing, because the work had not yet been released nor was there censorship in Finland. Filippov advised that if Leino's book was published, the Soviet Union would draw "serious conclusions". Later the same day Fagerholm called the publisher, Untamo Utrio, and it was decided that the January launch of the book was to be cancelled. Eventually, the entire print run of the book was destroyed at the Soviet Union's request. Almost all of the books – some 12,500 copies – were burned in August 1962 with the exception of a few volumes which were furtively sent to political activists. Deputy director of Tammi Jarl Hellemann later argued that the fuss about the book was completely disproportionate to its substance, describing the incident as the first instance of Finnish self-censorship motivated by concerns about relations to the Soviet Union (see [[Finlandization]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hellemann, Jarl: ''Kustantajan näkökulma – kirjoituksia kirjallisuuden reunalta'', s. 56–60. Otava 1999, Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was finally published in 1991, when interest in it had largely dissipated.

===Wilhelm Reich's publications (by U.S. Food and Drug Administration)===
{{Main|Wilhelm Reich}}
Noted [[psychiatrist]] Wilhelm Reich was prosecuted in 1954, following an investigation by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] in connection with his use of [[orgone]] accumulators. Reich refused to defend himself, and a federal judge ordered all of his orgone energy equipment and publications to be seized and destroyed. In June 1956, federal agents burned many of the books at Reich's estate near [[Rangeley, Maine]]. Later that year, and in March 1960, an additional 6&amp;nbsp;tons of Reich's books, journals and papers were burned in a public [[incinerator]] in New York.&lt;ref name="IDP"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/reich-wilhelm Reich, Wilhelm (1897–1957)], ''International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''&lt;/ref&gt; Reich died of heart failure while in federal prison in November 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/06_06_update.html#50 The Wilhelm Reich Museum: The burning of Reich's Publications]({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721073150/http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/06_06_update.html |date=July 21, 2011 |title=http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/06_06_update.html#50 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Algiers library (by OAS) ===

On June 7, 1962 the [[Organisation Armée Secrète]] (OAS), the movement of [[Pied-Noir|French colonists]] opposing Algerian independence, set fire to the [[University of Algiers]] library building, destroying about 500,000 books.&lt;ref&gt;n incendie criminel ravage l'universite, plusieurs autres batiments publics sont de ́truit', LeMonde(June 9, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; The burning of the library was considered either part of a desperate last-ditch effort to prevent Algerian independence – which was to be finally clinched a month later in the [[Algerian independence referendum, 1962|Algerian independence referendum]] – or as a savage [[scorched earth]] tactic intended to deny cultural resources to the future independent Algeria. The burning of the university library sent shock waves, especially across the Arab world. The effect on other countries in the region can be seen through commemorative stamps. Egypt, Iraq, Jordan (and Algeria itself, after independence) introduced stamps depicting either the burning of a book, or of the library itself.&lt;ref&gt;Fleury, Georges.

===Religious, Anti-Communist and Genealogy books (in the Cultural Revolution)===
It is the [[Chinese tradition]] to record family members in a book, including every male born in the family, who they are married to, etc. Traditionally, only males' names are recorded in the books. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), many such books were forcibly destroyed or burned to ashes, because they were considered by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] as among the [[Four olds|Four Old Things]] to be eschewed.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, Chihua. Madsen, Richard P. [1995] (1995). ''The Red Mirror: Children of China's Cultural Revolution''. Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-2488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also many copies of classical works of Chinese literature were destroyed, though – unlike the genealogy books – these usually existed in many copies, some of which survived. Many copies of the [[Buddhist]], [[Taoist]] and [[Confucian]] books were destroyed, thought to be promoting the "old" thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iws.punahou.edu/user/cshigemitsu/worldlit/dialogues/2/ChineseCulturalRevolution.htm|title=Chinese Cultural Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=punahou.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Chinese Communist Party|last=Sullivan|first=Lawrence R.|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2012|isbn=9780810872257|location=|pages= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the British publishing house [[Penguin Books]] was torn by an intense power struggle, with chief editor [[Tony Godwin]] and the board of directors attempting to remove the company founder [[Allen Lane]]. One of the acts taken by Lane in an effort to retain his position was to steal and burn the entire print run of the English edition of ''Massacre'' by the French cartoonist [[Siné]], whose content was reportedly "deeply offensive".&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by Lane biographer Jeremy Lewis on BBC Radio in 2010, http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b00tjrgz&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beatles Burnings – Southern USA, 1966===

[[John Lennon]], member of the popular music group [[The Beatles]], sparked outrage from religious conservatives in the Southern 'Bible Belt' states when his quote '[[More popular than Jesus|The Beatles are more popular than Jesus]]' was taken out of context from an interview he had done in England five months previous to the Beatles' 1966 US Tour (their final tour as a group). Disc Jockeys, evangelists, and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] implored the local public to bring their Beatles records, books, magazines, posters and memorabilia to Beatles bonfire burning events.

In 1987, the [[Nasir-i Khusraw]] Foundation was established in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan due to the collaborative efforts of several civil society and academic institutions, leading scholars and members of the [[Ismaili]] community. This site included video and book publishing facilities, a museum, and a library.&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; The library was a marvel in its extensive collection of fifty-five thousand books, available to all students and researchers, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Pashto. In addition, its Persian collection was unparalleled – including an extremely rare 12th-century manuscript of [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi]]'s epic masterpiece ''The Book of Kings ([[Shāhnāma]])''. The Ismaili collection of the library housed works from [[Hasan-i Sabbah]] and [[Nasir-i Khusraw]], and the seals of the first [[Aga Khan]]. With the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan in the late 1980s and the strengthening of the [[Taliban]] forces, the library collection was relocated to the valley of [[Kayan Baghlan|Kayan]]. However, on August 12, 1998, the Taliban fighters ransacked the press, the museum, the video facilities and the library, destroying some books in the fire and throwing others in a nearby river.

The protest was interrupted by the Kansas City Fire Department on the grounds that Wayne and Leathem had failed to obtain the required permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/books/05/28/bookburning.ap/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Bookstore owner burns books in protest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603015331/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/books/05/28/bookburning.ap/index.html |archivedate=June 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testaments in city of Or Yehuda, Israel===
In May 2008, a "fairly large" number of New Testaments were burned in [[Or Yehuda]], Israel. Conflicting accounts have the deputy mayor of Or Yehuda, Uzi Aharon (of [[Haredi]] party [[Shas]]), claiming to have organized the burnings or to have stopped them. He admitted involvement in collecting New Testaments and "Messianic propaganda" that had been distributed in the city. The burning apparently violated Israeli laws about destroying religious items.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bixler, "[http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/05/28/bible.burning/index.html Hundreds of New Testaments torched in Israel]", CNN (May 28, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jakes]] and most musical genres to be heretical expressions.

===National Archives of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2014)===
[[File:Predsjedništvo BiH.JPG|thumb|[[Building of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which hosted the part of the Archives that was burnt.]]
During the [[2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], large amounts of historical documents were destroyed when sections of the Archives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, housed in the presidential building, were set on fire. Among the lost archival material were documents and gifts from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, original documents from the 1878–1918 [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as well as documentations of the interwar period, the 1941–1945 rule of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], papers from the following years, and about 15000 files from the 1996–2003 [[Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref name=tportalhr&gt;{{cite news|title=Ogromna šteta, dio dokumentacije nepovratno uništen|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/svijet/315554/Ogromna-steta-dio-dokumentacije-nepovratno-unisten.html|accessdate=February 19, 2014|newspaper=tportal.hr|date=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=13febB92&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepovratno uništen deo Arhiva BiH|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=13&amp;nav_category=167&amp;nav_id=811808|accessdate=February 19, 2014|newspaper=B92|date=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the repositories that were burnt, about 60 percent of the material was lost, according to estimates by Šaban Zahirović, the head of the Archives.&lt;ref name=60posto&gt;{{cite news|title=Direktor Arhiva BiH tvrdi: Izgorjelo je 60 posto depoa |url=http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/direktor-arhiva-bih-tvrdi-izgorjelo-je-60-posto-depoa |accessdate=February 17, 2014 |newspaper=Oslobođenje |date=February 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223013526/http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/direktor-arhiva-bih-tvrdi-izgorjelo-je-60-posto-depoa |archivedate=February 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both were also mandated to report to the police once every week.&lt;ref name=BiHsud/&gt;

===''The Hindus: An Alternative History'' (under court order in India)===

''[[The Hindus: An Alternative History]]'' by American [[Indologist]] [[Wendy Doniger]] was originally highly successful in India. According to the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', ''The Hindus'' was a No. 1 bestseller in its non-fiction category in the week of October 15, 2009. However, the author's proclaimed aim of setting "an alternative to the narrative of Hindu history" aroused controversy and the anger of more conservative Hindu groups. In February 2014, litigation was started against the book on the grounds of its being "deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage the feelings of a religious community." As a result, the publisher – [[Penguin Books]]' Indian subsidiary, "Penguin India" – was obliged to withdraw the book from circulation and destroy all remaining copies within six months. The court order was not completely carried out; some bookshops in India are known to be still selling it, wrapped in brown envelopes.

'''Lotoko''', also known by the slang term "pétrole", is a home-distilled alcoholic drink or "[[moonshine]]" in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].  

Lotoko is usually made from [[maize]], but sometimes from [[cassava]] or [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. Heads of corn are cut up and boiled into a mash which is then fermented and distilled using improvised [[still]]s made from cut down [[Drum (container)|oil drums]]. Because of the woody core of the cobs of corn, the alcohol produced contains high levels of [[methanol]] which is toxic. Although it is officially banned, because of its high alcohol content (over 50%), its production is widespread in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Lotoko made from cassava or plantains doesn't carry the same methanol risk. 

Lotoko production, being a cottage industry, is very low-tech. It provides its mainly female producers with a degree of financial independence. 

Local NGOs have expressed concern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grioo.com/info10603.html Le "Lotoko", un alcool indigène dangereux pour la santé des Kinois] [Lotoko, an indigenous alcoholic drink that's dangerous to the health of Kinshasans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buveurs.com/La-boisson-indigene-Lotoko-un-danger-pour-la-sante La boisson indigène Lotoko, un danger pour la santé] [An indigenous drink, Lotoko, is a health hazard]&lt;/ref&gt; as to its health effects in the communities of [[Kinshasa]], where it costs 200 to 300 FC, compared to 600 FC for commercially brewed beers.

==Etymology==
Lotoko is a [[Lingala]] word and is known country-wide.

The exact number of Indigenous women and girls who have gone missing or have been murdered in Canada since the 1970s is uncertain, with estimates ranging from approximately 1,000 to nearly 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/politics/mmiw-4000-hajdu-1.3450237|title=Minister's comment highlights confusion over missing, murdered women numbers|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to activists, the Canadian government funded data collection on missing and murdered women, ending in 2010; the Native Women's Association of Canada has documented 582 cases since the 1960s, with 39% occurring after 2000. But advocacy groups say that many more women have been missing, with the highest number of cases in British Columbia. Some notable cases have included 19 women killed in the [[Highway of Tears murders]], and up to 49 women, many of whom were indigenous, murdered by [[Robert Pickton]].

Responding to repeated calls of Indigenous groups, other activists, and [[non-governmental organization]]s, the Government of Canada under Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] established the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/en/about-us/|title=About Us — National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls|website=National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls|access-date=2017-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423153818/http://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/en/about-us|archive-date=2018-04-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
As a group that has been "socially, economically, and politically marginalized",&lt;ref name="Harper, Anita 2006"&gt;Harper, Anita (Winter 2006). "Is Canada Peaceful and Safe for Aboriginal Women?". ''Canadian Woman Studies''. '''25''': 33–38&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous women have been frequent targets for hatred and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Anita (Winter 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Underlying factors such as poverty and homelessness contribute to their victimization, as do historical factors such as racism, sexism, and the legacy of colonialism. The trauma caused by abuses under Canada's [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school system]] also likely plays a role.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/06/the-vanishing-of-canadas-first-nations-women-harper-trudeau-violence-highway-of-tears-indigenous/|title=The Vanishing of Canada's First Nations Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous women are between 3 and 3.5 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than other women,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/en/background/|title=Background|last=|first=|date=|website=National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls|access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2011001/article/11439-eng.htm#a1|title=Violent victimization of Aboriginal women in the Canadian provinces, 2009|website=www.statcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the violence they face is often more severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2011001/article/11439-eng.htm|title=Violent victimization of Aboriginal women in the Canadian provinces, 2009|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Canada does not maintain a database for missing people, which makes it difficult to determine the rate at which Indigenous women are murdered or go missing, or to compare their data to those of other populations. In addition, various groups have collected data from different periods of time and different criteria. Available data suggests, however, that the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women is disproportionately high compared to their percentage of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women and Girls|url=http://www.nwac.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Fact_Sheet_Missing_and_Murdered_Aboriginal_Women_and_Girls.pdf|website=Native Women's Association of Canada|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Indigenous women and girls make up only 4% of the female population in Canada, they represented 16% of all female homicides in Canada between 1980 and 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  A 2011 Statistics Canada report estimated that Indigenous women are seven times more likely than other women to be victims of a homicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-503-x/2010001/article/11442-eng.pdf Vivian O’Donnell and Susan Wallace, ''Women in Canada: A Gender based Statistical Report: First Nations, Inuit and Métis Women'' (Statistics Canada, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty.ca"&gt;https://www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/iwfa_submission_amnesty_international_february_2014_-_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 study by the province of Saskatchewan&amp;nbsp;– the only province to have systematically reviewed its missing persons files for cases involving Indigenous women&amp;nbsp;– Indigenous women were found to have made up 6% of the province's population, and 60% of the province's missing women cases.&lt;ref name="sask"&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.sk.ca/adx/aspx/adxGetMedia.aspx?DocID=3025,104,81,1,Documents&amp;MediaID=1615&amp;Filename=missing-persons-final.pdf ''Saskatchewan Provincial Partnership Committee on Missing Persons, Final Report'', October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of missing and murdered Indigenous women is unclear. A 2014 report by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], ordered by the [[Stephen Harper]] administration, stated 1,181 Indigenous women were killed or went missing across the country between 1980 and 2012.&lt;ref name="rcmp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/mmaw-faapd-eng.htm|title=RCMP Report 2014|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510113547/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/mmaw-faapd-eng.htm|archivedate=2016-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With government funding, the [[Native Women's Association of Canada]] (NWAC) had documented 582 cases of missing and murdered Aboriginal women from the 1960s to 2010,&lt;ref name="humwatch"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/canada0213webwcover_0.pdf ''Those Who Take Us Away''], Human Rights Watch, 2013, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; but they believe there are many more. Of the cases analyzed by the RCMP, 67% were murder victims, 20% were missing persons, 4% were suspicious deaths, and 9% were unknown.&lt;ref name="rcmp"/&gt;

In 2016 [[Patricia Hajdu]], the Canadian minister for the status of women, suggested that the total number of missing and murdered Indigenous women could be closer to 4,000. She was basing her statement on information supplied by NWAC and originally collected by the Walk 4 Justice initiative. She said that historically there had been underreporting by law enforcement of cases of murdered or missing Indigenous women.

"Gladys Radek, co-founder of Walk 4 Justice, said her group collected the names while speaking to people during a trek across Canada in 2008. They stopped collecting information in 2011." Further, "When CBC News contacted one of the activists who supplied NWAC with the information, she said "roughly 60 to 70 per cent" of the 4,000 or so people on her list were Indigenous."&lt;ref name=Tasker/&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty14"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/iwfa_submission_amnesty_international_february_2014_-_final.pdf ''VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS IN CANADA: A SUMMARY OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S CONCERNS AND CALL TO ACTION - February 2014'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian4000&gt;{{cite web|last=Guardian Staff |first= |title=A Canadian government minister has suggested that as many as 4,000 indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered over the past three decades|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-in-canada-could-number-4000 |website=[[The Guardian]]|date= 16 Feb 2016|accessdate=23 Oct 2017 |quote=Walk 4 Justice initiative had collected at least 4,232 names of missing or murdered indigenous women}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tasker&gt;{{cite web|last=Tasker |first=John Paul |title=Confusion reigns over number of missing, murdered indigenous women - RCMP said 1,017 indigenous women were killed between 1980 and 2012;, activists say it's closer to 4,000.  |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mmiw-4000-hajdu-1.3450237 |website=[[CBC News]]|date= 16 Feb 2016|accessdate=15 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBC News|CBC]] in 2016 investigated accounts of unsolved cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women, creating an interactive database that now numbers more than 300 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/missingandmurdered/?profileID=karina-wolfe|title=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women|website=www.cbc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBC investigated 34 cases in which families disagreed with authorities' determination that no foul play was involved; it found "suspicious circumstances, unexplained bruises and other factors that suggest further investigation is warranted".&lt;ref name="unsolved"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/unresolved-cases-of-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-1.3651516 Holly Moore, Martha Troian, "'No foul play' found in deaths of dozens of Indigenous women, but questions remain"], CBC News, 28 Jun 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Details of 2014 RCMP investigation and update===
In late 2013, the Commissioner of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) initiated a study of reported cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women across all police jurisdictions in Canada. The 2014 report found that there were 1,181 incidents of female homicides and unresolved missing Indigenous females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Overview|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/mmaw-faapd-eng.htm|website=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Overview|publisher=RCMP|accessdate=19 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510113547/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/mmaw-faapd-eng.htm|archivedate=10 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 1,181 incidents, there were 225 unsolved cases between 1980 and 2012; 80% of all female homicides (Indigenous and non-Indigenous) are solved. RCMP statistics were updated in 2015, showing murder rates and the percentage solved (80%) to be essentially unchanged. The RCMP does not collect figures from the 300 non-RCMP police agencies in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/missing-and-murdered-aboriginal-women-2015-update-national-operational-overview#exec|title=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: 2015 Update to the National Operational Overview - Royal Canadian Mounted Police|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted|last=Police|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Highway of Tears" refers to the 700-kilometer stretch of [[British Columbia Highway 16|Highway 16]] from [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], British Columbia, which since 1969 has been the site of the murder and disappearance of a number of mainly Indigenous women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/crime-justice/cold-cases-unsolved-crimes-in-canada/bcs-infamous-highway-of-tears.html|title=BC's infamous 'Highway of Tears'|last=Lee|first=Miyoung |date=November 17, 2009|work=CBC Digital Archives|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/07/10/canada-s-highway-of-tears-why-are-women-disappearing.html Highway of Vanishing Women]", ''[[Daily Beast]]'', July 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harper, Anita 2006"/&gt; Government organizations and Indigenous organizations have different estimates of the number of victims along the highway, with police identifying 18 murders and disappearances, 13 of them teenagers, and other organizations placing the number as closer to 40.&lt;ref name=HRW2013&gt;Human Rights Watch, 2013, "Those Who Take Us Away: Abusive Policing and Failures in Protection of Indigenous Women and Girls in Northern British Columbia, Canada". https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/canada0213webwcover_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A reason for this numerical discrepancy is that for a disappearance or murder to be included in the RCMP’s [[E-Pana]] project statistics, the RCMP requires for the crime to have happened within a mile of Highway 16, 97, or 5; their count rejects all cases that take place elsewhere along the route.&lt;ref name=HRW2013/&gt;  

Many people hitchhike along this stretch of highway because they do not own cars and there is a lack of public transit. The Highway of Tears murders has led to initiatives by the British Columbia government to dissuade women from hitchhiking, such as billboards along the highway warning women of the potential risks.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Katherine (2016). "HITCHHIKING AND MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN: A CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF BILLBOARDS ON THE HIGHWAY OF TEARS". ''Canadian Journal of Sociology''. '''41''': 299–325.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous documentaries have focused on the victims associated with this highway. The Canadian media often refer to the highway in coverage of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and [[Two-spirit|Two-Spirit people]] in Canada.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

The RCMP in British Columbia launched [[Highway of Tears murdered and missing#Project E-Pana|Project E-Pana]] in 2005, in response to the Highway of Tears crisis. It initiated an investigation of 9 murdered women, launching a task force in 2006. In 2007 it added an additional 9 cases, which include cases of both murdered and missing women along Highways 16, 97 and 5. The task force consists of more than 50 investigators, and cases include those from the years 1969 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bc.cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=1525|title=Project E-PANA: Missing Women (photos)|publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia|language=en|access-date=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canadian National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls==
[[File:Justin Trudeau speech on missing and murdered indigenous women – Ottawa, October 2016.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister of Canada, [[Justin Trudeau]], giving a speech on missing and murdered Indigenous women in front of Parliament in Ottawa in October 2016.]]
After the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 Canadian federal election]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Government]] upheld their campaign promise and announced the initiation of a national inquiry on December 8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government of Canada: National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1448633299414/1448633350146|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian government had pre-inquiry meetings with a variety of people including families, front-line workers, representatives of the provinces and Indigenous organizations from December 2015 through February 2016, in order to determine how to structure the inquiry. The mandate of the inquiry and the projected length of time of the inquiry were published August 3, 2016. The estimated cost is $53.8 million. In addition, the government announced $16.17 million over four years to create family information liaison units in each province and territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1448633299414/1448633350146|title=National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls|first=Government of Canada; Indigenous and Northern Affairs|last=Canada|website=[[Indigenous Services Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquiry was established as independent from the Government of Canada, and five commissioners were appointed to oversee the independent inquiry process: [[Marion Buller]] (chief commissioner), [[Michèle Audette]], Qajaq Robinson, Marilyn Poitras, and Brian Eyolfson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1470141223313/1470141325236|title=About the commissioners|last=|first=|date=October 11, 2016|website=Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806050756/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1470141223313/1470141325236|archive-date=2016-08-06|dead-url=yes|access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interim report was expected from the Inquiry in November 2017. The initial conclusion date for the inquiry was set as December 31, 2018; however, in May 2017 the Chief Commissioner of the inquiry said the inquiry might seek an extension from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mmiwg-media-avail-criticism-1.4124463|title=MMIWG chief commissioner still has 'hope' despite rocky start|last=Tasker|first=John Paul|date=May 19, 2017|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first public hearing in April 2017, complaints by observers started to arise about the inquiry's terms of reference, its composition and administration, and a perceived lack of transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/canadas-mmiw-inquiry-is-falling-apart-before-it-even-begins/|title=Canada's MMIW inquiry is falling apart before it even begins|work= Macleans|date=8 May 2017|publisher=macleans.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence was taken from 50 witnesses during the first hearings at [[Whitehorse, Yukon Territory]], over three days in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/mmiwg-whitehorse-first-hearings-wrap-1.4142419|title=Missing and murdered inquiry wraps emotional 1st hearings in Whitehorse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She said in her resignation letter to the Prime Minister,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear to me that I am unable to perform my duties as a commissioner with the process designed in its current structure&amp;nbsp;... I believe this opportunity to engage community on the place and treatment of Indigenous women is extremely important and necessary.

On August 8, 2017, Waneek Horn-Miller, the inquiry's director of community relations, stepped down,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/indigenous-inquiry-mmiwg-1.4238881|title=MMIWG loses another key staffer as families slam 'colonial' inquiry process, demand hard reset|website=[[CBC News]]|access-date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on October 8, 2017, [[CBC News]] reported that the Inquiry's lead lawyer and research director had also resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/another-staffer-resigns-mmiwg-inquiry-1.4345757|title=MMIWG inquiry losing 2 more staffers|first=Austin|last=Grabish|date=October 8, 2017|work=[[CBC News]]|access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 the Inquiry announced the last of its public hearing dates, following which the commissioners will write a final report and submit recommendations to the Canadian government by April 30, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aptnnews.ca/2018/10/10/national-mmiwg-inquiry-sets-dates-for-final-submissions/|title=National MMIWG Inquiry sets dates for final submissions - APTN News|date=2018-10-10|work=APTN News|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== US Initiatives ==
Activism and proposed legislation has drawn the issue of MMIW to the attention of some lawmakers.&lt;ref name=Heitcamp/&gt; Currently, the federal laws surrounding violent crimes create difficulties in dealing with non-Native perpetrators on native lands.&lt;ref name=NIJ&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nij.gov/journals/277/Pages/violence-against-american-indians-alaska-natives.aspx#table2|title=Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women and Men|website=National Institute of Justice|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heitcamp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bachman&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronet Bachman, Heather Zaykowski, Rachel Kallmyer, Margarita Poteyeva, Christina Lanier|date=|title=Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women and the Criminal Justice Response: What is Known|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/223691.pdf|journal=US Department of Justice|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Supreme Court ruling in ''Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe'' (1978) tribal courts do not hold any jurisdictional powers over non-American Indians and Alaska Natives, and therefore cannot prosecute or punish them for their crimes. Additionally, the Indian Civil Rights Act (1968) limits the maximum punishment for any crime to a $5000 fine and up to one year in prison.&lt;ref name=Bachman/&gt; All violent felonies committed on tribal lands are prosecuted by the federal government. This continues to raise problems as law enforcement departments must compete over jurisdictional powers based on the nature of the crime, lowering the overall effectiveness of law enforcement, and providing enough immunity to non-citizens of the tribes (usually members of the dominant culture) for these crimes to become commonplace.&lt;ref name=Bachman/&gt;

=== National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls ===
On May 5th the US has declared a national day of awareness in order to raise concern for the crisis, and refocus attention on issues affecting Indigenous women with the hopes of improving relations between the federal and tribal governments. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/blog/recognizing-national-day-awareness-missing-and-murdered-native-women-and-girls|title=Recognizing the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls|date=2018-05-04|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Washington State House Bill 2951 ===
Effective May 7, 2018, this bill orders an inquiry into how to increase rates of reporting for missing Native American women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=2951&amp;Year=2017&amp;BillNumber=2951&amp;Year=2017|title=Washington State Legislature|website=apps2.leg.wa.gov|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women's Memorial March ===
The first [[Women's Memorial March]] was on February 14, 1991, in [[Downtown Eastside]], [[Vancouver]], which had numerous missing or murdered Indigenous women.&lt;ref name="Ajik"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://womensmemorialmarch.wordpress.com/|title=26th Annual Feb 14th Women's Memorial March|website=Feb 14th Annual Women's Memorial March|publisher=Ajik|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The march was in response to the murder of a [[Coast Salish]] woman.&lt;ref name="Ajik" /&gt;  The annual marches were intended to commemorate Indigenous women who have been murdered or have gone missing to build support for a national inquiry and program of response. In 2016 the government announced it would undertake such an inquiry. During the Vancouver march, the committee and public stop at the sites where the women were last seen, or murdered, holding a moment of silence as a sign of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/women-s-memorial-march-in-vancouver-attracts-hundreds-1.2957930|title=Women's memorial march in Vancouver attracts hundreds|website=CBC News British Columbia|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee has drawn attention to the issue locally, nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name="Annual Women's Memorial March"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2653830572|title=Annual Women's Memorial March|website=CBC Player|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee is made up of family members, front-line workers, close friends, and loved ones who have suffered the losses of Indigenous women during recent decades.&lt;ref name="Ajik" /&gt;

This event has expanded and as of 2017, was held annually on Valentine's Day in more than 22 communities across North America.  The march aims to break down barriers and raise awareness about racial stereotypes and stigmas that contribute to the high rate of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/news/867271/why-way-we-remember-missing-and-murdered-women-downtown-eastside-matters|title=Why the way we remember missing and murdered women of the Downtown Eastside matters|last=Siebert|first=Amanda|date=February 9, 2017|newspaper=The Georgia Straight|access-date=February 10, 2017|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sisters in Spirit Vigils ===
In 2002 the [[Native Women's Association of Canada]] (NWAC), [[Amnesty International]] Canada, [[KAIROS]], [[Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies|Elizabeth Fry Society]], and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] formed the [[National Coalition for our Stolen Sisters]], an initiative designed to raise awareness about the MMIW crisis in Canada. In 2005 Indigenous women founded Sisters in Spirit, a research, education and policy program run by Indigenous women, with a focus on raising awareness about violence against Indigenous women, girls, and [[two-spirit]] persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nwac.ca/home/policy-areas/violence-prevention-and-safety/sisters-in-spirit/|title=Sisters In Spirit - NWAC|work=NWAC|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sisters in Spirit collected the details of almost 600 cases of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Canada, including some historical cases that were not accepted by police, and cases where police closed the book on a woman's death despite lingering questions from family members.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/news/2010/11/sisters-spirit-program-used-feds-squeeze-native-womens-association-canada|title=Sisters in Spirit program used by feds to 'squeeze' Native Women's Association of Canada {{!}} rabble.ca|website=rabble.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first database of its kind in Canada in terms of its detail and scope, however the federal government stopped funding the program in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aptnnews.ca/2010/12/01/need-for-action-behind-funding-cut-to-sisters-in-spirit-cabinet-ministers-letter-2/|title=Need for 'action' behind funding cut to Sisters in Spirit: cabinet ministers' letter - APTN News|date=2010-12-01|work=APTN News|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the cut say it was meant to silence the Native Women's Association of Canada, the group behind the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, Sisters in Spirit vigils continue to be held across Canada every year on the 4th of October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/sisters-spirit-sudbury-1.4331297|title=Indigenous women and girls face 'internal terrorism,' says Sudbury vigil organizer|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She told [[CTV News]] that "a friend of hers, who is also an aboriginal, explained that red was the only colour spirits could see.

=== ''Walking with Our Sisters''===
[[File:Walking With Our Sisters Shingwauk Auditorium 2014.jpg|thumb|''Walking with Our Sisters'' exhibition in the Shingwauk Auditorium at Algoma University in 2014]]
''[[Walking with Our Sisters]]'' is a community-based art installation, commemorating murdered or missing women and children from Indigenous communities. The project is community-led, from the creation of the piece to the facilitation of the exhibit at different sites. The hope is to raise awareness on this issue and create a space for dialogue-based community discussions on this issue. It is a solely volunteer initiative.

The art project is a collection of vamps from [[moccasins]]. A vamp is the extra layer of leather for the top lip of the moccasin. The installation has more than 1763 pairs of adult vamps and 108 pairs for children. Each pair is authentic and custom made for each individual woman reported missing. The vamps represent the unfinished lives of the missing or murdered women.

The project began in 2012, with a call to action issued on [[Facebook]]. People were asked to design and create moccasin tops. By July 2013, the project leaders had received 1,600 vamps, more than tripling their initial goal of 600. Men, women, and children of all races responded to the call and became active in the project.

This installation consists of vamps placed on the floor of a public space. It travels to select galleries and art exhibition halls. Patrons are asked to take off their shoes and walk alongside the vamps in the gallery, to ensure that the people they represent are not forgotten and to show solidarity with the missing or murdered women. Booked until 2019, the installation is scheduled for 25 locations across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walking With Our Sisters|url=http://walkingwithoursisters.ca/|website=Walking With Our Sisters|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faceless Dolls Project ===
Begun by the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) in 2012, the Faceless Dolls Project consists of making dolls to represent missing and murdered women, and those affected by violence.&lt;ref name="dolls"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/scene/other/2012/04/16/faceless-dolls-project-gives-voice-to-missing-and-murdered-aborginal-women/|title="Faceless Dolls Project" gives voice to missing and murdered Aborginal women|last=Morrisseau|first=Miles|date=April 16, 2012|newspaper=CBC Manitoba|access-date=February 14, 2017|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dolls are designed as "a process of reconstructing identity" for women who lose individuality in becoming victims of crime. The first dolls were made to commemorate the 582 MMIW documented by the Association. They are intended as an artistic reminder of the lives and identities of the affected women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thewesternstar.com/news/local/2016/2/2/murdered-women-recognized-in-faceless-do-4424056.html|title=Murdered women recognized in Faceless Doll presentation|last=Gale|first=Frank|date=February 3, 2016|newspaper=The Western Star|access-date=February 14, 2017|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; NWAC has brought this art project to universities and communities across Canada, where participants join in making dolls as a form of activism and raising awareness of the issue of MMIW.&lt;ref name="dolls"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/2014/08/20/faceless-doll-project-remembering-victims|title=FACELESS DOLL PROJECT: Remembering victims|last=Ruby|first=Michelle|date=August 20, 2014|newspaper=Brantford Expositor|access-date=February 14, 2017|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female inuksuit===
Since late 2015 Kristen Villebrun, a local activist in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and about ten other Indigenous women have been constructing [[inuksuk|inuksuit]] on the Chedoke Radial Trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Windigo|first1=Delaney|title=Inuksuks along Hamilton hiking trail created to remember missing, murdered Indigenous women|url=http://aptn.ca/news/2015/11/12/inuksuks-along-hamilton-hiking-trail-created-to-remember-missing-murdered-Indigenous-women/|accessdate=11 December 2015|agency=Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|publisher=Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|date=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trail connects to the [[Chedoke Creek]], a watercourse in Hamilton. An inuksuk is a man-made stone structure commonly used for navigation or trail markers. ''Inuksuk'' translates to "in the likeness of a human".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an Inukshuk?|url=http://www.inukshukgallery.com/inukshuk.html|website=Inukshuk Gallery|publisher=Gallery Indigena|accessdate=11 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209150852/http://www.inukshukgallery.com/inukshuk.html|archive-date=2015-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women began the project in October 2015 when they noticed that shadows cast by previously constructed inuksuit on the trail were lifelike and reminiscent of women. These activists saw an opportunity to use these structures as a way of drawing attention to the issue of the missing women. They have constructed 1,181 inuksuit, working for six hours a day, four days a week. The project has attracted many questions, with hundreds of people stopping to inquire about the inuksuit. The women welcomed the questions, and they announced their intention to continue to build the female inuksuit until the government undertook an official inquiry into missing Indigenous women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Adam|title=Aboriginal women remembered with 1,181 inukshuks|url=http://www.rememberoursisterseverywhere.com/photo/missing-married-women|accessdate=11 December 2015|agency=CBC|publisher=Remember Our Sisters Everywhere|date=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would initiate such an inquiry.

In February 2016, Lucy Annanack ([[Nunavik]]) and a team of women built and placed another 1,200 inuksuit in [[Montreal]], Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=David|title=Nunavik woman spearheads Inuksuit campaign for Aboriginal women|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674nunavik_woman_spearheading_inuksuit_campaign_for_aboriginal_women/|accessdate=1 April 2017|work=Nunatsiaq Online|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Missing &amp; Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams?'' ===
In October 2016 journalist [[Connie Walker (journalist)|Connie Walker]] and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] launched a podcast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/webby-nominees-2017-1.4054424|title=Webby Awards: CBC's Missing &amp; Murdered podcast, NFB's Seances vie for online prize|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Who Killed Alberta Williams?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.flare.com/culture/meet-the-woman-behind-a-new-must-listen-podcast-on-canadas-mmiw/|title=Meet the Reporter Behind a New, Must-Listen Canadian Crime Podcast - Flare|date=2016-10-20|work=Flare|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight-part podcast examines the missing and murdered Indigenous women crisis in Canada though the lens of a specific case, the murder of Alberta Williams in 1989 along the [[Highway of Tears]] in British Columbia. The series was nominated for a [[Webby Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.flare.com/culture/meet-the-woman-behind-a-new-must-listen-podcast-on-canadas-mmiw/|title=Meet the Reporter Behind a New, Must-Listen Canadian Crime Podcast|last=Halushak|first=Maureen|date=October 20, 2016|work=Flare|access-date=December 21, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Big Green Sky ===
''Big Green Sky'' is a social justice play commissioned and produced by Windsor Feminist Theatre,  which debuted in May 2016 in Windsor Ontario.    It was prompted by the outrage over the acquittal of Bradley Barton in the trial of Cindy Gladue's murder.  This play is a direct result of reaching out to Muriel Stanley Venne,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indspire.ca/laureate/muriel-stanley-venne-2/|series=Indspire |title=Muriel Stanley Venne|website=indspire.ca|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chair of the Aboriginal Commission on Human Rights and Justice, and President of the Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women. Venne's report&lt;ref name="Venne_Anaya_2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaaw.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/UN-Presentation-Booklet-V11.pdf |format=PDF |title=Presentation to the United Nations For All the Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women of Canada|last=Stanley Venne|first=Muriel|date=October 2016|access-date=October 20, 2018 |publisher=[[Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women]] |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was submitted to United Nations rapporteur [[James Anaya]].  Venne created her report because she wanted to 'influence decision makers who have become very complacent and unconcerned about the lives of Indigenous women in our country."&lt;ref name="Venne_Anaya_2016"/&gt;

The playwright has created his heroine to be a Nigerian woman who moves to Northern Canada to see the Northern Lights and immerses herself in aboriginal culture. In this sense, members of the audience who are non-aboriginal are invited to take part in the journey of this "outsider" as she learns and uncovers the mysteries of murdered and missing aboriginal women. The title Big Green Sky comes from the display of the aurora borealis or Northern Lights.  Aboriginal interpretations include that the Northern Lights represent the spirits of the departed who are communicating with their loved ones.   The play will be gifted by WFT to any organization or individual wishing to bring awareness to this issue, and distributed without royalty fees, providing that all revenues/fundraising efforts be donated to local First Nations, Inuit or Métis women's initiatives.

The '''National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia''' is an [[United States|American]] [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] that is concerned with the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]].  According to the group's web site, its sole purpose is "to obtain the release of all prisoners, the fullest possible accounting for the missing and repatriation of all recoverable remains of those who died serving our nation during the [[Vietnam War]] in Southeast Asia."  The League's most prominent symbol is its famous [[POW/MIA flag]].

==History==

===Founding===

The League's origins date to groups created by [[Sybil Stockdale]] and a group of POW/MIA wives in [[Coronado, California]], as well as POW/MIA wives in the [[Hampton, Virginia]], area led by [[Evelyn Grubb]] and Mary Crowe, in 1967.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Grubb and Jose, ''You Are Not Forgotten'', {{Page needed|date=April 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wainwright, Loudon"&gt;{{cite news | author=Wainwright, Loudon | title=When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again - or doesn't | magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] | date= November 10, 1972 | authorlink= Loudon Wainwright, Jr. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-obit"&gt;{{cite news | title=Evelyn Grubb, 74; Advocated Humane Treatment for POWs of Vietnam Era | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date= January 4, 2006 | url= http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/04/local/me-grubb4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sybil Stockdale's husband, Navy Commander [[James Stockdale]], was shot down in 1965 and she was determined to make the American people aware of the mistreatment of U.S. POWs. Grubb and Crowe were frustrated with the lack of information from federal officials.&lt;ref name="nyt-obit"/&gt; It was these groups that finally convinced the U.S. government to change their official stance on the POW/MIA issue in 1969.&lt;ref name="Wainwright, Loudon"/&gt;  Eventually, the League was incorporated in [[Washington, D.C.]], on May 28, 1970.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wainwright, Loudon"/&gt;

Another notable member of the league during the war was [[Joe McCain]], brother of imprisoned U.S. Navy pilot and future U.S. Senator and presidential candidate [[John McCain]].&lt;ref&gt;McCain and Salter, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased national attention after 1972 ''Life'' magazine article===

The league gained increased international attention in 1972 when ''[[Life Magazine]]'' ran a feature article on the organization.&lt;ref name="Wainwright, Loudon"/&gt; The article started with a full page photograph of Major Wilmer Newlin Grubb of the United States Air Force, the husband of National League of Families President Evelyn Grubb, from after he had been shot down in 1966 and taken prisoner by the North Vietnamese Army.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wainwright, Loudon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-obit"/&gt; Evelyn Grubb by then was also serving as the League's representative to the [[White House]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[Paris Peace Talks]], pressing for better accountability, treatment and the speedy return of American MIA and POW soldiers, pilots, airmen, and sailors in the Vietnam War, as well as better policies related to their families.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Grubb did not find out until after the war was over that her husband had died shortly after being shot down.&lt;ref name="nyt-obit"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900EEDC1130F937A35752C0A9609C8B63| title = Evelyn Fowler Grubb, 74, Leader Of a Group Supporting P.O.W.'s| date = January 4, 2006| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation and adoption of "You Are Not Forgotten, POW/MIA" flag===

Then League President and POW wife [[Evelyn Grubb]] oversaw the development of the now-famous National League of Families' [[POW/MIA flag]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-obit"/&gt;  The flag's original design by military wife Haydn Anthony, was passed on to an ad agency and slightly modified by employee Newt Heisley, to represent America's missing men. The original design showed a POW crouched in a cage rather than the head of a POW now shown. Evelyn Grubb was then also a driving force in gaining the flags adoption by the military, the U.S. Postal Service and other federal service agencies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Eventually the flag became widely popular and adoption of its use began to spread on its own, as the flag became a national symbol of Vietnam war remembrance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The flag, with the now widely recognized "You Are Not Forgotten, POW/MIA" logo is still flown in front of all U.S. post offices, all major U.S. military installations, and most fire stations, police stations, many state level agencies and also most veterans organizations chapters across the United States today, and is almost always present at most local and national veterans events in the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The flag is consequently still visible to millions of Americans on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===1980s: Split and founding of alternate group===

In the 1980s a different group, the [[National Alliance of Families|National Alliance Of Families For the Return of America's Missing Servicemen]], was formed as a split-off by National League of Families members over a disagreement with then League President Ann Mills Griffith over tactics the organization should employ in pursuing its goals, and disagreements about the status of missing servicemen by the 1980s.&lt;ref name="skk"&gt;Keating, ''Prisoners of Hope'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the league, the National Alliance takes a more activist, radical stance, especially with regards towards the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]] and belief in the existence of "live prisoners" in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;McConnell and Schweitzer, ''Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives'', p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current status of organization===

The League's national office, based in [[Arlington, Virginia]], is still run by one full-time employee and various volunteers. To date, more than sixteen hundred U.S. servicemen are still listed as Missing in Action in the Vietnam War and efforts continue by certain departments of the U.S. government and the National League of Families to ascertain the fate of these missing service members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/vietnam/statistics/2010/documents/Stats20100805.pdf|title=Vietnam-era unaccounted for statistical report|date=August 5, 2010 | publisher=[[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate continues as to whether or not the efforts by the U.S. government, the Vietnamese government in Hanoi and other governments historically involved in the war have been, or continue to be, sufficient regarding the effort to find these missing soldiers, pilots, airmen and sailors.&lt;ref name="nyt061692"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DD103AF935A25755C0A964958260 | title=Gulag Held M.I.A.'s, Yeltsin Suggests | author=Barbara Crossette | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 16, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National League of Families continues to work at keeping the pressure on both Washington and Hanoi to bring complete resolution to this issue on behalf of each family with a loved one still missing in Vietnam.

{{Criminal law}}
'''Obstruction of justice''', in United States [[jurisdiction]]s, is a [[crime]] of obstructing [[prosecutor]]s  or other (usually government) officials. [[Common law]] jurisdictions other than the United States tend to use the wider offense of [[perverting the course of justice]]. 

Obstruction also applies to overt coercion of court or government officials via the means of threats or actual physical harm, and also applying to deliberate sedition against a court official to undermine the appearance of legitimate authority.

==Legal overview==
Generally, obstruction charges are laid when it is discovered that a person questioned in an investigation, other than a [[suspect]], has lied to the investigating officers. However, in most common law jurisdictions, the [[right to remain silent]] can be used to allow any person questioned by police merely to deny answering questions posed by an investigator without giving any reason for doing so. (In such a case, the investigators may [[subpoena]] the witness to give [[testimony]] under [[oath]] in court, though the witness may then exercise their rights, for example in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], if they believe their answer may serve to [[Self-incrimination|incriminate themselves]].) If the person willfully and knowingly tried to protect a suspect (such as by providing a false [[wikt:Alibi|alibi]]) or to hide from investigation of their own activities (such as to hide their involvement in another crime), this may leave them liable to prosecution. Obstruction charges can also be laid if a person alters, destroys, or conceals [[physical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1519|title=18 U.S. Code § 1519 - Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obstruction charges may also be laid in unique situations such as [[Refusing to assist a police officer|refusal to aid a police officer,]] escape through voluntary action of an officer and refusing to assist prison officers in arresting escaped convicts.

Obstruction can include crimes committed by [[judge]]s, [[prosecutor]]s, [[Attorney General|attorneys general]], and elected officials in general. It is [[misfeasance]], [[malfeasance]] or [[nonfeasance]] in the conduct of the office. Most commonly it is prosecuted as a crime for [[perjury]] by a non governmental official primarily because of prosecutorial discretion.

==Notable examples==
* [[Bill Clinton]] was [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1998 for obstruction of justice charges based on allegations Clinton lied about his relationship with [[Monica Lewinsky]] in a sworn [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] in the [[Paula Jones]] lawsuit. This made Clinton only the second U.S. president to be impeached after [[Andrew Johnson]]. He was later acquitted by the Senate.
* [[Richard Nixon]] was being investigated for obstruction of justice for his alleged role in the cover-up of the break-in at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate]] hotel during his [[United States presidential election, 1972|re-election campaign in 1972]]. Although it is unknown whether Nixon had foreknowledge of his re-election committee's "dirty tricks" campaign against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidates that led to the break-in, he was aware of it after the fact and paid money to keep the participants quiet.
* Former Vice-Presidential adviser [[Scooter Libby|I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]] was convicted of obstruction of justice in March 2007 for his role in the investigation of a [[Plame affair|leak to reporters]] by [[Richard Armitage (naval officer)|Richard Armitage]] of the identity of a CIA agent, [[Valerie Plame]]. His prison sentence was commuted by President [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush]] in July 2007, so that Libby was no longer required to serve a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence, but was still required to pay a $250,000 fine, be recorded as a convicted felon, obey probation terms, and be disbarred.  [[Donald Trump]] pardoned Libby on April 13, 2018.
* [[Conrad Black]] was convicted of obstruction of justice in July 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/14/business/13cnd-black.html|title=Conrad Black Found Guilty in Fraud Trial|last=Siklos|first=Richard|date=2007-07-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; for removing 13 boxes containing financial records from his office in Toronto after they had been sealed by a court order, returning the boxes a few days later.
* [[Barry Bonds]] was convicted of obstruction of justice on April 13, 2011 for his testimony in front of the [[grand jury]] during the [[BALCO]] steroid scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/04/barry-bonds-verdict-.html |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Barry Bonds convicted of obstruction of justice in performance-enhancing-drugs case |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conviction was later overturned by an appellate court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_27967951/barry-bonds-conviction-overturned | work=San Jose Mercury News | title=Barry Bonds conviction overturned}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[United States v. Binion]]'', malingering (feigning illness) during a competency evaluation was held to be obstruction of justice and led to an enhanced sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=October 10, 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obstruction trends==
"Anticipatory obstruction of justice" has recently appeared on the horizon in cases such as ''US v. Wolff''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FindLaw's United States DC Circuit case and opinions |url = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1161200.html |website = Findlaw|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the operative section, 1519, passed in 2002, has thus far languished in quasi-obscurity. Titled “Destruction, Alteration or Falsification of Records in Federal Investigations and Bankruptcy,” the provision was passed under Section 802 of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002.

The text of the statute is relatively straightforward:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aside from Section 1519’s 20-year maximum prison [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] (no small benefit to the government in big-dollar fraud loss cases such as Wolff), its primary appeal is that it uniquely removes certain key proof burdens from prosecutors’ collective shoulders.

Prosecutors charging violations of Section 1519 must still establish either of the following:
* The accused knowingly did the obstructive act with the intent to affect the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department or agency or any case filed under Title 11; or
* The accused knowingly did the obstructive act at least “in relation to or in contemplation of any such matter or case”.

Not on the list, however, is the requirement that prosecutors demonstrate to the finder of fact which specific “matter or case” the accused attempted to obstruct. That is a significant benefit to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/3/v2/23402/lit-11-03funkcommentary.pdf |first=T.

The '''Oregon Country Fair''' (OCF) is a nonprofit organization, and an annual three-day art and music fair held outside the city limits of [[Veneta, Oregon]], [[United States of America|United States]]. Located in the [[Willamette Valley]], the site is about {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} west of [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] along the [[Long Tom River]] near the unincorporated community of [[Elmira, Oregon|Elmira]]. Annual attendance is approximately 45,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Oregon Country Fair FAQs | publisher = Oregon Country Fair | url = http://www.oregoncountryfair.org/faqs.php | accessdate = 2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fair has around 960 craft and food booths each year.&lt;ref name="moon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Mark|title=Moon Oregon|publisher=Avalon Travel|year=2007|edition=7|page=209|isbn=978-1-56691-930-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-xEA_1nkxcAC&amp;lpg=PT209&amp;dq=%22Oregon%20Country%20Fair%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;pg=PT209#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Oregon%20Country%20Fair%22%20-inpublisher:icon&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is known as an outgrowth of the [[counter-culture]] movement, and for using environmentally-friendly practices during the fair.&lt;ref name="moon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="places"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Patricia|title=1,000 Places to See in the U.S.A. &amp; Canada Before You Die|publisher=Workman Publishing|year=2007|page=883|isbn=978-0-7611-3691-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SCq3kk_aHoUC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA883&amp;dq=%22Oregon%20Country%20Fair%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;pg=RA1-PA883#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Oregon%20Country%20Fair%22%20-inpublisher:icon&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oregon Country Fair begins on the Friday of the second weekend in July every year (i.e. as early as July 7 and as late as July 13). The fair is a non-profit organization and as such has a board of directors. Additionally, the management structure of the Oregon Country Fair is typically composed of a General Manager, an Operations Manager, and a team of volunteer Back Up Managers, otherwise known as BUMS, who serve as representation for the fair's paid management staff for the duration of the event. Currently the fair does not have an official General Manager. In the interim, management responsibilities fall to the Operations Manager and the Site Manager who work as a co-management team.

==History==
The first fair was held in Eugene, over the weekend of November 1–2, 1969. It was promoted with the tagline, "come in costume".&lt;ref name="Companion"&gt;{{cite book|last=Engeman|first=Richard H.|title=The Oregon Companion: An Historical Gazetteer of the Useful, the Curious, and the Arcane|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|page=283|isbn=978-0-88192-899-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2F30A_WRuPEC&amp;lpg=PT283&amp;dq=%22Oregon%20Country%20Fair%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;pg=PT283#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Oregon%20Country%20Fair%22%20-inpublisher:icon&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fair began as a [[craft]] fair to raise funds for an alternative school, the Children's Community School.&lt;ref name="Companion"/&gt;
The event moved to its current location in Veneta, about 13 miles west of Eugene, for the fall fair in October, 1970, after having had a May Fair the same year on Crow Road, about halfway between Eugene and Veneta.&lt;ref name="Companion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCFtimeline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://home.comcast.net/~robertanisbet/projects/ocftimeline.htm|title=Oregon Country Fair Time Line|accessdate=14 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025100409/http://home.comcast.net/~robertanisbet/projects/ocftimeline.htm|archivedate=25 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ew2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/07/06/coverstory.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709230713/http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/07/06/coverstory.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 9, 2006|title=The 38th Annual Oregon Country Fair: Fantastic Fair Folk|last=Salvia|first=Vanessa|date=July 6, 2006|work=Eugene Weekly|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1972 and August 1982, OCF hosted concerts headlined by the [[Grateful Dead]]. Known as "Field Trips", that first concert was held as a benefit for the Springfield Creamery, which is owned by members of [[Ken Kesey]]'s family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nancysyogurt.com/our_creamery/history.php |title=Our History - Nancy's Cultured Dairy and Soy |publisher=Nancysyogurt.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1977, the fair was known as the ''Oregon Renaissance Faire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19770616&amp;id=cLITAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mdkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6484,4185793 |title= Annual Gathering Gets New Name |date= June 16, 1977 |work= [[Register-Guard]] |author= Baker, Dean |accessdate= 2009-12-08}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment==
[[File:Oregon Country Fair 2005 Brass Band Parade.jpg|left|thumb|The Fighting Instruments of Karma Marching Band lead a parade at the 2005 Fair]]
During open hours (11 am to 7 pm) there are 22 [[Stage (theatre)|stages]] featuring a wide variety of [[musical theatre|musical]], [[comedic]], [[theatrical]], [[juggling]], [[Stunt performer|daredevil]], and [[vaudeville]] performances.

There are also numerous musicians engaged in [[busk]]ing along the pathways as well as parades, and walking performers throughout the entire fair site, including a [[marching band]], giant [[puppets]], and [[stilt walkers]].

There is also a drum circle at the Drum Tower which is open to all willing participants who bring their musical instruments.&lt;ref name="Oregon Country Fair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregoncountryfair.org |title=Oregon Country Fair |publisher=Oregon Country Fair |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tickets and transportation==
Tickets and passes are required to attend the Oregon Country Fair. All tickets sold to the public are sold in advance at TicketsWest outlets and other retail centers throughout the Northwest.  All tickets must be purchased off-site; no tickets are sold at the fair site and there is no on-site will-call. Discount tickets are available for people who qualify for disability or senior discounts. There is no fee for children who are under the age of ten, and come with a paying adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ticket Information | publisher = Oregon Country Fair | url = http://www.oregoncountryfair.org/tickets.php | accessdate = 2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public transportation, in the form of bus shuttle, is added in order to park and ride between Eugene and the OCF grounds non-stop throughout the days of the fair.

==Culture==

The fair is a family event with [[face painting]], [[puppet]] shows, and music for children. [[Toplessness]] is permitted while full nudity is not allowed during public hours in public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregoncountryfair.net/Pages/2009Guidelinesweb.pdf |title= 20. Nudity |work= Oregon Country Fair Guidelines |year= 2009 |publisher= Oregon Country Fair |page= 6 |accessdate= 2009-12-08 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723233437/http://www.oregoncountryfair.net/Pages/2009Guidelinesweb.pdf |archivedate= 2011-07-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is allowed and [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] is limited to designated areas.  The fair has its own water and communications systems, [[recycling]] service, emergency medical team, traffic control, and security team. Since 1997 there has been a strong effort to make it a drug-free event.

==Infrastructure==
The fair is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization. It is governed by an elected ten-member Board of Directors (with 2 elected alternates). There are seven staff positions within the organization. Staff positions traditionally include a General Manager, an Operations Manager, an Assistant Manager, A Site and Facilities Manager, a Residential Caretaker, a Groundskeeper, and an Administrative Assistant. Currently the fair does not have a General Manager. Until a full-time General Manager is hired by the Board of Directors, the Site and Facilities Manager and Operations Manager share management responsibilities and authority within the organization. 


Alter-abled access is available at the Oregon Country Fair, including wheelchairs (there is a battery re-charging station for electric wheelchairs), helpers, sign language interpreters, folding chairs, rest areas, maps, and other information. To obtain these services, or more information about them, event participants can go to the following locations on the event site: the ''Alter-Abled Access Advocates(4A)Center'' (located near Admissions as well as at the Bus Stop), ''Community Village'', ''Solutions'', and all ''Information booths''.&lt;ref name="oregoncountryfair.org"&gt;http://www.oregoncountryfair.org&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 1  through August 31 there are no dogs (except service dogs) allowed on the event site.&lt;ref name="oregoncountryfair.org"/&gt;

'''Publications'''

The Oregon Country Fair publishes a newsletter, the Fair Family News, eleven times a year.  As well as an event paper, the Peach Pit, once a year for the three-day event.&lt;ref name="oregoncountryfair.org"/&gt;

==Volunteer crews==
The Oregon Country Fair has a large volunteer network. This volunteer network is the base for all operational needs of the event. While some working volunteers receive food vouchers which can be used to buy meals from vendors during the event, many volunteers do not. Volunteer crews are separated into "Pre-fair Crews" and "During Fair Crews." Pre-fair crews work from the site's opening in early June until the event officially opens to the public the second weekend in July. Pre-fair crews are responsible for setting up the site's physical infrastructure and preparing the site both for the festival and for the increase in people on the land with the aim of reducing impact and preserving natural flora and fauna. Preservation and restoration efforts are led by the Site and Facilities Manager year round, and are largely carried out by the Residential Caretaker with the help of a special crew known as Site Crew who report directly to the Caretaker and Site and Facilities Manager. &lt;ref name="Oregon Country Fair"/&gt;

All volunteers agree to the Oregon Country Fair Guidelines and Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct of The Oregon Country Fair is:

{{quote|We are an association of equals. Each and every member of our community is entitled to respectful and equitable treatment by all other participants. We should all act responsibly towards one another wherever we gather. The OCF is committed to the principles of non-violence. Mental, verbal, physical, or sexual abuse will not be tolerated. We share reverence for the land. Stewardship is everyone's responsibility. Please help protect the plant and animal life whose space we share, and work to extend this practice beyond the OCF and into daily life.&lt;ref name="Oregon Country Fair"/&gt;}}

==History of the land==

The Willamette Valley has been continuously occupied by humans, to some extent, for at least the last 9,000-10,000 years (this timeline is based on the archaeological evidence gathered from 34 archaeological sites in the Upper Willamette Valley).&lt;ref&gt;A Chronology of Upper Willamette Valley, Oregon, Prehistory John R. White American Antiquity, Vol. 44, No. 3 (Jul., 1979), pp. 401-640&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:OCFLongTom.JPG|thumb|left|The banks of the [[Long Tom River]] decorated for the fair, as seen from the "eight" (the main path through the fair)]]

The Oregon Country Fair property has archaeological sites protected by state law on it. It is thought to have previously been a gathering place for the [[Kalapuya people|Kalapuya]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. All ground disturbing activities on the fair property must be approved by the archaeology and construction crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregoncountryfair.net/Pages/2010OCFGuidelines.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126062203/http://oregoncountryfair.net/Pages/2010OCFGuidelines.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalapuya lived in permanent winter homes and migrated throughout the Willamette Valley of Oregon during the summers. Subsistence was based on fishing, hunting, and gathering wild plant foods.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Green,. 2006. "THE POWERS THAT BE: SACRED TALES." In The Greenwood Library of American Folktales Volume 4: The Northwest The American Indian Experience.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the translation of Kalapuya texts, strong historical aspects of the Kalapuya culture include: the dream, the dream spirit-power, death, wealth, prestige, sexual division of labor (men hunt, women gather), sex, acculturation, and language. The dream spirit-power was observed to be the strongest. The dream power was constantly referred to in matters of courage and bravery, of sickness and resisting disease, gambling, hunting, wealth, casting spells, power over natural phenomena and becoming a shaman.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnolinguistic Observations Based on Kalapuya Texts J. P. Rumberger, Jr.International Journal of American Linguistics, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Jul., 1949), pp. 139-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the fair site is a [[wetland]] and the [[Long Tom River]] floods much of the fair property  each winter.&lt;ref name=Mantia&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zXQRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UeIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6021,1744540&amp;dq=oregon-country-fair&amp;hl=en |title= Highway to slice into country fair meadow |author= Mantia, Patty |work= [[The Register-Guard]] |date= April 8, 1983 |accessdate= 2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational areas==
[[File:Oregon Country Fair 2003 Energy Park.jpg|right|thumb|Energy Park]]
[[File:Oregon Country Fair 2005 Girls.jpg|right|thumb|Young attendees]]
Some of the Oregon Country Fair's areas are organized to be information and workshop resources.
The ''Kids Loop'' is a children's play area, ''Yes You Canopy'' is a pavilion dedicated to the teaching of juggling, ''Energy Park'' is an area with displays and demonstrations on [[alternative energy]], alternative transportation, organic agriculture and recycling,&lt;ref name=Educational&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregoncountryfair.org/educational_opportunities.php |title=Oregon Country Fair |publisher=Oregon Country Fair |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Community Village'' has booths from non-profit organizations dedicated to education, information access, plants and gardening, including a display by the [[Oregon State University]]/[[Lane County, Oregon|Lane County]] Extension Master Gardeners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/lane/sites/default/files/images/gg207.pdf |title=Feb07MG by PD.pub |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other forms of progressive social change.

''Archaeology Park'' ("Ark Park") is the home of the fair's archaeology crew, and includes replica cedar houses like those used by [[Pacific Northwest]] Native American tribes, displays of artifacts and photos of archaeological digs from the fair site, and hands-on demonstrations of [[Knapping|flintknapping]], firemaking, basket weaving and other Native American skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/about/nextgen/internedition/sum08/oregon.html |title=Intern Edition |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210083559/http://www.npr.org/about/nextgen/internedition/sum08/oregon.html |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
The OCF organization maintains close ties with the Eugene-area community and supports many other nonprofit organizations through its philanthropic programs.

Fairgoers, fair working volunteers, and the OCF organization alike contribute to non-profit groups through ''The Jill Heiman Vision Fund''. This fund grants funds to tax-exempt organizations in Lane County. Donations are provided to projects and programs related to improving the environment and fostering sustainability.

The OCF Board has created ''The Bill Wooten Endowment Fund'' to assist arts, environmental, and social justice projects.  The Board of Directors also offers donations to various groups and activities that share its values of living artfully and authentically on the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OCF Philanthropy | publisher = Official OCF Website | url = http://www.oregoncountryfair.org/philanthropy.php | accessdate = 2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name, a [[pun]] on "a two-tit sling," was invented by humorist [[Wallace Reyburn]] in the 1970s.  Since then, the name has appeared in the game ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' (the makers of the game fell for the hoax, and listed "Otto Titzling" as the "correct answer" to the question of who invented the brassiere), the 1988 movie ''[[Beaches (film)|Beaches]]'' (featuring a song named "Otto Titsling" sung by [[Bette Midler]]), the comic strip [[Luann (comic strip)|Luann]] by [[Greg Evans (cartoonist)|Greg Evans]],&lt;ref name="luann"&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Evans |work=[[Luann (comic strip)|Luann]] |title=Luann Comic Strip, March 14, 1999|url=http://www.gocomics.com/luann/1999/03/14 |date=March 14, 1999 |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has appeared in practice questions sent out to prospective teams by the [[BBC 2]] show ''[[University Challenge]]''.

[[Peter Cook]] references Otto Titsling as the inventor of the brassiere, during a [[Pete and Dud]] skit with [[Dudley Moore]], in their [[West End theatre|West End]] stage show, Behind the Fridge. The show was first broadcast on [[BBC2]] in 1974, and is the final public performance of Cook and Moore, as a double act. 

A similar situation exists with [[Thomas Crapper]], who was a real [[plumber]] but did not invent the [[flush toilet|flushing lavatory]]. Reyburn popularised this myth in "Flushed With Pride: The Story of Thomas Crapper".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21450">[[Image:Qoyllur R'Iti Shrine by night.jpg|thumb|200px|Shrine of the Lord of Quyllurit'i at night]]
'''Quyllurit'i''' ([[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''quyllu rit'i,'' ''quyllu'' bright white, ''rit'i'' snow, "bright white snow,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flores Ochoa|first1=Jorge|title=El Cuzco: Resistencia y Continuidad|date=1990|publisher=Editorial Andina|language=Spanish|chapter=Taytacha Qoyllurit'i. El Cristo de la Nieve Resplandeciente}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a religious festival held annually at the Sinakara Valley in the southern highlands [[Cusco Region]] of [[Peru]]. Local indigenous people of the Andes know this festival as a native celebration of the stars. In particular they celebrate the reappearance of the [[Pleiades]] constellation, known in Quechua as ''Qullqa,'' or "storehouse," and associated with the upcoming harvest and New Year. The Pleiades disappears from view in April and reappears in June. The new year is marked by indigenous people of the Southern Hemisphere on the [[Winter Solstice]] in June, and it is also a Catholic festival. The people have celebrated this period of time for hundreds if not thousands of years. The pilgrimage and associated festival was inscribed in 2011 on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].

According to the Catholic Church, the festival is in honor of the Lord of Quyllurit'i ({{lang-qu|Taytacha Quyllurit'i}}, {{lang-es|Señor de Quyllurit'i}}) and it originated in the late 18th century. The young native herder Mariano Mayta befriended a [[mestizo]] boy named Manuel on the mountain [[Qullqipunku]]. Thanks to Manuel, Mariano's herd prospered, so his father sent him to Cusco to buy a new shirt for Manuel. Mariano could not find anything similar, because that kind of cloth was sold only to the archbishop. Learning of this, the bishop of Cusco sent a party to investigate. When they tried to capture Manuel, he was transformed into a bush with an image of Christ crucified hanging from it. Thinking the archbishop's party had harmed his friend, Mariano died on the spot. He was buried under a rock, which became a place of pilgrimage known as the Lord of ''Quyllurit'i,'' or "Lord of Star (Brilliant) Snow." An image of Christ was painted on this boulder. 

The Quyllurit'i festival attracts thousands of indigenous peasants from the surrounding regions, made up of ''Paucartambo'' groups ([[Quechua languages|Quechua speakers]]) from the agricultural regions to the northwest of the shrine, and ''Quispicanchis'' ([[Aymara ethnic group|Aymara speakers]]) from the pastoral (herders) regions to the southeast. Both [[moiety (kinship)|moieties]] make an annual pilgrimage to the feast, bringing large troupes of dancers and musicians. There are four groups of participants with particular roles: ''ch'unchu,'' ''qulla,'' ''ukuku,'' and ''machula.'' Attendees increasingly have included middle-class Peruvians and foreign tourists. 

The festival takes place in late May or early June, to coincide with the full moon. It falls one week before the Christian feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. Events include several processions of holy icons and dances in and around the shrine of the Lord of Quyllurit'i. The culminating event for the indigenous non-Christian population takes place after the reappearance of ''Qullqa'' in the night sky; it is the rising of the sun after the full moon. Tens of thousands of people kneel to greet the first rays of light as the sun rises above the horizon. The main event for the Church is carried out by ''ukukus,'' who climb glaciers over [[Qullqipunku]] and bring back crosses and blocks of ice to place along the road to the shrine. These are believed to be medicinal with healing qualities.

==Origins==
There are several accounts of the origins of the Quyllurit'i festival. What follows are two versions: one relates the pre-Columbian origins, and the other the Catholic Church's version as compiled by the priest of the town of [[Ccatca]] between 1928 and 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes,'' pp. 207&amp;ndash;209.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Columbian origins ===
The Inca followed both solar and lunar cycles throughout the year. The cycle of the moon was of primary importance for the timing of both agricultural activities and associated festivals. There are many celebration of seasonal events related to animal husbandry, sowing seeds, and harvesting of crops. Important festivals such as Quyllurit'i, perhaps the most important festival given its significance and meaning, are still celebrated on the full moon.

The Quyllurit'i festival takes place at the end of a period of a few months when the [[Pleiades]] constellation, or Seven Sisters, a 7-star cluster in the [[Taurus constellation]], disappears and reappears in the skies of the Southern Hemisphere. Its time of disappearance was marked in Inca culture by a festival for ''[[Pariacaca]],'' the god of water and torrential rains. It occurs near the date of ''qarwa mita'' (''qarwa'' meaning when the corn leaves are yellow).&lt;ref name="fioravanti"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Erl4gR5Kw30C&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=el+turno+de+las+Pleyades&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kFUVXIqGAb&amp;sig=SQTPcOqnTO5nbQSN23WIvwEi9fo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4vOfLjo3RAhVC9YMKHbPqCcAQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=el%20turno%20de%20las%20Pleyades&amp;f=false Antoinette Molinié Fioravanti, ''Celebrando el Cuerpo de Dios'' (Corpus Cristi Festival)], Fondo Editorial PUCP, 1999, pp. 197-198{{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The return of the constellation about 40 days later, called ''unquy mita'' in Quechua,&lt;ref name="fioravanti"/&gt; was long associated in the Southern Hemisphere with the time of the coming harvest and therefore a time of abundance for the people. Incan astronomers had named the Pleiades constellation as ''Qullqa,'' or "storehouse," in their native language of [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]].

Metaphorically, the constellation's disappearance from the night sky and reemergence approximately two months afterward is a signal that the human planes of existence have times of disorder and chaos, but also return to order. 

&lt;!-- Note: This is a very large section to be virtually unsourced. The online glossary originally referred to does not qualify as a Reliable Source. I think it is questionable whether this information should be included at all without an academic source. 
:This outlook is believed to coincide with the Pachakuti or Inca Prophecy that has been popularized since the late 20th century. Literally translated from the two words ''pacha'' and ''kuti'' (Quechua ''pacha'' "time and space," ''kuti'' "return"), ''pacha kuti'' means "return of time," "change of time," or "great change or disturbance in the social or political order".&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, ''Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha,'' La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary): ''pacha kuti'' - ''(Pacha: tiempo y espacio. Kuti: regreso, vuelta). Regreso del tiempo, cambio del tiempo.'' ''pacha kuti'' - ''s. Gran cambio o trastorno en el orden social o político.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophecy is believed to refer to a period of upheaval and cosmic transformation, which some people currently interpret as referring to the period of Spanish invasion and conquest. It was seen as an overturning of the space/time continuum that affects consciousness, a reversal of the world, a cataclysmic event separating eras in time.

In the current ''pacha,'' it is said that people will set the world rightside up and return to a golden era. This era will last at least 500 years. The Andino people and their native historical culture will see a resurgence and rise out of the previous period of conquest and oppression, and begin to thrive and return to a period of grandeur.

The Pachakuti also speaks of the tumultuous nature of the current world, in particular the environmental destruction of the earth. It prophesies that man will return to a period of balance, harmony and sustainability. This will happen as the people change their thinking and become more conscious. The Pachakuti is representative of the death of an old way of thinking about the world, and an elevation to a higher state of consciousness. It is a way for the people to describe who they are becoming. --&gt;

=== Catholic Church origins ===
In the city of [[Cuzco]] in the late 17th century, the celebration of Corpus Cristi reached a height under Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo (1673–99), with processions through the city including Inca nobles in ceremonial regalia. The bishop also commissioned portraits of the nobles in their ceremonial clothes. Scholars such as Carolyn Dean have studies this evidence for its suggestions about related church rituals. &lt;ref name="lane"&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/11737 Kris E. Lane,  "Review: Carolyn Dean, ''Inka Bodies and the Body of Christ: Corpus Christi in Colonial Cuzco, Peru'' "], ''Ethnohistory,'' Volume 48, Number 3, Summer 2001, pp. 544-546; accessed 22 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean believes that such early churchmen thought that such Catholic rituals could displace indigenous ones. She examines the feast of Corpus Cristi and its relationship to the indigenous harvest festival at winter solstice, celebrated in early June in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="lane"/&gt; According to the church, events of the late 18th century that included a sighting of Christ on the mountain [[Qullqipunku]] became part of myth, and the pilgrimage festival of the Lord of Quyllurit'i is still celebrated in the 21st century. 

It is told that an Indian boy named Mariano Mayta used to watch over his father's herd of [[alpaca]] on the slopes of the mountain. He wandered into the snowfields of the glacier, where he encountered a [[mestizo]] boy named Manuel. They became good friends, and Manuel provided Mariano with food. When the boy did not return home for meals, Mariano's father went looking for his son. He was surprised to find his herd had increased. As a reward, he sent Mariano to [[Cusco]] to get new clothes. Mariano asked to buy some also for Manuel, who wore the same outfit everyday. His father agreed, so Mariano asked Manuel for a sample in order to buy the same kind of cloth in Cusco.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, ''Return of the Pleiades,'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariano was told that this refined cloth was restricted for use only by the bishop of the city. Mariano went to see the prelate, who was surprised by the request. He ordered an inquiry of Manuel, directed by the priest of [[Oncogate]] (''Quispicanchi''), a village close to the mountain. On June 12, 1783, the commission ascended Qullqipunku with Mariano; they found Manuel dressed in white and shining with a bright light. Blinded, they retreated, returning with a larger party. On their second try they reached the boy. But when they touched him, he was transformed into a tayanka bush (''[[Baccharis odorata]]'') with the crucified Christ hanging from it. Thinking the party had harmed his friend, Mariano fell dead on the spot. He was buried under the rock where Manuel had last appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, ''Return of the Pleiades,'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tayanka tree was sent to Spain, as requested by king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]. As it was never returned, the Indian population of Ocongate protested. The local priest ordered a replica, which became known as Lord of Tayankani ({{lang-es|Señor de Tayankani}}). The burial site of Mariano attracted a great number of Indian devotees, who lit candles before the rock. Religious authorities ordered the painting of an image of Christ crucified on the rock. This image became known as Lord of Quyllurit'i ({{lang-es|Señor de Quyllurit'i}}). In [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], ''quyllur'' means star and ''Rit'i'' means snow; thus, the term means Lord of Star Snow.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, ''Return of the Pleiades,'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pilgrims==

[[Image:Qoyllur Rit'i dancers.jpg|thumb|Dancers with the mountains Qullpiqunkpu and [[Sinaqara]] behind them.]]
The Quyllurit'i festival attracts more than 10,000 pilgrims annually, most of them indigenous peoples from rural communities in nearby regions.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, ''Inka Bodies'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; They are from two [[moiety (kinship)|moieties]]: Quechua-speaking ''Paucartambo,'' people from agricultural communities located to the northwest of the shrine in the provinces of [[Cusco Province|Cusco]], [[Calca Province|Calca]], [[Paucartambo Province|Paucartambo]] and [[Urubamba Province|Urubamba]]; and Aymara-speaking ''Quispicanchis,'' which encompasses those living to the southeast in the provinces of [[Acomayo Province|Acomayo]], [[Canas Province|Canas]], [[Canchis Province|Canchis]] and [[Quispicanchi Province|Quispicanchi]],  This geographic division also reflects social and economic distinctions, as the Quechuas of Paucartambo cultivate agricultural crops, whereas Quispicanchis is populated by the [[Aymara ethnic group|Aymara]], whose lives are based on animal husbandry, especially herds of [[alpaca]] and [[llama]].&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peasants from both moieties undertake an annual pilgrimage to the Quyllurit'i festival, with representatives of each community carrying a small image of Christ to the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''The hold life has'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these delegations include a large troupe of dancers and musicians dressed in four main styles:
*[[Ch'unchu (dance)|Ch'unchu]]: wearing feathered headdresses and carrying a wood staff, the ''[[Ch'unchu people|ch'unchu]]s'' represent the indigenous inhabitants of the [[Amazon Rainforest]], to the north of the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes,'' p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several types of ''ch'unchu'' dancers; the most common is ''wayri ch'unchu,'' which comprises up to 70% of all Quyllurit'i dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, "Qoyllur Rit'i", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Qhapaq Qulla]]: dressed in a "waq'ullu" knitted mask, a hat, a woven sling and a [[llama]] skin, ''[[Qulla people|qulla]]s'' represent the Aymara inhabitants of the ''[[Altiplano]]'' to the south of the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, ''Return of the Pleiades,'' p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Qulla'' is considered a [[mestizo]] dance style, whereas ''ch'unchu'' is regarded as indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ukuku:'' clad in a dark coat and a woolen mask, the ''ukukus'' ([[spectacled bear]]) represent the role of [[trickster]]s; they speak in high-pitched voices, and play pranks, but have the serious responsibility of keeping order among the thousands of pilgrims. Some also go up to the glacier to spend the night. They cut blocks of glacier ice and carry them on their backs to their people at the festival in the valley. When melted, the water is believed to be medicinal for body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for holy water in the churches during the next year. In Quechua mythology, ''ukukus'' are the offspring of a woman and a bear, feared by everyone because of their supernatural strength. In these stories, the ''ukuku'' redeems itself by defeating a ''condenado,'' a cursed soul, and becoming an exemplary farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, "Qoyllur Rit'i", p. 43&amp;ndash;44.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Machula: wearing a mask, a humpback, and a long coat, and carrying a walking stick, ''machulas'' represent the ''ñawpa machus,'' the mythical first inhabitants of the Andes. In a similar way to the ''ukukus,'' they perform an ambiguous role in the festival, being comical as well as constabulary figures.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quyllur Rit'i also attracts visitors from outside the Paucartambo and Quispicanchis moieties. Since the 1970s, an increasing number of [[middle-class]] mainstream Peruvians undertake the pilgrimage, some of them at a different date than more traditional pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes,'' pp. 223&amp;ndash;224.&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a rapid growth in the number of North American and European tourists drawn to the indigenous festival, prompting fears that it is becoming too commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, ''Inka bodies'', pp. 210&amp;ndash;211.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrimage and associated festival were inscribed in 2011 on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].

==Festival==
[[Image:Qoyllur R'Iti panoramic overview.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Panoramic view of the festival, with sanctuary church of Sinaqara in background]]
[[Image:Qoyllur R'Iti Cross 1.jpg|upright|thumb|One of the crosses along the road to the Quyllurit'i shrine]]
The festival is attended by thousands of indigenous people, some of whom come from as far away as Bolivia. The Christian celebration is organized by the Brotherhood of the Lord of Quyllurit'i ({{lang-es|Hermandad del Señor de Quyllurit'i}}), a lay organization that also keeps order during the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Preparations start on the feast of the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]], when the Lord of Quyllurit'i is carried in [[procession]] from its chapel at [[Mawallani]] 8 kilometers to its sanctuary at [[Sinaqara]].&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the first Wednesday after [[Pentecost]], a second procession carries a statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] from the Sinaqqara sanctuary to an uphill grotto to prepare for the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', pp. 225&amp;ndash;226.&lt;/ref&gt; Most pilgrims arrive by [[Trinity Sunday]], when the [[Blessed Sacrament]] is taken in procession through and around the sanctuary. 

The following day, the Lord of Qoyllur Rit'i is taken in procession to the grotto of the Virgin and back.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilgrims refer to this as the greeting between the Lord and Mary, referring to the double traditional Inca feasts of ''Pariacaca'' and ''Oncoy mita.'' (See section above.) On the night of this second day, dance troupes take turns to perform in the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At dawn on the third day, ''ukukus'' grouped by moieties climb the glaciers on Qullqipunku to retrieve crosses set on top. Some ukukus traditionally spent the night on the glacier to combat spirits. They also cut and bring back blocks of the ice, which is believed to have sacred medicinal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', pp. 227&amp;ndash;228.&lt;/ref&gt; The ukukus are considered to be the only ones capable of dealing with ''condenados,'' the cursed souls said to inhabit the snowfields.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, "Quyllurit'i", p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; According to oral traditions, ''ukukus'' from different moieties used to engage in [[endemic warfare|ritual battles]] on the glaciers, but this practice was banned by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, "Return of the Pleiades", p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; After a mass celebrated later this day, most pilgrims leave the sanctuary. One group carries the Lord of Quyllurit'i in procession to [[Tayankani]] before taking it back to Mawallani.&lt;ref&gt;Sallnow, ''Pilgrims of the Andes'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival precedes the official feast of Corpus Cristi, held the Thursday following Trinity Sunday, but it is closely associated with it.&lt;ref name="fioravanti"/&gt;

The '''Rey de Reyes 2008''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "King of Kings") was the 12th annual [[Rey de Reyes]] [[professional wrestling]] tournament and show, produced by the Mexican [[wrestling promotion]] [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA). The event took place on March 18, 2007 in the Plaza de Toros Lorenzo Garza arena in [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo León]], [[Mexico]]. The main focus of the 2008 Rey de Reyes show was the twelfth annual Rey de Reyes tournament and a match between the top ''technico'' [[Cibernético]] and the top ''rudo'' [[El Mesias]] for the [[AAA Mega Championship]] which El Mesias held going into the event. The undercard included four qualifying matches for the Rey de Reyes leading to the traditional four man [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Elimination tag team matches|elimination match]] that led to the crowning of that year's Rey de Reyes. The undercard also saw the continuing feud between [[Konnan]]’s ''[[La Legión Extranjera]]'' (Foreign Legion) and their altercations with wrestlers defending AAA. For this event La Legión Extranjera brought in two [[United States|American]] wrestlers, [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] and [[Scott Steiner]], to strengthen their side. The other undercard storyline was that of ''[[Los Psycho Circus]]'' (a trio of Rudo wrestlers dressed up as [[clown]]s) competing with [[The Black Family]].

==Production==
===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA, or Triple A; Spanish for "Assistance, Consulting, and Administration") has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date=February 21, 1997 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt; The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 show was the 12th Rey de Reyes show in the series.

===Storylines===
The Rey de Reyes show featured ten [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

==Event==
During the event [[Eddie Guerrero]] was inducted into the [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración#Hall of Fame|AAA Hall of Fame]], honoring Guerrero for the contributions he had made to AAA during the early part of his career.

In September 2014 Riot Festival &amp; Carnival returned to Humboldt Park for the last time.

== Cancellations ==
Two instances of Riot Fest have been canceled over the course of the festival's run.

The first came in 2009 in the form of Riot Fest West, originally set to happen in November 2009 and postponed in September. The fest initially vowed to make up the dates in Spring 2010 but the replacement fest did not materialize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gapersblock.com/transmission/2009/09/03/riot_fest_west_postponed_until_spring_2010/ |title=Riot Fest West Postponed Until Spring 2010 |first=Lisa|last=White|work=[[Gapers Block]] |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second cancellation came three years later in 2012 when Riot Fest East in Philadelphia was again postponed, this time one week before the show's planned July 19 start date. Though a reschedule was initially promised a follow up never emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/07/riot_fest_east.html |title=Riot Fest East (Philly) postponed |work=[[Brooklyn Vegan]] |date=July 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not an outright cancellation, Riot Fest Brooklyn in 2012 was shut down early due to weather concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynvegan.com/chicago/2012/09/riot_fest_brook.html Riot Fest Brooklyn][[Brooklyn Vegan]] September 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pigeon Messengers (Harper's Engraving).png|thumb|200px|Homing pigeons such as these served with the ''Confidential Pigeon Service''.]]

According to a 2007 newspaper report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Documents reveal role of 'winged spies'|author=Ben Fenton|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1546107/Documents-reveal-role-of-winged-spies.html|date= March 20, 2007| location=London | accessdate=April 24, 2012}}March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; '''Source Columba''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] ''columba'', "pigeon") was the [[code name]] for the '''Confidential Pigeon Service''', an unconventional [[Great Britain|British]] [[intelligence gathering]] operation in [[World War II]].

It involved air-dropping [[homing pigeons]] behind enemy lines in [[Nazi Germany|German]]-occupied [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] as a means for locals to convey information, such as troop movements, to British intelligence. From 1940 onwards, hundreds of pigeon cases were parachuted into Europe, each case including – apart from the pigeon – sheets of very thin paper, a special pencil and a tube for storing the message, as well as [[French language|French]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] instructions on how to fill in a report. A recent copy of a [[London]] newspaper was also included as proof of good faith.

In 1944, prior to the imminent [[Operation Overlord|Allied invasion]], German counterintelligence sought to counteract (or co-opt) ''Source Columba'' by dropping pigeons of their own. These pigeon cases, accompanied by a packet of English cigarettes, were purporting to be British also and carried instructions to communicate the names of the local patriots to the Allies. The [[Résistance]], for its part, let it be known that the best way to deal with these false birds would be to smoke the cigarettes and eat the pigeons.

Despite such interference, the operation was reported to have been remarkably successful, yielding useful intelligence in over fifty percent of the received messages. 31 ''Source Columba'' pigeons eventually received the [[Dickin Medal]], the highest British military decoration for animals. The operation became public only after [[The National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] files relating to it were released in 2007.  However the method and a few actual cases were described in some detail in Dr [[R.V. Jones]]' autobiographical book ''Most Secret War'' in 1978.

{{Campaignbox French and Indian War}}

The '''St. Francis Raid''' was an attack in the [[French and Indian War]] by [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]] on [[Odanak|St. Francis]], near the southern shore of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] in what was then the French province of [[Canada, New France|Canada]], on October 4, 1759.  Rogers and about 140 men entered the village, which was reportedly occupied primarily by women, children, and the elderly, early that morning, slaughtered many of the inhabitants where they lay, shot down many who attempted to flee, and then burned the village.  Rogers reported killing as many as 300 people, while French reports placed the number closer to thirty, mainly women and children.  One of Rogers' men was killed, and seven were wounded.

Rogers and his men endured significant hardships to reach the village from the British base at [[Fort Crown Point]] in present-day [[New York (state)|New York]], and even more hardship afterwards.  Chased by the French and vengeful Indians, and short on rations, Rogers and his men returned to Crown Point via the [[Connecticut River]] valley.  Missteps in caching food stores for the expedition's use led to starvation, and some of Rogers' men were reportedly driven to [[cannibalism]] in order to survive. About one third of the raid's participants did not return.

British colonial reports of the raid were unapologetic, as St. Francis had long been a place from which the natives raided colonial settlements as far south as [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], and Rogers reported a large number of English [[scalping|scalps]] decorating the main village buildings.

==Background==
The 1759 summer campaign season in the [[French and Indian War]] was a resounding success for the forces of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|Fort Ticonderoga was captured]] in July, as was [[Battle of Fort Niagara|Fort Niagara]], and [[Siege of Quebec (1759)|Quebec was under siege]]. General [[Jeffery Amherst]], the victor at Ticonderoga, had little news of the situation before [[Quebec City|Quebec]], and he required accurate intelligence before deciding whether a move of his army along [[Lake Champlain]] was warranted. To that end he sent one party of rangers out on August 7 to reach General [[James Wolfe]] near Quebec by traveling up the [[Kennebec River]], a long and roundabout route that took the party nearly one month to complete.  Although this party successfully traveled the route in both directions, the time taken meant that their news was effectively useless to Amherst due to the lateness of the season.

[[File:Amherst.jpg|thumb|right|upright|General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]]]]
Amherst sent a second party, consisting of two officers from the 17th Regiment and a handful of [[Stockbridge Indians]], on a route from the northern end of Lake Champlain toward Quebec via the primarily [[Abenaki]] village of [[Saint-François-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]]. In addition to dispatches for Wolfe, this party, led by Captain Quinton Kennedy, had, as a sort of cover for their movements, instructions to make offers of friendship to the Abenakis in exchange for their non-participation in the hostilities between the British and French. They carried a belt of [[wampum]] as part of this offer.

The village of St. Francis, which was regarded by many as an Abenaki village, was in fact inhabited by a diverse community.  In addition to the Abenakis who arrived after [[Father Rale's War]], members of other tribes that had been driven from [[New England]] in earlier conflicts lived there, as did white settlers that had either by choice or by capture adopted native ways.  The village consisted of what were then typical European-style homes centered around a church. It had a reputation among British colonists to the south as the launching point for raids into communities as far south as [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="F217"&gt;Fowler, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Rogers was a teenager in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] at the time of one such raid in 1746.&lt;ref name=B54&gt;Brumwell, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kennedy party captured==
Kennedy and his party left [[Fort Crown Point]] on August 8.  Word reached Amherst on August 19 that they had successfully reached [[Missisquoi Bay]] at the northern end of the lake in spite of French ships patrolling the area.  French General [[François-Charles de Bourlamaque]], in command of the French defenses at [[Île-aux-Noix]], was alerted to the presence of Kennedy's party and intended movements by the arrival of British deserters on August 22.  Bourlamaque immediately sent out patrols and alerted the St. Francis Abenakis to do the same.  On August 24 Kennedy's party was surrounded and captured by the Abenakis; despite attempts at bribery and negotiation, they were turned over to General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] in Quebec.  Amherst learned of this on September 10 when a letter from Montcalm reached him indicating that the two British officers were his prisoners.  Montcalm noted that the men were not in uniform, a tacit implication that Montcalm could have treated them as [[spy|spies]] and hanged them, rather than treating them as [[prisoners of war]].

[[File:Abenakis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|18th-century depiction of an [[Abenaki]] couple]]
Accounts circulated within the British camps that the two officers had been mistreated by the Abenaki, including the possibility of ritual torture.  This heightened anger and resentment among the British, and Amherst, apparently upset over the Abenaki behavior, decided to send [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]] on a mission of revenge.&lt;ref name=B159&gt;Brumwell, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  Rogers assembled a company of 220 men, drawn in part from [[Rogers' Rangers|his ranger companies]] but also including men he selected from the [[regular army]].  A significant number of his men were Stockbridge Indians bent on freeing their compatriots, and others were [[Mohegan]]s from his ranger corps.

Amherst's orders to Rogers on September 13 included the following: "Remember the barbarities that have been committed by the enemy's Indian scoundrels on every occasion, where they had an opportunity of showing their infamous cruelties on the King's subjects, which they have done without mercy.  Take your revenge, but don't forget ... it is my orders that no women or children are killed or hurt."&lt;ref name=P264&gt;Parkman, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expedition starts==
The expedition left Crown Point on the night of September 13.  Its departure was not a well-kept secret, although Rogers and Amherst were the only ones to know its actual destination, and Amherst took steps to publish false instructions about Rogers' movements.  The party, occupying 17 whaleboats, rowed north.  Due to heightened French patrolling in the wake of Kennedy's mission, they made slow progress.  The early days brought some notable disappointments, as more than 40 men turned back due to a variety of accidents and illnesses.  Rogers reached the head of Missisquoi Bay early on September 23, where the boats and supplies for the return trip were concealed and left with two Indians as guards.&lt;ref name=P265&gt;Parkman, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately for Rogers, his landing had not gone unnoticed.  Although he had successful eluded the naval patrols, the British [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|victory at Quebec]] on September 13 had resulted in the movement of French troops toward Lake Champlain, and there were increased French patrols in the area.  General Bourlamaque had recently personally scouted Missisquoi Bay and declared it a good place from which the British could launch an attack.  While French scouting expeditions the previous days had not turned up anything noteworthy, one party sent out the very day Rogers landed found a British oar floating in the bay.  The next day, a larger party of scouts, coincidentally led by Oliver de la Durantaye, who had [[Battle on Snowshoes|battled Rogers in 1758]], discovered the boats.  Some were destroyed and others were taken by the French for their use.  Bourlamaque learned on September 25 that a sizable British force was in the area, and immediately raised the alarm to Montreal and sent out detachments in force to scour the countryside.  He also concluded that the force might be targeting St. Francis in retaliation for Kennedy's capture, and stationed several hundred men near the site where the boats were hidden to set up an ambush in the event of Rogers' return.

==Change of plans==
Rogers at first chose a course that headed primarily east, in order to avoid both the French defenses at Île-aux-Noix and the more northerly route that Kennedy had followed.  This took the party through extremely swampy terrain.  Two days into the trek the two Indian guards brought the news that the boats had been taken by the French.&lt;ref name=P265/&gt;  This change of circumstance led Rogers to hold a council to discuss their options.  As they were behind enemy lines and far from any support, all their options were relatively poor.  Rogers reported that they decided to continue with the mission, and then to "attempt a retreat (the only way we could think of) by way of [[Fort at Number 4|No. 4]]".&lt;ref name=B185&gt;Brumwell, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of this daring plan, Rogers sent Lieutenant Andrew McMullen and a half dozen men overland to Crown Point with instructions to deliver a cache of food to the confluence of the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] and [[Ammonoosuc River|Ammonoosuc]] rivers, a point about {{convert|60|mi|km}} north of Number Four.

McMullen and his men made the overland trek to Crown Point (more than {{convert|100|mi|km}} over difficult terrain) in nine days, arriving on October 3.&lt;ref name=B186&gt;Brumwell, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  Amherst immediately sent a ranger, Lieutenant Samuel Stevens, to Number Four with specific orders to deliver supplies to the agreed rendezvous point and to wait there until either Rogers and his men appeared or Stevens felt there was no probability of their appearance.&lt;ref name=P267&gt;Parkman, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers and his men spent the next week slogging through swampy terrain, covering a distance Rogers estimated at {{convert|50|mi|km}} during which they were rarely dry.  The conditions were so difficult that the French pursuit gave up, never discovering who they were looking for. On October 3 they finally reached dry land along the banks of the [[Saint-François River|St. Francis River]].&lt;ref name=P265/&gt;  The village of St. Francis lay downstream and across the river, and was closer than Rogers realized.  When his men began chopping down trees to construct rafts for use in crossing the river, the sounds of the axes were heard in the village, but disregarded.  Rogers and his men eventually moved several miles upstream to locate a suitable ford.  In spite of this, he reported that the crossing "was attended with no small difficulty",&lt;ref name=B189&gt;Brumwell, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;  with swiftly flowing water {{convert|5|ft|m}} deep.

==Raid==
Many of the Abenaki men had been called out by Governor [[Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal|Vaudreuil]] to assist in tracking down the mysterious British force, which had seemingly vanished.  On October 3 Vaudreuil wrote to Bourlamaque that he had called on the Abenakis and some local militia to set up an ambush on the [[Yamaska River]], the route Kennedy had used on his expedition.

By the time Rogers and his company saw the smoke from the fires of St. Francis late on October 3, his force had been reduced to 142 men, and their rations had been completely exhausted.  That night, Rogers donned Indian dress and sneaked into the village.  There he observed that the natives were dancing, apparently a war dance in preparation for a major scouting expedition.  One news report claimed that Rogers learned that this expedition was to look for the unknown British force that might be in the area.

Rogers was not the only one of his party to enter the village.  According to Abenaki oral tradition, a strange native identifying himself as a Mahican (as the Stockbridge Indians were also known) entered the village and circulated warnings that it was about to be attacked.  A significant number of its inhabitants withdrew from the village in response to this warning, as many of the menfolk had answered Vaudreuil's call.

At 3:00 am on October 4 Rogers marched his men near the village and then divided them into companies for the attack.  The best shooters were placed to fire on anyone trying to escape the village.  At about 5 am the attack began.  In complete surprise they fell on the village inhabitants, many sleeping in their houses after the long night of dancing.  There was little to no organized defense as Rogers and his men broke down doors and shot, tomahawked, or bayoneted people where they lay.  Amherst's order to avoid killing women and children was lost in the frenzy.  Any resistance was quickly dealt with, and many who tried to escape were shot by the sentries posted outside the village.  Some inhabitants managed to reach their canoes and attempted to escape across the river; they were chased down and the canoes were sunk with their occupants, which included children.&lt;ref name=B196_8&gt;Brumwell, pp. 196-198&lt;/ref&gt;

After sunrise, Rogers ordered the village burned down.  As the houses burned it became clear that some of the inhabitants had attempted to escape the carnage by hiding in the attic spaces, which then became death traps.  The church was burned, but not before it was ransacked for its more valuable trappings, and at least one priest refused quarter and perished in the flames.&lt;ref name=B198&gt;Brumwell, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  The only structures not destroyed were the storehouses, which contained corn that Rogers and his men would require as sustenance during their retreat.

Only a few of the village's inhabitants at the time the raid began survived the experience.  Robert Kirkwood, a Scotsman who had been mistreated by [[Shawnee]] earlier in the war, wrote that "This was I believe the bloodiest scene in all America, our revenge being complete."&lt;ref name=B203&gt;Brumwell, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers interrogated some of the captives, and learned that large companies of French and Indians were within easy marching distance,&lt;ref name=P266&gt;Parkman, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; including a force of about 400 that were expected to arrive the next day.  After a brief council, Rogers and his men agreed that the only reasonable means of retreat was to Number Four, a straight-line distance of about {{convert|200|mi|km}} through uncharted wilderness.  Rogers and his men gathered up their loot and as much of the stored corn as they could carry, and set off to the south.

==Pursuit==
News of the raid reached [[Trois-Rivières]] around noon on the day of the raid, and traveled quickly throughout the province.  The attack on loyal allies of the French had to be answered, in spite of the larger threats posed by the armies of Amherst and Wolfe.  Bourlamaque, in a somewhat naive move, sent a further 300 men to join the 400 already awaiting the British return to their boats on Missisquoi Bay, unaware that Rogers knew his boats were lost and had planned a different route of retreat. Vaudreuil also sent additional native reinforcement to assist in scouting the area around the bay.

In Trois-Rivières a small force of experienced fighters under Captain [[Jean-Daniel Dumas]] mustered to chase after Rogers.  Going first to Yamaska to pick up some the force that had gathered there, they finally reached St. Francis on October 5, more than a day behind Rogers. A few men came out of the woods to join the party there as the carnage was surveyed and plans formulated to give chase.

The British force, burdened by supplies and prisoners, made fairly good progress, covering the {{convert|70|mi|km}} from St. Francis to [[Lake Memphremagog]] in about eight days. At this point rations began to run out again, and Rogers made a critical decision. Somewhere near present-day [[Sherbrooke]], Rogers broke the party up into companies of ten to twenty men, so that they might forage and hunt more effectively.  While each party might be able to more readily supply itself for food, they also made easier targets for the pursuit.&lt;ref name="F218"&gt;Fowler, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the small companies were tracked down by determined pursuers.&lt;ref name="F218"/&gt;  According to one French account, some forty of Rogers' men were killed and ten were brought as prisoners back to St. Francis, although historian Frank McLynn says that the expedition had 3 officers and 46 other ranks killed or captured.&lt;ref&gt;McLynn, Frank, ''1759: The Year Britain became Master of the World'', 2004, Jonathan Cape, London, {{ISBN|0-224-06245-X}}, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; At St. Francis, some of the prisoners "fell a victim to the fury of the Indian women, notwithstanding the efforts the Canadians could make to save them", suggesting that they were not subjected to ritual torture or killing.&lt;ref name=B216&gt;Brumwell, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of Rogers' men survived after being spirited away by a sympathetic "English Indian" to the relative safety of Trois-Rivières.

==Starvation==
The journals of the later stages of the expedition provide only a fragmented picture of what occurred to those of Rogers' force that eluded the pursuit, as men subjected to exhaustion, exposure, and starvation are unlikely to make good reporters.  The journal kept by Rogers was relatively terse concerning the trek to the Connecticut River, with "many days tedious march over steep rocky mountains or thro' wet dirty swamps, with the terrible attendants of fatigue and hunger".&lt;ref name=B223&gt;Brumwell, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;  They reported eating bark, roots, mushrooms, and gnawed fragments of flesh off beaver skins.  One widely reported account of cannibalism was recounted to historian [[Thomas Mante]] by Lieutenant George Campbell, in which his party of men came upon scalped remains trapped in logs on a small river, "devouring part of them raw" because they were too impatient to wait for a fire.&lt;ref name=B229&gt;Brumwell, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Kirkwood, in a relatively unadorned account, tells how Rogers killed one of their prisoners, an Indian woman, butchered the remains, and divided them among his men.&lt;ref name=B230&gt;Brumwell, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

After nine days of difficult travel, the group led by Rogers reached the appointed rendezvous on October 20.  He found there a burning fire and no provisions.  Lieutenant Stevens, whom Amherst had sent to Number Four to deliver the provisions to the rendezvous, had camped below the rendezvous point, and men from his party went to the rendezvous daily and fired their muskets to see if anyone was nearby.  After several days of this, Stevens gave up, eventually returning to Crown Point on October 30.  Amherst noted in his own journal that Stevens should probably have remained longer than he did.

Rogers took the disappointment in stride.  Leaving most of his emaciated company behind with promises to return with supplies in ten days, he and three men descended the Connecticut River on rafts, reaching Number Four on October 31, where he was reportedly barely able to walk.  Supplies were immediately dispatched upriver, which Rogers reported as reaching his starving men "the tenth [day] after I left them".&lt;ref name=B232&gt;Brumwell, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On November 2, French scouts on the shores of Missisquoi Bay heard English voices.  Investigating in force, they discovered five English survivors of the St. Francis raid, whom they took prisoner.  These men reported that at least one more small company was in the area; three more men were found, whose throats were slit when they were found to be carrying human flesh.

November 2 was also the day the General Amherst learned that Rogers had executed the raid.  The account, delivered by a French officer under a truce flag, included mention that women and children had been slain, an observation Amherst discounted.  Rogers' second in command arrived at Crown Point on November 7 with Rogers' report.  That same afternoon an Indian from the expedition appeared at Crown Point with word that a party of Rogers' men was on the far side of the lake.  The party consisted of six rangers, three prisoners, and a white woman freed from captivity, as well as a large amount of gathered loot.

Amherst replied to Rogers' report with approval: "... every step you inform me you had taken has been very well Judged and Deserves my full approbation."&lt;ref name=B240&gt;Brumwell, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the raid was first treated with skepticism in the British colonies, but when confirmation came from Rogers himself, he and his men were treated as heroes.  The ''New Hampshire Gazette'' devoted considerable space to coverage of the exploits of one of the province's famous fighters.  The scope of the feat served to raise Rogers' popularity, even while he still worried about the fate of all of his men.

Many of the village's residents who were not present at the time of the raid continued to serve with the French forces in the war, settling in other native communities along the Saint Lawrence.  The village itself was eventually rebuilt.

Farzana, who was pregnant by her husband Muhammad Iqbal, was killed following the tradition of [[Honour killing in Pakistan|honour killing]].&lt;ref name=au&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-27/pakistani-woman-stoned-to-death-in-27honour-killing27/5482308 |title=Pakistani woman stoned to death in 'honour killing' - Australia Network News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27599325 |title=BBC News - Pakistan woman stoned by family outside Lahore court |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press in Lahore |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/pregnant-pakistani-woman-stoned-to-death |title=Pregnant Pakistani woman stoned to death by family &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
By his own admission, Muhammad Iqbal strangled his first wife in 2008 out of love for Farzana Parveen, and so that he would be free to marry her.  Police said he had been released after that murder when a "compromise" was reached with his first wife's family.  Iqbal and Farzana had an engagement that had lasted years.  When she became pregnant by him, they decided to marry.  According to Iqbal, Farzana's father, Muhammad Parveen, withdrew support for the marriage after Iqbal refused his demands for more money, beyond the originally agreed bride-price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/29/pakistan-man-protesting-honour-killing-admits-strangling-first-wife|title=Pakistani man protesting 'honour killing' admits strangling first wife|date=29 May 2014 |website=The Guardian |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=May 27, 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2014, Farzana Iqbal, 30, was attacked by about a dozen male family members in front of a [[High Courts of Pakistan|Pakistani High Court]].  The attackers were led by her father, Muhammad Parveen, but included her two brothers and other family members.  They began by punching and kicking, then it escalated to using clubs and bricks, then hurling stones.  She was killed for eloping and marrying Muhammad Iqbal, 45, whom she loved and by whom she was pregnant.&lt;ref name=bbc1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated Press in Lahore |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/pregnant-pakistani-woman-stoned-to-death |title=Pregnant Pakistani woman stoned to death by family | work = [[The Guardian]] &amp;#124; World news | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] |date= 27 May 2014 |accessdate= 3 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Farzana Iqbal was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

Most of the attackers initially escaped except for Farzana's father, Muhammad Parveen, who was arrested. Police investigator Mujahid quoted the father as saying: "I killed my daughter as she had insulted all of our family by marrying a man without our consent, and I have no regret over it."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/pregnant-pakistani-woman-stoned-death-family-163143284.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215205524/https://in.news.yahoo.com/pregnant-pakistani-woman-stoned-death-family-163143284.html |archivedate=2015-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=au/&gt;  As of 5 June 2014, 12 people have been arrested in connection with Iqbal's death, including her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/05/world/asia/pakistan-stoning-death/index.html?hpt=wo_c2 |title=More arrests made in stoning death of pregnant Pakistani woman |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hatpin''''' is a musical by [[James Millar (Australian actor)|James Millar]] (book and lyrics) and [[Peter Rutherford]] (composer).  It was inspired by the true story of Amber Murray who in 1892 gave up her son to the [[John and Sarah Makin|Makin family]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].  Written and developed in 2006–2007, ''The Hatpin'' opened at the York Theatre, [[Seymour Centre]] in [[Sydney]] on 27 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hatpin|url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/reviews/sydney/the-hatpin-1166.html|publisher=Australian Stage|accessdate=29 June 2013|author=Brett Casben|date=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The musical has received subsequent productions in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Synopsis==
{{see also|John and Sarah Makin}}
''The Hatpin'' is the true story of a single mother, Amber Murray, who advertised her baby in a newspaper trading column in the hope of saving his life. [[Baby farmer]]s take the child in return for regular support payments, but in fact murder the child. Eventually the evil couple are arrested and tried for the murder of several infants - leading to one of the most moving criminal trials in Australian history. Using the moral support she gains from her friendship with the free spirited Harriet Piper, Amber fights the injustices of circumstance and tragedy to find hope and strength.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stagewhispers.com.au/news/hatpin-%E2%80%93-aussie-musical-melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sinai insurgency}}
The following is a chronological timeline of fatal incidents during the ongoing [[Sinai insurgency]], which was invigorated by [[Egyptian Crisis (2011–14)|a period of relative instability and political turmoil]] in Egypt, beginning with the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|2011 uprising]] against former autocrat [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Insurgent attacks, however, intensified significantly following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|July 2013 coup]] that ousted [[Muslim Brotherhood]]-backed president [[Mohamed Morsi]] and subsequent crackdown on his supporters.

[[Image:TremontSt ca1843 Boston byPhilipHarry MFABoston.png|400px|thumb|right|Tremont Theatre (at right), Tremont Street, Boston, ca.1843 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)]]

The '''Tremont Theatre''' (1827–1843) on 88 [[Tremont Street]] was a [[theatre|playhouse]] in [[Boston]]. A group of wealthy Boston residents financed the building's construction. Architect [[Isaiah Rogers]] designed the original Theatre structure in 1827 in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style. The playhouse opened on 24 September 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen's picture of Boston. 1838&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early part of the 19th Century, Boston was still a small town, not yet the bustling metropolis it is today. The town already had one playhouse, the [[Federal Street Theatre]], and the city's small population made supporting a second theatre difficult.&lt;ref name="Banham 1122"&gt;Banham 1122.&lt;/ref&gt; The owners tried to bring in patrons by booking big-name performers. These included [[Junius Brutus Booth]], [[Charlotte Cushman]], [[George Washington Dixon]], [[Fanny Elssler]], [[Edwin Forrest]], [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Charles Kemble|Charles]] and [[Fanny Kemble]], and [[Thomas D. Rice]]. Nevertheless, the Tremont never turned a profit during its 16-year life.&lt;ref name="Banham 1122"/&gt;

Around 1829 Tom Comer served as musical director.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Comer (1790–1862); cf. Daily Picayune (New Orleans); Date: 08-14-1862&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 1843, the [[Free Church Baptists]] bought the theatre and renamed it the [[Tremont Temple]]. Although the building was largely used for religious events after this, it still served as the venue for public events on occasion.

'''Vietnam Syndrome''', in [[U.S. politics]], is a term used to refer to public aversion to American overseas military involvements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kalb|first=Marvin |url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2013/01/22-obama-foreign-policy-kalb|title=It's Called the Vietnam Syndrome, and It's Back|publisher=Brookings Institution|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=12 June 2015|quote=In today's world of [[terrorism|terrorist]] threat and [[guerrilla war]], the Vietnam syndrome means, if nothing else, a fundamental reluctance to commit American military power anywhere in the world, unless it is absolutely necessary to protect the national interests of the country.}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the domestic controversy over the [[Vietnam War]], which ended in 1975. Since the early 1980s, the combination of a [[public opinion]] apparently biased against war,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=Kurt|jstor=4411323|title=Afghanistan and the Vietnam Syndrome|journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]]|volume=36|issue=44|date=3–9 November 2001|page=4182|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a relative reluctance to deploy [[Infantry|ground troops]] and [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]], and "Vietnam paralysis" are all the perceived results of the syndrome.

There is a general consensus by global historians and even most military analysts that from a purely strategic point of view, the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] was losing the war on the battlefield ''despite'' its superior firepower and superior technology, due largely to political decisions that hampered the efforts of military command.  Military historians and those who participated in the war note that indeed, the full spread of United States military technology, numbers, and expertise was present during the war, all the way to its very end, but the requirement of individual bombing raids being approved by the Commander in Chief personally, hindered the ability of commanders in country to execute an effective war strategy.  While the [[Viet Cong]] and the regular [[North Vietnamese Army]] employed an agility in ways the United States forces and [[Republic of Vietnam Military Forces|South Vietnamese forces]] did not, the lopsided losses experienced by the North indicated the effectiveness of the American execution of the war when political factors were not influencing actions on the battlefield.  The victory of the communist forces in Vietnam can be at least partially attributed to non-military factors such as [[Anti-war movement|anti-war sentiments]] in the United States and political interference involving micromanagement of responsibilities typically delegated to military command (millions of Vietnamese were killed, versus many thousands, but not millions, of United States or South Vietnamese troops).  The north Vietnamese were well versed in [[guerrilla warfare]], sabotage, atypical and [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] battlefield moves, infiltration, etc., but their unsustainable casualty count would not have survived a protracted engagement in the absence of major American political interference and Communist funded anti-war propaganda in the United States which eroded popular support for the conflict.

{{quote|Lyndon Johnson faced many of the same problems in Vietnam that Harry Truman faced in Korea.  Johnson's principal problems were to fight the war successfully without widening the conflict to include intervention by the major Communist powers.  This problem would color nearly every decision Johnson made about the war, would force him (from his point of view) to take personal command of the air war in North Vietnam, and would frustrate the military leadership, just as they had been frustrated during the Korean War.

The broad political objective was simple and clear-cut. However, the military's role in achieving that objective was much more obscure. According to Johnson's assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs, William Bundy, the primary focus of the American military effort was to "get Hanoi and North Vietnam (DRV) support and direction removed from South Vietnam." It is particularly important to note that the American military objective did not contemplate "winning" in the sense that the United States and its Allies had won World War II. The available policy documents rarely made reference to defeating the enemy. Indeed, General Westmoreland notes that in 1965, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara defined the American military objective by asking Westmoreland "how many additional American and Allied troops would be required to convince the enemy he would be unable to win." In essence, the American military objective was not to defeat or destroy the enemy. Rather, the military objective was to persuade the enemy that he could not win—a far cry from defeating the enemy in any traditional sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/readings/drew2.htm|last=Drew|first=Dennis M.|title=Rolling Thunder 1965: Anatomy of a Failure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are those who explicitly equate the Vietnam Syndrome with a similar narrative prior to and the formation of [[Nazi Germany]], in which the idea was spread that Germany had not actually lost [[World War I]] but had instead been "[[Stab-in-the-back myth|stabbed in the back by]]" forces from within that secretly wanted Germany to lose that war and to be weakened. That narrative, while central to Nazi Germany's bid for legitimacy - though refuted by unbiased scholars, persists with respect to the Vietnam conflict due largely to the severe imbalance of casualties that the North Vietnamese suffered (a roughly eight to one ratio).

==Failure in Vietnam==
In the domestic debate over why the US was unable to defeat North Vietnamese forces during the war, [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] thinkers, many in the US military, argued that the US had sufficient resources but the war effort had been undermined at home. In an article in ''Commentary'', "Making the World Safe for Communism," journalist [[Norman Podhoretz]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do we lack power?… Certainly not if power is measured in brute terms of economic, technological, and military capacity. By those standards, we are still the most powerful country in the world…. The issue boils down in the end, then, to the question of will.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thereafter, the term "Vietnam syndrome" proliferated in the press and policy circles as a way of talking about why the United States, one of the world's [[superpowers]], had not succeeded in repelling the North's invasion of South Vietnam. Many conservatives agreed with Podhoretz:

&lt;blockquote&gt;…a fickle and spineless public, an unpatriotic [[anti-war movement]] and undisciplined soldiers had ashamed the nation by their unwillingness or inability to do what was necessary to destroy North Vietnam. The world was a dangerous place, they warned, and any retreat or compromise was an invitation to Communists and other wicked people out to destroy American [[supremacism|supremacy]] and, by extension, the [[American way of life]].{{cite quote|date=July 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In time, the term "Vietnam syndrome" also came into use as a shorthand for the idea that Americans were worried they would never win a war again and that the nation was in utter decline.

==Military actions to bury the syndrome==

The administration of U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] hoped that the perceived success of the [[United States invasion of Grenada]] would help dispel the Vietnam Syndrome so that the American public could be successfully galvanized to support new US military actions,&lt;ref&gt;[[United Press International]], 28 May 1984, [https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/05/28/Reagans-view-of-Vietnam-War-unwavering/1916454564800/ Reagan's View of Vietnam War Unwavering] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Policy, 7 Jun. 2010, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/06/07/think-again-ronald-reagan/ "Think Again: Ronald Reagan, The Gipper Wasn't the Warhound His Conservative Followers Would Have You Think"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Angeles Times]], 2 Mar. 1991, [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-02/news/mn-1736_1_vietnam-syndrome U.S. Shakes Off Torment of Vietnam]&lt;/ref&gt; with President Reagan after the invasion declaring: "Our days of weakness are over. Our military forces are back on their feet and standing tall."&lt;ref&gt;[[Baltimore Sun]], 13 Dec. 1983, "Days of Weakness Over, Reagan Tells War Heroes" &lt;/ref&gt;

The quick victory in the [[First Gulf War]] was widely believed to be the end of the Vietnam Syndrome. U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] triumphantly declared after the First Gulf War that "The ghosts of Vietnam have been laid to rest beneath the sands of the Arabian desert."&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Herring]], "From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776 (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2008) p. 912&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reagan's speech to Veterans of Foreign Wars ==
In the later 1970s and the 1980s, [[Ronald Reagan]] talked about the aspects of the Vietnam Syndrome but argued that it could be overcome if Americans adopted a more confident and optimistic posture in the world, with him as leader. In the speech to the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] (VFW), which used the term "Vietnam syndrome," Reagan alleged that the time was right for such a change of attitude and action since the [[Soviet Union]] was outspending the US in the global [[arms race]] such that the latter's global power was decreasing. He accused the [[Carter administration]] of being "totally oblivious" to the Soviet threat.

Asserting a need for a more aggressive, activist foreign policy, Reagan also suggested that Americans could have defeated the [[Viet Cong]] and the [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese Army]] by alleging that the American public had turned against the war from the influence of North Vietnamese propaganda and implying that officials had let down the soldiers and been "afraid to let them win" the war.

Reagan equated the "Vietnam syndrome" not only with a reluctance on the part of the American public to support US military interventions but also with feelings of guilt about the devastation brought about because of the Vietnam War and with feelings of doubt over the morality of America's intentions and actions during the war. Reagan, however, argued that America had fought for "a noble cause" and blamed the war in Vietnam exclusively on North Vietnam's aggression:

{{quote|For too long, we have lived with the "Vietnam Syndrome." Much of that syndrome has been created by the North Vietnamese aggressors who now threaten the peaceful people of [[Thailand]]. Over and over they told us for nearly 10 years that we were the aggressors bent on imperialistic conquests. They had a plan. It was to win in the field of propaganda here in America what they could not win on the field of battle in Vietnam. As the years dragged on, we were told that peace would come if we would simply stop interfering and go home.

It is time we recognized that ours was, in truth, a noble cause. A small country newly free from colonial rule sought our help in establishing self-rule and the means of self-defense against a totalitarian neighbor bent on conquest. We dishonor the memory of 50,000 young Americans who died in that cause when we give way to feelings of guilt as if we were doing something shameful, and we have been shabby in our treatment of those who returned. They fought as well and as bravely as any Americans have ever fought in any war. They deserve our gratitude, our respect, and our continuing concern.

There is a lesson for all of us in Vietnam. If we are forced to fight, we must have the means and the determination to prevail or we will not have what it takes to secure the peace. And while we are at it, let us tell those who fought in that war that we will never again ask young men to fight and possibly die in a war our government is afraid to let them win.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Ronald (18 August 1980). Address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in Chicago. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=85202&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Campaignbox Zanj Rebellion}}
The '''Zanj Rebellion''' ({{lang-ar|ثورة الزنج}} {{transl|ar|DIN|''Thawrat al-Zanj / Zinj''}}) was a major uprising against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which took place from 869 until 883. Begun near the city of [[Basra]] in present-day southern [[Iraq]] and led by one 'Ali ibn Muhammad, the insurrection is traditionally believed to have involved some enslaved [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people  ([[Zanj]]) who had originally been captured from the coast of [[East Africa]] and transported to the [[Middle East]].{{sfn|Rodriguez|2007|p=585}} It grew to involve many slaves and free men from several regions of the Caliphate, and claimed tens of thousands of lives before it was finally defeated.{{sfn|Furlonge|1999|p=7}}

Several [[List of Muslim historians|Muslim historians]], such as [[al-Tabari]] and [[al-Masudi|al-Mas'udi]], consider the Zanj revolt to be one of the "most vicious and brutal uprisings" of the many disturbances that plagued the Abbasid central government.{{sfn|Furlonge|1999|p=7}} Modern scholars have characterized the conflict as being "one of the bloodiest and most destructive rebellions which the history of [[Western Asia]] records,"{{sfn|Nöldeke|1892|p=174}} while at the same time praising its coverage as being among the "most fully and extensively described campaign[s] in the whole of early Islamic historical writing."{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=153}} The precise composition of the rebels remains a subject of debate, both as regards their identity and as to the proportion of slaves and free among them – available historical sources being open to various interpretations.

==Background==
[[File:أهوار الجنوب.jpg|thumb|300px|Marshland around [[Basra]], southern Iraq.]]
The Zanj were Bantu-speaking slaves who had been imported from Africa and who were primarily utilized for agricultural labor as part of the [[plantation economy]] of southern Iraq. The demand for servile labor during this period was fueled by wealthy residents of the port city of Basra, who had acquired extensive marshlands in the surrounding region. These lands had been abandoned as a result of peasant migration and repeated flooding over time, but they could be converted back into cultivatable status through intensive labor.&lt;ref name="Waines 1992 29–30, 35"&gt;{{harvnb|Waines|1992|pp=29–30, 35}}; {{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=12–25}}; {{harvnb|McKinney|2004|pp=464–65}}; {{harvnb|Lewis|2002|pp=112–13}}; {{harvnb|Nöldeke|1892|pp=148–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local magnates were able to gain ownership of this land on the condition that they would make it arable. As a result, they acquired large numbers of Zanj and other slaves, who were placed into work camps and tasked with clearing away the nitrous topsoil as part of the reclamation process. Other Zanj were used to work in the salt flats of lower Iraq, especially in the area around Basra.&lt;ref name="Waines 1992 29–30, 35"/&gt;

Both the working and living conditions of the Zanj were considered to be extremely miserable. The menial labor they were engaged in was difficult and the slaves appear to have been poorly treated by their masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=12–13, 23–25}}; {{harvnb|McKinney|2004|p=465}}; {{harvnb|Lewis|2002|pp=112–13}}; {{harvnb|Nöldeke|1892|pp=148–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two previous attempts to rebel against these circumstances are known to have occurred in 689–90 and in 694. Both of these revolts had quickly failed and thereafter little is known about their history prior to 869.{{sfn|Popovic|1999|pp=22-23}}

Beginning in 861, the Abbasid Caliphate was weakened by a period of severe disorder known as the [[Anarchy at Samarra]], during which the central government in [[Abbasid Samarra]] was paralyzed by a struggle between the caliphs and the military establishment for control of the state. Throughout the 860s the various factions in the capital were distracted by this conflict, which resulted in the deaths of several caliphs, army commanders and bureaucrats, the outbreak of multiple troop riots, a [[Caliphal Civil War (865–866)|damaging civil war]] in 865–866, and the virtual bankruptcy of the government.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2004 169 ff., 177–78"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|2004|pp=169 ff., 177–78}}; {{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=25–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anarchy in Samarra allowed a number of provinces to fall into the hands of rebels, while provincial governors were free to act in an independent manner in the territories assigned to them. The effective loss of provinces, in turn, resulted in a decrease in taxation revenues received by the central government, further exacerbating the crisis in the capital and crippling the government's ability to effectively respond to challenges against its authority. This continuing instability greatly facilitated the initial success of the Zanj revolt, as the government proved incapable of committing sufficient troops and resources to subdue the rebels.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2004 169 ff., 177–78"/&gt;

=='Ali ibn Muhammad==
[[File:Iraq marshes 1994.jpg|thumb|450px|A map of the [[Mesopotamian Marshes]].]]

The leader of the revolt was a 'Ali ibn Muhammad, an individual of uncertain background. Little is known about his family or early life due to a scarcity of information and conflicting accounts. According to one version, his paternal grandfather was descended from the [[Banu Abdul Qays|'Abd al-Qays]] and his paternal grandmother was a [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] slave woman, while his mother, a free woman, was a member of the [[Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah]]. Some later commentators have presumed him to have been of [[Persian people|Persian]] rather than [[Arabs|Arab]] background, but other historians consider this to be unlikely. 'Ali himself claimed to have been descended from [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the son-in-law of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] and fourth caliph of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], but this was largely rejected by [[List of Muslim historians|Muslim historians]] of the era as false.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waines|1992|p=30}}; {{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=33–35, 150, 155}}; {{harvnb|Talhami|1977|p=453}}; {{harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=113}}; {{harvnb|Nöldeke|1892|pp=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of his origins, 'Ali appears to have spent at least a part of his youth living in the area of [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], and at an unspecified date he moved to the 'Abbasid capital of Samarra, where he mixed with some of the influential slaves of Caliph [[al-Muntasir]] (861-62). In 863, he made his way from Samarra to [[Eastern Arabia|Bahrain]] (modern eastern Arabia), where he pretended to be [[Shia Islam|Shi'i]] and started to rouse the people into rebellion against the caliphate. Support for his cause quickly grew. A large number of Bahranis submitted to his authority and the ''[[kharaj]]'' (land taxes) were collected in his name. Despite this, his rebellion eventually failed due to opposition from the local inhabitants, whereupon 'Ali abandoned the region and relocated to the city of Basra in southern Iraq in 868.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waines|1992|pp=30–32}}; {{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=35–36}}; {{harvnb|Talhami|1977|pp=453–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Basra 'Ali sought to take advantage of disturbances caused by the city's rival groups, the Bilaliyyah and Sa'diyyah, and attempted to secure the support of one of the factions. Eventually he proclaimed a new revolt, but no one in the city rallied to his side and he was forced to flee to the [[Mesopotamian Marshes|marshlands]] of southern Iraq. There he was arrested by the provincial authorities and sent to [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]]. He was quickly able to secure his freedom and went to [[Baghdad]], where he remained for the next year. During his time in Baghdad he claimed to be a [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] by being related to the grandson of [[Zayd ibn Ali]] and won over additional followers for his movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waines|1992|pp=32–33}}; {{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=38–39}}; {{harvnb|Talhami|1977|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When 'Ali heard news about another scuffle between Basra's factions in 869, he returned to the region and "began to seek out black slaves working in the Basra marshes and to inquire into their working conditions and nutritional standards."{{sfn|Talhami|1977|p=454}} He began a campaign to liberate and recruit Zanj and other slaves, promising them freedom and wealth in exchange for their support. A large number of people quickly joined his cause, and 'Ali soon came to be known by the title ''Sāhib az-Zanj'', meaning "Chief of the Zanj". However, 'Ali's movement attracted not only Zanj but many other socially downtrodden peoples. These included "semi-liberated slaves, clients of prestigious families, a number of small craftsmen and humble workers, some peasantry and some [[Bedouin]] peoples who lived around Basrah."&lt;ref name="Talhami455"/&gt;

While he was gaining followers for his rebellion, 'Ali adopted slogans of the egalitarian doctrine of the [[Khawarij|Kharijites]], who "preached that the most qualified man should reign, even if he was an [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] slave."&lt;ref name=Talhami455&gt;{{harvnb|Talhami|1977|p=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; He inscribed his banner and coins with Kharijite expressions&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waines|1992|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Walker|1933|pp=651 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started off his [[Jumu'ah|Friday sermons]] with the slogan "God is great, God is great, there is no God but God, and God is great; there is no arbitration except by God," which was "the war cry used by the Kharijites when they defected from the ranks of Ali ibn Abi Talib during the [[battle of Siffin]]."&lt;ref name="Talhami455"/&gt; At the same time, however, 'Ali did not completely abandon the pretense of being an [[Alids|Alid]] and maintained the claim that he was a Zaydi.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=33, 133-34}}

==Revolt==

[[File:اهوار العراق 03.jpg|thumb|300px|Marshland in Iraq. [[Brown-water navy|Riverine warfare]] on the regional waterways was a major aspect of the revolt.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=154}}]]

The revolt, which began in September 869, was concentrated in the districts of [[Iraq]] and al-Ahwaz (modern [[Khuzestan Province]]) in the central regions of the Abbasid Caliphate.{{sfn|Popovic|1999|p=10}} Over the course of the next fourteen years, the Zanj were able to combat the superior arms of the Abbasid government by waging [[guerrilla warfare]] against their opponents. They became adept at raiding towns, villages and enemy camps (often at night), seizing weapons, horses, food and captives and freeing fellow slaves, and burning the rest to cinders to delay retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waines|1992|pp=36, 55, 59, 109, 110, 111, 121–22, 126, 132, 138, 140, 195, 198}}; {{harvnb|Kennedy|2004|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the rebellion grew in strength, they also constructed fortresses, built up a navy for traversing the canals and rivers of the region, collected taxes in territories under their control, and minted their own coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=81, 130–39}}; {{harvnb|Walker|1933|pp=651 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its initial stages, the rebellion was limited to the region around the city of [[Basra]] and the [[Shatt al-Arab|Blind Tigris]]. Early efforts by the Abbasid government to crush the revolt proved ineffectual, and several towns and villages were occupied or sacked, including al-Ubulla in 870 and [[Ahvaz|Suq al-Ahwaz]] in 871. Basra [[Battle of Basra (871)|fell in September 871]] following an extended blockade, resulting in the city being burned and its inhabitants massacred. A retaliatory campaign undertaken by the caliphal regent [[Al-Muwaffaq|Abu Ahmad ibn al-Mutawakkil]] (known by his honorific of al-Muwaffaq) against the rebels in 872 ended in failure, and the Zanj remained on the offensive over the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waines|1992|pp=38 ff., 108 ff., 120 ff., 136, 137 ff., 152 ff., 156, 158, 164 ff.}}; {{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=45–72}}; {{harvnb|McKinney|2004|pp=464–66}}; {{harvnb|Nöldeke|1892|pp=152–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuing inability of the Abbasid army to suppress the revolt, caused in part by its preoccupation with fighting against the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar|Ya'qub ibn al-Layth]]'s advance into al-Ahwaz and Iraq, eventually encouraged the Zanj to expand their activities to the north. A campaign by the rebels to occupy the [[Mesopotamian Marshes|marshlands]] between Basra and [[Wasit]] in 876 proved successful, and soon they made their way into the district of [[Kashkar|Kaskar]]. By 879, the rebellion reached its furthest extent. Wasit and [[Ramhormoz|Ramhurmuz]] were sacked and the rebels advanced northwest along the [[Tigris]], coming to within fifty miles of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waines|1992|pp=174 ff., 181 ff., 186 ff., 190 ff., 200 ff., 204, 205 ff.}}; {{harvnb|Fields|1987|pp=2 ff., 6, 7 ff.}}; {{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=72–82}}; {{harvnb|McKinney|2004|p=466}}; {{harvnb|Nöldeke|1892|pp=162–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbasid government regained the initiative in the war in late 879, when al-Muwaffaq sent his son [[Al-Mu'tadid|Abu al-'Abbas]] (the future caliph al-Mu'tadid) with a major force against the rebels. Al-Muwaffaq himself joined the offensive in the following year, and over the next several months the government forces succeeded in clearing the rebels out of the districts of Iraq and al-Ahwaz and driving them back toward their "capital" of al-Mukhtarah, to the south of Basra.&lt;ref name="Fields 1987 12 ff., 50 ff., 65 ff., 72 ff., 80, 82 ff., 91 ff., 98 ff., 128 ff"&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|1987|pp=12 ff., 50 ff., 65 ff., 72 ff., 80, 82 ff., 91 ff., 98 ff., 128 ff.}}; {{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=91–122}}; {{harvnb|McKinney|2004|p=468}}; {{harvnb|Nöldeke|1892|pp=164–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Mukhtarah was placed under siege in February 881, and over the next two and half years a policy by al-Muwaffaq of offering generous terms to anyone that voluntarily submitted convinced many of the rebels to abandon the struggle. The fall of al-Mukhtarah in August 883, combined with the death or capture of 'Ali ibn Muhammad and most of the rebel commanders, brought the revolt to an end, and the remaining rebels either surrendered to the government or were killed.&lt;ref name="Fields 1987 12 ff., 50 ff., 65 ff., 72 ff., 80, 82 ff., 91 ff., 98 ff., 128 ff"/&gt;

==Consequences==
The number of people killed in the conflict is difficult to estimate; contemporary writers gave widely variable figures, and these are considered by modern historians to be gross exaggerations.{{sfn|Popovic|1999|p=154}} [[Al-Masudi|Al-Mas'udi]] reported a "moderate" estimate of 500,000 casualties – though he added a clarification that this was "empty conjecture - rigorous calculation [of the amount slain] is impossible" – and separately noted that 300,000 were killed at the [[Battle of Basra (871)|battle of Basra]].{{sfn|Al-Mas'udi|1861–1917|loc=v. 8: pp. 58, 61}} [[Abu Bakr bin Yahya al-Suli|Al-Suli]] gave a figure of 1,500,000 dead, which was subsequently quoted by multiple sources, while [[Ibn al-Tiqtaqa|Ibn al-Taqtaqi]] provided a high-end number of 2,500,000.{{sfn|McKinney|2004|pp=468-69}} [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings|History]]'' contains no comprehensive figures, but the author frequently noted the number of soldiers killed or injured in individual battles, with amounts ranging from hundreds to thousands.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvnb|Waines|1992|pp=51, 55–56, 123, 147}}; {{harvnb|Fields|1987|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebellion greatly disrupted economic activity and caused extensive damage to the districts it took place in. Sources of the revolt describe burnt cities and towns, the seizure of food and other resources by advancing armies, the abandonment of lands and the cessation of agricultural activity, disruptions in the regional trade, and the damaging of bridges and canals in the name of military exigency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waines|1992|pp=110–11, 132, 152, 183, 204}}; {{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=153–54}}; {{harvnb|McKinney|2004|p=465}}; {{harvnb|Nöldeke|1892|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortages of basic necessities, such as food and water, at times became severe, and instances of cannibalism are reported to have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinney|2004|loc=p. 475, who notes a passage in al-Tabari detailing cannibal acts during the siege of al-Mukhtarah, but who expresses doubt on the veracity of the account}}; {{harvnb|Al-Mas'udi|1861–1917|loc=v. 8: p. 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the rebels and their opponents engaged in looting, destroying supplies that were likely to fall into enemy hands, and massacring or executing captives.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari's account contains numerous examples of these activities; see for example {{harvnb|Waines|1992|pp=39–40, 131–32, 140, 178, 198}}; {{harvnb|Fields|1987|pp=25, 26, 33, 36, 55, 121, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long term effects of the revolt, on the other hand, are more difficult to ascertain and opinions by modern historians vary; some like [[Bernard Lewis]] believe that the rebellion resulted in no significant changes, while others such as [[Theodor Nöldeke]] argue that the regions devastated by the conflict never fully recovered afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popovic|1999|pp=153–54, 156–57}}; {{harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Nöldeke|1892|pp=174–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The significant arms and resources that the Abbasid government was required to throw against the Zanj meant that it was forced to divert its attention from other fronts for the duration of the conflict, resulting in the effective loss of several provinces. [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], the [[Tulunids|Tulunid]] governor of [[Egypt]], was able to take advantage of the Abbasids' preoccupation with the Zanj and forge a ''de facto'' independent state which would survive for more than three decades, while the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar|Ya'qub ibn al-Layth]] and [[Amr ibn al-Layth]] seized several of the eastern provinces and faced no serious opposition from the central government until Ya'qub's [[Battle of Dayr al-'Aqul|attempt to march]] on Iraq itself in 876. The revolt may have also affected the government's ability to defend against the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], who scored several successes on the [[Al-'Awasim|Anatolian frontier]] during this period, and possibly even indirectly contributed to the rise of the [[Qarmatians]] of Bahrain a few years later.{{sfn|Popovic|1999|p=153}}

==Historiography==
[[File:Iraqi mudhif interior.jpg|thumb|300px|The interior of a mudhif, a traditional [[Marsh Arab]] guesthouse made entirely out of reeds.]]

Ghada Hashem Talhami, a scholar of the Zanj rebellion, argues that modern views of the revolt are distorted by mistakenly equating the Zanj with East Africans. The assumption that ‘Abbasid writers exclusively used the term "Zanj" to mean specifically the East African coast, and that therefore the people they called Zanj originated from a specific part of that region, is unsupported by contemporary sources due to their silence on the existence of an East African slave trade in this period, as well as by their occasional use of the term to mean "blacks" or "Africa" in general.

Talhami cites from various historians and works to make her point that the rebellion was more of a religious/social uprising made by the lowly classed and suppressed citizens of the Basra area, which included a wide variety of people, including slaves of indeterminate origin. She points out that the sources specifically state that the people referred to as "Zanj" were not the only participants of the revolt, but were joined by Bahranis, Bedouins and others from the Basra region; moreover, they give no explicit indication that the Zanj even constituted a majority of the rebels.{{sfn|Talhami|1977|loc=passim}}

Historian M. A. Shaban has argued that rebellion was not a slave revolt, but a revolt of blacks (''zanj''). In his opinion, although a few runaway slaves did join the revolt, the majority of the participants were Arabs and free East Africans, and if the revolt had been led by slaves, they would have lacked the necessary resources to combat the Abbasid government for as long as they did.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=101-02}}

===Sources of information===
Much of the current knowledge of the Zanj Rebellion comes from the historian al-Tabari's work ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]''.{{sfn|Popovic|1999|loc=p. 161, describes al-Tabari's account as being "by far the best source from every point of view"}} It has been the subject of research by such famous [[oriental studies|Orientalist]]s as [[Theodor Nöldeke]] (''Sketches from Eastern History'') and [[Louis Massignon]] (''The Passion of [[Mansur Al-Hallaj|al-Hallaj]]''). Alexandre Popović has authored a more recent [[monograph]] on the subject.
