The '''2015 Pokémon World Championships''' was the seventh annual [[Electronic Sports|e-Sport]] invite-only tournament held by [[Play! Pokémon]], a division of [[The Pokémon Company]] that unites the top ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' [[video game]] players from around the world. The event was held alongside the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]] World Championships at the [[Hynes Convention Center]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="pokemon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/pokemon-events/pokemon-tournaments/vg-world-championships/|title=Pokémon VG World Championships|work=pokemon.com|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tournament was transmitted with live streaming from the official Pokémon [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] channel. The defending Video Game champions for the year were [[Se Jun Park]] from [[South Korea]] (Masters Division), Nikolai Zielinsky from the [[United States]] (Senior Division) and Kota Yamamoto from [[Japan]] (Junior Division).

== Qualification ==
Players could only gain an invitation to play in the Video Game World Championships by either being the [[2014 Pokémon World Championships|2014 Pokémon World Champions]], or by obtaining enough Championship Points in their respective geographic zone designated by [[Play! Pokémon]]. However, the only exception to this rule are for players from Japan and South Korea, as their tournaments are not overseen by Play! Pokémon and their invites are governed through a different system of qualification.

Since 2014, players were able to earn Championship Points from various tournaments within their geographical region. The tournaments vary in scale, ranging from local Premier Challenges to state-level Regional Championships and finally the large-scale National Championships. The amount of points awarded varies with scale, and players who earn these points are ranked and divided into zones such as North America, Europe and South Africa. This year, two new zones (Latin America and Asia-Pacific) were introduced.

The 2015 Pokémon Video Game World Championship was intended to be played under 2 Swiss tournaments and 1 single-elimination tournament which would then determine the 2015 World Champions. As such, there are two types of invites:
* a regular 'Day One' invite, and
* a 'Day Two' invite, which allows players to receive a bye for the Swiss tournament on the first day.

As an example, the invitations for the Masters Division were distributed as follows:-:&lt;ref name="pokemon.com"/&gt;
* 'Day One' invitation (by Championship Points): 
**'''Top 40''' players from [[North America]]
**'''Top 60''' players from [[Europe]]
**'''Top 18''' players from [[Latin America]]
**'''Top 18''' players from [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]]
**'''Top 2''' players from [[South Africa]]
* 'Day Two' invitation (i.e. 'Day One' bye)
** 2014 World Champion
**'''Top 8''' players from [[North America]] by Championship Points.
**'''Top 16''' players from [[Europe]] by Championship Points.
**'''Top 2''' players from [[Latin America]] by Championship Points.
**'''Top 2''' players from [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] by Championship Points. 
**'''Top 2''' players from [[South Africa]] by Championship Points.
**'''Top 4''' players of the [[South Korea]] Video Game National Championships.
**'''Top 8''' players of the [[Japan]] Video Game National Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuggetbridge.com/news/japans-path-to-the-2015-pokemon-world-championships-announced/|title=Japan's Path to the 2015 Pokémon World Championships Announced - Nugget Bridge|work=Nugget Bridge|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tournament Structure==
The [[Pokémon (video game series)|Video Game]] Championships consisted of 2 [[Swiss system tournament|Swiss tournaments]] and 1 single elimination tournament played across three days.

On Friday (Day 1), all players who earned an invitation without a Day 1 bye were entered into a Swiss tournament, where players with two or fewer losses would advance onto the next round. The second Swiss tournament was then played on Saturday (Day 2), where players who advanced from Day 1 were joined by players who received an invitation with a Day 1 bye.

At the end of the Day 2 Swiss tournament, the top eight players played in single elimination rounds until the last two remain. The finals took place on Sunday (Day 3).

==Weapons controversy==
Two Trading Card Game competitors from [[Iowa]] (Kevin Norton, 18, and James Stumbo, 27) brought weapons in their vehicle, which were recovered by the police. The two posted status updates and images of their weaponry on social media, which were noticed by various ''Pokémon'' fans who treated them as supposed threats against the tournament. The updates were reported to the [[Boston Police Department|Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC)]], who promptly seized their automobile and then stopped them at the door and barred them from entering the Hynes Convention Center on Thursday evening. Police executed a search warrant on Friday and Norton and Stumbo were arrested at their Red Roof Inn room in Saugus just after midnight on Saturday, August 22, 2015.&lt;ref name=GlobeAug23&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Tempera | first1 = Jacqueline | last2 = Sennott | first2 = Adam | title = Threats to Pokémon event were ‘real, serious’: Iowa pair had guns, knife in car, police say | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/08/23/police-arrest-two-heavily-armed-men-who-threatened-pokemon-event/F4Ozm06zDSZCXqT0YSpXnK/story.html | newspaper = [[The Boston Globe]] | date = August 23, 2015 | accessdate = June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2357">'''Aaron ibn Sargado''' or '''Aaron ben R. Joseph ha-Kohen''' ([[Hebrew]]: אהרן הכהן בן יוסף - כלף סרג'דו)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=174&amp;letter=A AARON IBN SAGADO], jewishencyclopedia.com; Article&lt;/ref&gt;) was a tenth-century [[AD]] [[Gaon (Hebrew)|gaon]] ([[Jewish]] religious leader) in [[Pumbedita]], Babylonia. He was a son of Joseph ha-Kohen.

==Biography==

According to the chronicle of [[Sherira]], Sargado was gaon from 943 to 960; others declare he died in 942. He was successor to the gaon [[Hananiah ben R. Yehudai|Hananiah]], the father of Sherira.

Rav Shrira continues to note that Rabbi Ahron HaKohen was not of a family of scholars, but of wealthy merchants, he was elevated to the gaonate (presidency of a rabbinical academy) through the influence of his family. Caleb ibn Sargado, the determined opponent of Saadia, who spent 60,000 ''[[Zuz (Jewish coin)|zuzim]]'' in order to bring about the deposition of the gaon of [[Sura]], was probably identical with Aaron, as [[Harkavy]] has shown (see ''[[Seder 'Olam Zuṭṭa]]'' in "Anecdota Oxoniensia," ii. 83).

==Rabbinic writings==

Four of Sargado's legal decisions on religious problems are preserved, and are printed in the collection, "Ḥemdah Genuza," Nos. 37-40. One of these, it appears, was the answer to an inquiry from [[Kairouan]].

Like his opponent [[Saadia Gaon|Saadia]], Aaron was a Bible commentator, and parts of his commentary are extant in St. Petersburg. [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] quotes some of his philosophical sayings.

'''Abgar VIII''' of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], also known as '''Abgar the Great'''{{sfn|Healey|2009|p=15}}{{sfn|Ball|2016|p=98}}{{sfn | Drijvers | Healey | 1999 | p=37}}{{sfn | Dewing | Kaldellis | Mladjov | 2014 | p=98}}{{sfn | Guscin | 2016 | p=9}}{{efn|It was maintained also that Abgar the Great should be regarded as [[Abgar IX]], however, according to A.

Abgar the Great was most remembered for his alleged conversion to [[Christianity]] in about 200 CE and the declaration of Christianity as the official religion of the city at that time.{{sfn | Guscin | 2016 | p=9}}{{sfn|Ball|2000|p=91}}{{sfn|Shahid|1984|p=47}}
It has been suggested that a cross shown on the tiara of Abgar VIII in coins he minted have Christian meaning.{{sfn|Sayles|1998|p=61}}

Osrhoene was a [[client state]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in this era,{{sfn|Healey|2009|p=15}} Prior to Abgar VIII, in {{CE|165}}, the [[Roman military]] had reinstated [[Abgar VII]]&lt;!-- after what?--&gt;,{{sfn|Healey|2009|p=14f}} and they continued to have a significant presence in the region. However,  Abgar VIII's behavior indicates that he was not wholly loyal to Rome nor was closely monitored by Rome. While Abgar VIII's [[Roman provincial currency|coins]] bear the image of the Roman [[Emperor Commodus]], Abgar's goals were to maintain a degree of independence and to extend his influence geographically as much as possible without disturbing the greater powers of Rome and [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]].{{sfn|Ross|2000|p=46}}
Abgar VIII supported [[Pescennius Niger]] as Roman Emperor in {{CE|193}}, who was swiftly challenged and deposed by the Emperor [[Septimius Severus]]. Abgar VIII's submission to Septimus Severus is portrayed on the [[Arch of Severus]] in Rome. He was not deposed, but Osrhoene was made a [[Roman province]] and Abgar's kingdom was reduced to a [[rump state]] containing just the city of Edessa.{{sfn|Ball|2016|p=98}} Abgar was fully reconciled with Septimus Severus and was later received with honor as a guest of Septimus Severus in Rome. In an additional display of loyalty, Abgar VIII took Severus' name as his own.{{sfn|Healey|2009|p=15}}

'''Adelaide of Guelders''' ({{circa|1182}} &amp;ndash; 1218) was the daughter of Count [[Otto I, Count of Guelders|Otto I]] of Guelders and his wife, [[Richardis of Bavaria|Richardis]], the daughter of Duke [[Otto I of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto I]] of Bavaria and [[Agnes of Loon]]. Also known as Adelaide of Bellich or Alice of Guelders.

In 1197 in [[Stavoren]], she married Count [[William I, Count of Holland|William I]] of Holland.  They had five children:
# [[Floris IV, Count of Holland|Floris IV]] (24 June 1210 in [[The Hague]]&amp;ndash;19 July 1234 in [[Corbie]], [[France]]), succeeded his father as [[Count of Holland]]
# [[Otto III van Holland|Otto]] (d. 1249), Regent of Holland in 1238–1239, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|Bishop of Utrecht]]
# William (d. 1238), Regent of Holland in 1234–1238.
# Richarda (d. 1262)
# Ada (d. 1258), Abbess at [[Rijnsburg]] from 1239 until her death

Adelaide died in 1218, while her husband was away on the [[Fifth Crusade]].  She was buried in [[Rijnsburg Abbey]].

'''Astrobiology''' is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the [[abiogenesis|origins]], [[Protocell|early evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]].

The term was first proposed by the Russian ([[Soviet]]) astronomer [[Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov|Gavriil Tikhov]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cockell |first=Charles S. |title='Astrobiology' and the ethics of new science |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Cockell/publication/42790151_%27Astrobiology%27_and_the_ethics_of_new_science/links/0a85e530540978d399000000/Astrobiology-and-the-ethics-of-new-science.pdf |format=PDF |date=2001 |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews  |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=90–96 |doi=10.1179/0308018012772533}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Astrobiology'' is etymologically derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄστρον}}, ''astron'', "constellation, star"; {{lang|grc|βίος}}, ''bios'', "life"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', ''study''. The synonyms of astrobiology are diverse; however, the synonyms were structured in relation to the most important sciences implied in its development: [[astronomy]] and [[biology]]. A close synonym is ''exobiology'' from the Greek {{lang|grc|Έξω}}, "external"; Βίος, ''bios'', "life"; and λογία, -logia, ''study''. The term exobiology was coined by molecular biologist and Nobel Prize winner [[Joshua Lederberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/BB/p-nid/32 Launching a New Science: Exobiology and the Exploration of Space] ''The National Library of Medicine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Exobiology is considered to have a narrow scope limited to search of life external to Earth, whereas subject area of astrobiology is wider and investigates the link between life and the [[universe]], which includes the search for extraterrestrial life, but also includes the study of life on Earth, its origin, evolution and limits.

Another term used in the past is [[xenobiology]], ("biology of the foreigners") a word used in 1954 by science fiction writer [[Robert Heinlein]] in his work ''[[The Star Beast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinlein R, Harold W|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Xenobiology |journal=Science |date=21 July 1961 |pages=223, 225 | doi=10.1126/science.134.3473.223 |jstor=1708323 |volume=134 |issue=3473|bibcode = 1961Sci...134..223H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term xenobiology is now used in a more specialized sense, to mean "biology based on foreign chemistry", whether of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (possibly synthetic) origin. Since alternate chemistry analogs to some life-processes have been created in the laboratory, xenobiology is now considered as an extant subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Markus Schmidt | title=Xenobiology: A new form of life as the ultimate biosafety tool | journal=BioEssays | date=9 March 2010 | pages=322–331 | doi=10.1002/bies.200900147 | volume=32 | issue=4 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.200900147/abstract | pmid=20217844 | pmc=2909387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is an emerging and developing field, the question of whether [[life]] exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of [[science|scientific]] inquiry.&lt;ref name="NAT-20170216"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Livio |first=Mario |title=Winston Churchill's essay on alien life found |url=http://www.nature.com/news/winston-churchill-s-essay-on-alien-life-found-1.21467 |date=15 February 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=542 |issue=7641 |pages=289–291 |doi=10.1038/542289a |accessdate=18 February 2017 |bibcode = 2017Natur.542..289L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170215"&gt;{{cite news |last=De Freytas-Tamura |first=Kimiko |title=Winston Churchill Wrote of Alien Life in a Lost Essay |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/world/europe/winston-churchill-aliens.html |date=15 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formalized field of study. Planetary scientist [[David Grinspoon]] calls astrobiology a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown, in known scientific theory.&lt;ref&gt;Grinspoon 2004&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's interest in exobiology first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program, which is now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Living Universe: NASA and the Development of Astrobiology |author1=Steven J.

NASA's [[Viking program|Viking missions]] to Mars, launched in 1976, included [[Viking biological experiments|three biology experiments]] designed to look for [[metabolism]] of present [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].

Advancements in the fields of astrobiology, observational astronomy and discovery of large varieties of [[extremophile]]s with extraordinary capability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth, have led to speculation that life may possibly be thriving on many of the extraterrestrial bodies in the universe. A particular focus of current astrobiology research is the search for [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]] due to this planet's proximity to Earth and geological history. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that Mars has previously had a considerable amount of [[Water on Mars|water on its surface]],&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=T. |date=2000 |title=Argyre Planitia and the Mars Global Hydrologic Cycle |volume=XXXI |bibcode=2000LPI....31.2033P |journal=Lunar and Planetary Science |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2000/pdf/2033.pdf |format=PDF |last2=Clifford |first2=S.

Missions specifically designed to search for current life on Mars were the [[Viking program]] and [[Beagle 2]] probes. The Viking results were inconclusive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Viking Biological Investigation: Preliminary Results |journal=Science |date=1 October 1976 |vauthors=Klein HP, Levin GV|lastauthoramp=yes |volume=194 |issue=4260 |pages=99–105 |doi=10.1126/science.194.4260.99 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/4260/99 |accessdate=15 August 2008 |pmid=17793090 |bibcode = 1976Sci...194...99K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Beagle 2 failed minutes after landing.&lt;ref name="BBC News 16 Jan 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |title=Lost Beagle2 probe found 'intact' on Mars |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-30784886|date=16 January 2015 |work=[[BBC]] |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A future mission with a strong astrobiology role would have been the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]], designed to study the frozen moons of Jupiter—some of which may have liquid water—had it not been cancelled. In late 2008, the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]] probed the environment for past and present [[planetary habitability]] of [[microbe|microbial]] [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]], and researched the history of water there.

The [[European Space Agency]]'s astrobiology roadmap from 2016, identified five main research topics, and specifies several key scientific objectives for each topic. The five research topics are:&lt;ref name='ESA AstRoMap 2016'&gt;[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/ast.2015.1441 AstRoMap European Astrobiology Roadmap].

In November 2011, NASA launched the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission carrying the [[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity'']] rover, which [[Curiosity rover#Landing|landed]] on Mars at [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name="Gale Crater"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webster |first1=Guy |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover To Land At Gale Crater |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[NASA JPL]] |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-222#1 |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale Crater2"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Chow |first1=Dennis |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover to Land at Huge Gale Crater |url=http://www.space.com/12394-nasa-mars-rover-landing-site-unveiled.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale Crater3"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Mars rover aims for deep crater |date=22 July 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate = 22 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722170810/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524| archivedate= 22 July 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Curiosity'' rover is currently probing the environment for past and present [[planetary habitability]] of [[microbe|microbial]] [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].

==Methodology==

=== Planetary habitability ===
{{Main|Planetary habitability}}

When looking for life on other planets like Earth, some simplifying assumptions are useful to reduce the size of the task of the astrobiologist. One is the informed assumption that the vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on [[Carbon-based life|carbon chemistries]], as are all life forms on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2000 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075201/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |archivedate=20 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of [[molecule]]s that can be formed around it. Carbon is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element]] in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and [[organic compound|complex molecules]].

The presence of liquid water is an assumed requirement, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/astrobiology-spsc-04/ |title=Astrobiology |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Science Library: Space Sciences. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers posit environments of water-[[ammonia]] mixtures as possible solvents for [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article2057.html |title=The Ammonia-Oxidizing Gene |accessdate=20 October 2008 |author=Penn State |date=19 August 2006 |publisher=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting [[Sun]]-like [[star]]s for increased probabilities of [[planetary habitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |title=Stars and Habitable Planets |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2007 |publisher=Sol Company |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001194624/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |archivedate=1 October 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might not have time to emerge on [[planet]]s orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be [[Tidal lock|tidally "locked"]] to the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/display/?id=223364&amp;source=r |title=M Dwarfs: The Search for Life is On |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=29 August 2005 |publisher=Red Orbit &amp; [[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long lifetimes of [[red dwarf]]s could allow the development of habitable environments on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See [[Habitability of red dwarf systems]]).

Since Earth is the only planet known to harbor [[life]], there is no evident way to know if any of these simplifying assumptions are correct.

===Communication attempts===
{{Main|Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence}}
[[File:Pioneer10-plaque tilt.jpg|right|thumb|The illustration on the [[Pioneer plaque]] ]]
Research on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence ([[Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence|CETI]]) focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. Communication attempts by humans have included broadcasting mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the [[Arecibo message]] and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication. The [[SETI]] program, for example, uses both [[radio telescope]]s and [[optical telescope]]s to search for deliberate signals from an  [[extraterrestrial intelligence]].

While some high-profile scientists, such as [[Carl Sagan]], have advocated the transmission of messages,&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl. Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence. MIT Press, 1973, 428 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/you-never-get-a-seventh-chance-to-make-a-first-impression-an-awkward-history-of-our-space-transmissions/| title=You Never Get a Seventh Chance to Make a First Impression: An Awkward History of Our Space Transmissions| work=Lightspeed Magazine| accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientist [[Stephen Hawking]] warned against it, suggesting that aliens might simply raid Earth for its resources and then move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/25/stephen-hawking-aliens_n_551035.html|title=Stephen Hawking: Humans Should Fear Aliens|date=2010-06-25|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements of astrobiology===

==== Astronomy ====
{{Main|Astronomy}}
[[Image:OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb planet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Artist's impression of the [[extrasolar planet]] [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] orbiting its star 20,000 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]]; this planet was discovered with [[gravitational microlensing]].]]
[[Image:Telescope Kepler-NASA.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The [[NASA]] [[Kepler mission]], launched in March 2009, searches for [[extrasolar planets]].]]
Most astronomy-related astrobiology research falls into the category of [[extrasolar planet]] (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably [[NASA]]'s [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) and [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] programs, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' mission]] in March 2009, and the [[French Space Agency]] launched the [[COROT]] space mission in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/ |title=Kepler Mission |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2008 |publisher=NASA | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081031070350/http://kepler.nasa.gov/| archivedate= 31 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |title=The COROT space telescope |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=17 October 2008 |publisher=CNES |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108130307/http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |archivedate=8 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway.

The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]]. By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vpl.astro.washington.edu/main/about_vpl.html |title=The Virtual Planet Laboratory |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2008 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.

An estimate for the number of planets with intelligent ''communicative'' [[extraterrestrial life]] can be gleaned from the [[Drake equation]], essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm |title=What is the Drake Equation? |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Ford |first=Steve |date=August 1995 |publisher=SETI League | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081029212425/http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm| archivedate= 29 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N = R^{*} ~ \times ~ f_{p} ~ \times ~ n_{e} ~ \times ~ f_{l} ~ \times ~ f_{i} ~ \times ~ f_{c} ~ \times ~ L&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* '''''N''''' = The number of communicative civilizations
* '''''R*''''' = The rate of formation of suitable stars (stars such as our Sun)
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of those stars with planets (current evidence indicates that planetary systems may be common for stars like the Sun)
* '''''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The number of Earth-sized worlds per planetary system
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of those Earth-sized planets where life actually develops
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of life sites where intelligence develops
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of communicative planets (those on which electromagnetic communications technology develops)
* '''''L''''' = The "lifetime" of communicating civilizations

However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not usable to generate or support [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, '''''R*''''', number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, ''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', stars with planets and ''f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/seti/seti_history_07.html|author=Amir Alexander| title=The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Short History – Part 7: The Birth of the Drake Equation}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or [[pseudoscientific]] arguments.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 17 January 2011 | date = 26 September 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101212184044/http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html| archivedate= 12 December 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another associated topic is the [[Fermi paradox]], which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the [[universe]], then there should be obvious signs of it.

Another active research area in astrobiology is [[planetary system]] formation. It has been suggested that the peculiarities of the [[Solar System]] (for example, the presence of [[Jupiter]] as a protective shield)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=999 |title=Jupiter: Friend or foe? |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Horner |first=Jonathan |author2=Barrie Jones |date=24 August 2007 |publisher=Europlanet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65SpMGrmN?url=http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=999 |archivedate=15 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on our planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=3910 |title=The Role Of Astrobiology in Solar System Exploration |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last1=Jakosky |first1=Bruce |author2=David Des Marais |date=14 September 2001 |work=NASA |publisher=SpaceRef.com |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1222 |title=Coming Soon: "Good" Jupiters |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Bortman |first=Henry |date=29 September 2004 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1970s, [[life]] was thought to be entirely dependent on energy from the [[Sun]]. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from [[sunlight]] to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process that is then consumed by oxygen-respiring organisms, passing their energy up the [[food chain]]. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was thought to obtain its nourishment either from consuming [[marine snow|organic detritus rained down from the surface waters]] or from eating animals that did.&lt;ref name="smoker"&gt;{{cite web |title= Black Smokers and Giant Worms |author=Chamberlin, Sean |date=1999 |work=Fullerton College |url=http://www.courseworld.com/ocean/smokers.html |accessdate=11 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  world's ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to [[sunlight]]. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the deep-sea exploration submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', scientists discovered colonies of [[giant tube worm]]s, [[clam]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[mussel]]s, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as [[black smoker]]s.&lt;ref name="smoker"/&gt; These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprise an entirely independent [[ecosystem]]. Although most of these multicellular lifeforms need dissolved oxygen (produced by oxygenic photosynthesis) for their aerobic cellular respiration and thus are not completely independent from sunlight by themselves, the basis for their food chain is a form of [[bacterium]] that derives its energy from [[Redox|oxidization]] of reactive chemicals, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]], that bubble up from the Earth's interior. Other lifeforms entirely decoupled from the energy from sunlight are green sulphur bacteria which are capturing geothermal light for anoxygenic photosynthesis or bacteria running chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium.&lt;ref name="Trixler2013"&gt;{{cite journal | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768233/pdf/COC-17-1758.pdf|last=Trixler|first=F|title=Quantum tunnelling to the origin and evolution of life.|journal=Current Organic Chemistry|date=2013|volume=17|number=16|pages=1758–1770|doi=10.2174/13852728113179990083|pmc=3768233|pmid=24039543}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[chemosynthesis]] revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life need not be sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

[[Extremophiles]], organisms able to survive in extreme environments, are a core research element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] which are able to survive several kilometers below the ocean's surface near [[hydrothermal vent]]s and [[microbe]]s that thrive in highly acidic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/050207_extremophiles.html |title=Wild Things: The Most Extreme Creatures |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |date=7 February 2005 |work=Live Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life.&lt;ref name=Cavicchioli &gt;{{cite journal| title=Extremophiles and the search for extraterrestrial life|journal=Astrobiology|date=Fall 2002 |first=R. |last=Cavicchioli |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=281–92 |pmid=12530238 |doi=10.1089/153110702762027862 |bibcode = 2002AsBio...2..281C |url=http://somosbacteriasyvirus.com/extremophiles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats.

The origin of life, known as [[abiogenesis]], distinct from the [[Evolution#Evolution of life|evolution of life]], is another ongoing field of research. [[Oparin]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane]] postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive to the formation of [[organic compound]]s from [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic elements]] and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of [[panspermia]] is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the [[panspermia]] hypothesis.

====Astroecology====
{{Main|Astroecology}}
[[Astroecology]] concerns the interactions of life with space environments and resources, in [[planets]], [[asteroids]] and [[comets]]. On a larger scale, astroecology concerns resources for life about [[stars]] in the [[galaxy]] through the cosmological future. Astroecology attempts to quantify future life in space, addressing this area of astrobiology.

Experimental astroecology investigates resources in planetary soils, using actual space materials in [[meteorite]]s.&lt;ref name = "AstroecologyIcarus2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary bioresources and astroecology. 1.

==== Astrogeology ====
{{Main|Geology of solar terrestrial planets}}
[[Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Astrogeology]] is a [[planetary science]] discipline concerned with the [[geology]] of [[celestial bodies]] such as the [[planet]]s and their [[moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteorite]]s. The information gathered by this discipline allows the measure of a [[planet]]'s or a [[natural satellite]]'s potential to develop and sustain [[life]], or [[planetary habitability]].

An additional discipline of astrogeology is [[geochemistry]], which involves study of the [[chemistry|chemical]] composition of the Earth and other [[planet]]s, chemical processes and reactions that govern the composition of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and [[soil]]s, the cycles of matter and energy and their interaction with the [[hydrosphere]] and the [[atmosphere]] of the planet. Specializations include [[cosmochemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[organic geochemistry]].

The [[fossil record]] provides the oldest known evidence for life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html |title=Fossil Succession |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=14 August 1997 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081014190106/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html| archivedate= 14 October 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining the fossil evidence, [[paleontologists]] are able to better understand the types of organisms that arose on the early Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the [[Pilbara]] in [[Western Australia]] and the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] of Antarctica, are also considered to be geological analogs to regions of Mars, and as such, might be able to provide clues on how to search for past [[life on Mars]].

The various organic functional groups, composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a host of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide the enormous diversity of chemical reactions necessarily catalyzed by a living [[organism]]. Silicon, in contrast, interacts with only a few other atoms, and the large silicon molecules are monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules.&lt;ref name=BC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; Indeed, it seems likely that the basic building blocks of life anywhere will be similar  those on Earth, in the generality if not in the detail.&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; Although terrestrial life and life that might arise independently of Earth are expected to use many similar, if not identical, building blocks, they also are expected to have some biochemical qualities that are unique. If life has had a comparable impact elsewhere in the Solar System, the relative abundances of chemicals key for its survival – whatever they may be – could betray its presence. Whatever extraterrestrial life may be, its tendency to chemically alter its environment might just give it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Michael | title = Telltale chemistry could betray ET | date = 21 January 2011 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20927962.700-telltale-chemistry-could-betray-et.html | work = New Scientists | accessdate = 22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two of the natural atoms, [[carbon]] and [[silicon]], are known to serve as the backbones of molecules sufficiently large to carry biological information. As the structural basis for life, one of carbon's important features is that unlike silicon, it can readily engage in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thereby allowing for the chemical versatility required to conduct the reactions of biological metabolism and propagation.

== Rare Earth hypothesis ==
{{Main|Rare Earth hypothesis}}

The Rare Earth hypothesis postulates that multicellular life forms found on Earth may actually be more of a rarity than scientists assume. It provides a possible answer to the Fermi paradox which suggests, "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?" It is apparently in opposition to the [[principle of mediocrity]], assumed by famed astronomers [[Frank Drake]], [[Carl Sagan]], and others. The Principle of Mediocrity suggests that life on Earth is not exceptional, but rather that life is more than likely to be found on innumerable other worlds.

;Methane
In 2004, the spectral signature of [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}) was detected in the Martian atmosphere by both Earth-based telescopes as well as by the ''[[Mars Express]]'' orbiter. Because of [[solar radiation]] and [[cosmic radiation]], methane is predicted to disappear from the Martian atmosphere within several years, so the gas must be actively replenished in order to maintain the present concentration.&lt;ref name="results"&gt;

;Planetary systems
It is possible that some exoplanets may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's [[Kepler Mission]] seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's [[light curve]] as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimeter astronomy]] has revealed the constituents of other [[star system]]s.

;Planetary habitability
{{main|Planetary habitability}}
Efforts to answer questions such as the abundance of potentially habitable planets in [[habitable zone]]s and chemical precursors have had much success. Numerous [[extrasolar planet]]s have been detected using the [[Doppler spectroscopy|wobble method]] and [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transit method]], showing that planets around other [[star]]s are more numerous than previously postulated. The first Earth-sized extrasolar planet to be discovered within its star's habitable zone is [[Gliese 581 c]].&lt;ref name="Gliese"&gt;{{cite news | first=Ker | last=Than | title=Major Discovery: New Planet Could Harbor Water and Life | date=24 April 2007 | publisher=Space.com | url =http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html | pages = | accessdate =20 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081015075030/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html| archivedate= 15 October 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missions ==
Research into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme [[ecosystem]]s is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life. Missions such as the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]], [[ExoMars]], [[Mars 2020]] rover to Mars, and the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' probe]] to [[Saturn]]'s moons aim to further explore the possibilities of life on other planets in the Solar System.

;''Viking'' program
{{main|Viking lander biological experiments}}
[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] posing with a model of the Viking Lander.]]
The two [[Viking program|Viking landers]] each carried four types of biological experiments to the surface of Mars in the late 1970s. These were the only Mars landers to carry out experiments looking specifically for [[metabolism]] by current microbial [[Life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]. The landers used a robotic arm to collect soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. The two landers were identical, so the same tests were carried out at two places on Mars' surface; [[Viking 1]] near the equator and [[Viking 2]] further north.&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{Cite book

An '''automated personal assistant''' or an '''Intelligent Personal Assistant''' is a mobile [[software agent]] that can perform tasks, or services, on behalf of an individual based on a combination of user input, location awareness, and the ability to access information from a variety of online sources (such as weather conditions, traffic congestion, news, stock prices, user schedules, retail prices, etc.).

There are two types of automated personal assistants: intelligent automated assistants (for example, [[Apple Inc.|Apple’s]] [[Siri (software)|Siri]] and Tronton’s Cluzee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann Dwyer |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20120117/BLOGS06/120119828 |title=Giving Siri a run for her money |publisher=Crain's Chicago Business |date=2012-01-17 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which perform [[concierge]]-type tasks (e.g., making dinner reservations, purchasing event tickets, making travel arrangements) or provide information based on voice input or commands; and smart personal agents, which automatically perform management or data-handling tasks based on online information and events often without user initiation or interaction.

According to Chi-Hua Chien&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chi-hua-chien |title=Chi-Hua Chien  |publisher=CrunchBase |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], examples of tasks that may be performed by a smart personal agent-type of automated personal assistant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rip Empson |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/29/three-companies-chi-hua-chien-of-kleiner-perkins-would-love-to-invest-in/ |title=Three Companies Chi-Hua Chien Of Kleiner Perkins Would Love To Invest In |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; include schedule management (e.g., sending an alert to a dinner date that a user is running late due to traffic conditions, update schedules for both parties, and change the restaurant reservation time) and personal health management (e.g., monitoring caloric intake, heart rate and exercise regimen, then making recommendations for healthy choices).

Both types of automated personal assistant technology are enabled by the combination of [[Mobile device|mobile computing devices]], [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), and the proliferation of [[mobile apps]].  However, intelligent automated assistants are designed to perform specific, one-off tasks specified by user voice instructions, while smart personal agents perform ongoing tasks (e.g., schedule management) autonomously.{{fact|date=February 2016}}&lt;!--need to establish these are the standard definitions for these terms--&gt;

The company's name is an [[acronym]] for "California Life Company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Pollack|first1 = Andrew|last2 = Miller|first2 = Claire Cain|title = Tech Titans Form Biotechnology Company|url = http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/google-and-former-genentech-chief-announce-new-biotech-company/|accessdate = 18 January 2015|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = 18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page|first1=Larry|title=2013 Founders' Letter|url=http://investor.google.com/corporate/2013/founders-letter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Google restructured into [[Alphabet Inc.]], making Calico a subsidiary of the new company along with Google and others. As of 2018, Calico has not developed any known drugs or biotechnology products.&lt;ref name="bloomberg2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Womack|first1=Brian|title=Google Creates New Company Called Alphabet, Restructures Stock|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-10/google-to-adopt-new-holding-structure-under-name-alphabet-|accessdate=10 August 2015|agency=Bloomberg|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships and staff ==
In September 2014, it was announced that Calico, in partnership with [[AbbVie]], would be opening up an R&amp;D facility focused on aging and age-related diseases, such as [[neurodegeneration]] and [[cancer]]. Initially, each company will invest $350 million, with an option for each to add an extra $500 million later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AbbVie and Calico Announce a Novel Collaboration to Accelerate the Discovery, Development, and Commercialization of New Therapies|url=http://www.calicolabs.com/news/2014/09/03/|date=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Calico announced a partnership with the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]] and 2M Companies regarding drug development for neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UT Southwestern researchers discover novel class of NAMPT activators for neurodegenerative disease; Calico enters into exclusive collaboration with 2M to develop UTSW technology|url=http://www.calicolabs.com/news/2014/09/11/|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Broad Institute|Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard]] announced a partnership with Calico to "advance research on age-related diseases and therapeutics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Institute and Calico announce an extensive collaboration focused on the biology of aging and therapeutic approaches to diseases of aging|url=https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/6633}}&lt;/ref&gt; a further partnership also was announced with the [[Buck Institute for Research on Aging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google's Calico continues its partnering romp on aging R&amp;D with Buck collaboration|url=http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/googles-calico-continues-its-partnering-romp-aging-rd-buck-collaboration/2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, Calico announced a partnership with [[California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences|QB3]] based on researching the biology of aging and identifying potential therapeutics for age-related diseases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calico and QB3 announce partnership to conduct research into the biology of aging and to identify potential therapeutics for age-related diseases|url=http://www.calicolabs.com/news/2015/03/24/|accessdate=6 June 2015|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one with AncestryDNA based on conducting research into the genetics of human lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AncestryDNA and Calico to Research the Genetics of Human Lifespan|url=http://www.calicolabs.com/news/2015/07/21/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capital punishment in Iceland''' was practiced until 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=4649|title=Hvenær var síðasta aftakan á Íslandi?|work=Vísindavefurinn|access-date=2018-04-22|language=is}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capital punishment was abolished in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1999|title=Hvar er dauðarefsing leyfð? Hvers vegna er henni beitt? Fækkar hún glæpum?|work=Vísindavefurinn|access-date=2018-04-22|language=is}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] (930–1262), having no central executive powers, did not apply capital punishment.  It was, however, possible for the [[Althing]] to declare a man ''réttdræpur'' (English: "rightfully killable").  This made the killing of the person in question legal—although the executive power was invested in whosoever cared to pursue it, instead of being the duty of state officials.

==History==
From 1550 to 1830, approximately 240 individuals were executed in Iceland.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/240-aftokur-a-islandi-a-um-200-arum|title=240 aftökur á Íslandi á um 200 árum|date=2018-10-13|work=RÚV|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Execution methods included [[beheading]], hanging, [[burning at the stake]] and drowning. Whereas men were more commonly beheaded or hanged, women were instead lowered into the river directly next to the [[Law Rock]] itself with ropes, to either freeze to death or drown.

According to archeologist Steinunn Kristjánsdóttir, women were drowned when found guilty of infanticide, incestuous couples were beheaded, murderers were beheaded, thieves were hung and individuals found guilty of witchcraft were burned at the stake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Executed individuals lost the right to burial in church cemeteries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later, when [[Iceland]] fell under the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish Crown]], Danish laws applied, more or less. The frequency of capital punishment increased considerably with the adoption of [[Lutheranism]] in the 17th century, but gradually disappeared by the mid-19th century.

==Last execution==
The last application of capital punishment in [[Iceland]] took place on January 12, 1830, in Vatnsdalshólar in [[Austur-Húnavatnssýsla|Húnavatnssýsla]].  The convicts were Agnes Magnúsdóttir, a farmhand, and Friðrik Sigurðsson, a farmer's son from Katadalur. Their crime was the murder of two men on March 14, 1828: Natan Ketilsson, a farmer of Illugastaðir, and Pétur Jónsson of the "Geitaskarð" farm. They were executed by beheading.

The last capital punishment sentence took place in 1913, but the sentence was later changed to a prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kjarninn.is/skyring/2016-11-04-deyjandi-osidur/|title=Deyjandi (ó)siður|date=2016-11-06|work=Kjarninn|access-date=2018-04-22|language=is-IS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This case was the basis for a 1995 [[Cinema of Iceland|Icelandic film]] ''[[Agnes (film)|Agnes]]'' by Egill Eðvarðsson and novel, ''[[Burial Rites]]'' by Australian writer [[Hannah Kent]] (May 2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betterread.com.au/book/burial-rites-book-9781742612829.do] Trade review.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
Four years later, the last execution of an Icelander was carried out in [[Denmark]].  After 1830, dozens of Icelanders were found guilty of a crime punishable by death.  Most of the cases were [[infanticide]]s, where women who were unable to care for their newly-born illegitimate children would kill them.  However, they were all granted a clemency by the [[King of Denmark]]. In 1869, a new law took effect in Iceland, harmonising Icelandic and Danish law—this law abolished the death penalty for lesser offences.  In 1928 the death penalty was abolished entirely, and has not since had a place in Icelandic law.

Since the 1995 revision of the [[constitution of Iceland|constitution]], the reintroduction of capital punishment is unconstitutional.

'''Charles Burke Elbrick''', (March 25, 1908 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] – April 12, 1983 in [[Washington, D.C.]]), was a United States [[diplomat]] and career [[United States Foreign Service|foreign service officer]]. During his career, he served three [[ambassador]]ships: in Portugal, Yugoslavia and Brazil, in addition to numerous minor postings.

Elbrick spoke Portuguese, Spanish, French and German, and was regarded as an expert on [[Iberia]] and [[Eastern Europe]] after World War II.

==Early life and education==
Elbrick was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the son of Charles Elbrick and his Irish wife Lillian Burke, and raised as a [[Roman Catholic]]. Transferring after a freshman year at the [[University of Notre Dame]], he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Williams College]] in 1929, narrowly missing selection for a [[Rhodes Scholarship]]. He had aimed to begin a career in publishing in New York, but the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] persuaded him to work instead for the US Government.  He therefore studied languages to prepare for a career with the [[United States Department of State]].

==Foreign service career==
Commissioned into the [[United States Foreign Service]] in 1931, Elbrick was initially appointed Vice Consul in [[Panama]], and then Southampton, England. He next served as Third Secretary at Port-au-Prince, [[Haiti]], before transferring in that rank to [[Warsaw, Poland]] in 1937. In 1939, Elbrick followed the Polish government into exile after the [[Invasion of Poland|invasion by the German Nazi army]]. While leaving Warsaw in convoy, the diplomatic convoy was strafed by German planes, and Elbrick had to leap to cover in a roadside ditch.  He joined the Polish government-in-exile at Angers, France. When the German [[blitzkrieg]] smashed into France in the spring of 1940, Elbrick had to flee again, this time to Spain.  He spent most of World War II as an embassy official in Lisbon, and as consul in Tangier.  During this time he added Portuguese to his other foreign languages, which were German, French and Spanish.

After the war, Elbrick returned to Poland in June 1945 to reopen the US Embassy, then went to the [[State Department]] as assistant chief of the Division of East European Affairs. He served as Counselor at the U.S. Embassy in [[Havana]] from 1949 to 1951.  In 1951 and 1952, he served respectively as Counselor of [[Embassy of the United States, London|the US Embassy in London]] and [[Embassy of the United States, Paris|then in Paris]] and as a delegate to the [[North Atlantic Council]].

From 1953 to 1957 Elbrick was deputy assistant secretary of State for European affairs, and was promoted to [[Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs]] in 1957. Thereafter, Ambassador Elbrick was variously the representative of the United States to [[Portugal]] (1958), [[Yugoslavia]] (1964), and [[Brazil]] (1969).

In August 1968, when Soviet-led forces [[Prague spring|invaded Czechoslovakia]], Elbrick, then Ambassador in [[Belgrade]], was summoned by [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] and asked about United States policy toward Yugoslavia. "The same as always", Elbrick said. "To support Yugoslav independence and integrity. Do you need any help?" "Not now", said Tito, thanking Ambassador Elbrick for inquiring.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

A year later, while stationed in Brazil, Elbrick was kidnapped from a road-block on September 4, 1969, and held for 78 hours by the [[Revolutionary Movement 8th October]] (MR-8) in [[Rio de Janeiro]].  The ambassador's driver was released unharmed with a note demanding the release of 15 unnamed political prisoners and the publication of a three-page manifesto from [[Revolutionary Movement 8th October]].  If the demands were not met within 48 hours, MR-8 threatened to carry out 'revolutionary justice', by executing Elbrick. The ambassador was released in exchange for the government's release of fifteen political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Newton |first=Michael |title= ELBRICK, Charles Burke |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EZjlE4-1GSIC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=rio+15+political+prisoners+elbrick&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_z-rEutnKAhUDJB4KHQPGAGcQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rio%2015%20political%20prisoners%20elbrick&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 February 2016 |work=The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings |location=Checkmark Books  |date=1 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnapping occurred as a means to bring media attention to the repression, imprisonment and torture of Brazilian citizens by the Brazilian military regime. Ambassador Elbrick remarked, "Being an ambassador is not always a bed of roses."

In 1969, Ambassador Elbrick was honored by the [[Richard Nixon|President of the United States]] with the rank of [[List of United States Foreign Service Career Ambassadors|Career Ambassador]], the highest in the Foreign Service, in recognition of especially distinguished service over a sustained period. Following his retirement in 1973, Elbrick was awarded the Foreign Service Cup by his fellow Foreign Service officers.  He resided in Washington DC, and Gilbertsville, New York. Ambassador Elbrick received an honorary doctorate from [[Hartwick College]] in Oneonta, New York.

==Family==
Elbrick married Elvira Lindsay Johnson (1910–1990) at [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle|St. Matthew's Cathedral]], Washington DC, on July 27, 1932. Elvira was the daughter of Hannah Cox Harris (descendant of Thomas Harris, addressee of the [[Rhode Island Royal Charter]] of 1663), and [[Alfred Wilkinson Johnson]], later a Vice Admiral in the US Navy. Elvira's mother was a direct descendant of [[Abijah Gilbert]], the founder of [[Gilbertsville, New York]] (1787). Her father was the son of Rear Admiral [[Philip Carrigan Johnson]], by her namesake Elvira Lindsay Acevedo of [[Talcahuano]] (Chile),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Elward |first=Ronald |title= Belmonte, op cit 37 |url= http://heirsofeurope.blogspot.co.uk/2010/01/granito-pignatelli.html |accessdate=1 February 2016 |work=The Heirs of Europe |location=Online  |date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nephew of celebrated painter and co-founder of the [[Metropolitan Museum]], [[Eastman Johnson]].

Elbrick and Elvira had two children: Alfred (born 1938) and Valerie (born 1942). Elbrick was survived by his wife, children, and six grandchildren: Tristan, Sophie, Alexia, and [[Xanthe Elbrick|Xanthe]], and brothers Burke and Nicholas Hanlon.

==Honors==
Elbrick was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Prince Henry]].  He was knighted in the Sovereign Military and Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta ([[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]])&lt;ref name="malta"&gt;[http://www.orderofmalta.org Order of Malta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517182643/http://www.orderofmalta.org/ |date=2006-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Prince and Grand Master, [[Angelo de Mojana di Cologna|Fra' Angelo de Mojana di Cologna]]. He was also knighted in the  Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre ([[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]])&lt;ref name="sepulchre"&gt;[http://www.order-of-the-holy-sepulchre.org Order of the Holy Sepulchre]&lt;/ref&gt; by the Grand Master Maximilian, [[Maximilien de Furstenberg|Cardinal de Furstenberg]].

==Representation in popular culture==
*The events of Ambassador Elbrick's abduction in Brazil were recounted by [[Fernando Gabeira]] in his 1979 memoir, ''O Que É Isso Companheiro?'' (in English: ''What's This, Comrade?''). The former member of revolutionary cell MR-8 had become a  journalist and elected congressman in Brazil's [[Green Party (Brazil)|Green Party]]. 
*The 1997 Brazilian film, ''[[Four Days in September]]'', was based on Gabeira's memoir. It was directed by [[Bruno Barreto]], featuring [[Alan Arkin]] as Ambassador Elbrick, with Pedro Cardoso and [[Fisher Stevens]].

'''Claudius Buchanan Whish''' (5 January 1827 - 28 February 1890) was a prominent sugar-planter, civil servant and politician in [[Queensland]], Australia. He was a Member of the [[Queensland Legislative Council]].

==Early life==
Whish was born in [[London]], the son of General Sir William Whish, Royal Artillery, and his wife Mary, née Hardwicke.

==Military service==
In 1851, Whish served in [[India]] under the 14th [[Light Dragoons]] as an interpreter and bazaar master, officer of public works and assistant quartermaster general of cavalry on General Jacob’s staff during the Persian campaign of 1856.

Following a promotion to captain in 1857, Whish traveled to the Australian colonies of [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]] to buy cavalry remounts for the Indian army. He married Anne Whish, née Ker, in [[Bombay]] about 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding aid to the Anne and Claudius Buchanan Whish Miniature Watercolours|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10462/eadarc/6659|publisher=State Library of Queensland|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sugar cane plantation owner==
Whish migrated to Queensland on the ''Young Australia'' and began the [[Oaklands Sugar Mill|Oaklands sugar plantation]] in [[Caboolture]] on 15 August 1862. His crop did well and he became chairman of the local planters’ association and hired [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Pacific islanders]] to work on the crop. Although this move lost him the favour of the people, after 1865 it helped to preserve his £5000 investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorne|first=E.|title=The Queen of the Colonies; Or, Queensland as I Knew it|year=1876|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, &amp; Rivington,|location=Oxford University|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anne Whish.jpeg|left|thumb|Portrait of his wife Anne Whish]]

==Politics==
Whish tried and failed to win the seat of [[Electoral district of East Moreton (Queensland)|East Moreton]] in the [[Queensland Legislative Assembly]] elections in 1867, and a committee on Pacific island labour was informed that whippings had taken place on Whish’s estate. This evidence gained little credence, and as a justice for peace and a deeply religious man, Whish was appointed to the [[Queensland Legislative Council]] in June 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Votes and Proceedings|journal=Legislative Assembly, Queensland|year=1869|volume=2|issue=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he is known as the first successful sugar-producer in Queensland, Whish’s estate lost its worth and he resigned from the Legislative Council in March 1872, sold his machinery and became a surveyor of roads. 

==Later life==
By September 1873, Whish was bankrupt with a debt of £5598, although he was promoted to inspector of road surveys for the southern division in 1875 and for the colony in 1880.

In 1889 Whish took his leave by setting out for England. He was aboard the fated ''[[RMS Quetta]]'' on the day it sank in the [[Torres Strait]]. His wife Anne perished with him; they were survived by their four daughters and two sons.

His daughter Anne Maud Whish married [[Reginald Heber Roe]], who is known for being a headmaster of [[Brisbane Grammar School]] and a vice chancellor of the [[University of Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bolton|first=G.

'''Diosdado Gabi''', nicknamed '''Prince''' (born September 9, 1979 in [[Davao City]], [[Philippines]]) is a retired [[Filipino people|Filipino]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]].

==Personal life==
Gabi is married and has a young son that he left back in the Philippines to fight overseas in the [[United States]]. ''"We come from a very poor family. My father is a fisherman. All we eat sometimes is what he catches. I try to send them as much money as often as I can".

==Boxing career==

===Early career===
On May 8, 2001, after building an undefeated record of 11-0, Gabi fought for the minor World Boxing Federation (WBF) [[super flyweight]] title against the then holder of the title, [[Samson Dutch Boy Gym]] (40-0) of [[Thailand]]. Gabi suffered his first loss as a professional, losing on points to Dutch Boy Gym, who later retired undefeated with a record of 43-0. After two wins following his loss to Dutch Boy Gym, he suffered yet another setback when he faced another undefeated [[Thai people|Thai]], Peesaddaeng Kiatsakthanee (11-0), whom he lost to by unanimous decision (UD) for the latter's [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Asian Boxing Council Super Flyweight title.

Gabi won seven more bouts, and drew once (after his loss to Kiatsakthanee) before he was able to vie for the WBC International [[flyweight]] title, then held by compatriot, Randy Mangubat. Gabi won the belt by technical decision (TD) through twelve rounds, winning by scores of 116-111, 114-112, 116-110. After winning three more fights after his win against Mangubat, Gabi fought Eric Barcelona (whom he defeated six years ago, in 1999, in just his fourth pro fight). The result of the fight was just the same, Gabi defeated Barcelona by TD through 5 rounds, after an accidental headbutt caused the fight to be stopped.

===First and Last World Title shot===
On March 3, 2006, in Chumash Casino in [[Santa Ynez]], [[California]], in Gabi's second fight in the United States, he got his first (and last) shot at a world title. He fought the then undefeated [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] and [[IBF]] [[List of flyweight boxing champions|Flyweight World Champion]], [[Vic Darchinyan]] (24-0). Unfortunately, Gabi was caught with a fierce left punch in the 8th round, resulting in an eight round technical knockout win for Darchinyan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=GABI WILL BOUNCE BACK

|accessdate=2006-03-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to help his fellow friend and fellow [[Philippines|Filipino]] boxer [[Nonito Donaire]] prepare to fight Darchinyan, Gabi gave advice that the young fighter acknowledged after the bout. Donaire went on to knock out Darchinyan to become a world champion, something Gabi never accomplished, but he did help a friend, and that's what matters. Donaire said "Gabi taught me a little bit and told me what this guy (Darchinyan) did and he helped out a lot for this fight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The Prince's Farewell===
On March 15, 2008, after winning four more bouts after his loss to Darchinyan, Gabi faced the then [[WBO]] NABO [[Bantamweight]] Champion, [[Abner Mares]] for his title in the undercard of [[Manny Pacquiao]]'s rematch with [[Juan Manuel Márquez]]. Mares, who was undefeated coming into the bout with 15 wins and 0 losses, stopped Gabi in his tracks in just two rounds. Gabi later retired from the sport following the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Controversy==
On August 17, 2007 Gabi was ordered arrested for breaching a contract with [[Cotabato]] Vice Governor, [[Emmanuel Piñol]]. MTC Judge Antonina Escovilla issued the warrant of arrest based on the complaint of Piñol who sought P4.8 million from Gabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Edward John Smith''', [[Reserve Decoration|RD]] (27 January 1850 – 15 April 1912) was a [[British Merchant Navy]] officer. He served as master of numerous [[White Star Line]] vessels. He is best known as the captain of the {{RMS|Titanic}}, who perished when the ship [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sank on its maiden voyage]].

Raised in a working environment, he left school early to join the Merchant Navy and the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]. After earning his master's ticket, he entered the service of the [[White Star Line]], a prestigious British company. He quickly rose through the ranks and graduated in 1887. His first command was the {{SS|Celtic|1872|6}}. He served as commanding officer of numerous White Star Line vessels,&lt;ref name="igi"&gt;[http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Search/igi/individual_record.asp?recid=100061391160 birth/death dates and parents] at the [[International Genealogical Index]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the {{SS|Majestic|1890|2}} (which he commanded for nine years) and attracted a strong and loyal following amongst passengers.

In 1904, Smith became the commodore of the White Star Line, and was responsible for controlling its flagships. He successfully commanded the {{RMS|Baltic|1903|2}}, {{RMS|Adriatic|1907|2}} and the {{RMS|Olympic|3=2}}. In 1912, he was the [[Sea Captain|captain]] of the [[maiden voyage]] of the RMS ''Titanic'', which [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|struck an iceberg and sank]] on 15 April 1912; over 1,500 perished in the sinking, including Smith, who [[The captain goes down with the ship|went down with the ship]]. For his stoicism and fortitude in the face of adversity, Smith became an icon of British "[[stiff upper lip]]" spirit and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Letter to daughter reveals softer side of Titanic captain|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/letter-daughter-reveals-softer-titanic-captain/story-18685669-detail/story.html|agency=Stoke Sentinel|date=2 October 2015|access-date=2 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408032558/http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/letter-daughter-reveals-softer-titanic-captain/story-18685669-detail/story.html|archive-date=8 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Edward John Smith was born on 27 January 1850 on Well Street, [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], [[Staffordshire]]&lt;!--NOTE: Stoke-on-Trent didn't exist until 1910--&gt;, England to Edward Smith, a potter, and Catherine Hancock, born Marsh, who married on 2 August 1841 in Shelton, Staffordshire.&lt;ref name=BBC17447183&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-17447183 |title=Plaque for Titanic captain's house in Stoke-on-Trent |accessdate=26 March 2012 |work=BBC News |date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents later owned a shop.

Smith attended the [[Etruria, Staffordshire|Etruria]] British School until the age of 13, when he left and operated a steam hammer at the Etruria Forge. In 1867, aged 17 he went to [[Liverpool]] in the footsteps of his half-brother Joseph Hancock, a captain on a sailing ship.&lt;ref name=BBC17181461&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17181461|title=Titanic: Captain Edward John Smith's legacy|author=Emma Kasprzak|publisher=BBC News|date=15 March 2012|accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his apprenticeship on ''Senator Weber'', owned by A Gibson &amp; Co. of Liverpool.

==Marriage and children==
On 13 January 1887, Smith married Sarah Eleanor Pennington at [[St Oswald's Church, Winwick|St Oswald's Church]], [[Winwick, Cheshire|Winwick]], Lancashire. Their daughter, Helen Melville Smith, was born in [[Waterloo, Merseyside|Waterloo]], Liverpool on 2 April 1898. The family lived in a red brick, twin-gabled house, named "Woodhead", on Winn Road, [[Highfield, Southampton]], Hampshire.

==Career==

===Early commands===
Edward Smith joined the [[White Star Line]] in March 1880 as the Fourth Officer of {{SS|Celtic|1872|6}}. He served aboard the company's liners to Australia and to New York City, where he quickly rose in status. In 1887, he received his first White Star command, the {{SS|Republic|1872|2}}. In 1888, Smith earned his Extra Master's Certificate and joined the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], receiving a commission as a [[Lieutenant (Royal Navy)|Lieutenant]], which entitled him to add the letters "RNR" after his name. This meant that in a time of war he could be called upon to serve in the [[Royal Navy]]. Smith retired from the RNR in 1905 with the rank of Commander. His ship had the distinction of being able to fly the [[Blue Ensign]] of the RNR; British merchant vessels generally flew the [[Red Ensign]].

===Bigger commands===
Smith was {{SS|Majestic|1890|2}}{{'}}s captain for nine years commencing in 1895. When the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] started in 1899, ''Majestic'' was called upon to transport troops to [[Cape Colony]]. Smith made two trips to South Africa, both without incident, and in 1903, for his service, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] awarded him the [[Transport Medal]], showing the "South Africa" clasp. Smith was regarded as a "safe captain". As he rose in seniority, he gained a following amongst passengers with some only sailing the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] on a ship he captained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Daniel Allen|title=Unsinkable: The Full Story|date=2012|publisher=Frontline Books|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5NykAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith even became known as the "Millionaires' Captain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cashman|first1=Sean Dennis|title=America Ascendant: From Theodore Roosevelt to FDR|date=1998|publisher=NYU Press|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WuqFXFeERoC&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1904 on, Smith commanded the White Star Line's newest ships on their maiden voyages. In 1904, he was given command of what was then the largest ship in the world, the {{RMS|Baltic|1903|2}}. Her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York, sailing 29 June 1904, went without incident. After three years with ''Baltic'', Smith was given his second new "big ship," the {{RMS|Adriatic|1907|2}}. Once again, the maiden voyage went without incident. During his command of ''Adriatic'', Smith received the long service [[Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve]] (RD).&lt;ref&gt;Gary Cooper (2011). ''Titanic Captain: The Life of Edward John Smith''. p. 133.  The History Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Olympic'' class command===
[[File:EJ Smith.jpg|thumb|right|Edward J. Smith, on ''Olympic'', in 1911|left|alt=Photograph of a bearded man wearing a white captain's uniform, standing on a ship with his arms crossed.]]
As one of the world's most experienced sea captains, Smith was called upon to take first command of the lead ship in a [[Olympic class ocean liner|new class]] of ocean liners, the {{RMS|Olympic|3=2}} – again, the largest vessel in the world at that time. The maiden voyage from Southampton to New York was successfully concluded on 21 June 1911, but as the ship was docking in New York harbour, a small incident took place. Docking at Pier 59 under the command of Captain Smith with the assistance of a harbour pilot, ''Olympic'' was being assisted by twelve tugs when one got caught in the backwash of ''Olympic'', spun around, collided with the bigger ship, and for a moment was trapped under ''Olympic's'' stern, finally managing to work free and limp to the docks.

===The ''Hawke'' incident===
On 20 September 1911, ''Olympic''{{'}}s first major mishap occurred during a collision with a British warship, {{HMS|Hawke|1891|6}}, in which the warship lost her [[prow]]. Although the collision left two of ''Olympic''{{'}}s [[Ship floodability|compartments]] filled and one of her [[propeller shaft]]s twisted, she was able to limp back to [[Southampton]]. At the resultant inquiry, the Royal Navy blamed ''Olympic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Kit |author2=Carolyn Bonner | title = Great Ship Disasters | publisher = MBI Publishing Company | year = 2003 | pages = 33–34 | url = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7603-1336-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=GIbbons |first1=Elizabeth |title=To the Bitter End |url=http://www.williammurdoch.net/articles_29_to_the_bitter_end_09.html |website=williammurdoch.net |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that her massive size generated a suction that pulled ''Hawke'' into her side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4-EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+1931+curtiss#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%201931%20curtiss&amp;f=true |title="Why A Huge Liner Runs Amuck"|publisher=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=4 November 2018|date= February 1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Smith had been on the bridge during the events.

The ''Hawke'' incident was a financial disaster for White Star, and the out-of-service time for the big liner made matters worse. ''Olympic'' returned to [[Belfast]] and, to speed up the repairs, [[Harland and Wolff]] was forced to delay ''Titanic''{{'}}s completion, in order to use one of her propeller shafts and other parts for ''Olympic''. Back at sea in February 1912, ''Olympic'' lost a [[propeller]] blade and once again returned to her builder for emergency repairs. To get her back to service immediately, Harland and Wolff again had to pull resources from ''Titanic'', delaying her [[maiden voyage]] from 20 March to 10 April.

==RMS ''Titanic''==
{{Main|Sinking of the RMS Titanic}}

Despite the past trouble, Smith was again appointed to be in command of the newest ship in the Olympic class when the RMS ''Titanic'' left Southampton for her maiden voyage. Although some sources state that he had decided to retire after completing ''Titanic''{{'}}s maiden voyage,&lt;ref&gt;For example, the account of his planned retirement is prominently mentioned at the Titanic attraction museums in the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; an article in the Halifax ''Morning Chronicle'' on 9 April 1912 stated that Smith would remain in charge of ''Titanic'' "until the Company (White Star Line) completed a larger and finer steamer."

On 10 April 1912, Smith came aboard ''Titanic'' at 7&amp;nbsp;am to prepare for the [[Board of Trade]] muster at 8:00&amp;nbsp;am. He immediately went to his cabin to get the sailing report from [[Chief Officer]] [[Henry Tingle Wilde|Henry Wilde]]. After departure at noon, the huge amount of water displaced by ''Titanic'' as she passed caused the laid-up [[SS City of New York|''New York'']] to break from her moorings and swing towards ''Titanic.'' Quick action from Smith helped to avert a premature end to the maiden voyage.

[[File:Titanic the sinking.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the sinking of the ''Titanic'']]
The first four days of the voyage passed without incident, but on 14 April 1912, ''Titanic''{{'}}s [[telegraphist|radio operators]]{{efn|name=wireless|Radio telegraphy was known as [[Wireless telegraphy|"wireless"]] in the British English of the period.}} received six messages from other ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on ''Titanic'' had begun to notice during the afternoon.

Although the crew was thus aware of ice in the vicinity, they did not reduce the ship's speed, and continued to steam at {{convert|22|knots}}, only {{convert|2|knots}} short of her maximum speed of {{convert|24|knots}}.{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=10}}{{efn|Despite later myth, featured for example in the [[Titanic (1997 film)|1997 film ''Titanic'']], the ship ''Titanic'' was not attempting to set a transatlantic speed record; the White Star Line had made a conscious decision not to compete with their rivals [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] on speed, but instead to focus on size and luxury.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=24}} }} ''Titanic''{{'}}s high speed in waters where ice had been reported was later criticised as reckless, but it reflected standard maritime practice at the time. According to Fifth Officer [[Harold Lowe]], the custom was "to go ahead and depend upon the lookouts in the [[crow's nest]] and the watch on the bridge to pick up the ice in time to avoid hitting it".{{sfn|Mowbray|1912|p=278}}

The North Atlantic liners prioritised time-keeping above all other considerations, sticking rigidly to a schedule that would guarantee their arrival at an advertised time. They were frequently driven at close to their full speed, treating hazard warnings as advisories rather than calls to action. It was widely believed that ice posed little risk; close calls were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, {{SS|Kronprinz Wilhelm}}, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but was still able to complete her voyage. That same year, ''Titanic''{{'}}s future captain, Edward Smith, declared in an interview that he could not "imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that."{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=13}}

Shortly after 11:40&amp;nbsp;pm on 14 April, Smith was informed by First Officer [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]] that the ship had just collided with an iceberg. It was soon apparent that the ship was seriously damaged; designer [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]] reported that all of the first five of the ship's watertight compartments had been breached and that ''Titanic'' would sink in under two hours.

There are conflicting reports about Smith's actions during the evacuation. Some say that he did all in his power to prevent panic and did his best to assist in the evacuation; Major [[Arthur Godfrey Peuchen]] of the [[Royal Canadian Yacht Club]] said "He was doing everything in his power to get women in these boats, and to see that they were lowered properly. I thought he was doing his duty in regard to the lowering of the boats".&lt;ref name="titanicinquiry.org"&gt;[http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq04Peuchen02.php Testimony of Arthur G. Peuchen] at Titanic inquiry.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Williams Daniel]], a first class passenger, also said:

{{quote|Captain Smith was the biggest hero I ever saw.  He stood on the bridge and shouted through a megaphone, trying to make himself heard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williammurdoch.net/mystery02_witness_05_daniel.html Robert Williams Daniel, first class passenger]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other sources say that that he was very ineffective and inactive in preventing loss of life. Captain Smith was an experienced seaman who had served for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first crisis of his career, and he would have known that even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=22}} As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer [[Joseph Boxhall]] did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down,{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=250–52}} while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=106}} Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=250–52}}{{sfn|Cox|1999|pp=50–52}}

Just minutes before the ship started its final plunge, Smith was still busy releasing ''Titanic'''s crew from their duties; he went to the Marconi operators room and released Junior Marconi Officer [[Harold Bride]] and senior wireless operator [[John George Phillips (wireless officer)|John "Jack" Phillips]] from their duties. He then carried out a final tour of the deck, telling crew members: "Now it's every man for himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Butler| first = Daniel Allen| year = 1998|title = Unsinkable: The Full Story of RMS ''Titanic''|page=130|publisher = Stackpole Books| location = Mechanicsburg, PA| isbn = 978-0-8117-1814-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 2:10&amp;nbsp;a.m., Steward Edward Brown saw the captain approach with a megaphone in his hand. He heard him say "Well boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves." He saw the Captain walk onto the bridge alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTInq09Brown01.php "British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry. Day 9"]. Titanic Inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last reliable sighting of Smith. A few minutes later Trimmer Samuel Hemming found the bridge apparently empty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq07Hemming01.php Testimony of Samuel Hemming] at Titanic inquiry.com&lt;/ref&gt; Five minutes later, the ship disappeared beneath the ocean. Smith perished that night along with around 1,500 others, and his body was never recovered.

===Death===
{{See also|The captain goes down with the ship}}

There are conflicting accounts of Smith's death. Some survivors&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Mark Chirnside|2004|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; said they saw Smith enter the ship's [[Pilothouse|wheelhouse]] on the bridge, and die there when it was engulfed.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Allen Butler writes: "if Smith did indeed go to the bridge around 2:10 a.m. as Steward Brown said, and took refuge inside the wheelhouse, that would explain why Trimmer Hemming did not see him when he went onto the bridge a few minutes later. Earlier, at nightfall, the shutters on the Titanic‘s wheelhouse windows would have been raised, to keep the lights of the wheelhouse from interfering with the bridge officers’ night vision: Trimmer Hemming would have been unable to see Captain Smith had the captain indeed been inside the wheelhouse, awaiting his end". [http://www.rmstitanicremembered.com/?page_id=300 (website)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Herald]]'' in its 19 April 1912 edition quoted [[Robert Williams Daniel]], who jumped from the stern immediately before the ship sank, in its 19 April 1912 edition as having claimed to have witnessed Captain Smith drown in the ship's wheelhouse. ''"I saw Captain Smith on the bridge. My eyes seemingly clung to him. The deck from which I had leapt was immersed. The water had risen slowly, and was now to the floor of the bridge. Then it was to Captain Smith's waist. I saw him no more. He died a hero."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spignesi|first=Stephen|title=The Titanic for Dummies|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqO__ScTpnMC&amp;pg=PA207#v=onepage|accessdate=6 November 2012|page=207|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Smith himself made statements hinting that he would go down with his ship if he was ever confronted with a disaster. A friend of Smith's, Dr. Williams, asked Captain Smith what would happen if the ''Adriatic'' struck a concealed reef of ice and was badly damaged. "Some of us would go to the bottom with the ship," was Smith's reply. A boyhood friend, William Jones said, "Ted Smith passed away just as he would have loved to do. To stand on the bridge of his vessel and go down with her was characteristic of all his actions when we were boys together."&lt;ref name="seaofglass"&gt;ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE &amp; LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC" by Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton &amp; Bill Wormstedt. Amberley Books, March 2012. pp 329-334&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these factors as well as the accounts of Smith going inside the wheelhouse, this has remained the iconic image which has remained of Smith and has been perpetuated by film portrayals.

When working to free Collapsible B, Junior Marconi Officer [[Harold Bride]] said he saw Captain Smith dive from the bridge into the sea just as Collapsible B was levered off the roof of the officers' quarters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq14Bride01.php Testimony of Harold Bride at the US Inquiry]&lt;/ref&gt; a story which was corroborated by first class passenger Mrs Eleanor Widener, who was in Lifeboat No.4 (the closest to the sinking ship) at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williammurdoch.net/mystery02_witness_18_widener.html Mrs Eleanor Widener, first class passenger]&lt;/ref&gt; Also second class passenger William John Mellors, who survived aboard collapsible B, stated that Smith jumped from the bridge.&lt;ref name="Shots in the dark"&gt;[http://wormstedt.com/Titanic/shots/secondno.html Shots in the dark]&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Maltin, author of ''101 Things You Thought You Knew About The Titanic - But Didn't!'' affirms that the witnesses "could here be mistaking Captain Smith for Lightoller, who we know did exactly this at this time, first swimming towards the crow's nest."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jT-8P9ykSkcC&amp;pg=PT96&amp;lpg=PT96 101 Things You Thought You Knew about the Titanic - But Didn't!] at Google Books.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Several accounts say that Smith may have been seen in the water near the overturned Collapsible B during or after the sinking. Colonel Archibald Gracie reported that an unknown swimmer came near the capsized and overcrowded lifeboat, and that one of the men on board told him "Hold on to what you have, old boy. One more of you aboard would sink us all,"; in a powerful voice, the swimmer replied "All right boys. Good luck and God bless you.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ErmHSMn2vMC&amp;pg=PT63&amp;lpg=PT63 The Truth About the Titanic]&lt;/ref&gt; Gracie did not see this man, nor was able to identify him, but some other survivors later claimed to have recognised this man as Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000919193532/http://www.titanicresource.8m.com/cries.htm Cries in the Night]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.titanic-lore.info/Capt-Smith.htm |title=Captain Edward John Smith |access-date=6 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822094217/http://www.titanic-lore.info/Capt-Smith.htm |archive-date=22 August 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another man (or possibly the same) never asked to come aboard the boat, but instead cheered its occupants saying "Good boys!

Harry Senior, one of Titanic's stokers, and second class passenger Charles Eugene Williams, who both survived aboard Collapsible B, stated that Smith&lt;ref name="Shots in the dark"/&gt;  swam with a child in his arms to Collapsible B, which Smith presented to a steward, after which he apparently swam back to the rapidly foundering ship. Williams' account differs slightly, claiming that, after Smith handed the child over to the steward, he asked what had become of First Officer Murdoch. Upon hearing news of Murdoch's demise, Smith "pushed himself away from the lifeboat, threw his lifebelt from him and slowly sank from our sight. He did not come to the surface again." These accounts are almost certainly apocryphal, according to historians featured in the A&amp;E Documentary ''[[Titanic: Death of a Dream]]''. Lightoller who survived on Collapsible B never reported seeing Smith in the water or receiving a child from him. There is also no way in which survivors on Collapsible B would have been able to verify the identity of the individual concerned under such dimly lit and chaotic circumstances. It is more likely based upon wishful thinking that the person they saw was the Captain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williammurdoch.net/mystery02_witness_20_cwilliams.html Charles Eugene Williams, second class passenger]&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Smith's fate will probably remain uncertain.

For many years, there were also conflicting accounts of Smith's last words. Newspaper reports said that as the final plunge began, Smith advised those on board to "Be British boys, be British!" Although this is engraved on his memorial and portrayed in the [[Titanic (1996 TV miniseries)|1996 TV miniseries]], it is a myth popularised by the British press at the time.{{when|date=July 2017}} If Smith had said these words to anyone, it would have been to the crew, but not one of the surviving crew members claimed he did. Because Steward Brown's account of Smith giving orders before walking onto the bridge was the last reliable sighting, this would make Smith's last words simply "Well boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

==Decorations==
As a member of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], Smith wore his two decorations when in uniform: the [[Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve]] and the [[Transport Medal]].

The term "'''energy'''" is used by writers and practitioners of various [[esoteric]] forms of [[spirituality]] and [[alternative medicine]] to refer to a variety of phenomena.&lt;ref name="Stenger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stenger|first=Victor J|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508003317/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |deadurl=yes|archivedate=2016-05-08|title=Bioenergetic Fields |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|volume=3|number=1|date=Spring–Summer 1999 |accessdate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jonathan C.|title=Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=9781405181228|pages=268–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no [[scientific evidence]] for the existence of such energy.&lt;ref name="Stenger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="energy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/energy.html |title=energy – (according to New Age thinking) |publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapies that purport to use, modify, or manipulate unknown energies are thus among the most contentious of all complementary and [[alternative medicine]]s. Claims related to energy therapies are most often [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] (from single stories), rather than being based on repeatable [[empirical]] evidence.&lt;ref name="energy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/reich.html |title=Some Notes on Wilhelm Reich, M.D |publisher=Quackwatch.org |date=2002-02-15 |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarvis|first1=William T.|url=https://www.ncahf.org/articles/o-r/reiki.html|title=Reiki|publisher=National Council Against Health Fraud|date=2000-12-01|accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Concepts such as "life force" and "[[élan vital]]" existed from antiquity and emerged from the debate over [[vitalism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries with Mesmer and the magnetism. They continued to be discussed in the 20th century by some thinkers and practitioners in the modern [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref name="Stenger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

As biologists studied [[embryology]] and [[developmental biology]], particularly before the discovery of genes, a variety of organisational forces were posited to account for their observations. German biologist [[Hans Driesch]] (1867–1941), proposed [[Hans Driesch#The philosophy of entelechy|entelechy]], an energy which he believed controlled organic processes.&lt;ref name="Vitalism"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bechtel|first1=William|last2=Richardson|first2=Robert C.|title=Vitalism|url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/~bill/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm|website=William Bechtel's Web|publisher=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2014-05-02|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source appears to be a self-published site.|date=November 2017}} However such ideas are discredited and modern [[science]] has all but abandoned the attempt to associate additional energetic properties with [[life]].&lt;ref name="Vitalism"/&gt;

According to [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]], the [[energy|scientific term energy]] is, in fact, misused in the context of spirituality and alternative medicine:

{{quote|That's all that energy is: a measurement of work capability. But in popular culture, 'energy' has somehow become a noun. "Energy" is often spoken of as if it is a thing unto itself, like a region of glowing power, that can be contained and used. Here's a good test. When you hear the word "energy" used, substitute the phrase "measurable work capability." Does the usage still make sense? Remember, energy itself is not the thing being measured: energy is the measurement of work performed or of potential... Thus, this New Age concept of the body having an "energy field" is fatally doomed. There is no such thing as an energy field; they are two unrelated concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4411|number=411|title=Your Body's Alleged Energy Fields|date=22 April 2014|last=Dunning|first=Brian|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the lack of scientific support, spiritual writers and thinkers have maintained ideas about energy and continue to promote them either as useful allegories or as fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonas|first1=WB|last2=Crawford|first2=CC|title=Science and spiritual healing: a critical review of spiritual healing, "energy" medicine, and intentionality.|journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine|date=March 2003|volume=9|issue=2|pages=56–61|pmid=12652884}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[energy medicine]] purports to manipulate energy, but there is no credible evidence to support this.&lt;ref name="energy"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5634">{{Evolutionary algorithms}}
In computer science, an '''evolution strategy (ES)''' is an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] technique based on ideas of [[evolution]]. It belongs to the general class of [[evolutionary computation]] or [[artificial evolution]] methodologies.

==History==
The 'evolution strategy' optimization technique was created in the early 1960s and developed further in the 1970s and later by [[Ingo Rechenberg]], [[Hans-Paul Schwefel]] and their co-workers.

==Methods==
Evolution strategies use natural problem-dependent representations, and primarily [[mutation]] and [[Selection (biology)|selection]], as search operators. In common with [[evolutionary algorithms]], the operators are applied in a loop. An iteration of the loop is called a generation. The sequence of generations is continued until a termination criterion is met.

For real-valued search spaces, mutation is performed by adding a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] random value to each vector component. The step size or mutation strength (i.e. the standard deviation of the normal distribution) is often governed by self-adaptation (see [[evolution window]]). Individual step sizes for each coordinate or correlations between coordinates are governed either by self-adaptation or by covariance matrix adaptation ([[CMA-ES]]).

The (environmental) selection in evolution strategies is deterministic and only based on the fitness rankings, not on the actual fitness values. The resulting algorithm is therefore invariant with respect to monotonic transformations of the objective function. The simplest evolution strategy operates on a population of size two: the current point (parent) and the result of its mutation. Only if the mutant's fitness is at least as good as the parent one, it becomes the parent of the next generation. Otherwise the mutant is disregarded. This is a ''(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-ES''. More generally, λ mutants can be generated and compete with the parent, called ''(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;λ)-ES''. In (1&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;λ)-ES the best mutant becomes the parent of the next generation while the current parent is always disregarded. For some of these variants, proofs of [[Rate of convergence|linear convergence]] (in a [[stochastic]] sense) have been derived on unimodal objective functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Contemporary derivatives of evolution strategy often use a population of μ parents and recombination as an additional operator, called ''(μ/ρ+,&amp;nbsp;λ)-ES''. This makes them less prone to settle in local optima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

A '''fallacy of division''' occurs when one reasons [[logic]]ally that something true for the whole must also be true of all or some of its parts.

An example:

# The 2nd grade in Jefferson elementary eats a lot of ice cream
# Carlos is a 2nd grader in Jefferson elementary
# Therefore, Carlos eats a lot of ice cream

The converse of this [[fallacy]] is called [[fallacy of composition]], which arises when one fallaciously attributes a property of some part of a thing to the thing as a whole.  Both fallacies were addressed by [[Aristotle]] in ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]''.

In the philosophy of the ancient Greek [[Anaxagoras]], as claimed by the Roman [[atomist]] [[Lucretius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intellectual Property Protection of Fact-based Works: Copyright and Its Alternatives|page=110|first=Robert|last=Brauneis|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was assumed that the atoms constituting a substance must themselves have the salient observed properties of that substance: so atoms of water would be wet, atoms of iron would be hard, atoms of wool would be soft, etc. This doctrine is called ''[[homoeomeria (philosophy)|homoeomeria]]'', and it depends on the fallacy of division.

If a system as a whole has some property that none of its constituents has (or perhaps, it has it but not as a ''result'' of some constituent having that property), this is sometimes called an ''[[Emergence|emergent]]'' property of the system.

==Examples==

In [[statistics]] an [[ecological fallacy]] is a logical fallacy in the interpretation of statistical data where inferences about the nature of individuals are deduced from inference for the group to which those individuals belong. The four common statistical ecological fallacies are: confusion between ecological correlations and individual correlations, confusion between group average and total average,  [[Simpson's paradox]], and other statistical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Logic: A Modern Introduction to Deductive Reasoning|pages=160–163|first=Dailey|last=Burnham Terrell|year=1967|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spring Farm Work -- Grafting.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Grafting'', 1870, by [[Winslow Homer]] {{mdash}} an example of [[grafting]].]]
'''[[Fruit tree]] propagation''' is usually carried out vegetatively (non-sexually) by [[grafting]] or budding a desired variety onto a suitable [[rootstock]].

[[Perennial plant]]s can be propagated either by sexual or vegetative means. [[Sexual reproduction]] begins when a male germ cell ([[pollen]]) from one [[flower]] fertilises a female germ cell ([[ovule]], incipient seed) of the same species, initiating the development of a [[fruit]] containing [[seed]]s. Each seed, when germinated, can grow to become a new specimen tree. However, the new tree inherits characteristics of both its parents, and it will not grow [[True-breeding organism|true]] to the variety of either parent from which it came. That is, it will be a fresh individual with an unpredictable combination of characteristics of its own. Although this is desirable in terms of producing novel combinations from the richness of the [[gene]] pool of the two parent plants (such sexual recombination is the source of new cultivars), only rarely will the resulting new fruit tree be directly useful or attractive to the tastes of humankind. Most new plants will have characteristics that lie somewhere between those of the two parents.

Therefore, from the [[orchard]] grower or gardener's point of view, it is preferable to propagate fruit cultivars vegetatively in order to ensure reliability. This involves taking a cutting (or scion) of [[wood]] from a desirable parent tree which is then grown on to produce a new plant or "[[vegetative reproduction|clone]]" of the original. In effect this means that the original [[Bramley (apple)|Bramley apple]] tree, for example, was a successful variety grown from a pip, but that every Bramley since then has been propagated by taking cuttings of living matter from that tree, or one of its descendants.

==Methods==
The simplest method of propagating a tree vegetatively is '''rooting''' or '''taking cuttings'''. A [[cutting (plant)|cutting]] (usually a piece of stem of the parent plant) is cut off and stuck into soil. Artificial rooting hormones are sometimes used to improve chances of success. If the cutting does not die from rot-inducing fungi or [[desiccation]] first, roots grow from the buried portion of the cutting to become a new complete plant. However, although this works well for some plants (such as [[ficus|figs]] and [[olive]]s), for most fruit tree [[cultivar]]s this method has much too low a success rate to be commercially viable. Root cuttings (pieces of root cut off and induced to grow a new trunk) are also not used to propagate fruit trees, although this method is successful with some [[herbaceous]] plants.

A refinement on rooting is '''[[layering]]'''. This is rooting a piece of a wood that is still attached to its parent and continues to receive nourishment from it. The new plant is severed only after it has successfully grown roots. Layering is the technique most used for propagation of clonal apple rootstocks.

The most common method of propagating fruit trees, suitable for nearly all species, is '''[[grafting]]''' onto '''[[rootstock]]s'''. This in essence involves physically joining part of a shoot of a hybrid cultivar onto the roots of a different but closely related species or cultivar, so that the two parts grow together as one plant. The process of joining the two varieties must ensure maximum contact between the [[cambium (botany)|cambium]] (the layer just below the [[bark (biology)|bark]]) of each, so that they grow together successfully. Grafting is a preferred method because it not only propagates a new plant of the desired hybrid cultivar, it usually also confers extra advantages as a result of the characteristics of the rootstocks (or '''stocks'''), which are selected for characteristics such as their vigour of growth, hardiness and soil tolerance, as well as compatibility with the desired variety that will form the aerial part of the plant (called the '''scion'''). For example, [[grape]] rootstocks descended from [[North America]]n grapes allow [[Europe]]an grapes to be grown in areas infested with ''[[Phylloxera]]'', a soil-dwelling insect that attacks and kills European grapes when grown on their own roots. Two of the most common grafting techniques are "whip and tongue", carried out in spring as the sap rises, and "budding", which is performed around the end of summer.

===Bud grafting===
[[File:Budgraft.png|thumb|300px|Diagram illustrating the bud grafting technique]]
{{See also|Shield budding}}
# Cut a slice of [[bud]] and bark from the parent tree.
# Cut a similar sliver off the rootstock, making a little lip at the base to slot the scion into.
# Join the two together and bind.
# In time, the scion bud will grow into a shoot, which will develop into the desired tree.

===Whip and tongue grafting===
[[File:Whiptonguegraft.png|thumb|300px|Diagram illustrating the whip and tongue grafting technique]]
# Make a sloping cut in the rootstock with a "tongue" pointing upwards.
# Make a matching cut in the scion wood with a "tongue" pointing downwards.
# Join the two, ensuring maximum contact of the [[vascular cambium]] layers. Bind with [[raffia palm|raffia]] or [[polythene]] [[Adhesive tape|tape]] or wind around with a 5mm wide strip of elastic band (this is particularly successful because it keeps pressure on the cambium layers to be joined and eventually falls away without cutting into the bark as the tree grows) and seal with grafting [[wax]].

==Rootstocks==&lt;!---PLEASE use some discipline when adding rootstocks---&gt;
One reason for grafting onto [[rootstock]]s is that this enables the grower to determine the tree's eventual size.

Another desirable characteristic of rootstocks is environmental adaptability. This may be tolerance to wet/dry soil conditions, acidity/alkalinity of soil or even hot/cold air temperature.&lt;ref name="Objectives"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=PSU |title=Horticulture 432 Deciduous Tree Fruit Production - Fall 2000 - Lecture Notes - Tree Fruit Rootstocks |url=http://hortweb.cas.psu.edu/courses/hort432/lecturenotes/rtstk.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202114531/http://hortweb.cas.psu.edu/courses/hort432/lecturenotes/rtstk.html |archivedate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple rootstocks===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Apical dominance]] --&gt;
Apple tree size classes number from one to ten in increasing height and breadth.&lt;ref name="nysaes.cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/hort/breeders/appleroots/Factsheets/FSAccess.htm |title=Apple Rootstocks' Fact Sheet Access Page |publisher=Nysaes.cornell.edu |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "1" is a dwarf which can be productive and as short as {{convert|3|ft}} with proper pruning. A "10" is the standard sized tree with no dwarfing and will grow to {{convert|20|ft}} tall and wide or more, dependent upon the variety chosen. In general the class range is (1) 10-20% of full size, (2) 20-30%, (3) 30-40% and so forth to size 10 which is 100% of full size.

The Malling series and clones have been standard rootstocks for apples for many years and remain the "workhorses" for the commercial industry in the United States&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt; and the UK. However, since most of them are susceptible to disease some Malling rootstocks are being replaced by new breeds, including the Cornell-Geneva series, which has resistance to the major problems preventing quality production of apples utilizing organic control systems. One of the newest rootstocks of the "CG" series, only released commercially in 2004, is CG5202(G.202) which adds resistance to the woolly apple aphid, and when combined with highly resistant cultivars such as "Liberty" it is showing great potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nc140.org/2006/annualreport.pdf |title=(PDF) NC-140 2006 Annual Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TFGN&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ron Perry |author2=Peter Hurst |author3=Win Cowgill |author4=Jon Clements |url=http://www.nc140.org/pubs/perrynewapplersfgn2002.htm |title=New Apple Rootstocks promising for commercial growers |journal=The Fruit Growers News |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=6-8 |publisher=NC-140 Regional Rootstock Research Project |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rootstocks based on Siberian [[Crab apple]] are being used in colder areas for more cold tolerance.&lt;ref name="Kole2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chittaranjan Kole|title=Wild Crop Relatives - Genomic and Breeding Resources: Temperate Fruits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAJ_mUrdpWMC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=29 December 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-16056-1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of new rootstocks to modify or augment characteristics of fruit trees is limited and may disappoint in the long term. It takes ten years to get a full picture of the effects of any one rootstock, so a rootstock that appears promising in the first five years of a trial may fail in the last five years. The Mark rootstock was such a stock and has now fallen mostly into disfavor.&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt; Another, the G.30, has proved to be an excellent stock for production but it was only after a number of years of trials that it was found to be somewhat incompatible with the cultivar "Gala", so that it is now recommended to be staked and wired.&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt;

An industry consortium undertakes trials of different rootstocks, called the "NC-140" trials.&lt;ref name=TFGN/&gt; These test many pome rootstocks in many different sites across the United States and thereby provide growers a clearer picture of what to expect when growing fruit trees on specific stock, in specific planting methods in their specific area of the. This information has the potential to create economic benefits to both growers and consumers, as well as helping to reduce the need to spray pesticides as frequently as is currently required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nc140.org/ |title=NC-140 Home |publisher=NC-140 Regional Rootstock Research Project |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Bud 118"''' A winter hardy early bearing replacement for MM111 bred in the Soviet Union. Full sized tree unless allowed to bear young which will stunt its growth. Hardy to USDA zone 3.

'''"Bud 9"''' A winter hardy, early bearing replacement for M9 bred in the Soviet Union. Dwarf tree resistant to crown rot and less susceptible to drought than most other dwarfing stocks. Produces large fruit, is precocious and hardy to USDA zone 3.

'''"M"''' designates [[Malling series]] developed stocks. East Malling Research is a pioneer in the development of dwarfing rootstocks. [[East Malling Research Station]] in Kent, England collected clones of the Paradise stocks from France in 1912 from which 24 "M" were designated with no particular order to the rootstock characteristics other than where they were located in the garden at the time the numbers were assigned. In other words, M.2 is a larger tree than M.9, while M.27 is smaller than M.26.&lt;ref name="Objectives"/&gt;
[[File:applerootstock.png|thumb|300px|Diagram illustrating comparative sizes of apple trees depending on rootstock grafting]]
* '''M.2''': Produces a semidwarf to semistandard freestanding tree, depending on scion variety. Trees are strong, crop well, and do not have collar rot problems.&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt;&lt;!--- this is an unimportant rootstock.---&gt;
* '''M.7''': Produces a semidwarf tree of Class 6&lt;ref name="nysaes.cornell.edu"/&gt; that is freestanding in deep well drained soils but in rocky, steep, or shallow soils, it tends to lean. The rootstock may sucker profusely and is susceptible to collar rot([[Phytophthora]]).&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt;
* '''M.9''': Very dwarfing&amp;nbsp;— Reaches a height of {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}, coming into fruit after 3 to 4 years, reaching full capacity of {{convert|50|to|65|lb|kg}} after 5 to 6 years. It will grow under average soil conditions, but needs a good rich soil to thrive. A good choice where space is limited and fertility is high. Permanent staking is required, as is routine feeding and watering.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Trees on this rootstock always require leader support. The rootstock is very susceptible to [[fire blight]] and can develop burr knots.&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt;
* '''M.25''': Very vigorous&amp;nbsp;— Suitable for a grassed orchard, and to grow on as a full standard. Plant {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} apart, makes a tree of {{convert|15|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} or more height and spread, eventually yielding {{convert|200|to|400|lb|kg|abbr=on}} per tree.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} This rootstock is primarily used in UK and is rarely seen in the United States where MM.111(size Class 8)&lt;ref name="nysaes.cornell.edu"/&gt; is used for this size tree.
* '''M.26''': Dwarfing&amp;nbsp;— Similar to M9 in effect, although somewhat more vigorous and generally stronger, with a higher expected eventual yield of {{convert|65|-|75|lb|kg}} and height of {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}. A good choice where soil quality is average and compact growth is required. Comes into fruit after 3 to 4 years, reaching full cropping capacity after 5 to 6 years. Staking is needed for the first four or five years of its life.&lt;ref name="RHS Fruit"&gt;{{Cite |title=RHS Fruit|editor=Harry Baker|isbn=1-85732-905-8|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is susceptible to collar rot and fire blight and should not be planted in a wet site.

* '''M.27''': A very dwarfing rootstock. Unless the central leader is supported, the tree will be very small. Often only used as an intermediate stem piece on MM.106 or MM.111. If handled and spaced properly, it can be a very productive stock for a vertical axe system.&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt; Trees can be grown three to four feet tall and produce about 45 fruit, roughly 2 pecks, depending on fruit cultivar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://midfex.org/yale/intro.html |title=MidFEx presents Gene's Backyard Orchard (Introduction)&amp;nbsp;—  97 dwarf apple trees in 2500 square feet |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-09-25 |accessdate=2012-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925051216/http://midfex.org/yale/intro.html |archivedate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"MM"''' designates Malling-Merton stocks developed from joint breeding program by John Innes Institute, in Merton, England, &amp; East Malling Research Station in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple Rootstocks |url=http://tfpg.cas.psu.edu/138.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724232835/http://tfpg.cas.psu.edu/138.htm |archive-date=2008-07-24 |publisher=Tfpg.cas.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "MM" series was developed primarily to provide resistance to Woolly Apple Aphid([[Eriosomatinae]]) infestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysipm.cornell.edu/factsheets/treefruit/pests/waa/waa.asp |title=Woolly Apple Aphid |publisher=Nysipm.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''MM.106''': Semi-dwarfing&amp;nbsp;— Sometimes referred to as semi-vigorous, this is the most widely used of rootstocks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} It is probably the best choice for the average garden under average conditions, being tolerant of a wide range of soils, and producing a tree with an eventual size of {{convert|12|to|18|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="RHS Fruit"/&gt; Trees on this stock begin producing fruit within three to four years, and yield {{convert|90|to|110|lb|kg}} after some seven or eight years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} MM106 is very suitable for use with weaker varieties that would produce undersized bushes with more dwarfing rootstocks. Can be trained as a half standard tree, but is rather too vigorous for cordons unless the soil is poor. Requires staking for the first four or five years or so of its life.&lt;ref name="RHS Fruit"/&gt; Trees on MM.106 are highly susceptible to [[collar rot]] especially when planted in soils that remain wet(poor percolation).&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt;
* '''MM.111''': Vigorous&amp;nbsp;— Not generally suitable for garden scale growing, being both too large and spreading (18–25&amp;nbsp;ft), and too slow to come into cropping. They are, however, suitable for growing as specimen standards in the large garden, or for producing medium-sized bushes on poorer soils. Begins to fruit after six or seven years, reaching full capacity of {{convert|160|to|360|lb|kg|abbr=on}} after seven to eight years.&lt;ref name="RHS Fruit"/&gt;It is not winter hardy in United States zone 3 unless it receives abundant snow cover. Bud 118 was developed in the Soviet Union to replace MM.111, Bud 118 is winter hardy in zone 3 and very precocious. (Early bearing). Planting depth of this rootstock is critical. The union should be no higher than 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;inches above the final soil line.&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt;

'''"EMLA"''' designates East Malling / Long Ashton research stations who took the "M" stocks and developed virus free versions. For example., EMLA 7 is M 7 with a guaranteed virus-free stock.&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tfpg.cas.psu.edu/181.htm |title=Specific rootstocks |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502040529/http://tfpg.cas.psu.edu/181.htm |archive-date=2009-05-02 |publisher=Tfpg.cas.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMLA characteristics are often different from the parent "M" rootstock. Note that nearly all the apple rootstocks in the industry are now virus free.&lt;ref name="Objectives"/&gt;

'''"CG"''' or '''"G"''' designates Cornell-Geneva stocks which are those developed via the Cornell and USDA collaboration at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, NY. The "G" is the old designation. All newer stocks are "CG" followed by numbers that actually provide some information about the stock. As one might surmise, this is a huge improvement in the classical naming scheme which has no identification method at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/hort/breeders/appleroots/numbers.html |title=William C. Johnson Updates-April 1999 |publisher=Nysaes.cornell.edu |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''G.11''' Geneva 11 is the second release of the Cornell breeding program similar in size to M.26 (Class 4), but more productive. Has the advantage of being resistant to fire blight and crown rot as well as only rarely producing suckers or burr knots.&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt;
* '''G.41''' Geneva 41, released in 2005, produces trees the size of M.9. The rootstock was developed from a cross between M.27 and Robusta 5 made in 1975. Resistant to Crown|Collar|Root rot([[Phytophthora]]) and [[fire blight]].&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt;
* '''G.202''' Geneva 202(CG 4202) is a semidwarfing rootstock that produces a tree in class 5 slightly larger than M.26(Size Class 4) and is more productive than M.26. It was developed from a cross of M.27 (Size Class 1) and Robusta 5 to be [[fire blight]] and [[Phytophthora]] resistant as well as having resistance to woolly apple aphids. In a 9-year study with the scion cultivar of the "Liberty" apple, G.202 was about 50 percent smaller than M.7, but had much greater production efficiency.&lt;ref name="Web site - Specific rootstocks"/&gt;

'''"P"''' designates Poland. The Polish apple rootstocks were designed specifically for winter hardiness.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Jim Cummins, now with Cummins' Nursery http://www.ibiblio.org/ecolandtech/NAFEX/message-archives/old/msg01477.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- this may become an important stock in the future but not yet---&gt;

'''Seedling''': Very vigorous trees produced on a rootstock grown from seed. There is greater variability than with the vegetatively propagated rootstocks. Apples used for production of seedling rootstocks include "Dolgo" and "[[Antonovka (apple)|Antonovka]]", which are both extremely hardy and vigorous.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Pear rootstocks===
[[Pear]]s are usually grafted onto quince rootstocks, which produce small to medium-sized trees. Some varieties, however, are not compatible with [[quince]], and these require double working. This means that a piece of pear graft-work compatible with both the quince rootstock and the pear variety is used as an intermediate between the two. If this is not done the pear and the rootstock could eventually separate at the graft. Varieties that require double working include "Bristol Cross", "Dr Jules Guyot", "Doyenné d' été" and "Williams Bon Chrétien".

* '''Quince C''': Moderately vigorous&amp;nbsp;— Makes a bush pear tree about {{convert|8|to|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, bearing fruit within four to seven years.&lt;ref name="RHS Fruit"/&gt; Suitable for highly fertile soils and vigorous varieties, but not where conditions are poor. Used for bush, cordon and espalier growing. Old stocks of Quince C may be infected with a virus, so care should be taken to obtain certified virus free stock. If in doubt, use Quince A as there is not a great amount of difference in vigor between the two.
* '''Quince A''': Medium vigor&amp;nbsp;— Slightly more vigorous than Quince C, this is the most common variety upon which pears are grafted. Bears fruit between four and eight years, making a tree of some {{convert|10|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height and spread. Suitable for all forms of pear trees except standards.&lt;ref name="RHS Fruit"/&gt;
* '''Pear stock''': Very vigorous&amp;nbsp;— Pears grafted onto pear rootstocks make very large trees, not suitable for most gardens.

===Cherry rootstocks===
Until the 1970s, [[cherry|cherries]] were grown on the vigorous "Malling F12/1", "Mazzard" (''Prunus avium''), or "Maheleb" (''P. maheleb'') rootstocks, which required much space and time before cropping began, thus the growing of cherries was not a realistic option on a garden scale. The introduction of the rootstock "Colt" enabled trees reaching a maximum height of {{convert|12|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} to be grown, and if trained as a pyramid it is possible to restrict growth to about {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Hessayon&gt;[[Hessayon, Dr. D. G.]], ''The Fruit Expert'', Transworld Publishers Ltd, 1997, p37 {{ISBN|0-903505-31-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular sweet variety "Stella" can even be successfully grown in a pot on the patio when grafted onto a "Colt" rootstock.&lt;ref name=Hessayon/&gt; A newer rootstock, "Gisela 5",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.lsdi.lt/straipsniai/25-3/25(3)-29.pdf |title=Use of Gisela 5 for sweet cherries |first1=Jef |last1=Vercammen |first2=Guy |last2=Van Daele |last-author-amp=yes |first3=Toon |last3=Vanrykel |journal=Scientific Works of the Lithuanian Institute of Horticulture and Lithuanian University of Agriculture |department=Gardening and Vegetable Growing |format=PDF |date=2006 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=218-223 |accessdate=2012-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224650/http://www.lsdi.lt/straipsniai/25-3/25(3)-29.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is slowly becoming available to gardeners and produces a tree 20% smaller than "Colt" and 45% smaller than "Mahaleb" and "Mazzard", making netting for bird protection much easier. Furthermore, German Nurseries Consortium (Consortium Deutscher Baumschulen&amp;nbsp;— CDB®) is introducing across the EU their newest most dwarfing "Gisela 3" cherry rootstock that has 50% dwarfing qualities in comparison with "Mahaleb" and "Mazzard" and is 10% smaller still than "Gisela 5" rootstock.

===Plum rootstocks===
[[Plum]] rootstocks are often suitable for [[peach]]es, [[nectarine]]s and [[apricot]]s. They include:
* '''Pixy'''&amp;nbsp;— A dwarfing rootstock (''[[Prunus domestica]]'' subsp. ''insititia'', or sometimes ''[[Prunus insititia]]'') suitable for bush trees planted {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} apart.
* '''St. Julien A'''&amp;nbsp;— A semi-vigorous rootstock suitable for bush and half standards planted {{convert|12|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} apart. Also suitable for peaches, nectarines and apricots.
* Brompton or Myrobalan B- ([[Prunus cerasifera]])&amp;nbsp;— Suitable for half standards planted {{convert|18|to|22|ft|m|abbr=on}} apart. Also suitable for peaches, nectarines and apricots.
* '''Myro-29C'''&amp;nbsp;— ([[Prunus cerasifera]]) Semi-dwarf rootstock. Shallow, vigorous, good choice for hard soils. Somewhat drought tolerant.
* '''Citation'''&amp;nbsp;— Semi-dwarf rootstock. Shallow, vigorous, good choice for hard soils. Prefers a wetter soil.

==Own-root fruit trees==
Many species of fruit, e.g., [[ficus|fig]], [[olive]], and [[pomegranate]], are commonly grown on their own roots, as there may be no great advantages to using a special rootstock, or suitable rootstocks may not be readily available. However, even for fruit trees that usually are grown grafted on a rootstock, there can be advantages in growing them on their own roots instead, particularly in the traditional [[coppicing]] systems advocated in both [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[permaculture]]. Disadvantages of using own-root trees can include excessive size and excessive production of wood (thus very long times until the start of fruit production), although training branches horizontally and limiting pruning to summer only may help encourage fruit production at an earlier age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiHQU_p8rCY |title=Phil Corbett video |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orangepippin.com/articles/own-roots |title=Orange Pippin apple and orchard resource |publisher=Orangepippin.com |date=1981-04-16 |accessdate=2012-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612223140/http://www.orangepippin.com/articles/own-roots |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooltemperate.co.uk/own_root.shtml |title=Phil Corbett website |publisher=Cooltemperate.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518004546/http://www.cooltemperate.co.uk/own_root.shtml |archivedate=18 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of research on the use of the own root method in large-scale systems.  British horticulturalist [[Hugh Ermen]] was a prominent advocate of own root fruit trees, particularly Apple trees, following his work at the Brogdale research centre in Kent.&lt;ref&gt;Whitefield, Patrick, 01/10/2011, The Earth Care Manual, Permanent Publications, p254, {{ISBN|185623021X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The research undertaken at Brogdale did not continue but there has been renewed academic interest in own root fruit trees since the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, David, 13/11/2014, The One Planet Life: A Blueprint For Low Impact Development, Taylor and Francis, p376, {{ISBN|9781317625902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family trees and fruit salad trees==
In addition to propagating trees on rootstocks designed to control size/vigour and confer disease resistance, grafting above the rootstock can be used to provide multiple cultivars of a single species, known as a '''[[genus|family]] tree''', or, within certain limits, cultivars of different fruit species on one tree, often known as a '''[[fruit salad]] tree'''. Family trees typically combine several cultivars (two or three being most common) of apple, pear or a given species of [[stonefruit]] on a single rootstock, while fruit salad trees typically carry two or more different species from within a given genus, such as plum, [[apricot]], and [[peach]] or [[mandarin orange]], [[lemon]], and [[lime (fruit)|lime]]. Certain combinations, including sour cherry (''[[prunus cerasus]]'')/sweet cherry (''[[prunus avium]]''), although from the same genus, are known to be difficult, although successes have sometimes been reported. Other grafts of this kind can produce the [[Pomato]].

[[File:Red Giant Earth warm.jpg|thumb|274x274px|alt=A dark gray and red sphere representing the Earth lies against a black background to the right of an orange circular object representing the Sun|Conjectured illustration of the scorched [[Earth]] after the [[Sun]] has entered the [[red giant]] phase, about 7 billion years from now.&lt;ref name=apj418/&gt;]]

The biological and geological '''future of Earth''' can be [[Extrapolation|extrapolated]] based upon the estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at [[Earth]]'s surface, the rate of [[Thermal history of the Earth|cooling of the planet's interior]], the [[perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational interactions]] with other objects in the [[Solar System]], and a steady increase in the [[solar luminosity|Sun's luminosity]]. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as [[climate engineering]],&lt;ref name=aree25_245/&gt; which could cause significant changes to the planet.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas104_31/&gt; The current [[Holocene extinction]]&lt;ref name=pnas98_1/&gt; is being caused by technology{{sfn|Myers|2000|pp=63–70}} and the effects may last for up to five million years.{{sfn|Reaka-Kudla|Wilson|Wilson|1997|pp=132–33}} In turn, technology may result in the [[extinction of humanity]], leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes.&lt;ref name=bostrom2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

Over time intervals of hundreds of millions of years, random celestial events pose a global risk to the [[biosphere]], which can result in [[mass extinction]]s. These include impacts by [[comet]]s or [[asteroid]]s, and the possibility of a massive stellar explosion, called a [[supernova]], within a 100-[[light-year]] radius of the Sun. Other large-scale geological events are more predictable. [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch theory]] predicts that the planet will continue to undergo [[glacial period]]s at least until the [[Quaternary glaciation]] comes to an end. These periods are caused by variations in [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]], [[axial tilt]], and [[precession]] of the Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt; As part of the ongoing [[supercontinent cycle]], [[plate tectonics]] will probably result in a [[supercontinent]] in 250–350&amp;nbsp;million years. Some time in the next 1.5–4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years, the axial tilt of the Earth may begin to undergo chaotic variations, with changes in the axial tilt of up to 90°.&lt;ref name=aaa318/&gt;

The luminosity of the [[Sun]] will steadily increase, resulting in a rise in the [[solar radiation]] reaching the Earth. This will result in a higher rate of [[weathering]] of [[silicate mineral]]s, which will cause a decrease in the level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere. In about 600&amp;nbsp;million years from now, the level of carbon dioxide will fall below the level needed to sustain [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation photosynthesis]] used by trees. Some plants use the [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation]] method, allowing them to persist at carbon dioxide concentrations as low as 10 parts per million. However, the long-term trend is for plant life to die off altogether. The extinction of plants will be the demise of almost all animal life, since plants are the base of the [[food chain]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt;

In about one billion years, the solar luminosity will be 10% higher than at present. This will cause the atmosphere to become a "moist greenhouse", resulting in a [[Positive feedback|runaway]] evaporation of the oceans. As a likely consequence, plate tectonics will come to an end, and with them the entire [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref name=lunine09/&gt; Following this event, in about 2−3 billion years, the planet's [[Dynamo theory|magnetic dynamo]] may cease, causing the [[magnetosphere]] to decay and leading to an accelerated loss of [[volatiles]] from the outer atmosphere. Four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will cause a [[runaway greenhouse effect]], heating the surface enough to melt it. By that point, all life on the Earth will be extinct.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|p=142}}{{sfn|Fishbaugh|Des_Marais|Korablev|Raulin|2007|p=114}} The most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the Sun in about 7.5&amp;nbsp;billion years, after the star has entered the [[red giant]] phase and expanded beyond the planet's current orbit.

== Human influence ==
{{Main|Conservation biology|Global warming|Human impact on the environment}}

Humans play a key role in the [[biosphere]], with the large [[human population]] dominating many of Earth's [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt; This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing [[mass extinction]] of other [[species]] during the present geological [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], now known as the [[Holocene extinction]]. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a [[biotic crisis]], with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007.{{sfn|Myers|2000|pp=63–70}} At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of [[extinction]] in the next hundred years.&lt;ref name=Novacek/&gt; The Holocene extinction event is the result of [[habitat destruction]], the widespread distribution of [[invasive species]], hunting, and [[climate change]].{{sfn|Cowie|2007|p=162}}&lt;ref name=nature04/&gt; In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global [[primary production]].&lt;ref name=pnas104_31/&gt; The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;

The consequences of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last for at least five million years.{{sfn|Reaka-Kudla|Wilson|Wilson|1997|pp=132–33}} It could result in a decline in [[biodiversity]] and homogenization of [[biota (ecology)|biota]]s, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are [[Opportunism|opportunistic]], such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular [[taxa]] that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. [[Microorganism|Microbes]] are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large [[vertebrate]]s are likely to arise and [[food chains]] will probably be shortened.&lt;ref name=pnas98_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas01/&gt;

There are [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|multiple scenarios for known risks]] that can have a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and [[Human extinction|terminal risks]]. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the [[Grey goo|misuse of nanotechnology]], a [[nuclear holocaust]], warfare with a programmed [[superintelligence]], a [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a [[Doomsday argument|doomsday]] threat, including a highly [[virulent]] disease, the [[Impact event|impact of an asteroid or comet]], [[runaway greenhouse effect]], and [[resource depletion]]. There may also be the possibility of an infestation by an [[extraterrestrial life]]form.&lt;ref name=telegraph20100410/&gt; The actual odds of these scenarios occurring are difficult if not impossible to deduce.&lt;ref name=bostrom2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

Should the human race become extinct, then the various features assembled by humanity will begin to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay [[half-life]] of about 1,000&amp;nbsp;years. The last surviving structures would most likely be open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the [[Giza Necropolis]] or the sculptures at [[Mount Rushmore]] may still survive in some form after a million years.&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;{{efn|See also: [[Life After People]], about the decay of structures (if humans disappeared).}}

==Random events==
[[File:Barringer Crater aerial photo by USGS.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Barringer Meteorite Crater]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], showing evidence of the impact of celestial objects upon the Earth]]
As the Sun orbits the [[Milky Way]], wandering stars may approach close enough to have a disruptive influence on the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=qjras35_1_1/&gt; A close stellar encounter may cause a significant reduction in the [[perihelion]] distances of comets in the [[Oort cloud]]&amp;mdash;a spherical region of icy bodies orbiting within half a [[light year]] of the Sun.&lt;ref name=aaa112_1_157/&gt; Such an encounter can trigger a 40-fold increase in the number of comets reaching the inner Solar System. Impacts from these comets can trigger a mass extinction of life on Earth. These disruptive encounters occur at an average of once every 45 million years.&lt;ref name=apjl499_L219/&gt; The mean time for the Sun to [[Stellar collision|collide]] with another star in the solar neighborhood is approximately {{nowrap|3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; years}}, which is much longer than the estimated age of the Milky Way galaxy, at {{nowrap|~1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years}}. This can be taken as an indication of the low likelihood of such an event occurring during the lifetime of the Earth.{{sfn|Tayler|1993|p=92}}

The energy release from the impact of an [[asteroid]] or comet with a diameter of {{convert|5|–|10|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} or larger is sufficient to create a global [[environmental disaster]] and cause a [[statistically significant]] increase in the number of species extinctions. Among the deleterious effects resulting from a major impact event is a cloud of fine dust ejecta blanketing the planet, blocking some [[Diffuse sky radiation|direct sunlight]] from reaching the Earth's surface thus lowering land temperatures by about {{convert|15|C-change|F-change}} within a week and halting [[photosynthesis]] for several months (similar to a [[nuclear winter]]). The mean time between major impacts is estimated to be at least 100 million&amp;nbsp;years. During the last 540 million&amp;nbsp;years, simulations demonstrated that such an impact rate is sufficient to cause 5–6 mass extinctions and 20–30 lower severity events. This matches the geologic record of significant extinctions during the [[Phanerozoic Eon]]. Such events can be expected to continue into the future.&lt;ref name=emp72_1_441/&gt;

A [[supernova]] is a cataclysmic explosion of a star. Within the Milky Way [[galaxy]], supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years.&lt;ref name=Tammann1004/&gt; During the [[History of Earth|history of the Earth]], multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years; known as a [[near-Earth supernova]]. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with [[radioisotope]]s and possibly impact the biosphere.&lt;ref name=nar48_1_119/&gt; [[Gamma ray]]s emitted by a supernova react with [[nitrogen]] in the atmosphere, producing [[nitrous oxide]]s. These molecules cause a depletion of the [[ozone layer]] that protects the surface from [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation from the Sun. An increase in [[UV-B]] radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the [[phytoplankton]] that form the base of the oceanic [[food chain]]. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26&amp;nbsp;light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32&amp;nbsp;light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries.{{sfn|Hanslmeier|2009|pp=174–76}} Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one [[gamma ray burst]] that will have a significant impact on the planet's biosphere.&lt;ref name=ass336_2_287/&gt;

The incremental effect of [[gravitational perturbation]]s between the planets causes the inner Solar System as a whole to behave [[Chaos theory|chaotically]] over long time periods. This does not significantly affect the [[stability of the Solar System]] over intervals of a few million years or less, but over billions of years the orbits of the planets become unpredictable. Computer simulations of the Solar System's evolution over the next five billion years suggest that there is a small (less than 1%) chance that a collision could occur between Earth and either [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], or [[Mars]].&lt;ref name=nature459_817/&gt;&lt;ref name=odp200906/&gt; During the same interval, the odds that the Earth will be scattered out of the Solar System by a passing star are on the order of one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. In such a scenario, the oceans would freeze solid within several million years, leaving only a few pockets of liquid water about {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} underground. There is a remote chance that the Earth will instead be captured by a passing [[binary star]] system, allowing the planet's biosphere to remain intact. The odds of this happening are about one chance in three million.{{sfn|Adams|2008|pp=33–44}}

==Orbit and rotation==
The gravitational perturbations of the other planets in the Solar System combine to modify the [[Earth's orbit|orbit of the Earth]] and the [[Earth's rotation|orientation of its spin axis]]. These changes can influence the planetary climate.&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt;&lt;ref name=sci289_5486/&gt;{{sfn|Hanslmeier|2009|p=116}}{{sfn|Roberts|1998|p=60}}&lt;!-- This paragraph is a summary of the material below. --&gt; Despite such interactions, highly accurate simulations show that overall, Earth's orbit is likely to remain dynamically stable for billions of years into the future. In all 1,600 simulations, the planet's [[semimajor axis]], [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], and [[orbital inclination|inclination]] remained nearly constant.&lt;ref name=Zeebe2015/&gt;

===Glaciation===
Historically, there have been cyclical [[ice age]]s in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in [[ocean circulation]] and [[continentality]] induced by [[plate tectonics]].{{sfn|Lunine|Lunine|1999|p=244}} The [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch theory]] predicts that [[glacial period]]s occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal [[orbital eccentricity]], a low [[axial tilt]] (or obliquity), and the alignment of [[summer solstice]] with the [[aphelion]].&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt; Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05.&lt;ref name=qsr10_4/&gt;&lt;ref name=maslin_ridgwell05/&gt; This is equivalent to a change of the [[semiminor axis]] of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the [[semimajor axis]] to 99.88%, respectively.&lt;ref name=weisstein03/&gt;

The Earth is passing through an ice age known as the [[quaternary glaciation]], and is presently in the [[Holocene]] [[interglacial period]]. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years.{{sfn|Roberts|1998|p=60}} However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the [[atmosphere]] by humans may delay the onset of the next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a [[global warming]] period of finite duration (based on the assumption that [[fossil fuel]] use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of [[greenhouse gas]] emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt;

===Obliquity===
[[File:Tidal braking.svg|thumb|alt=A small gray circle at the top represents the Moon. A green circle centered in a blue ellipse represents the Earth and its oceans. A curved arrow shows the counterclockwise direction of the Earth's rotation, resulting in the long axis of the ellipse being slightly out of alignment with the Moon.|The rotational offset of the [[tidal bulge]] exerts a net [[torque]] on the Moon, boosting it while slowing the [[Earth's rotation]] (not to scale).]]

The [[tidal acceleration]] of the [[Moon]] slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the [[Earth-Moon distance]]. Friction effects—between the [[Inner core|core]] and [[Earth mantle|mantle]] and between the atmosphere and surface—can dissipate the Earth's rotational energy. These combined effects are expected to increase the [[Earth's rotation|length of the day]] by more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;hours over the next 250 million years, and to increase the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] by about a half degree. The distance to the Moon will increase by about 1.5 Earth radii during the same period.&lt;ref name=aaa428/&gt;

Based on computer models, the presence of the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes.&lt;ref name=nature361/&gt; This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the [[precession]] rate of the Earth's spin axis, thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane (that is, the precession motion of the [[ecliptic]]).&lt;ref name=icarus168_2/&gt; However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.&lt;ref name=aaa318/&gt;

A high obliquity would probably result in dramatic changes in the climate and may destroy the planet's [[Planetary habitability|habitability]].{{sfn|Hanslmeier|2009|p=116}} When the axial tilt of the Earth exceeds 54°, the yearly [[insolation]] at the equator is less than that at the poles. The planet could remain at an obliquity of 60° to 90° for periods as long as 10&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=gsl29_23/&gt;

==Geodynamics==
[[File:Pangaea continents.svg|right|250px|thumb|alt=An irregular green shape against a blue background represents Pangaea.|[[Pangaea]] was the last [[supercontinent]] to form before the present.]]

[[Tectonics]]-based events will continue to occur well into the future and the surface will be steadily reshaped by [[tectonic uplift]], [[Extrusive|extrusions]], and [[erosion]]. [[Mount Vesuvius]] can be expected to erupt about 40 times over the next 1,000 years. During the same period, about five to seven earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater should occur along the [[San Andreas Fault]], while about 50 magnitude 9 events may be expected worldwide. [[Mauna Loa]] should experience about 200 eruptions over the next 1,000 years, and the [[Old Faithful Geyser]] will likely cease to operate. The [[Niagara Falls]] will continue to retreat upstream, reaching [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in about 30,000&amp;ndash;50,000 years.&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

In 10,000 years, the post-glacial rebound of the [[Baltic Sea]] will have reduced the depth by about {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Hudson Bay]] will decrease in depth by 100&amp;nbsp;m over the same period.&lt;ref name=odp200906/&gt; After 100,000 years, the island of [[Hawaii]] will have shifted about {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest. The planet may be entering another glacial period by this time.&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

===Continental drift===
{{Further|Continental drift}}
The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a [[hydrosphere]]. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt.&lt;ref name="pr114_1" /&gt; The production of [[Radiogenic heat|heat through radiogenic processes]] is sufficient to maintain [[mantle convection]] and plate [[subduction]] for at least the next 1.1 billion years.&lt;ref name="pr118" /&gt;

At present, the continents of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] are moving westward from [[Africa]] and [[Europe]]. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future.{{sfn|Ward|2006|pp=231–32}} These [[geodynamic]] models can be distinguished by the [[subduction]] flux, whereby the [[oceanic crust]] moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, [[Atlantic ocean]] becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, [[Pacific ocean]] remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.&lt;ref name="gr15_3_4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science5859" /&gt;

As the understanding of [[geodynamics]] improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the [[mantle convection]] will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a [[supercontinent]] composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="pepi171_1_4" /&gt;

Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.&lt;ref name=hess5_4/&gt;

====Introversion====
[[File:PangeaUltimaRoughEstimation.png|right|thumb|350px|A rough approximation of [[Pangaea Ultima]], one of the three models for a future supercontinent.]]
[[Christopher Scotese]] and his colleagues have mapped out the predicted motions several hundred million years into the future as part of the [[Paleomap Project]].{{sfn|Ward|2006|pp=231–32}} In their scenario, 50 million years from now the [[Mediterranean sea]] may vanish and the collision between Europe and Africa will create a long mountain range extending to the current location of the [[Persian Gulf]]. [[Australia]] will merge with [[Indonesia]], and [[Baja California]] will slide northward along the coast. New subduction zones may appear off the eastern coast of North and South America, and mountain chains will form along those coastlines. To the south, the migration of Antarctica to the north will cause all of [[Antarctic ice sheet|its ice sheets]] to melt. This, along with the melting of the [[Greenland ice sheet]]s, will raise the average ocean level by {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The inland flooding of the continents will result in climate changes.{{sfn|Ward|2006|pp=231–32}}

As this scenario continues, by 100 million years from the present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around the southern tip of Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called [[Pangaea Ultima]]), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the [[South Pole]], building up a new ice cap.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=92–96}}

====Extroversion====
The first scientist to extrapolate the current motions of the continents was Canadian geologist [[Paul F. Hoffman]] of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that the continents of North and South America would continue to advance across the Pacific Ocean, pivoting about [[Siberia]] until they begin to merge with Asia. He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, [[Amasia (continent)|Amasia]].{{sfn|Nield|2007|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=323–27}} Later, in the 1990s, [[Roy Livermore]] calculated a similar scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and [[Madagascar]] would move across the [[Indian Ocean]] to collide with Asia.&lt;ref name=williams_nield/&gt;

In an extroversion model, the closure of the Pacific Ocean would be complete in about 350&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name="U13B-08"/&gt; This marks the completion of the current [[supercontinent cycle]], wherein the continents split apart and then rejoin each other about every 400–500&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=sa259_1/&gt; Once the supercontinent is built, plate tectonics may enter a period of inactivity as the rate of subduction drops by an [[order of magnitude]]. This period of stability could cause an increase in the mantle temperature at the rate of {{convert|30|-|100|C-change|F-change}} every 100&amp;nbsp;million years, which is the minimum lifetime of past supercontinents. As a consequence, [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] may increase.&lt;ref name=science5859/&gt;&lt;ref name="U13B-08"/&gt;

====Supercontinent====
The formation of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in [[Orogenic uplift|mountain building]], thereby shifting weather patterns. [[Sea level]]s may fall because of increased glaciation.{{sfn|Calkin|Young|1996|pp=9–75}} The rate of surface [[weathering]] can rise, resulting in an increase in the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in more rapid [[biological evolution]] as new [[Ecological niche|niches]] emerge.{{sfn|Thompson|Perry|1997|pp=127–28}}

The formation of a supercontinent insulates the mantle. The flow of heat will be concentrated, resulting in volcanism and the flooding of large areas with basalt. Rifts will form and the supercontinent will split up once more.{{sfn|Palmer|2003|p=164}} The planet may then experience a warming period, as occurred during the [[Cretaceous period]].{{sfn|Thompson|Perry|1997|pp=127–28}}

===Solidification of the outer core===
The iron-rich core region of the Earth is divided into a {{convert|1220|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius solid [[inner core]] and a {{convert|3480|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius liquid [[outer core]].&lt;ref name=gjl156_2_363/&gt; The rotation of the Earth creates convective eddies in the outer core region that cause it to function as a [[dynamo]].{{sfn|Gonzalez|Richards|2004|p=48}} This generates a [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetosphere]] about the Earth that deflects particles from the [[solar wind]], which prevents significant erosion of the atmosphere from [[sputtering]]. As heat from the core is transferred outward toward the mantle, the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid outer core region to freeze, thereby releasing [[thermal energy]] and causing the solid inner core to grow.&lt;ref name=nature473_361/&gt; This iron [[crystallization]] process has been ongoing for about a billion years. In the modern era, the radius of the inner core is expanding at an average rate of roughly {{convert|0.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} per year, at the expense of the outer core.&lt;ref name=science328_5981_1014/&gt; Nearly all of the energy needed to power the dynamo is being supplied by this process of inner core formation.&lt;ref name=pepi110_1_83/&gt;

The growth of the inner core may be expected to consume most of the outer core by some 3–4 billion years from now, resulting in a nearly solid core composed of iron and other [[Heavy metals|heavy elements]]. The surviving liquid envelope will mainly consist of lighter elements that will undergo less mixing.{{sfn|Meadows|2007|p=34}} Alternatively, if at some point plate tectonics comes to an end, the interior will cool less efficiently, which may end the growth of the inner core. In either case, this can result in the loss of the magnetic dynamo. Without a functioning dynamo, the [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field of the Earth]] will decay in a geologically short time period of roughly 10,000 years.{{sfn|Stevenson|2002|p=605}} The loss of the [[magnetosphere]] will cause an increase in erosion of light elements, particularly [[hydrogen]], from the Earth's outer atmosphere into space, resulting in less favorable conditions for life.&lt;ref name=ssr129_1_167/&gt;

== Solar evolution ==
{{see also|Stellar evolution|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}

The energy generation of the Sun is based upon [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]]. This occurs in the core region of the star using the [[proton–proton chain reaction]] process. Because there is no [[Convection zone|convection]] in the [[solar core]], the [[helium]] concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature at the core of the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the [[triple-alpha process]], so these atoms do not contribute to the net energy generation that is needed to maintain [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] of the Sun.&lt;ref name=gough81/&gt;

At present, nearly half the hydrogen at the core has been consumed, with the remainder of the atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.&lt;ref name=gough81/&gt;

[[File:Solar evolution (English).svg|right|thumb|320px|Evolution of the Sun's [[Solar luminosity|luminosity]], [[Solar radius|radius]] and [[effective temperature]] compared to the present Sun. After Ribas (2010).&lt;ref name=ribas2010/&gt;]]
The result of this process has been a steady increase in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a [[main sequence]] star, it radiated only 70% of the current [[luminosity]]. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt; Likewise, in three billion years the Sun is expected to be 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the [[subgiant star|subgiant]] stage and [[stellar evolution|evolve]] into a [[red giant]].&lt;ref name=apj418/&gt;

By this time, the [[Andromeda–Milky Way collision|collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies]] should be underway. Although this could result in the Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or its planets.&lt;ref name=Cain/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cox2008/&gt;

=== Climate impact ===

{{See also|Medea hypothesis}}

The rate of weathering of [[silicate minerals]] will increase as rising temperatures speed up chemical processes. This in turn will decrease the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as these weathering processes convert carbon dioxide gas into solid [[carbonate]]s. Within the next 600 million years from the present, the concentration of carbon dioxide will fall below the critical threshold needed to sustain [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] photosynthesis: about 50 parts per million. At this point, trees and forests in their current forms will no longer be able to survive,&lt;ref name=heath_doyle09/&gt; the last living trees being evergreen [[conifer]]s.&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; However, [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation]] can continue at much lower concentrations, down to above 10 parts per million. Thus plants using {{c4}} photosynthesis may be able to survive for at least 0.8 billion years and possibly as long as 1.2 billion years from now, after which rising temperatures will make the biosphere unsustainable.&lt;ref name=nature360/&gt;&lt;ref name=tellus_b_52_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=grl28_9/&gt; Currently, {{c4}} plants represent about 5% of Earth's plant [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] and 1% of its known plant species.&lt;ref name=Bond2005/&gt; For example, about 50% of all grass species ([[Poaceae]]) use the {{c4}} photosynthetic [[metabolic pathway|pathway]],{{sfn|van der Maarel|2005|p=363}} as do many species in the herbaceous family [[Amaranthaceae]].&lt;ref name=ijps164_6/&gt;

When the levels of carbon dioxide fall to the limit where photosynthesis is barely sustainable, the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to oscillate up and down. This will allow land vegetation to flourish each time the level of carbon dioxide rises due to [[tectonic]] activity and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] from animal life. However, the long term trend is for the plant life on land to die off altogether as most of the remaining carbon in the atmosphere becomes [[Carbon sequestration|sequestered]] in the Earth.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=117–28}} Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of carbon dioxide of a few parts per million, so these life forms would probably disappear only because of rising temperatures and the loss of the biosphere.&lt;ref name=nature360/&gt;

Plants—and, by extension, animals—could survive longer by evolving other strategies such as requiring less carbon dioxide for photosynthetic processes, becoming [[Carnivorous plant|carnivorous]], adapting to [[desiccation]], or [[mycoheterotrophy|associating with]] [[fungi]]. These adaptations are likely to appear near the beginning of the moist greenhouse (see [[Future of the Earth#Loss of oceans|further]]).&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt;

The loss of plant life will also result in the eventual loss of oxygen as well as ozone due to the respiration of animals, chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and volcanic eruptions. This will result in less [[attenuation]] of [[DNA]]-damaging UV,&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; as well as the death of animals; the first animals to disappear would be large [[mammal]]s, followed by small mammals, birds, [[amphibian]]s and large fish, [[reptile]]s and small fish, and finally [[invertebrate]]s. Before this happens, it's expected that life would concentrate at refugia of lower temperature such as high elevations where less land surface area is available, thus restricting population sizes. Smaller animals would survive better than larger ones because of lesser oxygen requirements, while birds would fare better than mammals thanks to their ability to travel large distances looking for colder temperatures.&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt;

In their work ''The Life and Death of Planet Earth'', authors [[Peter D. Ward]] and [[Donald Brownlee]] have argued that some form of animal life may continue even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the [[Burgess Shale]] in [[British Columbia, Canada]], to determine the climate of the [[Cambrian explosion|Cambrian Explosion]], and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with [[Marine life|sea life]]. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from [[asphyxia]]tion within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=117–28}}

As temperatures continue to rise, the last of animal life will be driven toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the [[polar night]], [[aestivation|aestivating]] during the [[polar day]] due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily be found in the oceans.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=117–28}} However, due to a decrease in the amount of organic matter entering the oceans from land as well as a decrease in [[Dissolved Oxygen|dissolved oxygen]],&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; sea life would disappear too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of [[Fresh water|freshwater]] species and conclude with invertebrates,&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt; particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as [[termite]]s or those near [[hydrothermal vents]] such as [[worm]]s of the genus ''[[Riftia]]''.&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; As a result of these processes, [[Multicellular organism|multicellular life forms]] may be extinct in about 800 million years, and [[eukaryote]]s in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the [[prokaryote]]s.&lt;ref name=bd2_6_1665/&gt;

=== Loss of oceans{{anchor|Ocean-free_era}} ===
[[File:Venuspioneeruv.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Light brown clouds wrap around a planet, as seen from space.|The [[atmosphere of Venus]] is in a "super-greenhouse" state.]]
One billion years from now, about 27% of the modern ocean will have been subducted into the mantle. If this process were allowed to continue uninterrupted, it would reach an equilibrium state where 65% of the current surface reservoir would remain at the surface.&lt;ref name=hess5_4 /&gt; Once the solar luminosity is 10% higher than its current value, the average global surface temperature will rise to {{convert|320|K|C F}}. The atmosphere will become a "moist greenhouse" leading to a [[Runaway greenhouse effect|runaway]] [[evaporation]] of the oceans.&lt;ref name=mnras386_1/&gt;{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} At this point, models of the Earth's future environment demonstrate that the [[stratosphere]] would contain increasing levels of water. These water molecules will be broken down through [[photodissociation]] by solar UV, allowing hydrogen to [[Atmospheric escape|escape the atmosphere]]. The net result would be a loss of the world's sea water by about 1.1 billion years from the present.&lt;ref name=icarus74/&gt;&lt;ref name=guinan_ribas/&gt; This will be a simple dramatic step in annihilating all life on Earth.

There will be two variations of this future warming feedback: the "moist greenhouse" where water vapor dominates the [[troposphere]] while water vapor starts to accumulate in the stratosphere (if the oceans evaporate very quickly), and the "runaway greenhouse" where water vapor becomes a dominant component of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] (if the oceans evaporate too slowly). The Earth will undergo rapid warming that could send its surface temperature to over {{Cvt|900|C|F K}} as the atmosphere will be totally overwhelmed by water vapor, causing its entire surface to melt and killing all life, perhaps in about 3 billion years. In this ocean-free era, there will continue to be surface reservoirs as water is steadily released from the deep crust and mantle,&lt;ref name=hess5_4/&gt; where it is estimated that there is an amount of water equivalent to several times that currently present in the Earth's oceans.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=94}} Some water may be retained at the poles and there may be occasional rain storms, but for the most part the planet would be a dry desert with large [[dune]]fields covering its equator, and a few [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] on what was once the ocean floor, similar to the ones in the [[Atacama Desert]] in Chile.&lt;ref name=lunine09/&gt;

With no water to serve as a lubricant, plate tectonics would very likely stop and the most visible signs of geological activity would be [[shield volcano]]es located above mantle [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]].{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}}&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; In these arid conditions the planet may retain some microbial and possibly even multicellular life.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} Most of these microbes will be [[halophile]]s and life could find refuge in the atmosphere as [[Life on Venus#Recent speculation|has been proposed to have happened on Venus]].&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; However, the increasingly extreme conditions will likely lead to the extinction of the prokaryotes between 1.6 billion years&lt;ref name=bd2_6_1665/&gt; and 2.8 billion years from now, with the last of them living in residual ponds of water at high [[latitude]]s and heights or in caverns with trapped ice. However, underground life could last longer.&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt; What proceeds this depends on the level of tectonic activity. A steady release of carbon dioxide by volcanic eruption could cause the atmosphere to enter a "super-greenhouse" state like that of the planet [[Venus]]. But, as stated above, without surface water, plate tectonics would probably come to a halt and most of the carbonates would remain securely buried&lt;ref name=lunine09/&gt; until the Sun becomes a red giant and its increased luminosity heated the rock to the point of releasing the carbon dioxide.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=94}}

The loss of the oceans could be delayed until 2 billion years in the future if the [[atmospheric pressure]] were to decline. A lower atmospheric pressure would reduce the [[greenhouse effect]], thereby lowering the surface temperature. This could occur if [[Nitrogen cycle|natural processes were to remove the nitrogen from the atmosphere]]. Studies of organic sediments has shown that at least {{convert|100| kPa|atm|lk=on}} of nitrogen has been removed from the atmosphere over the past four billion years; enough to effectively double the current atmospheric pressure if it were to be released. This rate of removal would be sufficient to counter the effects of increasing solar luminosity for the next two billion years.&lt;ref name=pnas106_24/&gt;

By 2.8 billion years from now, the surface temperature of the Earth will have reached {{convert|422|K|C F}}, even at the poles. At this point, any remaining life will be extinguished due to the extreme conditions. If the Earth loses its surface water by this point, the planet will stay in the same conditions until the Sun becomes a red giant.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} If this scenario does not happen, then in about 3–4 billion years the amount of water vapour in the lower atmosphere will rise to 40% and a "moist greenhouse" effect will commence&lt;ref name=pnas106_24/&gt; once the luminosity from the Sun reaches 35–40% more than its present-day value.&lt;ref name=icarus74/&gt; A "runaway greenhouse" effect will ensue, causing the atmosphere to heat up and raising the surface temperature to around {{convert|1600|K|C F}}. This is sufficient to melt the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name=guinan_ribas/&gt;{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} However, most of the atmosphere will be retained until the Sun has entered the red giant stage.&lt;ref name=minard09/&gt;

With the extinction of life, 2.8 billion years from now it is also expected that Earth [[biosignature]]s will disappear, to be replaced by signatures caused by non-biological processes.&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt;

=== Red giant stage ===

[[File:Sun red giant.svg|thumb|240px|right|alt=A large red disk represents the Sun as a red giant. An inset box shows the current Sun as a yellow dot.|The size of the current Sun (now in the [[main sequence]]) compared to its estimated size during its [[red giant]] phase]]
Once the Sun changes from burning hydrogen at its core to burning hydrogen around its shell, the core will start to contract and the outer envelope will expand. The total luminosity will steadily increase over the following billion years until it reaches 2,730 times the Sun's current [[solar luminosity|luminosity]] at the age of 12.167 billion years. Most of Earth's atmosphere will be lost to space and its surface will consist of a [[Lava-ocean planet|lava ocean]] with floating continents of metals and metal oxides as well as [[iceberg]]s of [[Refractory|refractory materials]], with its surface temperature reaching more than {{convert|2400|K|C F}}.&lt;ref name="Kargel2003"/&gt; The Sun will experience more rapid mass loss, with about 33% of its total mass shed with the [[solar wind]]. The loss of mass will mean that the orbits of the planets will expand. The orbital distance of the Earth will increase to at most 150% of its current value.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt;

The most rapid part of the Sun's expansion into a red giant will occur during the final stages, when the Sun will be about 12 billion years old. It is likely to expand to swallow both Mercury and Venus, reaching a maximum radius of {{convert|1.2|AU|km|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The Earth will interact tidally with the Sun's outer atmosphere, which would serve to decrease Earth's orbital radius. Drag from the [[chromosphere]] of the Sun would also reduce the Earth's orbit. These effects will act to counterbalance the effect of mass loss by the Sun, and the Earth will probably be engulfed by the Sun.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt;

The drag from the solar atmosphere may cause the [[orbit of the Moon]] to decay. Once the orbit of the Moon closes to a distance of {{convert|18470|km|mi|abbr=on}}, it will cross the Earth's [[Roche limit]]. This means that tidal interaction with the Earth would break apart the Moon, turning it into a [[ring system]]. Most of the orbiting ring will then begin to decay, and the debris will impact the Earth. Hence, even if the Earth is not swallowed up by the Sun, the planet may be left moonless.&lt;ref name=space070122/&gt; The [[ablation]] and [[vaporization]] caused by its fall on a decaying trajectory towards the Sun may remove Earth's mantle, leaving just its core, which will finally be destroyed after at most 200 years.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jianke1998/&gt; Following this event, Earth's sole legacy will be a very slight increase (0.01%) of the solar [[metallicity]].&lt;ref name="RvMP1997"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;§IIC&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Post-red giant stage ===

[[File:NGC7293 (2004).jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Helix nebula]], a planetary nebula similar to what the Sun will produce in 8 billion years.]]

After fusing helium in its core to [[carbon]], the Sun will begin to collapse again, [[stellar evolution|evolving]] into a compact [[white dwarf]] star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a [[planetary nebula]]. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become [[tidelock]]ed, with each showing only one face to the other.&lt;ref name="tide1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract [[angular momentum]] from the system, causing the [[lunar orbit]] to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.&lt;ref name="canup_righter"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 65 billion years, it is estimated that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the [[Earth–Moon system]] being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2017/01/31/earth-and-moon-may-be-on-long-term-collision-course/#38a21ffa3c68|work=Forbes|author=Bruce Dorminey|title=Earth and Moon May Be on Long-Term Collision Course|date=31 January 2017|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun in 7.6 billion years, then on a time scale of 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; (10 quintillion) years the remaining planets in the Solar System will be ejected from the system by [[violent relaxation]]. If this does not occur to the Earth, the ultimate fate of the planet will be that it collides with the [[black dwarf]] Sun due to the decay of its orbit via [[gravitational radiation]], in 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name="dyson"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5287">'''Generative topographic map''' ('''GTM''') is a [[machine learning]] method that is a probabilistic counterpart of the [[self-organizing map]] (SOM), is probably convergent and does not require a shrinking [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] or a decreasing step size. It is a [[generative model]]: the data is assumed to arise by first probabilistically picking a point in a low-dimensional space, mapping the point to the observed high-dimensional input space (via a smooth function), then adding noise in that space. The parameters of the low-dimensional probability distribution, the smooth map and the noise are all learned from the training data using the [[expectation-maximization]] (EM) algorithm.  GTM was introduced in 1996 in a paper by [[Christopher Bishop]], Markus Svensen, and Christopher K. I. Williams.

== Details of the algorithm ==
The approach is strongly related to [[density networks]] which use [[importance sampling]] and a [[multi-layer perceptron]] to form a non-linear [[latent variable model]]. In the GTM the latent space is a discrete grid of points which is assumed to be non-linearly projected into data space. A [[Gaussian noise]] assumption is then made in data space so that the model becomes a constrained [[Gaussian mixture model|mixture of Gaussians]]. Then the model's likelihood can be maximized by EM.

In theory, an arbitrary nonlinear parametric deformation could be used.  The optimal parameters could be found by gradient descent, etc.

The suggested approach to the nonlinear mapping is to use a [[radial basis function network]] (RBF) to create a nonlinear mapping between the latent space and the data space. The nodes of the  
RBF network then form a feature space and the nonlinear mapping can then be taken as a [[linear transform]] of this feature space.  This approach has the advantage over the suggested density network approach that it can be optimised analytically.

== Uses ==
In data analysis, GTMs are like a nonlinear version of [[principal components analysis]], which allows high-dimensional data to be modelled as resulting from Gaussian noise added to sources in lower-dimensional latent space.  For example, to locate stocks in plottable 2D space based on their hi-D time-series shapes.  Other applications may want to have fewer sources than data points, for example mixture models.

In generative [[deformational modelling]], the latent and data spaces have the same dimensions, for example, 2D images or 1 audio sound waves.  Extra 'empty' dimensions are added to the source (known as the 'template' in this form of modelling), for example locating the 1D sound wave in 2D space.  Further nonlinear dimensions are then added, produced by combining the original dimensions.  The enlarged latent space is then projected back into the 1D data space.  The probability of a given projection is, as before, given by the product of the likelihood of the data under the Gaussian noise model with the prior on the deformation parameter.  Unlike conventional spring-based deformation modelling, this has the advantage of being analytically optimizable.  The disadvantage is that it is a 'data-mining' approach, i.e. the shape of the deformation prior is unlikely to be meaningful as an explanation of the possible deformations, as it is based on a very high, artificial- and arbitrarily constructed nonlinear latent space.  For this reason the prior is learned from data rather than created by a human expert, as is possible for spring-based models.

== Comparison with Kohonen's self-organizing maps ==
While nodes in the [[Self-organizing map|self-organizing map (SOM)]] can wander around at will, GTM nodes are constrained by the allowable transformations and their probabilities.  If the deformations are well-behaved the topology of the latent space is preserved.
 
The SOM was created as a biological model of neurons and is a heuristic algorithm. By contrast, the GTM has nothing to do with neuroscience or cognition and is a probabilistically principled model. Thus, it has a number of advantages over SOM, namely:
* it explicitly formulates a density model over the data.
* it uses a cost function that quantifies how well the map is trained.
* it uses a sound optimization procedure ([[Expectation maximization|EM]] algorithm).

GTM was introduced by Bishop, Svensen and Williams in their Technical Report in 1997 (Technical Report NCRG/96/015, Aston University, UK) published later in Neural Computation. It was also described in the [[PhD]] thesis of Markus Svensen (Aston, 1998).

'''George Henry Sheldon''' (June 3, 1947 – August 23, 2018) was an American attorney and politician who served as a member of the [[Florida House of Representatives]], as the Secretary of the [[Florida Department of Children and Families]], and as the Acting Assistant Secretary at the federal [[Administration for Children and Families]] within the [[Department of Health and Human Services]]. He ran unsuccessfully in the [[Florida Attorney General election, 2014|2014 Florida Attorney General election]].&lt;ref name=GS2014&gt;{{cite web|title=George Sheldon 2014 Website|url=http://www.georgesheldon2014.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

==Biography==
George Sheldon was born in [[Wildwood, New Jersey]] on June 3, 1947. He was raised in [[Plant City, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haught.care/notices/George-Sheldon George Henry Sheldon-obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; He received both his B.A. and J.D. from [[Florida State University]].&lt;ref name=HHS&gt;{{cite web|title=George Sheldon, Acting Assistant Secretary|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/about/leadership/george-sheldon|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheldon's political career began in 1969, when he was a legislative aide for state senator and future governor [[Reubin Askew]]. Sheldon was a state representative in the [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] area from 1974 to 1982, before running against Congressman [[Michael Bilirakis]]. Sheldon would serve in private practice until 1999, when he became Deputy Attorney General for Central Florida under Attorney General [[Bob Butterworth]]. In 2003, he assumed the post of Associate Dean at St Thomas University School of Law; and in 2008, Sheldon became the Secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families under governor [[Charlie Crist]]. While at Florida DCF, Sheldon played a key role in relief efforts for refugees from Haiti's 2010 earthquake.&lt;ref name=PBP2&gt;{{cite news|last=Musgrave|first=Jane|title=Florida hospitals handling hundreds of Haiti victims, state official says|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional/florida-hospitals-handling-hundreds-of-haiti-victi/nL2gs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also recognized by a national child welfare coalition as leading the "largest transformation of an American child welfare system in recent decades, turning Florida from the national example of failure into, relatively speaking, a leader in doing child welfare right." &lt;ref name=NCCPR&gt;{{cite news|title=Big boost for child welfare reform: George Sheldon to run ACF|url=http://www.nccprblog.org/2011/05/big-boost-for-child-welfare-reform.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon would later become the Acting Assistant Secretary for the federal [[Administration for Children and Families]] in the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] from 2011 to 2013.&lt;ref name=HHS /&gt;&lt;ref name=PBP&gt;{{cite news|last=Valdes|first=Ana|title=Former Florida Children and Families chief tapped for U.S. post|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional/former-florida-children-and-families-chief-tappe-1/nLsRd/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheldon was the Democratic nominee for [[Attorney General of Florida]] in the [[Florida Attorney General election, 2014|2014 election]], but lost to incumbent Republican [[Pam Bondi]].&lt;ref name=Sheldon&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Sickler|first=Michael|title=Democrat George Sheldon challenging Attorney General Pam Bondi|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/democrat-george-sheldon-challenging-attorney-general-pam-bondi/2148324|accessdate=October 22, 2013|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheldon died from complications of a fall in [[Miami, Florida]], on August 23, 2018, at the age of 71.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article217264940.html|title=George Sheldon, a former DCF secretary and a champion for foster children, dies|work=miamiherald|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] estimates that Abdulghupur was born in 1973 in [[Ghulja]], [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous Region, China.

He was one of the 22 [[Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo|Uighurs held in Guantanamo]] for many years even though it became clear early on that they were innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/04/02/innocent_detainees_need_a_home/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Innocent detainees need a home | first1=Bill | last1=Delahunt | first2=Sabin | last2=Willett | date=April 2, 2009 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s6nTMyn0?url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/04/02/innocent_detainees_need_a_home/ | archivedate=2010-08-19 | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/17-innocent-uighurs-detained-guant%C3%A1namo-ask-supreme-court-release 17 Innocent Uighurs Detained at Guantánamo Ask Supreme Court for Release &amp;#124; Center for Constitutional Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5s6nfQuCV?url=http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/17-innocent-uighurs-detained-guant%C3%A1namo-ask-supreme-court-release |date=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AsiaTimes041104&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FK04Ad02.html China's Uighurs trapped at Guantanamo], ''[[Asia Times]]'', November 4, 2004 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5iiEnVC9Y?url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FK04Ad02.html |date=August 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won his [[habeas corpus]] case in 2008. Judge [[Ricardo Urbina]] declared his detention unlawful and ordered for him to be set free in the [[United States]].

In December 2013, after having been held at Guantanamo for over eleven years, Abdulghupur was transferred to Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/us/us-frees-last-of-uighur-detainees-from-guantanamo.html?_r=0|title=U.S. Frees Last of the Chinese Uighur Detainees From Guantánamo Bay|date=December 31, 2013|first=Charlie|last=Savage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hank Henshaw''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] featured in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], who normally goes by the name '''[[Cyborg Superman]]'''. While originally featured primarily as an enemy of [[Superman]], he has in recent years also been an enemy of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. 

At times, he is also referred to as ''The Cyborg'' (not to be confused with Victor Stone a.k.a. [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]).&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Cyborg Superman | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 91 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
While the character debuted in ''[[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' #465 (May 1990) and was created by [[Dan Jurgens]], he was reintroduced as the original [[Cyborg Superman#Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] during the ''Reign of the Supermen'' storyline following [[The Death of Superman|Superman's death]].

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Hank henshaw origins.PNG|Left: Hank Henshaw and the ''Excalibur'' crew after being exposed to the radiation. Right: Hank Henshaw as his body decays. Art by [[Dan Jurgens]].|thumb|left]]
Hank Henshaw first appeared as a crew member on board the doomed NASA [[space shuttle]] ''Excalibur'' in ''[[Superman (vol. 2)|Superman]]'' #42, and Henshaw and the other crew members were next seen in ''Adventures of Superman'' #465.&lt;ref name="superman42"&gt;{{Cite comic

In a [[pastiche]] of the origin of the [[Fantastic Four]], Hank and the other three members of the ''Excalibur'' crew, including his wife Terri, are part of a radiation experiment designed by [[LexCorp]] that is affected by a [[solar flare]], causing their shuttle to crash.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; As a result of their radiation exposure, the human bodies of two crew members were destroyed. However, their minds survived and they were able to construct new bodies out of cosmic radiation and bits of earth and wreckage from the shuttle, respectively. Initially, Henshaw and his wife suffer no ill effects from the radiation (though Hank's hair turns white), and the crew travels to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] in the hopes of using LexCorp facilities to cure their mutated crew mates. During a brief battle with Superman, one crew member, now composed of radiation, becomes unhinged and flies into the sun, thereby destroying himself. By this time, Henshaw's body has started to rapidly decay while his wife is beginning to phase into an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]]. With Superman's help, Henshaw is able to use the LexCorp facilities to save Terri. The remaining member of the shuttle crew commits suicide using an MRI booth to tear apart the metallic components of his body.&lt;ref name="adventures466"&gt;{{Cite comic

Though Henshaw's physical body expired, he was able to transfer his consciousness into the LexCorp mainframe. Now able to control technology, Henshaw appears to his wife in a robotic body. The shock of this bizarre rebirth is too much for Terri to bear and in a fit of insanity, she jumps to her death from the nearest window. By this point, Henshaw's electronic consciousness has begun to disrupt Earth's communications networks. Using [[NASA]] communications equipment, Henshaw beams his mind into the birthing matrix which had carried [[Superman]] from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] to Earth as an infant.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; He creates a small exploration craft from the birthing matrix and departs into outer space alone.&lt;ref name="adventures468"&gt;{{Cite comic

Henshaw spends some time traveling between planets, bonding with local lifeforms to learn about the culture and history of various worlds. Henshaw would later come to believe that Superman was responsible for the tragedy of the ''Excalibur'' after learning that around the time of the accident, the Man of Steel had thrown a rogue Kryptonian artificial intelligence (the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]) into the sun. Henshaw believes that this created the solar flare that resulted in the ''Excalibur'' crew's transformations (although Superman had shared this concern with Terri after he saved her life and she had confirmed that the flares would have been triggered ''before'' Superman disposed of the Eradicator).&lt;ref name="sinestrocorps"&gt;{{Cite comic

Arriving on a planet controlled by alien overlord and Superman foe [[Mongul]], Henshaw learns of [[Warworld]] and forcibly recruits Mongul as part of a plan for revenge against Superman.&lt;ref name="superman81"&gt;{{Cite comic

===Reign of the Supermen===
{{Main article|The Death of Superman}}
[[File:Superman79.png|thumb|upright|left|Cover of ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #79. Art by [[Dan Jurgens]].]]
With Superman apparently dead after his battle with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Henshaw decides to pose as him in order to destroy his reputation. To that end, the Cyborg claims to be Superman [[Resurrection|reborn]], the result of the hero's body being pieced together and revived with technology. The Cyborg then uses knowledge obtained from Superman's birthing matrix to construct a body that is genetically identical to Superman.&lt;ref name="superman81" /&gt; When analyzed closely by [[Professor Hamilton]], the Cyborg passes for the real thing due to components within himself that include Kryptonian alloys, combined with the fact that the replaced body parts correspond with those parts of the original Superman's body that were most severely injured in his fight with Doomsday.&lt;ref name="superman78"&gt;{{Cite comic

After destroying a Superman memorial plaque in front of the Daily Planet, the Cyborg exiles Doomsday into space, prevents a [[nuclear meltdown]], and saves the [[President of the United States]] from an [[assassination]] attempt. The White House then endorses the Cyborg as the 'true' Superman.&lt;ref name="adventures500" &gt;{{Cite comic

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When confronted by [[Lois Lane]], the Cyborg claims his memory is "blurry" but he can see a "spaceship on a farm and the name Kent", suggesting that Henshaw may be aware of Superman's [[secret identity]].&lt;ref name="superman78" /&gt;

Henshaw's arrival as Superman, the self-styled Man of Tomorrow, was simultaneous with that of three others: [[John Henry Irons]] (the self-styled Man of Steel), [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]] (the self-styled Last Son of Krypton), and the modern [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]].&lt;ref name="adventures500" /&gt; The endorsement of the President ensures that the Cyborg eclipses the rest of the heroes claiming to be Superman's heir. During this time, two cults spring up in anticipation of Superman's return from the dead; one that deifies the Eradicator and another that venerates the Cyborg. Supporters of both eventually come to blows over which is the real Superman. This is a foreshadowing of a battle yet to come between the Cyborg and the Eradicator.

===Destroying Coast City===
When an alien ship appears over [[Coast City]], the Cyborg attacks and severely injures the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]], allowing Mongul's craft to destroy the city. The Cyborg also murders an entire family of vacationers trying to find a way out of the devastated area.&lt;ref name="superman80"&gt;{{Cite comic

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Green Lantern]] defeats Mongul, the Cyborg lures Superman and the Eradicator to the Engine City main reactor and attempts to kill Superman with the Kryptonite that powers the engine. When Henshaw tries to kill Superman with a concentrated blast of Kryptonite radiation, the Eradicator intercepts the blast at the expense of his own life. As the Kryptonite energy passes through the Eradicator, the radiation is altered and acts to fully restore Superman's powers. Superman is then able to easily defeat the already weakened Cyborg by sticking his arm through Henshaw's chest, killing him and shattering his body. When Henshaw panics and states that he will "somehow" find a way to come back, a doubting Superman simply says that if he does, he will be waiting.&lt;ref name="superman82"&gt;{{Cite comic

It was later revealed that Henshaw chose to attack Coast City first because he and his late wife were former residents. This was part of an effort to erase his former life.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) # 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return===
[[File:Hunter Prey -1 - Page 27 - Hank Henshaw.jpg|thumb|upright|Hank Henshaw in ''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey'' #1, drawn by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[Brett Breeding]]]]
Before exiling Doomsday into space, Henshaw had installed a device on the monster to allow him to detect if Doomsday were to ever escape. After the destruction of his Cyborg Superman form, Henshaw transfers his consciousness into this device as Doomsday is "the safest place in the galaxy" for the Cyborg to hide. Doomsday is brought on board a space cruiser and, despite frantic efforts of the crew to jettison him, kills the crew, and upon landing on [[Apokolips]], proceeds to pillage the planet.
 
When Superman, his power now boosted by being repowered by "purple Kryptonite", arrives; Henshaw emerges by reconfiguring an armored Apokoliptian trooper, brutally murdered by Doomsday, into a new body (which by all accounts had its DNA overwritten with the Kryptonian DNA Henshaw had obtained while in Superman's birthing matrix, and thus still retains a portion of Superman's abilities and still looks the way the Cyborg Superman looked, except for a change in the color of the Cyborg's metallic components) and proceeds to lay siege to the planet alongside Doomsday. The Cyborg successfully took over most of Apokolips and, despite resisting them once, was captured by [[Darkseid]]'s Omega Beams during a battle with Superman.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apokolips and beyond===
Darkseid did not kill the Cyborg; rather, the [[Omega Effect]] captured Henshaw in a small orb, with Darkseid planning to use the Cyborg against Superman at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | writer = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] | Penciller = Jurgens, Dan | Inker = Breeding, Brett | Title = Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey | Issue = #3 | date = 1994 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 2-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darkseid eventually frees Henshaw with the understanding that Henshaw is to leave Apokolips and never return.

The Cyborg eventually aligns himself with an intergalactic Tribunal which is seeking to bring Superman to trial for the crimes of his ancestors. Henshaw assists the Tribunal in capturing Eradicator, Superboy, Supergirl, Steel, and [[Alpha Centurion]], who had intended to rescue Superman. However, the Cyborg betrayed the Tribunal and attempted to conquer their planet for conversion into a new Warworld. Superman and his allies stop the Cyborg's plan and, when Henshaw's involvement in the destruction of Coast City is brought to the attention of the Tribunal, they find him guilty of [[genocide]] and sentence him to death. As an electronic consciousness, Henshaw cannot be killed by normal means and is transported beyond the event horizon of a [[black hole]], where not even light can escape from the gravity.

Rather than being destroyed, the Cyborg is transported (unknowingly by another villain, [[Thanos]]) to a [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Multiverse dimension]] designated as [[Earth-616|616]], as seen at the beginning of the ''Green Lantern/Silver Surfer'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]]. The Cyborg destroys a planet in another attempt to recreate Warworld, attracting the attention of the [[Silver Surfer]]. Their short battle is interrupted by the arrival of [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], who has been tracking the Cyborg for some time, seeking vengeance for the destruction of Coast City. In the confusion, Henshaw escapes and is returned to the [[DC Universe]] by the end of the story. Parallax undid the destruction of the planet that Henshaw had caused using power donated from the Silver Surfer.

[[File:Slimedborg.jpg|Henshaw in his later, less Superman-based configuration. Art by [[Doug Mahnke]]|thumb|left]]
The Cyborg encounters [[Hal Jordan]] again at the brink of the [[Source Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Final Night]]'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; a nexus of statues that channels vital energy to preserve the Fourth World. Parallax uses his powers to generate representations of the victims of Coast City, which tear the Cyborg's body apart. Jordan then disperses Henshaw's consciousness, and the Cyborg is seemingly destroyed once again.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

During a crisis involving the Godwave, Superman (wearing his blue energy costume at the time) travels to [[New Genesis]] and encounters Henshaw again. Henshaw has taken part of the Source Wall's structure and crafted a small world made up of his memories, which he uses to taunt Superman before being defeated again. Unknown to Superman, the Cyborg stored his own consciousness in Superman's high-tech containment suit. After Superman returns to Earth, Henshaw escapes and constructs a new body, this time posing as an art teacher at a high school in an attempt to start over. He is a popular teacher and befriends the blind Ashbury Armstrong (daughter of Dirk Armstrong), but ultimately his rage towards Superman causes him to reveal his true identity and his new body is lost in a fight with Superman. To escape detection, Henshaw stores his consciousness in a clay statue. This statue is later stolen by the [[Toyman]] and the two villains join forces to kill Superman. To this end, the Cyborg designs a machine that will break Superman's energy form down into multiple components and beam them to different points in the galaxy, preventing Superman from reforming. A malfunction in the machine causes Superman to split into [[Superman Red/Superman Blue|Superman Blue and Superman Red]], the latter of whom eventually defeats and recaptures the Cyborg.

The Cyborg later attempts to take over [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], but fails when he is defeated by Superman and sent to the [[Phantom Zone]]. Shortly after the ''Superman Y2K'' story, Henshaw escapes the Zone and attacks Superman, who was suffering from Kryptonite poisoning. Henshaw is defeated with the help of the Kandorians and sent back to the Phantom Zone, swearing revenge. However, he is not encountered on subsequent visits to the Zone.

===Manhunters===
Henshaw returns in a form similar to his original body, when he is revealed to be the [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunters]]' new Grandmaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #11 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; With his influence, the Manhunters have been upgraded with organic material, most notably with blood. On the Manhunter home world of Biot, in sector 3601, Henshaw is holding captive several assumed-to-be-dead Green Lanterns, most of whom appeared to die during the ''[[Emerald Twilight]]'' saga.

Henshaw has also used [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] technology to upgrade the Manhunters. During the ''Green Lantern'' story arc ''No Fear'',&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #1-3 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Kryptonian robots are seen servicing the Manhunters. Henshaw, the Grandmaster, allowed the Green Lantern Corps to rebuild for unspecified reasons as a part of his master plan. While Henshaw explains that he first encountered the Manhunters around the time he was imprisoned in the Source Wall by Parallax, it has yet to be revealed how the Cyborg was able to escape the Phantom Zone and take control of Biot. Henshaw is defeated when Biot explodes, destroying most of his body aside from his head.

Henshaw's head is then brought by a Guardian back to Oa so that they can learn of how he was able to take control of Biot, what he has learned from the Manhunters and to learn about "the 52"&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #15&lt;/ref&gt; (referring to the 51 alternate Earths created during the second Crisis as well as their own reality). It is also revealed that the Cyborg knows of the 52, though exactly how he came by this knowledge is not made completely clear. It is stated that he has explored "The Bleed"; the space between dimensions, which could have occurred either when he was imprisoned there, when he was imprisoned in the Source Wall, or in his past exploration of the [[Marvel Universe]].

===Sinestro Corps===
[[File:DoYouFearMeNow.jpg|Cover art for ''Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Cyborg Superman'' #1, by [[Ethan Van Sciver]].|thumb|upright|right]]
Henshaw's head is taken by the [[Sinestro Corps]] after their invasion of Oa to [[Qward]]. Henshaw is later seen as a herald of the newly returned [[Anti-Monitor]]. He reconstructs his cyborg body and replaces the S-symbol on his chest with the symbol of the Sinestro Corps. He now wields ten Qwardian power rings.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special'' #1 (August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed that Henshaw has joined the Sinestro Corps so that the Anti-Monitor can later kill him and allow him to rest in peace.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #22&lt;/ref&gt;

Henshaw was the focus of the ''Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Cyborg Superman'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] that was released on October 3, 2007.&lt;ref name="sinestrocorps"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dccomics.com/comics/?cm=8131 DC Comics' solicitation for the ''Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Cyborg Superman'' one-shot]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/reviews/119194449335916.htm Review of ''Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Cyborg-Superman'' #1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011101506/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/reviews/119194449335916.htm |date=2007-10-11 }}, [[Silver Bullet Comic Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Henshaw and his Manhunters head to Earth to assist the Sinestro Corps in their attack. En route, Henshaw stops leading the Manhunters which continue to their preprogrammed destinations. As he watches them go, he remembers everything that has happened to him, from their dreadful shuttle accident to his wife's suicide when she sees him in his robot form. He finishes this journey down memory lane by going to his wife's grave. He digs her corpse out and rips it into two, shouting that all he wants is not to be with her, but for these memories to fade.&lt;ref name="sinestrocorps"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the Manhunters begin an assault on the JLA satellite. [[Hawkgirl]], [[Black Lightning]], and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] retaliate; however, all three are neutralized when Henshaw assists in the attack and he successfully tampers with the mechanics of the satellite core. As the satellite is thrown out of orbit, Superman appears and engages Henshaw in battle. Their fight continues on Earth, while Sinestro transports his crew and his ship from the anti-matter universe. At first Superman seems to have the upper hand; however after two punches, Henshaw strikes with great power and rage, punching him through the Statue of Liberty. By the end, Henshaw has Superman in a choke hold, thinking that the victory is near.&lt;ref name="sinestrocorps"/&gt;

He is later seen briefly in ''Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Superman-Prime'', having presumably been beaten back by the combined strength of Superman, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], and [[Power Girl]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Superman-Prime #1'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Green Lantern Corps decide to detonate New Warworld and the central power battery of the Sinestro Corps to destroy the Anti-Monitor, Henshaw allows himself to be trapped behind a shield and exposed to the massive explosion. Before he is destroyed, however, he thanks the Green Lantern Corps.&lt;ref name="gl25"&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #25&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Henshaw's body survived the explosion, but it took further damage when Superman-Prime hurled the Anti-Monitor into space. The upper part of his skull was retrieved by the android Manhunters. Unable to detect any life signs and confused without his leadership, the Manhunters reanimated the brain of the Cyborg Superman. He shed a tear when he realized he was still alive.&lt;ref name="gl25"/&gt;

===Death and retrieval===
In the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' crossover, Henshaw would eventually return and work with the Alpha Lanterns as they attempted to augment every Green Lantern, including Ganthet, into an Alpha.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #48 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #49 (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This was apparently at the suggestion of [[Krona (comics)|the robed figure]] holding Ion and Parallax, who told him that Ganthet held the knowledge to destroy him permanently, after Henshaw's attempts to provoke [[Nekron]] into killing him during the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' failed because he lacked a heart to attract Nekron's interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #50 (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; By threatening to make the Alpha Lanterns kill themselves if Ganthet does not cooperate, Henshaw forces Ganthet to work on reversing the augments that turned the Green Lanterns into Alpha Lanterns, hoping that he can use the resulting information to restore his original mortal body.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #51 (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Henshaw was seemingly killed when his lifeforce was finally separated from his nearly indestructible body by the combined full powered blasts of several Lanterns and Ganthet, and appeared on the mental plane of Alpha-Lantern [[Boodikka]] in an attempt to take her bio-mechanical body over, where both beings were their original, un-powered selves. Her essence, gifted with her innate, formidable combat skills, engaged his in one-on-one combat, and she quickly overpowered and killed his astral form.

Afterwards, however, Ganthet noted immediately that there was something different about her. Boodikka claims this is because Ganthet's newly discovered emotions allowed him to see her as she is (Boodikka's true self, now in control of her body again), not by what she is (an Alpha Lantern).&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #52 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Reign of Doomsday]]'' crossover, Boodikka was attacked by Doomsday while investigating the remains of [[New Krypton]], and Henshaw was revealed to still be alive inside her, forming a new body out of her internal circuitry to fight Doomsday while [[Batman]] and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] were trying to repair Boodikka.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America (vol. 3) #55 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Henshaw uses his abilities to take control of the [[JLA Watchtower]] and uses the satellite's defenses in an attempt to kill Doomsday, reasoning that if he could manage to destroy the creature that killed Superman, it would prove once and for all that he is superior to Superman. After the creature is violently dismembered by Henshaw, it somehow absorbs the nanotechnology from Henshaw's body and repairs itself, becoming a new being dubbed '''Cyborg Doomsday'''. Cyborg Doomsday somehow manages to negate Henshaw's ability to repair himself, which leads Henshaw to believe that he might finally meet his demise. Supergirl bursts onto the scene and attempts to stop Doomsday herself, but Henshaw fires an energy blast at her, stating that he would not allow her to defeat the creature that had humiliatingly beaten him only moments before. With Supergirl distracted, Cyborg Doomsday knocks her out and then tears one of Henshaw's arms off before departing with both of his unconscious captives.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman Annual'' #5 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Trapped in a satellite with the other Supermen, the heroes conclude that Henshaw has been trapped with them to keep them disorganized due to the tensions caused by his presence, prompting Henshaw to depart and search the satellite himself. After Superman arrives to rescue his comrades, Henshaw reveals that the Doomsdays that fought them were actually all clones of the original created by Lex Luthor.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #900&lt;/ref&gt; Henshaw tries to fight them, but Superman rips his central node off, knowing that they would not survive a confrontation with the Doomsdays.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #901&lt;/ref&gt; After the Doomsday clones are sent to another dimension, Henshaw is in custody of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #904&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The New 52'' and ''DC Rebirth'' ===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a fully human Henshaw appears as a doctor working for the Advanced Prosthetic Research Centre and colleague of [[Caitlin Fairchild]]. He is tasked into reactivating the android [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Team 7'' (vol. 2) #5 (April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

While in space and after saving a planet called I'noxia, [[Supergirl]] discovers an amnesiac [[Cyborg Superman#Zor-El|Cyborg Superman]] living there. This version is revealed to be '''[[Zor-El]]''', who survives Krypton's destruction and is reconfigured as a half-human half-machine by Brainiac to be his scout looking for stronger species in the universe. His heart was switched with that of a human to remove his ability to be affected by kryptonite.&lt;ref&gt;''Supergirl'' (vol. 6) #21 (August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the human Henshaw is sent into space on the ''Excalibur'' on a long-term mission, he is monitored by the Clark Kent and Lois Lane of the pre-''Flashpoint'' universe, who were trapped in the New 52 world following the ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'', with Superman seeking to prevent the rise of some of his former adversaries in this world. When the ''Excalibur'' crashes after returning from a ten-year journey to Jupiter and back, Superman saves the ship, but is puzzled to see that Henshaw is the only person on board.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Lois &amp; Clark'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Taking Henshaw to a base he has established in the Arctic regions to better assess if this Henshaw is a threat or not, Superman is briefly forced to face both Henshaw and a new foe called Blanque, who possesses powerful telepathic and telekinetic abilities and was also kept in the fortress, but once Blanque is focused on fighting Superman, Henshaw helps Superman defeat this new foe with the weapons of a spaceship that was also kept in the fortress. It is later revealed that Henshaw acquired part of an object known as 'the Oblivion Stone' on Jupiter, with Superman forced to face an alien warrior seeking both Henshaw's part of the stone and another part kept in the fortress, but Superman drives her off, Henshaw claiming when questioned that he has no memory of anything that happened on the ''Excalibur'' or between it landing and him being discovered.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Lois &amp; Clark'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reality disruption caused by [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] caused the histories of the pre-''Flashpoint'' and ''New 52'' Superman to merge during the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' reboot, Henshaw's memories of his past as the Cyborg Superman were restored. With this knowledge, he set out to assemble various old foes of Superman like [[Metallo]], Eradicator, Blanque, and his old 'ally' Mongul to form the [[Superman Revenge Squad]] before using the Oblivion Stone to restore his body to the Cyborg Superman state. He even expressed interest into recruiting [[General Zod]] to his group.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #980&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Superman Revenge Squad]] then set out for Kal-El's fortress of solitude in order to obtain the Phantom Zone Projector, still in need of Zod's kryptonian army to help defeat the superman family. What the cyborg didn't realize was that Zod was simply using everyone within the squad to achieve his own ends. Whom, soon after finding his own family trapped within the zone's confines, betrayed them left and right. Leaving Henry trapped within the penal dimension with the only link leading him back to Earth being severed, thus trapping Cyborg Superman within the phantom zone.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #984&lt;/ref&gt; 

He would soon be released by his hated enemy, Superman. On account of the epiphany Clark had while on a time traveling excursion with [[Booster Gold (comic book)|Booster Gold]]. To keep the maddened bionic menace docile while coming up with a more humane means of detaining him. Superman gave Henry a kryptonian memory crystal that would serve as a trip down memory lane, pacifying the Cyborg Superman's rage by letting him relive his happiest memories in an fantasy world fabricated by power of the mind, his own.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #999&lt;/ref&gt; This self-imposed incarceration would not last however, as the demented machine man would find another means of escape. While he was trapped within his own body, a part of his mind would escape out into the universe where he sought to manipulate the Guardians and their appointed intergalactic law enforcement bureau; The Green Lantern Corps as a means of facilitating his escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lanterns'' #51&lt;/ref&gt; Even trapped within Superman's Kryptonian dwelling Henry was able to influence the central power battery back on Oa a universe away, from within his cell he'd orchestrated a mystery surrounding the death of a Guardian in order to ascertain a powerful weapon with which he could use for his own ends; The Phantom Ring.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lanterns'' #54&lt;/ref&gt; After hacking into the lantern ring network and triggering high alerts up and down the board. Henshaw would use the unsuspecting corpsmen [[Simon Baz]], whom had no idea he was carrying an invisible Phantom Ring on his person, in order to hand deliver it to him as he broke the Cyborg out of the Fortress of Solitude.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lanterns'' #54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Hank Henshaw is a "technomorph." Unlike a simple technopath which can manipulate the physical proponent of technology with their mind. Hank can extend his consciousness into any form of mechanics by commandeering the mechanical energy of all monotonous functions, incorporating them however he sees fit.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #691 (September 1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through it he also gained Kryptonian powers similar to Superman. While editing out some of the standard weaknesses that entail, such as immunity to kryptonite. 

Through his Technomorphing ability he can even commandeer complex alien energy and adjacent harnessing functionality.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #52 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; More than just simple application of a specific Lantern Corps power ring, but parasitically controlling and assimilating with the spectrum energy fueling them and their batteries.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lanterns'' #54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
* Hank Henshaw appears in the first arc of ''[[Smallville Season 11]]'', a comic book continuation of the television series ''[[Smallville]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dccomics.com/comics/smallville-season-11-2012/smallville-season-11-4 DC Comics]&lt;/ref&gt; Henshaw, depicted as a heroic pilot that [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] sends to pilot his new anti-alien Guardian Defense Platform, nearly dies when the Guardian Platform blasts its weapons inside the shuttle, causing a dangerous radiation leak. [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Superman]] rescues the crew (along with Hank's wife, Terri), but Hank gets the radiation-spewing shuttle safely away so civilians will not get injured by it crashing. Superman gets him out as soon as he can, but he is left covered in [[third-degree burns]] and suffering from [[locked-in syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville: Season 11'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Henshaw is treated by Doctor [[Emil Hamilton]], a friend of Superman's, until Lex takes over treatment, transferring Henshaw's consciousness into one of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]' drones, which Hamilton describes as being basically robot Supermen. Once inside the robot body, Henshaw snaps, unable to stand living without a sense of touch, and attacks Luthor, blaming him for both turning him into a machine and (correctly) believing that Luthor caused the accident intentionally (it is later revealed that Luthor wanted to bathe Superman in radiation so he could track his movements and location).&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville: Season 11'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;  Superman is forced to intervene and, after a brief though devastating battle, Superman is able to talk him down. He returns to S.T.A.R. Labs to continue treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville: Season 11'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

* Hank Henshaw also appears in the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story, ''[[JLA: Act of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA: Act of God'' #1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the crossover story ''[[Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future]]'', Henshaw learns of the existence of [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] in the future and uses a salvaged Terminator skull to provide Skynet with information on Superman's weaknesses, subsequently allying with a [[T-X]] unit to eliminate [[John Connor]] and the Superman Family. Despite Henshaw merging with the T-X to battle Superman, he is forced to withdraw when Supergirl infects the hybrid with a computer virus developed by Lex Luthor to use against the Terminators that damages the T-X beyond repair.

===Television===
* In the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' episode "Message in a Bottle", a [[Superman robot]] that resembles the Cyborg Superman appears as the [[property caretaker]] of the [[Fortress of Solitude]] in the [[31st century]] and is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]].
* Hank Henshaw appears in the series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[David Harewood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/supergirl-chyler-leigh-david-harewood-778058 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title='Supergirl': Chyler Leigh, David Harewood | date=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the character is a former CIA agent who is the head of the [[Department of Extranormal Operations]] (DEO). Hank Henshaw places the DEO on high alert when [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] reveals herself, worried that her otherworldly abilities pose a threat to humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/10/31/supergirl-casting-jimmy-olsen-cat-grant/|title=CBS' Supergirl Casting Jimmy Olsen, Cat Grant and Others|last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb|work=TV Line|date=October 31, 2014|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Human For a Day]]", Henshaw reveals to Alex that he is really [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]], an alien refugee. The original Henshaw was obsessed with killing him, and Danvers sacrificed himself to stop Henshaw; J'onzz avenged Danvers' death and took Henshaw's form to ensure humane treatment of aliens by the DEO as well as to watch over both Danvers' daughters. In "Manhunter", it is revealed through flashbacks that the real Henshaw had a prejudice against all aliens, seeing them all as dangerous and untrustworthy, and had founded the DEO to hunt them all down. When Henshaw learned of the Martian Manhunter, an alien from Mars who was seen as the world's most powerful man by even Superman himself, he sent a group of DEO agents including Jeremiah to Peru to hunt him down. Danvers became separated from the group and finds J'onn himself, befriending him upon realizing his true, harmless nature. However, Henshaw was soon informed of Jeremiah's disappearance and tracked him down, discovering him talking to J'onn near a makeshift campfire. Shooting J'onn with a stun gun, Hank attempted to apprehend him, ignoring Jeremiah's pleas and insistence that J'onn was not dangerous. Realizing that Hank was too obsessed with hunting J'onn for his own good, Jeremiah tackled Hank and the two rolled dangerously towards a nearby cliff while wrestling for Hank's weapon. In an attempt to force Danvers to let go of the stun gun, Henshaw fatally stabbed him with a jungle knife, but Jeremiah managed to pull the stun gun from Hank and shock him, causing Hank to fall down the cliff to his death, although his corpse is never actually seen. In the same episode, it is implied that Hank worked with Project Cadmus. In "The Darkest Place," Hank Henshaw is revealed to be alive and has become [[Cyborg Superman]].&lt;ref&gt;Supergirl Episode The Darkest Hour&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the episode he ends up in the Fortress of Solitude inquiring about Project Medusa. In the episode "Medusa," he attacks [[Mon-El]]&lt;ref&gt;Supergirl episode Medusa&lt;/ref&gt; outside a bar and later gets involved in a fight with [[Martian Manhunter]]. He later resurfaced, having masterminded alongside Lillian Luthor [[Metallo]]'s escape alongside Lillian's own escape, as well as later doctoring security footage showing him stealing synthetic Kryptonite by making it seem as though [[Lena Luthor]] had been responsible for the theft and smuggling in of the heart. He ultimately escaped alongside Lillian after Metallo underwent a meltdown from the synthetic Kryptonite heart becoming unstable via chopper. In the episode "Homecoming," he destroys a train track as to escape the DEO.&lt;ref&gt;http://fansided.com/2017/02/27/supergirl-season-2-episode-14-live-stream-watch-homecoming-online/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
* DC's direct-to-DVD movie ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'', based on "[[The Death of Superman]]" storyline, features a variation on the Cyborg Superman character. One of the many changes is a streamlined cast which cuts the four Superman imposters, including Henshaw. Elements from three of the four impostors (Henshaw, [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]), were combined into the Superman clone created by [[Lex Luthor]] in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=30604 |title=DVD Talk Review: Superman - Doomsday |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous===
* During the DC/Marvel crossover ''Green Lantern/[[Silver Surfer]]: Unholy Alliances'', Henshaw is briefly shown in the [[Marvel Universe]], having destroyed a planet due to the tidal stresses generated when he tried to convert it into a new Warworld. He is confronted by the Silver Surfer, who once spared the planet when he acted as a Herald to [[Galactus]]. Henshaw is intrigued at the Surfer's reference to Galactus' power, but the fight is interrupted by [[Hal Jordan]]-currently [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]-seeking revenge for Henshaw's destruction of Coast City. It is later revealed that [[Thanos]] was responsible for Henshaw's appearance in the Marvel Universe; having discovered the multiversal rift created by the destruction of [[Oa]], Thanos plucked Henshaw from the DC Universe to test the rift, later sending [[Terrax]] to the DC Universe to test Kyle Rayner as part of his plan. 
**In the subsequent crossover ''[[Superman/Fantastic Four]]: The Infinite Destruction'', [[Reed Richards]] and his team are forced into an uneasy alliance with Henshaw when Galactus kidnaps Superman and transforms him into his Herald. In conversation with [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]], Henshaw points out the "ironic" similarity between his origin and the FF's. Eventually, Superman is released from his position as Herald when his will proves to be stronger than Galactus' reprogramming, due to the sheer scale of the impact that Krypton's destruction has had on him as a person. The story concludes with Galactus blasting Henshaw with a ray that turns him into a simple metal rod in response to his pleas for perfection, after the discovery that Henshaw was responsible for Superman coming to the Marvel Universe; Henshaw sent Superman a fake message from [[Jor-El]] to suggest that Galactus was involved in Krypton's destruction, seeking the power of becoming a Herald after learning of Galactus in his encounter with the Surfer.

'''Ilford Animal Cemetery''' is an animal cemetery in [[Ilford]] in [[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] that contained over three thousand burials.&lt;ref name=Guardian_2/&gt;  It was founded in the 1920s and is operated by the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]].&lt;ref name=PDSA/&gt;  The cemetery was closed to new burials in the 1960s and gradually became neglected and overgrown.  In the early twenty-first century it was restored with the assistance of a £50,000 grant from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]].&lt;ref name=Guardian_2/&gt;  Headstones were repaired&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; or replaced,&lt;ref name=PDSA/&gt; the entrance gate was repaired, the graves were numbered and a visitor's map was created.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  The cemetery re-opened in 2007 with a ceremony that included a performance of the [[Last Post]] by a bugler from the [[The Rifles|King's Royal Rifle Corps]]&lt;ref name=Mail/&gt; and a pigeon fly-past (although the birds actually took fright at the assembled crowd and flew in the opposite direction).&lt;ref name=Guardian_2/&gt; It was attended by two holders of the [[PDSA Gold Medal]],&lt;ref name=Mail&gt;{{cite news |title= Military honours for courageous animals |author= Beth Hale |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-501915/Military-honours-courageous-animals.html |newspaper= Daily Mail |date= 13 December 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jake (an explosives detection dog)&lt;ref name=Guardian_2/&gt; and [[Endal]] (an assistance dog).&lt;ref name=Mail/&gt;  Also present was Commander Stuart Hett, who had been an officer aboard {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}} and had been tasked with responding to the many letters received by the ship's heroic cat, [[Simon (cat)|Simon]], who is buried at Ilford.&lt;ref name=Guardian_2/&gt;

'''''Insomniac City: New York, Oliver, and Me''''' (also subtitled '''''New York, Oliver Sacks, and Me''''') is a 2017 memoir by writer and photographer [[Bill Hayes (writer, born 1961)|Bill Hayes]], primarily recounting his life in [[New York City]] and his romantic relationship with neurologist and writer [[Oliver Sacks]] over the last seven years of Sacks' life.&lt;ref name="Silberman"/&gt; The book is composed of vignettes narrated in prose, interspersed with poetry and diary entries (Hayes began keeping a diary at Sacks' suggestion), and is illustrated with Hayes' photographs.&lt;ref name="senior"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silberman"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
Following the sudden death of his partner of sixteen years, Hayes rented out his San Francisco apartment and moved to New York City in 2009.&lt;ref name="popova"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McAlpin"/&gt;

Hayes had had a passing social relationship with the neurologist Oliver Sacks, who had written him in 2008 to praise his book ''The Anatomist''. When Hayes moved to New York, his relationship with Sacks – a fellow [[insomnia]]c, and at 75 nearly thirty years his senior – soon turned romantic. Sacks had hidden his homosexuality from most people, and had lived a largely celibate life; at the start of his relationship with Hayes, it had been three and a half decades since his last romantic encounter.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt; Hayes eventually moved into Sacks' building, though they maintained separate apartments.

Hayes reverently describes Sacks' unique and curious mind. The two would use marijuana together (Sacks preferred [[Cannabis edibles|edibles]], and always called it "cannabis"), and Sacks would report on vivid visual hallucinations, owing to his significantly impaired eyesight.&lt;ref name="senior"/&gt; Sacks, an eccentric, was fascinated by the [[periodic table|chemical elements]], insisted on wearing swim goggles to open a bottle of champagne, and was utterly unaware of popular culture (he did not know who [[Michael Jackson]] was).&lt;ref name="white"/&gt; He enjoyed playing classical piano, and the couple shared a love of music. They would often visit botanical gardens, and the mineralogy collection at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Hayes' book is peppered with Sacks' idiosyncratic musings: "Are you conscious of your thoughts before language embodies them?" Of Hayes, he said "I've suddenly realized what you mean to me: you create the need which you fill, the hunger you sate. Like Jesus. And Kierkegaard. And smoked trout..."

Hayes describes caring for Sacks, who suffered a number of age-related infirmities, including sciatica, a bad knee, and significant hearing loss.&lt;ref name="senior"/&gt; He writes, "I help him get ready for bed — 'de-sock' him, fill his water bottle, bring him his sleeping tablets, make sure he has something to read."

In early 2015, Sacks was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer, a recurrence of a rare [[ocular melanoma]] which had afflicted him nine years earlier.&lt;ref name="popova"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sacks"/&gt; He read his own [[CT scan]] and determined the diagnosis for himself.&lt;ref name="senior"/&gt; He declared his wish to avoid heroic life-prolonging measures, preferring to focus on living and working in as much comfort as possible in the time he had. Sacks made his diagnosis public with an essay in the ''New York Times'' on February 19, 2015.&lt;ref name="Sacks"/&gt; He committed himself to finishing numerous writings, telling Hayes, "writing is more important than pain."&lt;ref name="popova"/&gt;

In 2015, Sacks' autobiography ''[[On the Move: A Life]]'' was published. In it, he publicly revealed his homosexuality, and described his relationship with Hayes, to whom he dedicated the book.&lt;ref name="Susoyev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="white"/&gt; The publication date was moved up so that Sacks could see the book released.&lt;ref name="Susoyev"/&gt; Sacks died on August 30, 2015, aged 82, at his New York home, with Hayes at his side.&lt;ref name="Silberman"/&gt;

Throughout his memoir, Hayes documents his relationship with New York City: he describes his feelings about various subway lines, the changing of seasons, and his brief encounters with an assortment of characters – shopkeepers, skateboarding teens, street artists, and homeless people – who are often his photographic subjects.&lt;ref name="senior"/&gt; Hayes writes of New York, "It requires a certain kind of unconditional love to love living here. But New York repays you in time in memorable encounters, at the very least."

==Reception==
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called ''Insomniac City'' "a unique and exuberant celebration of life and love".&lt;ref name="Kirkus"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Hayes' poetry as "pedestrian", but his photographic portraits as "frank, beautiful, bewitching".&lt;ref name="senior"/&gt; ''Brain Pickings'' called the book a "dual love letter...a lyrical reminder that happiness and heartache are inseparably entwined".&lt;ref name="popova"/&gt;

The book was named to [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]'s "best biographies and memoirs of 2017" list.&lt;ref name="Amazon_best"&gt;{{cite web |title=Best biographies and memoirs of 2017 |url=https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_BOTY17_2b1_w?node=17296225011 |website=Amazon.com |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been translated into Korean.&lt;ref name="GBooks"&gt;{{cite web |title=인섬니악 시티: 뉴욕, 올리버 색스 그리고 나 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/%EC%9D%B8%EC%84%AC%EB%8B%88%EC%95%85_%EC%8B%9C%ED%8B%B0.html?id=zPt-tAEACAAJ |website=Google Books |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23111">'''Italo Insolera''' ([[Turin]], February 7, 1929 – [[Rome]], August 27, 2012) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[architect]], [[Urban planning|urban]] and [[Spatial planning|land]] planner, and [[historian]].
[[File:Italo Insolera.jpg|thumb|Italo Insolera (2008)]]

He published several books and essays dealing with the economic, social and cultural circumstances and conditions of urban development, and the use of the ancient [[town]] in the framework of metropolitan development. These issues were also the primary focus of his professional and academic work, where restoration and planning of historical towns and [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental systems]] prevail. He was especially interested in the relationship between [[archaeology]] and the modern city; he proposed solutions for the correct (re)use of ancient towns that included traffic restriction, [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrianization]], and restoration. Some of these have been implemented by [[Municipality|municipal governments]], particularly in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Refer to entry "Insolera Italo" in ''Chi è. Mille nomi dell'Italia che conta'' (Who's who. One thousand names of those who matter in Italy), appendix to no. 44 of [[L'Espresso]], November 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
In 1953, Insolera graduated from [[Sapienza University of Rome|La Sapienza University]], Rome with a degree in [[Architecture]]. He became a licensed architect in 1954, and qualified for university teaching in [[urbanism]] in 1960. In 1962, he published ''[[Roma moderna]]. Un secolo di storia urbanistica'' (Modern Rome: A Century of Urban History), the first book dealing with urban planning and management in Rome from the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]] to the present. The book has subsequently gone through six editions, with the most recent published in 2011.

He was added to the official register of [[Spatial planning|land planners]] in 1971. From 1963 to 1971, he was a lecturer at [[Università Iuav di Venezia|Venice University’s Institute of Architecture]], and from 1971 to 1983 he was a tenured professor of Urban History at [[University of Geneva|Geneva University]]’s School of Architecture. He also taught courses and seminars at the universities of Rome, [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Paris]], [[Kassel]], [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]].

During his tenure in [[Geneva]], he founded and was for four years at the head of the ''Centre de Recherche sur la Rénovation Urbaine'' (Research Centre on Urban Renovation), sponsored by the Swiss National Fund for scientific research.

Originally named Parker Neptune, in honor of his father Parker Sensation, he was raised by Boner's daughter, Patty, as a [[4-H]] project. Neptune was donated by Sherman Boner on December 5, 1942 and was originally intended to be served at a fundraising pig roast until the local navy recruiter had another idea.&lt;ref name=Bismarck&gt;"Needs Signature of Hog to Cash Check for Him." Associated Press. ''The Bismarck Tribune''. [[Bismarck, North Dakota]]. January 15, 1945, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Neptune was a [[Hereford (pig)|Hereford swine]],&lt;ref&gt;"'Auctions' of Pig Raise $62,000 in Bond Sales." UP. ''Hammond Times''. [[Hammond, Louisiana]].

Department of Animal Science&amp;nbsp;— [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater]]. [http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/swine/hereford/index.htm Hereford].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fund raising efforts==
Navy recruiter Don C. Lingle, originally of [[Anna, Illinois]], working at the office in [[Marion, Illinois]], decided to auction the pig to raise [[war bond]]s. Lingle and auctioneer L. Oard Sitter traveled throughout southern Illinois auctioning Neptune for bonds for the battleship ''Illinois'' which was under construction. Eventually, the individual parts of the pig were auctioned; his squeal was auctioned for $25 on at least one occasion. After each auction, King Neptune was returned to be auctioned again later. High demand for appearances by Neptune led them to travel the rest of Illinois raising funds. The mostly red, with white features, Hereford was often displayed covered with a blue Navy blanket and wearing a crown and silver [[earring]]s.

On March 6, 1943, [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois Governor]] [[Dwight H. Green]] purchased King Neptune for $1 million on behalf of the state of [[Illinois]]. At the same auction, one of Neptune's [[bristle]]s was sold for $500.&lt;ref&gt;"One Bristle $500, Pig Sold at $1,000,000." [[United Press]]. ''Waterloo Daily Courier''. [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. March 7, 1943, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one occasion in early 1945, a check was written to King Neptune for his upkeep. The bank asked Lingle to obtain the pig's endorsement to cash the checks. Lingle was promoted to [[Chief Petty Officer]] as a result of his fund raising efforts with Neptune.&lt;ref name=Bismarck/&gt;

Most of the hog's appearances were sponsored by local [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks clubs]] and King Neptune was a life member of the chapters at [[Marion, Illinois]], [[Freeport, Illinois]] and [[Harrisburg, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;"King Neptune, the Hog, Has His Great Day of Triumph." Associated Press. ''Reno Evening Gazette''. [[Reno, Nevada]]. December 7, 1945, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of King Neptune's fundraising career, he, Lingle and Sitter helped raise $19 million in war bonds,&lt;ref&gt;Beth Py-Lieberman. [http://www.jcs-group.com/military/wariipatriots/anybonds.html Any Bonds Today?] Smithsonian.

In 1946, King Neptune was to be sent to the [[Union Stock Yards|Chicago Stockyards]]; however, Lingle regained ownership of the pig and placed him on a local farm where he spent the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="PlanPark"&gt;"Plan National Park In Tribute to Porker."

In 1956, Lingle planned to donate an additional {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of land around the property for use as a Naval Reserve National Park.&lt;ref name="PlanPark"/&gt; However, that plan never materialized, and in 1958 the construction of [[Interstate 57]] forced King Neptune's grave to be temporarily relocated.&lt;ref&gt;"Highway means relocating grave of high priced hog."

In the late 1980s, after the previous monument was heavily vandalized, the state of Illinois placed a second monument commemorating King Neptune at the nearby northbound I-57 rest area ({{coord|37|27|57|N|89|7|55.7|W}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.com/~ilcemete/pulaski/pulaskicohistmarkers/kingneptune.htm Photograph of monument to King Neptune] at the I-57 "Trail of Tears" rest area.&lt;/ref&gt;

His original tombstone said:

[[File:ChristianMartyrsOfNagasaki.jpg|thumb|The Christian [[martyrs of Japan]]; 17th-century Japanese painting]]
A '''martyr''' ([[language|Greek]]: μάρτυς, ''mártys'', "witness"; [[Word stem|stem]] μάρτυρ-, ''mártyr-'') is someone who suffers [[persecution]] and death for advocating, renouncing, refusing to renounce, or refusing to advocate a belief or cause as demanded by an external party. This refusal to comply with the presented demands results in the punishment or execution of the martyr by the oppressor. Originally applied only to those who suffered for their religious beliefs, the term has come to be used in connection with [[Martyr (politics)|people killed for a political cause]].

Most martyrs are considered holy or are respected by their followers, becoming symbols of exceptional leadership and heroism in the face of difficult circumstances. Martyrs play significant roles in religions. Similarly, martyrs have had notable effects in secular life, including such figures as [[Socrates]], among other political and cultural examples.

==Meaning==
In its original meaning, the word martyr, meaning ''[[witness]]'', was used in the secular sphere as well as in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Alison A. Trites, ''The New Testament Concept of Witness'', {{ISBN|0-521-60934-8}} and {{ISBN|978-0-521-60934-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of bearing witness was not intended to lead to the death of the witness, although it is known from ancient writers (e.g. [[Josephus]]) and from the New Testament that witnesses often died for their testimonies.

During the [[early Christianity|early Christian]] centuries, the term acquired the extended meaning of believers who are called to witness for their religious belief, and on account of this witness, endures suffering or death. The term, in this later sense, entered the [[English language]] as a [[loanword]]. The death of a martyr or the value attributed to it is called ''martyrdom''.

The early Christians who first began to use the term ''martyr'' in its new sense saw [[Jesus]] as the first and greatest martyr, on account of his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].&lt;ref&gt;Frances M. Young, ''The Use of Sacrificial Ideas in Greek Christian Writers from the New Testament to John Chrysostom'' (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2004), pp. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]] wrote of the early Christians: "They were so eager to imitate Christ ... they gladly yielded the title of martyr to Christ, the true Martyr and Firstborn from the dead." Eusebius, ''Church History'' 5.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholars believe that [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] was written during the period when the word for ''witness'' was gaining its meaning of ''martyr''. Revelation describes several Christian reh with the term ''martyr'' (Rev 17:6, 12:11, 2:10-13), and describes Jesus in the same way ("Jesus Christ, the faithful witness/martyr" in Rev 1:5, and see also Rev 3:14).&lt;/ref&gt; The early Christians appear to have seen Jesus as the archetypal martyr.&lt;ref name="D. Rusk, 2011 pp. 217-229"&gt;A. J. Wallace and R. D. Rusk, ''Moral Transformation: The Original Christian Paradigm of Salvation'' (New Zealand: Bridgehead, 2011), pp. 217-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''martyr'' is used in English to describe a wide variety of people. However, the following table presents a general outline of common features present in stereotypical martyrdoms.

{{main article|Martyrdom in the Bahá'í Faith}}
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], martyrs are those who sacrifice their lives serving humanity in the name of God.&lt;ref name="winters_conclusion"&gt;{{cite book | title =Dying for God: Martyrdom in the Shi'i and Babi Religions | first = Jonah | last = Winters | date = 1997-09-19 | accessdate = 2007-01-23 | chapter = Conclusion | url =  http://bahai-library.com/theses/dying/dying8.conclusion.html | publisher = M.A. Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, discouraged the literal meaning of sacrificing one's life. Instead, he explained that martyrdom is devoting oneself to service to humanity.&lt;ref name="winters_conclusion" /&gt;

{{main article|Martyrdom in Chinese culture}}
Martyrdom was extensively promoted by the [[Tongmenghui]] and the [[Kuomintang]] party in modern China. Revolutionaries who died fighting against the Qing dynasty in the [[Xinhai Revolution]] and throughout the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] period, furthering the cause of the revolution, were recognized as martyrs.{{Citation needed|date = December 2016}}

In [[Christianity]], a  martyr, in accordance with the meaning of the original Greek ''martys'' in the New Testament, is one who brings a testimony, usually written or verbal. In particular, the testimony is that of the Christian [[Gospel]], or more generally, the [[Word of God (Bible)|Word of God]]. A Christian witness is a biblical witness whether or not death follows.&lt;ref&gt;See Davis, R.[http://www.newmatthewbible.org/martyr.html "Martyr, or Witness?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511195005/http://www.newmatthewbible.org/martyr.html |date=2011-05-11 }}, New Matthew Bible Project&lt;/ref&gt; However, over time many Christian testimonies were rejected, and the witnesses put to death, and the word ''martyr'' developed its present sense. Where death ensues, the witnesses follow the example of [[Jesus]] in offering up their lives for truth.{{Citation needed|date = December 2016}}

[[File:Christian martyrs burned at the stake in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|left|Christian martyrs burned at the stake by [[Ranavalona I]] in [[Madagascar]]]]
The concept of Jesus as a martyr has recently received greater attention. Analyses of the Gospel [[Passion (Christianity)|passion narratives]] have led many scholars to conclude that they are martyrdom accounts in terms of genre and style.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. van Henten, "Jewish Martyrdom and Jesus' Death" in Jörg Frey &amp; Jens Schröter (eds.), ''Deutungen des Todes Jesu im Neuen Testament'' (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005) pp. 157 – 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Riddle, "The Martyr Motif in the Gospel According to Mark." The Journal of Religion, IV.4 (1924), pp. 397 – 410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Vines, M. E. Vines, "The 'Trial Scene' Chronotype in Mark and the Jewish Novel", in G. van Oyen and T. Shepherd (eds.), ''The Trial and Death of Jesus: Essays on the Passion Narrative in Mark'' (Leuven: Peeters, 2006), pp. 189 – 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have also concluded that [[Paul the Apostle]] understood Jesus' death as a martyrdom.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Finlan, ''The Background and Content of Paul's Cultic Atonement Metaphors'' (Atlanta, GA: SBL, 2004), pp. 193 – 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sam K. Williams, ''Death as Saving Event: The Background and Origin of a Concept'' (Missoula, MT: Scholars Press for Harvard Theological Review, 1975), pp. 38 – 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Seeley, ''The Noble Death'' (Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1990), pp. 83 – 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Stowers, ''A Rereading of Romans: Justice, Jews, and Gentiles'' (Ann Arbor: Yale University Press, 1997), p. 212f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis J. Williams, ''Maccabean Martyr Traditions in Paul's Theology of Atonement'' (Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Cummins, ''Paul and the Crucified Christ in Antioch'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In light of such conclusions, some have argued that the Christians of the first few centuries would have interpreted the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] as a martyrdom.&lt;ref name="D. Rusk, 2011 pp. 217-229"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Patterson, ''Beyond the Passion: Rethinking the Death and Life of Jesus'' (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of church history, from the time of the [[persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire]], it developed that a martyr was one who was killed for maintaining a [[religion|religious]] belief, ''knowing'' that this will almost certainly result in imminent death (though without intentionally seeking [[death]]). This definition of ''martyr'' is not specifically restricted to the Christian faith. Though Christianity recognizes certain Old Testament Jewish figures, like [[Abel]] and the [[Maccabees]], as holy, and the New Testament mentions the imprisonment and beheading of [[John the Baptist]], Jesus's possible cousin and his prophet and forerunner, the first Christian witness, after the establishment of the Christian faith (at Pentecost), to be killed for his testimony was [[Saint Stephen]] (whose name means "crown"), and those who suffer martyrdom are said to have been "crowned." From the time of [[Constantine I|Constantine]], Christianity was decriminalized, and then, under [[Theodosius I]], became the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion]], which greatly diminished persecution (although not for non-Nicene Christians). As some wondered how then they could most closely follow Christ there was a development of ''desert spirituality'', desert monks, self-mortification, [[ascetics]], ([[Paul the Hermit]], [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]]), following Christ by separation from the world. This was  a kind of ''white martyrdom'', dying to oneself  every day, as opposed to a &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;''red martyrdom''&lt;/span&gt;, the giving of one's life in a violent death.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'', ''Saints'', directed by Paul Tickell, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anneken van den Hove te Brussel levend begraven (Jan Luyken, 1597).PNG|thumb|350px| [[Jan Luyken]]'s drawing of the [[Anabaptist]] [[:nl:Anna Utenhoven]] being buried alive at [[Vilvoorde]] (present-day [[Belgium]]) in 1597. In the engraving, her head is still above the ground and the Catholic priest is exhorting her to recant her faith, while the executioner stands ready to completely cover her up upon her refusal. This engraving was part of a major Protestant outrage praising Utenhoven as a martyr.]]  
In Christianity, death in [[sectarian]] persecution can be viewed as martyrdom. For example, there were martyrs recognised on both sides of the schism between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England after 1534, with two hundred and eighty Christians martyred for their faith by public burning between 1553 and 1558 by the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I in England leading to the reversion to the Church of England under Queen Elizabeth I in 1559 and then three hundred Roman Catholics martyred by the Church authorities in England over the following hundred and fifty years in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{Citation needed|date = December 2016}}

Even more modern day accounts of martyrdom for Christ exist, depicted in books such as ''[[Jesus Freaks (book)|Jesus Freaks]]'' though the numbers are disputed.  There are claims that the numbers of Christians killed for their faith annually are greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander |first=Ruth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24864587 |title=Are there really 100,000 new Christian martyrs every year? |publisher=BBC News |date=2013-11-12 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

==Hinduism==
Despite the promotion of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) within [[Sanatana Dharma]], and there being no concept of martyrdom,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp (2006) The Power of the Dharma: An Introduction to Hinduism and Vedic Culture [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9upBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT138&amp;dq=martyrdom+and+hinduism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq5pLEluTLAhXh83IKHUKxDKkQ6AEISzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=martyrdom%20&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; there is the belief of righteous duty (''[[dharma]]''), where violence is used as a last resort to resolution after all other means have failed. Examples of this are found in the [[Mahabharata]]. Upon completion of their exile, the Pandavas were refused the return of their portion of the kingdom by their cousin Duruyodhana; and following which all means of peace talks by [[Krishna]], [[Vidura]] and [[Sanjaya]] failed. During the great war which commenced, even [[Arjuna]] was brought down with doubts, e.g., attachment, sorrow, fear. This is where Krishna instructs [[Arjuna]] how to carry out his duty as a righteous [[warrior]] and fight.

Martyrdom in [[Judaism]] is one of the main examples of ''[[Kiddush Hashem]]'', meaning "sanctification of God's name" through public dedication to Jewish practice. Religious martyrdom is considered one of the more significant contributions of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] to [[Western Civilization]]. [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]] recount numerous martyrdoms suffered by [[Jews]] resisting [[Hellenization|Hellenizing]] (adoption of Greek ideas or customs of a [[Hellenistic civilization]]) by their [[Seleucid]] overlords, being executed for such crimes as [[Shabbat|observing the Sabbath]], [[Brit milah|circumcising their boys]] or [[Kashrut|refusing to eat pork or meat sacrificed to foreign gods]]. According to [[W. H. C. Frend]], "Judaism was itself a religion of martyrdom" and it was this "Jewish psychology of martyrdom" that inspired Christian martyrdom.

Martyrdom (called ''shahadat'' in Punjabi) is a fundamental concept in [[Sikhism]] and represents an important institution of the faith. The Sikh Gurus and the Sikhs that followed them are some of the greatest examples of martyrs who fought &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Concept of Martyrdom and Sikhism|url=http://www.globalsikhstudies.net/articles/The%20Concept%20of%20Martyrdom%20and%20Sikhism-Dr%20Hakam%20Singh.pdf|website=globalsikhstudies.net|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; against Mughal tyranny and oppression, upholding the fundamentals of Sikhism, where their lives were taken during non-violent protesting or in battles. Sikhism believes in ''Ibaadat se Shahadat'' (from love to martyrdom). Some famous Sikh martyrs include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandeep Singh Bajwa |url=http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/martyrs/nojava.html |title=Biographies of Great Sikh Martyrs |publisher=Sikh-history.com |date=2000-02-11 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guru Arjan]], the fifth leader of Sikhism. Guru ji was brutally tortured for almost 5 days before he attained shaheedi, or martyrdom.

==Notable martyrs==

* 399 BCE &amp;ndash; [[Socrates]], much of what is known about the life of Socrates has been drawn from the writings of Plato, which more often than not focus on the events surrounding the death of Socrates. Plato's writings discuss how the state charges Socrates with corrupting the youth. Socrates reached martyrdom when he chose death over escape, as in so doing he chose to die for what he believed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeve|first1=C.D.C.|title=A Plato Reader: Eight Essential Dialogues|date=2012|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company Inc.|location=Indianapolis|isbn=978-1-60384-811-4|pages=47–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is significant in the extent to which it affected his followers and the legacy of his ideas.

==Revolutionary martyr==
The term "revolutionary martyr" usually relates to those dying in [[revolution]]ary struggle.&lt;ref&gt;''The French Revolution'' Page 95 Linda Frey, Marsha Frey - 2004 "He was immortalized by the painter David in the famous painting of the death scene that became the icon of the revolution and an emblem of revolutionary propaganda. The revolutionary martyr was commemorated not only in painting and in ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revolutionary Mexico: The Coming and Process of the Mexican ... - Page 250 John Mason Hart - 1987 "They popularized Ricardo Flores Magon as a revolutionary martyr who was harassed by the American and Mexican ..."&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the concept was developed in particular in the culture and propaganda of communist or socialist revolutions, although it was and is also used in relation to nationalist revolutions.

* In the [[culture of North Korea]], martyrdom is a consistent theme in the ongoing revolutionary struggle, as depicted in literary works such as ''[[Sea of Blood]]''. There is also a [[Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery]] in the country.
* In [[Vietnam]], those who died in [[Indochina Wars|the independence struggle]] are often honoured as martyrs, or ''liệt sĩ'' in Vietnamese. [[Nguyễn Thái Học]] and schoolgirl [[Võ Thị Sáu]] are two examples.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam At War Mark Philip Bradley - 2009 "As the concept of 'sacrifice' (hi sinh) came to embody the state's narrative of sacred war (chien tranh than thanh), the ultimate sacrifice was considered to be death in battle as a 'revolutionary martyr' (liet si)."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[India]], the term "revolutionary martyr" is often used when referring to the world history of socialist struggle. [[Guru Radha Kishan]] was a notable Indian independence activist and communist politician known to have used this phrasing.

'''Merena''' was a military officer of the [[Sassanid Empire]] during the reign of [[Shapur II]] in the 4th century. He was a cavalry commander in the [[Sassanid army]] in the course of the [[Roman-Persian Wars]] soon after the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Battle of Ctesiphon]] in 363, which took place outside the Sassanid capital [[Ctesiphon]] in what is now [[Iraq]]. As cavalry commander, he also appeared in the [[Battle of Maranga]]&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', Book 25, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/25*.html#1.1 1.10]&lt;/ref&gt;.

He was among those killed at the subsequent [[Battle of Samarra]], a few hours before the death of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', Book 25, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/25*.html#1.1 3.13]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''murder of Hilda Feste''' was a [[criminal case]] in [[Norway]], involving the [[rape]] and [[murder]] of a 98-year-old victim, '''Hilda Feste''' (20 February 1913 – 1 January 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/11/09/magasinet/hilda_feste/os-drapet/innenriks/drap/24282553/ |title=Hilda Feste var snart 99 år da hun åpnet døra for en ukjent mann 1. nyttårsdag - magasinet |publisher=Dagbladet.no |date=1913-02-20 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; perpetrated by then 19-year-old '''Christian Haugland''' (born 1993).

'''Ruth Pelke''' was a 78-year-old American from [[Gary, Indiana]], who was murdered by '''Paula R. Cooper'''&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=If9GiGRV7a8C&amp;pg=PA214&lt;/ref&gt; (August 25, 1969 – May 26, 2015), aged 15, on May 14, 1985. Cooper stabbed Pelke 33 times with a butcher knife before stealing ten dollars and her car. A year later, Cooper was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] on July 11, 1986.

Cooper's age and sentence attracted an international uproar, especially in Europe, including a condemnation from [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]]. In 1989, her sentence was commuted to 60 years in prison.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|date=1989-07-13|title=Woman's Execution for Murder at 15 Is Barred}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 2013, Cooper was released from [[Rockville Correctional Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ind. woman sentenced to death at 16 to leave prison|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/06/16/indiana-woman-sentenced-to-death-at-age-16-will-leave-prison-after-24-years/2427531/?sf14015964=1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=17 June 2013|first=Tim|last=Evans|date=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died on May 26, 2015, following an apparent suicide.

==Background==
According to police, Cooper skipped school with three friends (Denise Thomas, aged 14; Karen Corder, aged 16; and April Beverly, aged 15),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-11-08/news/8503170143_1_murder-trial-stabbing-paula-cooper |title=Girl Testifies She Had No Role In Murder |first=John |last=O'Brien |date=November 8, 1985 |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=May 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; drank [[alcohol]], and smoked [[marijuana]] before visiting Pelke, a neighbor, ostensibly to ask about Bible lessons. One of the girls struck Pelke with a vase, and cut her arms and legs. Cooper stabbed Pelke 33 times in the chest and stomach with a foot-long (30&amp;nbsp;cm) [[butcher knife]]. Cooper and her friends then searched the house for jewelry, and stole ten dollars and the keys to Pelke's 1976 [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]].&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianahistory.org/library/manuscripts/collection_guides/m0565.html|title=Paula Cooper Case Records|accessdate=2007-05-26|publisher=Indiana Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt1986a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death Sentence At 16 Rekindles Debate On Justice For Juveniles|publisher=New York Times|date=1986-11-02|page=A26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2342772/Paula-Cooper-Murderer-sentenced-death-row-16-killing-Ruth-Pelke-78-released-prison.html Paula Cooper sentenced to Death Row at 16 released from prison], dailymail.co.uk; accessed May 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prosecutor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/row/cooperp.htm|title=Prosecution page|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cooper's lawyers described her as a victim of sexual abuse who had attended ten different schools by the time of the murder. She had a prior [[criminal record|record]] as a [[runaway youth|runaway]] and for [[burglary]].&lt;ref name="nyt1986"/&gt; However, there was little question of her guilt in the case. She was considered to be the ringleader of the group of girls, aged 14 to 16, who were all given sentences of 25 to 60 years for their roles in the crime. According to authorities, Cooper attacked guards in the juvenile center after her arrest and had to be moved to the County Jail. There, it was reported that she bragged about her crime and had said she would do it again.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Sentencing and fallout==
Cooper's [[public defender]] advised her to [[plea]]d guilty. At sentencing, [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake County]] [[District attorney|prosecutor]] James McNew portrayed Cooper as a social misfit with no hope of [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] and asked for the death penalty. The defense presented evidence that Cooper was a chronic runaway who had been physically abused and forced to watch the rape of her mother and violent assaults by her father. The defense stated that Cooper's mother had once attempted to kill her. Cooper was found guilty, and Judge James Kimbrough imposed the death penalty.&lt;ref name="nyt1986"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death Sentence At 16 Debate On Justice For Juveniles|publisher=New York Times|date=1986-11-02|page=A26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper was sent to [[Death Row]] at [[Indiana Women's Prison]] in [[Indianapolis]]. Her case was taken up by attorney Monica Foster, who organized a campaign which presented an appeal signed by two million people to the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. Pope [[John Paul II]] made a personal appeal to [[Governor of Indiana|Indiana Governor]] [[Robert D. Orr|Robert Orr]] in September 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|title=Pope Urges Indiana Not to Execute Woman|date=1987-09-27|page=13A}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate appeal to the [[United Nations]] received one million signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/collection-guides/paula-cooper-case-records-1986-1989.pdf|title=Historical Background" in "Paula Cooper Case Records, 1986-1989, Collection Guide|accessdate=2012-11-05|publisher=Indiana Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper's case was profiled on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and various European television programs. She was front-page news in her hometown of Gary, including a scandal where it was found that several prison guards had sex with her in her cell, and pregnancy tests were performed, which came back negative.&lt;ref name="nyt1986"/&gt; Judge Kimbrough died, and the [[Appellate review|appeals process]] was slowed as a replacement was chosen. In 1987, the [[Indiana General Assembly|Indiana legislature]] passed a bill raising the minimum age for a defendant in a death penalty case from 10 years old to 16 years old. Although the change was a reaction to Cooper's case, the legislature made it clear that the change did not affect Cooper's death sentence. In 1988, a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Thompson v. Oklahoma]],'' barred the death penalty for defendants under the age of 16 at the time of the crime. The [[Indiana Supreme Court]] considered both of these developments, and the court heard arguments and reduced Cooper's sentence to life imprisonment on July 3, 1989.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; 

A ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial that month called the court's decision "brave" and said that the law on which her death sentence was based was "medieval" as it allowed the execution of children as young as 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|title=Topics of The Times; A Murderous Child|date=1989-07-17|page=16A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Cooper earned a [[General Educational Development|GED]] and took college [[correspondence course]]s while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=magazine.article&amp;issue=soj9505&amp;article=950526|title=Leaven of Forgiveness|author=Penn, Mary Sue|publisher=Sojourner's Magazine|date=May 1995|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she was sentenced to 60 years, Indiana law dictates that offenders earn one day off from their sentence for each day served with good behavior.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Pelke's grandson, Bill Pelke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.journeyofhope.org/who-we-are/murder-victim-family/bill-pelke|title=Journey of Hope: Bill Pelke …From Violence to Healing|date=June 3, 2014|work=journeyofhope.org|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially favored the death penalty for Cooper but later joined the movement opposing it in 1987. He wrote of having forgiven Cooper in a 2003 book, ''Journey of Hope''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1413419917/|title=Amazon.com description|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving 26 years, three weeks, and three days, Cooper was released on 17 June 2013. She was 43 at the time of her release. Just under two years later, on 26 May 2015, she was found dead of an apparent suicide.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news|title=Paula Cooper dead: Police say the one-time youngest woman on death row was found dead|url=http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/video-police-say-paula-cooper-found-dead|agency=RTV 6|date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4369">The ''' Nicholson–Bailey model''' was developed in the 1930s to describe the [[population dynamics]] of a coupled host-[[parasitoid]] system.{{ref|reference_name_A|a}} It is named after [[Alexander John Nicholson]] and [[Victor Albert Bailey]]. Host-parasite and [[Predator-prey|prey-predator]] systems can also be represented with the Nicholson-Bailey model. The model is closely related to the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra model]], which describes the dynamics of antagonistic populations (preys and predators) using [[differential equation]]s.

The model uses (discrete time) [[difference equation]]s to describe the [[population growth]] of host-parasite populations. The model assumes that parasitoids search for hosts at random, and that both parasitoids and hosts are assumed to be distributed in a non-contiguous ("clumped") fashion in the environment. In its original form, the model does not allow for stable coexistence. Subsequent refinements of the model, notably adding density dependence on several terms, allowed this coexistence  to happen.

== Equations ==
===Model derivation===
The model is defined in discrete time. It is usually expressed as:&lt;ref name="logan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Logan |first=J. David |last2=Wolesensky |first2=Willian R. |title=Mathematical Methods in Biology |series=Pure and Applied Mathematics: a Wiley-interscience Series of Texts, Monographs, and Tracts |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2009 |page=214 |isbn=978-0-470-52587-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6GGyquH8kLcC&amp;pg=PA214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl} H_{t+1} &amp; = &amp; k H_t e^{-a P_t} \\ P_{t+1} &amp; = &amp; c H_t \left ( 1-e^{-aP_t} \right ) \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''H'' the population size of the host, ''P'' the population size of the parasitoid, ''k'' the reproductive rate of the host, ''a'' the searching efficiency of the parasitoid, and ''c'' the average number of viable eggs that a parasitoid lays on a single host.

This model can be explained based on probability.&lt;ref name="logan"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;e^{-a P_t} &lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the host will survive &lt;math&gt; P_t &lt;/math&gt; predators; whereas &lt;math&gt; 1 - e^{-a P_t} &lt;/math&gt; is that they will not, bearing in mind the parasitoid eventually will hatch into larva and escape. 

Density dependence can be added to the model, by assuming that the growth rate of the host decreases at high abundances. The equation for the parasitoid is unchanged, and the equation for the host is modified: 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl} H_{t+1} &amp; = &amp; H_t e^{r(1-H_t/K)}e^{-a P_t} \\ P_{t+1} &amp; = &amp; c H_t \left ( 1-e^{-aP_t} \right ) \end{array}&lt;/math&gt; 

The host rate of increase ''k'' is replaced by ''r'', which decreases when the host population density reaches ''K''. 

===Model analysis===
Simulating this system usually results in oscillations moving away from an unstable equilibrium.

Depending on the parameter values, this system admits one unstable fixed point, at

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl} H^\star &amp; = &amp; \frac{k\, \text{ln}(k)}{(k-1)\, ac} \\ P^\star &amp; = &amp; \frac{\text{ln}(k)}{a}\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

This point has positive abundances of ''P'' and ''H'' only when ''k'' is greater than one.

'''nowthatsfuckedup.com''' was a controversial website depicting corpses in kill zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. It existed from February 2004 until April 2006, when it was shut down under Florida [[obscenity law]]s.

Often known by its initials NTFU, it had an initial focus on user-contributed amateur pornography until it adopted a novel business model whereby [[United States armed forces|U.S. military personnel]], unable to use their [[credit card]]s due to the point-of-sale being located in high-risk regions and wary of repercussions from their superiors, could gain access to the site's content in exchange for proof of military employment for free memberships.  The first pictures submitted were soldiers posing with tanks and other harmless situations.  As word spread of the free admittance, so-called [[trophy]] photos, or graphic depictions of corpses and other disturbing imagery direct from the [[kill zone]]s in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] began to be submitted.  The site took on an idea of "bodies-for-porn."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/8878187/casualty_of_porn Casualty of Porn], rollingstone.com&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving national publicity, proprietor Christopher Wilson was arrested on 301 total charges, 300 misdemeanors and one felony, under Florida obscenity laws.  Wilson hired the high-profile First Amendment law firm of Weston, Garrou,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendment.com/ Firstamendment.com]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; DeWitt&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clydedewitt.com Clydewitt.com]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as received legal assistance from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and others; they eventually worked out a [[plea bargain]] with prosecutors. Under the deal, Wilson agreed to the closure of his business and not to work on any adult websites for five years, and pleaded guilty to five [[misdemeanor]] charges. The website operated for 90 more days, accepting logins from existing subscribers, before being taken over by the [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]] Sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060114/NEWS/601140413 Wilson Will Avoid Jail In Plea Deal], Theledger.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Parity was formed in 1986 as the "Campaign for Equal State Pension Ages" (CESPA) &lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2003998.stm BBC NEWS | Business | Threat to National Insurance increase&lt;!-- Both generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal aim was to obtain for men the same [state pension] age as enjoyed by women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The organisation changed its name to "Parity" in 1997 to reflect growing concern regarding increased unequal treatment of men and women in other areas by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hertsdirect.org/comdirectory/comvol/trade2y/tdfina3y/pensions4/?view=Printlist hertsdirect.org Pensions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

CESPA's inaugural meeting was held on 29 August 1986 in Committee Room 1 of Manchester Town Hall. The ten founder members were G.W. Alderton, D.Higgins, D.J.D Yarwood, J.H Bennett, E.L Anderson, J.Greenwood, M.D Davidson, J.Graham, D.G Lindsay, and J. Bradfield.
The original CESPA constitution was agreed. The meeting appointed David Lindsay as Chairman, Geoff Alderton as Vice-Chairman, David Yarwood as Hon Secretary and John Bennett as Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parity-uk.org/history_of_cespa1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Parity was denied charitable status for a number of years because it was seeking changes in the law to redress statutory [[sex discrimination]], and thus was deemed to be political.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-912855991.html Parity &amp; Equal rights for men - Mankind | HighBeam Research - FREE trial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It finally gained [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|charitable status]] in 2005 following a change to the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Organisation==
The organisation is run entirely by volunteers and receives no public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/organisation.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It had an income of £1,016 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/PrintReport.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1107795&amp;ReportType=BW Charity-commission.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its constitution it states its objectives are "to promote and protect the equal rights of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil, political, economic social and cultural rights under the law" and "to institute proceedings in the UK or appropriate European Courts for the purpose of establishing or protecting any such equal rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/index.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
Parity has had some notable successes over the years, particularly in addressing statutory sex discrimination. Their campaigns have stopped government [[sex discrimination]] which, in the case of winter fuel payments, had denied an estimated £20 million per year to males between the ages of 60-65.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/567208.stm BBC News | UK | Winter fuel payments 'sexist'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parity claims successes in four main areas: [[Prescription (medical)|prescription]] charges, winter fuel payments, [[Bus_pass#UK|bus travel concessions]] and, in association with others, [[widower]]'s benefits:

===Prescription charges===
Parity's first major success began in 1993 under its original name, when CESPA member Cyril Richardson, an [[asthmatic]], took the government to court over sex discrimination in entitlement for free [[Prescription drug|prescriptions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=16471 Equal rights for men at the chemist's - Article - TES Connect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-080.pdf The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Bill [HL&amp;#93; Bill 38 of 2001-02&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618214600/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-080.pdf |date=18 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in 1995 the European Court of Justice ruled that it was unlawful to charge men aged 60–65 for prescriptions when they were free to women. As a result, men now receive benefits in the order of an estimated £30 million per annum. Additionally, £10 million in charges was refunded to those who had wrongly paid for prescriptions in the previous 3 months before the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ay06C8wAdAAC&amp;pg=PA705&amp;lpg=PA705&amp;dq=1995+nhs+prescription+charges+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J7Ec4-rWx0&amp;sig=K1uuQ8Ttlf3tWYz4EuM37bl9JHg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DoTiSf6MM8WhjAfT7bnUDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 The textbook of pharmaceutical medicine - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/311/7013/1118/a Men can have free prescriptions at 60 - 311 (7013): 1118 - bmj.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Winter fuel payments===
In 1998 Parity member John Taylor went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to contest the fact that the government was denying [[winter fuel payment]]s to men aged 60–65 that women were able to receive. It was argued that this was a breach of European laws on equality in social security,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/189612.stm BBC News | UK | Winter fuel case goes to Europe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and that such discrimination was blatant and unjustifiable.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/winter-fuel-cash-cheats-men-says-court-chief-1121423.html Winter fuel cash cheats men, says court chief - News - The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was referred to the [[European Court of Justice]] who ruled in Mr Taylor's favour in December 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The ruling meant up to £26 million per annum in benefits being given to men that otherwise would have been denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/455023.stm BBC News | UK Politics | Fuel payments ruling due&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus travel concessions===
In 2000 Parity took the Government to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] over the fact that it denied [[free travel pass|free bus travel]] to men aged 60–65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thisisyork.co.uk/2000/4/28/317100.html Postman leads fight to change bus pass policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070730222225/http://archive.thisisyork.co.uk/2000/4/28/317100.html |date=30 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Parity's previous successes, the government had refused to end discrimination in this area.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ministers-fight-free-bus-pass-for-men-at-60-634573.html Ministers fight free bus pass for men at 60 - UK Politics, UK - The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in June 2001 it became clear that Parity would win the case if it went to court and the government relented, with [[John Prescott]] announcing men would receive free [[bus pass]]es from age 60. Controversially, Prescott hailed the move as "another example of the Government providing extra help for pensioners" whereas it had effectively been forced into the move by the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1323123/Men-over-60-to-be-eligible-for-free-bus-passes.html Men over 60 to be eligible for free bus passes - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Bill finally passed in 2003 resulting in males receiving the £50 million per annum in benefits that the state had denied them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2880989.stm BBC NEWS | Business | End to 'sexist' bus fares&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Widowers benefits===
Parity campaigned to end sexism in the payment of widows benefits and bereavement tax allowances. These were previously only paid to women and not men. The campaign achieved success in 2001 as a result the benefits are now available to both genders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2002647.stm BBC NEWS | Business | Widowers besiege Europe with benefit claims&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence statistics===
In 2008 Parity campaigned to stop the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] making false statements that the "overwhelming" majority of domestic violence victims were women, whereas in fact about one in three victims is male. With the aid of the [[UK Statistics Authority]] the organisation succeeded and the incorrect claims were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/new-component.pdf Statisticsauthority.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/letter-from-sir-roger-jowell-to-keir-starmer-qc-30-march-2009.pdf Statisticsauthority.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation also forced [[Gillian Morgan]] of the [[Welsh Assembly]] to stop making the same claims in the "Strategic Action Plan to Address Violence to Women".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/Copy_of_letter-from-sir-michael-scholar-to-dame-gillian-morgan-021009.pdf Statisticsauthority.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current campaigns==
Parity's main current campaign is to equalise the state [[pension]] ages for men and women in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/successes.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently this is now due to take place in 2018.

Other objectives include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/objectives.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Raaz Pichhle Janm Ka''''' ({{lang-hi|राज़ पिछले जनम का}}, "Past Life Secrets") is an Indian [[reality television]] series based on the technique of [[past life regression]]. The [[NDTV Imagine]] show is hosted by actor [[Ravi Kishan]], while the past life regression sessions are conducted by Mumbai-based psychologist Trupti Jayin.&lt;ref name=to&gt;{{cite web |title=Want to know your past? |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-04/tv/28067592_1_past-life-past-lives-raaz-pichhle-janam-ka |date=4 December 2009 |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raaz Pichley Janam Ka to peep into celebs' past |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/72285/Cinema/Raaz+Pichley+Janam+Ka+to+peep+into+celebs%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2+past.html |date=November 25, 2009 |publisher=[[India Today]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Want to know about past life?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/smallscreen/Want-to-know-about-past-life/Article1-478786.aspx |date= November 21, 2009|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season started on December 7, 2009, was planned for a 20-episode run from Monday to Friday, 9.30 pm, by Ideas Box Entertainment and Urban Brew Studios, got an extension of 20 episodes, and ended on January 15, 2010, while Second season started on October 23, 2010, with actor, [[Chunky Pandey]] as guest.&lt;ref name=hto/&gt;

Participants include a mixture of invited celebrities and ordinary people selected through a phone-in process. Celebrity participants have included [[Shekhar Suman]], [[Monica Bedi]], [[Celina Jaitley]], [[Payal Rohatgi]] and [[Manvendra Singh Gohil]].

==Concept==
The show opens with the guest explaining a particular problem, usually a fear he or she is facing and wishes to find a solution or insight into. Thereafter they are taken through an extended past life regression session, edited for television.

The procedure as explained by show's therapist, Dr. Tripti Jayin, the patient are first taken into in a state of progressive relaxation, followed by an alpha-theta meditation through the visualisation of light and then supposedly 'taken back' into the past  to know the reason for things that trouble them in this birth. Some of the events are dramatized as the participant narrates certain incidents, and in the end talks about the experience.&lt;ref name=to/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1966 Air India crash victim reborn desi kahani |url=http://www.mydesibaba.com |date=6 December 2010 |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About past-life regression==

It uses conscious meditative technique to recover memories of our past lives. It helps address fears, phobias and even physical ailments in our present day lives by finding their roots in our previous lives.

==Recalled information==
Many of the participants have supposedly recalled information from the past.  The best example is that of Swati '''Singh''' (Episode-1 participant) who correctly recalled information about the 1966 Air India flight 101 crash incident (24 January 1966), in which she claimed that she was an Indian sailor named '''Singh''', and in this flight the eminent Indian [[physicist]] Dr. [[Homi J. Bhabha]] had also died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desiikahani.blogspot.com/2017/04/didi-ki-choot-pharri-aur-gand-ma-pura.html |title=News |publisher=Samay Live |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of medical-community==
A number of clinical psychiatrists have said that such ‘memories’ of a past life may only be the projected imagination of an individual. However, some others believe that the concept needs further research. “I do not practice it but I do not agree that past-life regression should be dismissed altogether. I believe that this concept needs to be thoroughly researched,” says Dr Divay Mangla, a psychiatrist practising in Yamuna Nagar, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/raaz-pichhle...-creates-stir-but-psychiatrists-stay-away-it-has-no-scientific-basis/569118/ |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510193437/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/raaz-pichhle...-creates-stir-but-psychiatrists-stay-away-it-has-no-scientific-basis/569118/ |archivedate=May 10, 2012 |title=Raaz Pichhle... creates stir but psychiatrists stay away: ‘It has no scientific basis’
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Some people and organizations have raised doubts over the credibility and reality of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://informationmadness.com/cms/entertainment/television/1975-reasons-to-believe-that-raaz-pichle-janam-ka-is-fake.html |title=Reasons To Believe That Raaz Pichle Janam Ka Is Fake |website=Informationmadness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the past-life regression process is also not shown on television, so it can't be confirmed whether the process is real or not. No explanation has been given by [[NDTV Imagine]] in this regard.

===Statutory notice===
Bharat Jan Vigyan Jathan, an independent Indian organisation, has got issued a statutory notice by the Punjab and Haryana High Court to [[NDTV Imagine]] TV Channel (a copy of which was also issued to the Information and Broadcasting Ministry of India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HC pulls up I&amp;B over NDTV Imagine’s reality show

==Season 1==

===Episodes===
The first series of Raaz Pichhle Janam Ka began on 7 December 2009 and ended on 15 January 2010. Episodes were aired on NDTV Imagine nightly from Monday to Friday at 9:30pm. It was originally planned to have 20 episodes but this was extended to 40. The season finale revisited the participants post their experience on the show and explored the impact the show had made on their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/RaazPichhleJanamKa ]{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radioactivity''' is generally used in life sciences for highly sensitive and direct measurements of biological phenomena, and for visualizing the location of [[biomolecule]]s [[radiolabelled]] with a [[radioisotope]].

All atoms exist as stable or unstable [[isotope]]s and the latter decay at a given [[half-life]] ranging from attoseconds to billions of years; radioisotopes useful to biological and experimental systems have half-lives ranging from minutes to months.  In the case of the hydrogen isotope [[tritium]] (half-life = 12.3 years) and [[carbon-14]] (half-life = 5,730 years), these isotopes derive their importance from all organic life containing hydrogen and carbon and therefore can be used to study countless living processes, reactions, and phenomena.  Most short lived isotopes are produced in [[cyclotron]]s, linear [[particle accelerator]]s, or [[nuclear reactor]]s and their relatively short half-lives give them high maximum theoretical specific activities which is useful for detection in biological systems.

[[File:Y-90 tacatuzumab tetraxetan structure.svg|thumb|DOTA linked to the monoclonal antibody [[tacatuzumab]] and chelating [[yttrium-90]] ]]
[[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|Whole-body PET scan using &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG showing intestinal tumors and non-specific accumulation in bladder]]  
[[Isotopic labeling|Radiolabeling]] is a technique used to track the passage of a molecule that incorporates a radioisotope through a reaction, metabolic pathway, cell, tissue, organism, or biological system. The reactant is 'labeled' by replacing specific atoms by their isotope.  Replacing an atom with its own radioisotope is an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] label that does not alter the structure of the molecule.  Alternatively, molecules can be radiolabeled by chemical reactions that introduce an atom, [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]], or [[functional group]] that contains a [[radionuclide]].  For example, radio-iodination of peptides and proteins with [[Isotopes of iodine#Radioiodines I-123.2C I-124.2C I-125.2C and I-131 in medicine and biology|biologically useful iodine isotopes]] is easily done by an oxidation reaction that replaces the hydroxyl group with iodine on [[tyrosine]] and [[histadine]] residues.  Another example is to use chelators such [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]] that can be chemically coupled to a protein; the chelator in turn traps radiometals thus radiolabeling the protein.  This has been used for introducing Yttrium-90 onto a monoclonal antibody for therapeutic purposes and for introducing Gallium-68 onto the peptide [[Octreotide]] for diagnostic imaging by [[Positron emission tomography|PET imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Breeman | first1 = W. A. P. | last2 = De Blois | first2 = E. | last3 = Sze Chan | first3 = H. | last4 = Konijnenberg | first4 = M. | last5 = Kwekkeboom | first5 = D. J. | last6 = Krenning | first6 = E.

Radiolabeling is not necessary for some applications.  For some purposes,  soluble ionic salts can be used directly without further modification (e.g., [[gallium-67]], [[gallium-68]], and [[radioiodine]] isotopes).  These uses rely on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the organism or biological system.

[[Molecular imaging]] is the biomedical field that employs radiotracers to visualize and quantify biological processes using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) imaging.  Again, a key feature of using radioactivity in life science applications is that it is a quantitative technique, so PET/SPECT not only reveals where a radiolableled molecule is but how much is there.

[[Radiobiology]] (also known as radiation biology) is a field of clinical and basic medical sciences that involves the study of the action of radioactivity on biological systems.  The controlled action of deleterious radioactivity on living systems is the basis of [[radiation therapy]].

==Examples of biologically useful radionuclei==
===Hydrogen===
[[Tritium]] (Hydrogen-3) is a very low [[Beta decay|beta]] energy emitter that can be used to label [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, drugs and almost any organic biomolecule. The maximum theoretical specific activity of tritium is 28.8 [[Curie|Ci]]/[[Mole (unit)|mmol]] (1.066 PBq/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voges|first1=Rolf|last2=Heys|first2=J. Richard|last3=Moenius|first3=Thomas|title=Preparation of compounds labeled with tritium and carbon-14|date=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-0-470-51607-2|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VgcIEhrwCIC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is often more than one tritium atom per molecule: for example, tritiated [[Uridine triphosphate|UTP]] is sold by most suppliers with carbons 5 and 6 each bonded to a tritium atom.

For tritium detection, liquid [[scintillation counter]]s have been classically employed, in which the energy of a tritium decay is transferred to a [[Scintillator|scintillant]] molecule in solution which in turn gives off photons whose intensity and spectrum can be measured by a [[photomultiplier]] array.  The efficiency of this process is 4–50%, depending on the scintillation cocktail used. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakonić|first1=I|last2=Nikolov|first2=J|display-authors=etal|title=Study on quench effects in liquid scintillation counting during tritium measurements|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|date=2014|volume=302|issue=1|pages=253–259|doi=10.1007/s10967-014-3191-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scintillation Cocktails &amp; Consumables - For every liquid scintillation counting application|url=https://www.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/BRO_ScintillationCocktailsAndConsumables.pdf|website=PerkinElmer|accessdate=11 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327093930/https://www.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/BRO_ScintillationCocktailsAndConsumables.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The measurements are typically expressed in [[counts per minute]] (CPM) or disintegrations per minute (DPM).  Alternatively, a solid-state, tritium-specific [[Photostimulated luminescence|phosphor screen]] can be used together with a phosphorimager to measure and simultaneously image the radiotracer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Storage Phosphor Screen BAS-IP|url=https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related%20Content/Files/1351177681492/litdoc29026296_20161015084341.pdf|website=GE Life Sciences|accessdate=11 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911190807/https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related%20Content/Files/1351177681492/litdoc29026296_20161015084341.pdf|archivedate=11 September 2017|date=2012|quote=Data file 29-0262-96 AA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements/images are digital in nature and can be expressed in intensity or densitometry units within a [[region of interest]] (ROI).

===Carbon===
[[Carbon-14]] has a long half-life of 5,730±40 years. Its maximum specific activity is 0.0624 Ci/mmol (2.31 TBq/mol). It is used in applications such as [[radiometric dating]] or drug tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.aptochem.com/t-radiolabeled-test-articles.aspx | title=Radiolabeled Test Articles | accessdate= | publisher=AptoChem }}&lt;/ref&gt;  C-14 labeling is common in drug development to do [[ADME]] (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) studies in animal models and in human toxicology and clinical trials.  Since tritium exchange may occur in some radiolabeled compounds, this does not happen with C-14 and may thus be preferred.

===Sodium===
[[Sodium-22]] and [[chlorine-36]] are commonly used to study [[ion transporter]]s. However, sodium-22 is hard to screen off and chlorine-36, with a half-life of 300,000 years, has low activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biochemic methods. Sample for medicine Students''. 2nd ed 2008, by Birgitte Lüttge. Aarhus University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sulfur===
[[Sulfur-35]] is used to label proteins and nucleic acids. [[Cysteine]] is an [[amino acid]] containing a [[thiol group]] which can be labeled by S-35. For [[nucleotide]]s that do not contain a sulfur group, the oxygen on one of the phosphate groups can be substituted with a sulfur. This [[thiophosphate]] acts the same as a normal phosphate group, although there is a slight bias against it by most [[polymerase]]s. The maximum theoretical specific activity is 1,494 Ci/mmol (55.28 PBq/mol).

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus-33]] is used to label nucleotides. It is less energetic than P-32 and does not require protection with plexi glass. A disadvantage is its higher cost compared to P-32, as most of the bombarded P-31 will have acquired only one [[neutron]], while only some will have acquired two or more. Its maximum specific activity is 5,118 Ci/mmol (189.4 PBq/mol).

[[Phosphorus-32]] is widely used for labeling nucleic acids and phosphoproteins. It has the highest emission energy (1.7 MeV) of all common research radioisotopes. This is a major advantage in experiments for which sensitivity is a primary consideration, such as titrations of very strong interactions (i.e., very low dissociation constant), footprinting experiments, and detection of low-abundance phosphorylated species. 32P is also relatively inexpensive. Because of its high energy, however, its safe use requires a number of [[engineering controls]] (e.g., [[acrylic glass]]) and [[administrative controls]].  The half-life of 32P is 14.2 days, and its maximum specific activity is 9131 Ci/mmol.

===Iodine===
[[Iodine-125]] is commonly used for labeling proteins, usually at tyrosine residues. Unbound iodine is volatile and must be handled in a fume hood.  Its maximum specific activity is 2,176 Ci/mmol (80.51 PBq/mol).

A good example of the difference in energy of the various radionuclei is the detection window ranges used to detect them, which are generally proportional to the energy of the emission, but vary from machine to machine: in a Perkin elmer TriLux Beta scintillation counter &lt;!-- Googled to see where the hell did the values come from)--&gt;, the H-3 energy range window is between channel 5–360; C-14, S-35 and P-33 are in the window of 361–660; and P-32 is in the window of 661–1024.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Detection==
[[File:Autoradiography_of_a_brain_slice_from_an_embryonal_rat_-_PMID19190758_PLoS_0004371.png|thumb|Autoradiograph of a coronal brain tissue slice, with a radiolabeled GAD67 probe.  Most intense signal is seen in subventricular zone.]]
[[File:Southern-Blot-Autoradiogramm.jpg|thumb|Autoradiograph of Southern blot membrane]]

===Quantitative===
In [[liquid scintillation counting]], a small aliquot, filter or swab is added to scintillation fluid and the plate or vial is placed in a [[scintillation counter]] to measure the radioactive emissions.  Manufacturers have incorporated solid scintillants into multi-well plates to eliminate the need for scintillation fluid and make this into a high-throughput technique.

A [[gamma counter]] is similar in format to scintillation counting but it detects gamma emissions directly and does not require a scintillant.

A [[Geiger counter]] is a quick and rough approximation of activity. Lower energy emitters such as tritium can not be detected.

===Qualitative AND Quantitative===
[[Autoradiography]]: A tissue section affixed to a microscope slide or a membrane such as a [[Northern blot]] or a hybridized [[slot blot]] can be placed against x-ray film or phosphor screens to acquire a photographic or digital image.  The density of exposure, if calibrated, can supply exacting quantitative information.

[[Phosphor storage screen]]: The slide or membrane is placed against a phosphor screen which is then scanned in a [[phosphorimager]]. This is many times faster than film/emulsion techniques and outputs data in a digital form, thus it has largely replaced film/emulsion techniques.

===Microscopy===
[[Electron microscopy]]: The sample is not exposed to a beam of electrons but detectors picks up the expelled electrons from the radionuclei.

Micro-autoradiography: A tissue section, typically cryosectioned, is placed against a phosphor screen as above.

Quantitative Whole Body Autoradiography (QWBA):  Larger than micro-autoradiography, whole animals, typically rodents, can be analyzed for biodistribution studies.

==Scientific methods==
{{Expand section|date=August 2007}}
{{main|Protein methods}}
{{main|Nucleic acid methods}}

[[Schild regression]] is a radioligand binding assay. It is used for DNA labelling (5' and 3'), leaving the nucleic acids intact.

==Radioactivity concentration==
A vial of radiolabel has a "total activity". Taking as an example γ32P [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], from the catalogues of the two major suppliers, Perkin Elmer NEG502H500UC or GE AA0068-500UCI, in this case, the total activity is 500 μCi (other typical numbers are 250 μCi or 1 mCi). This is contained in a certain volume, depending on the radioactive concentration, such as 5 to 10 mCi/mL (185 to 370 TBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); typical volumes include 50 or 25 μL.

Not all molecules in the solution have a P-32 on the last (i.e., gamma) phosphate: the "specific activity" gives the radioactivity concentration and depends on the radionuclei's half-life. If every molecule were labelled, the maximum theoretical specific activity is obtained that for P-32 is 9131 Ci/mmol. Due to pre-calibration and efficiency issues this number is never seen on a label; the values often found are 800, 3000 and 6000 Ci/mmol. With this number it is possible to calculate the total chemical concentration and the hot-to-cold ratio.

"Calibration date" is the date in which the vial’s activity is the same as on the label. "Pre-calibration" is when the activity is calibrated in a future date to compensate for the decay occurred during shipping.

==Comparison with fluorescence==
{{See also|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}
Prior to the widespread use of [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]] in the past three decades radioactivity was the most common label.

The primary advantage of fluorescence over radiotracers is that it does not require radiological controls and their associated expenses and safety measures.  The decay of radioisotpes may limit the [[shelf life]] of a reagent, requiring its replacement and thus increasing expenses.  Several fluorescent molecules can be used simultaneously (given that they do not overlap, cf. FRET), whereas with radioactivity two [[isotopes]] can be used ([[tritium]] and a low energy isotope, e.g. [[Phosphorus-33|&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P]] due to different intensities) but require special equipment (a tritium screen and a regular phosphor-imaging screen, a specific dual channel detector, e.g.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090105194225/http://www.biospacelab.com/html/microimager.html]).

Fluorescence is not necessary easier or more convenient to use because fluorescence requires specialized equipment of its own and because [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] makes absolute and/or reproducible quantification difficult.

The primary disadvantage of fluorescence versus radiotracers is a significant biological problem:  chemically tagging a molecule with a fluorescent dye radically changes the structure of the molecule, which in turn can radically change the way that molecule interacts with other molecules.  In contrast, intrinsic radiolabeling of a molecule can be done without altering its structure in any way.  For example, substituting a H-3 for a hydrogen atom or C-14 for a carbon atom does not change the conformation, structure, or any other property of the molecule, it's just switching forms of the same atom.  Thus an intrinscially radiolabeled molecule is identical to its unlabeled counterpart.

Measurement of biological phenomona by radiotracers is always direct.  In contrast, many life science fluorescence applications are indirect, consisting of a fluorescent dye increasing, decreasing, or shifting in wavelength emission upon binding to the molecule of interest.

==Safety==
If good [[health physics]] controls are maintained in a laboratory where radionuclides are used, it is unlikely that the overall radiation dose received by workers will be of much significance. Nevertheless, the effects of low doses are mostly unknown so many regulations exist to avoid unnecessary risks, such as skin or internal exposure. Due to the low penetration power and many variables involved it is hard to convert a radioactive concentration to a dose.
1 μCi of P-32 on a square centimetre of skin (through a dead layer of a thickness of 70 μm) gives 7961 [[Rad (unit)|rads]] (79.61 [[gray (unit)|grays]]) per hour . Similarly a [[mammogram]] gives an exposure of 300 [[Röntgen equivalent man|mrem]] (3 [[millisievert|mSv]]) on a larger volume (in the US, the average annual dose is 620 mrem or 6.2 mSv&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=NCRP|volume=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).

'''''Red Planet''''' is a 2000 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[thriller film]] directed by Antony Hoffman, starring [[Val Kilmer]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] and [[Tom Sizemore]]. Released on November 10, 2000, it was a critical and commercial failure. The film was Hoffman's only feature film; he primarily directed television commercials.

==Plot==
In 2056 A.D., [[Earth]] is in [[ecological crisis]] as a consequence of [[pollution]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Automated interplanetary missions have been seeding [[Mars]] with atmosphere-producing [[algae]] as the first stage of [[terraforming]] the planet. When the oxygen quantity produced by the algae is inexplicably reduced, the crew of ''Mars-1'' investigate—a crew consisting of Quinn Burchenal ([[Tom Sizemore]]), a geneticist; Bud Chantilas ([[Terence Stamp]]), an aging [[philosopher|philosophical]] scientist and surgeon; systems engineer Robby Gallagher ([[Val Kilmer]]); commander Kate Bowman ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]); pilot Ted Santen ([[Benjamin Bratt]]); and terraforming scientist Chip Pettengill ([[Simon Baker]]).

When ''Mars-1'' is damaged in arrival by a [[Gamma-ray burst]], Bowman remains aboard for repair while the others land to locate an automated habitat (HAB 1) established earlier to manufacture food and [[oxygen]]. During insertion, the team's landing craft is damaged and lands off-course. In the aftermath, "AMEE" (Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion)—a military [[robot]] programmed to guide them—is lost, and Chantilas suffers a ruptured [[spleen]] and internal bleeding, and tells the others to leave him behind. Santen refuses, but Chantilas tells them that they have limited oxygen left to make it to HAB 1. Chantilas tells Gallagher that it is all right, as he got to see Mars for the first time. The crew leaves to allow Chantilas to die in peace. In orbit around Mars, Bowman contacts Houston, which informs her that ''Mars-1'' is in [[decaying orbit]], but offers hope of restoring engine function in departing Mars.

On Mars, the landing party find HAB 1 mysteriously destroyed. They are baffled for an explanation, since the module was designed and field-tested in [[Tornado Alley]] to withstand any damaging storms on Mars. All expect their imminent [[death]]s by [[suffocation]]. Pettengill and Santen wander from the others to explore, later to reach a [[canyon]] where Pettengill accidentally kills Santen, after they get into a fight over whether or not the mission was a failure, and that Pettengill realizes that Santen would never accept defeat. Pettengill returns to Burchenal and Gallagher, and tells them that Santen killed himself. His oxygen depleted, Gallagher opens his helmet, choosing a quick death over asphyxiation – and discovers that Mars' atmosphere is thin but breathable. The only salvageable material from the habitat is all of the liquid fuel, which has ruptured out of its containers but pooled under the wreck. With no remaining power in their suits, the astronauts set it on fire with a flare so they can have a bonfire to survive the massive temperature drop of the Martian night. AMEE reunites with the crew, and the three astronauts notice the robot is damaged and attempt to shut it down so they can recover its guidance device. Perceiving their actions as a threat, AMEE breaks Burchenal's ribs and pursues the others before retreating. Gallagher tells the others she has gone into military mode, and intends to kill them all one by one.  She wounded Burchenal instead of killing him because she has been programmed with knowledge of the old guerrilla tactic that a wounded man will slow the enemy down since effort must be expended to transport a wounded teammate.  

Eventually, Gallagher builds a makeshift radio from parts of the [[Rover (space exploration)|Mars Rover]] ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'', through which Bowman instructs them to use a Russian [[Kosmos (satellite)|probe]]'s sample-return system to launch themselves into orbit. During the trip, Bowman tells Gallagher that the probe can hold only two people.  The trio takes shelter from an ice storm inside of a cave. Devastated by the recent news and afraid of being left behind, Pettengill flees with the radio, only to be killed by AMEE. After the storm subsides Gallagher and Burchenal recover the radio from Pettingill's corpse, and discover that it has become infested by insect-like native Martian life (identified by Burchenal as "[[nematodes]]"). The insects are highly flammable, as using a simple cutting torch on Pettengill's corpse to free his grip caused a chain reaction, making all of the insects in his corpse explode like firecrackers.  Later, the two encounter a field of [[algae]] being eaten by the insects, and Burchenal pieces together what happened.

The Martian insects had lain dormant on their almost dead world, but when the probes from Earth spread algae fields across Mars it gave them a massive new food source and led to a population explosion. The Martian insects are what caused the algae to disappear, but in the process they actually gave Mars breathable oxygen levels, because they produce oxygen as a waste product (explaining why they are so flammable). The insects are also what destroyed the habitat module, as they tore in to get to the food supplies inside.

Burchenal explains to Gallagher that the biochemistry of alien insects' [[Cellular respiration|respiratory metabolism]] is capable of producing oxygen far more efficiently than human science is currently able to. Studying the insects' biochemistry is the key to terraforming Mars, and may even lead to discoveries which will allow Earth's polluted atmosphere to be repaired. However, Burchenal is attacked by swarms of the insects when [[blood]] drips from an open wound. Rather than be eaten alive, he passes his sample vial of insects to Gallagher before [[self-immolation|immolating himself]] and his attackers.

Gallagher reaches the Russian probe, finds sufficient fuel to power the rocket's engine, but not enough electrical power to launch the probe, and realizes that the only available replacement is AMEE's power core. In a final confrontation, Gallagher is able to lure AMEE into a trap and disable her using one of the probe's sample launchers, then takes her battery. Gallagher launches himself in the probe's sample-return capsule and reaches orbit where ''Mars-1'' is waiting for him, and he is recovered and revived by Bowman. Gallagher becomes upset that four astronauts died so that he could live, but Bowman tells him that they did not die for nothing. The computer is busy analyzing the sample of Martian insects which Gallagher brought back, and research on them might lead to repairing Earth itself. With a six-month-long trip back to Earth, the computer has plenty of time to analyze the insects, and Bowman and Gallagher have time to start pursuing a romantic relationship.

==Production==
The production of the film (which was filmed in Wadi Rum in Southern Jordan and in outback Australia) was the subject of numerous reports about the fractious relationship between co-stars [[Tom Sizemore]] and [[Val Kilmer]]. Kilmer's reputation for being "difficult" was already well-established, and although the two stars had been friends, they fell out after Kilmer reportedly became enraged when he discovered that production had paid for Sizemore’s exercise machine to be shipped to the set. Kilmer shouted, “I’m making ten million on this; you’re only making two”, to which Sizemore responded by throwing a 50-pound weight at Kilmer (which missed). The two were soon refusing to speak to each other or even come onto the set if the other was present, necessitating the use of body doubles to shoot scenes involving both actors, and their relationship became so bad that one of the producers is said to have asked Sizemore not to hit Kilmer in the face when the big fight finally happened - in the event, Sizemore cooperatively landed a knock-down blow on Kilmer’s chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tom-sizemore-recounts-fame-battle-sobriety-memoir-article-1.1290899|first=Sherryl|last=Connelly|title=Action star Tom Sizemore recounts his rise and fall from fame and his battle with sobriety in new memoir|journal=[[New York Daily News]]|date=17 March 2014|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizemore has since described the film as one of his career regrets, but also stated that he and Kilmer have since reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/26/tom-sizemore-s-revenge-on-tom-cruise-s-scientology-recruitment-drugs-and-craving-a-comeback.html|first=Marlow|last=Stern|title=Tom Sizemore’s Revenge: On Tom Cruise’s Scientology Recruitment, Drugs, and Craving a Comeback|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
===Box office===
''Red Planet'' opened at No. 5 at the North American box office making $8.7 million [[United States dollar|USD]] in its opening weekend. The film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $33 million worldwide against an estimated budget of $80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=redplanet.htm|title=Red Planet (2000) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
The film received negative reviews, with only a 14% "rotten" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 100 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_planet/|title=Red Planet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Holden]]'s review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' was almost entirely negative, calling the film "a leaden, skimpily plotted space-age Outward Bound adventure with vague allegorical aspirations that remain entirely unrealized."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E7D81738F933A25752C1A9669C8B63&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=Red%20Planet&amp;st=cse "Red Planet: Finding the Terra Not So Firma on Mars,"] Stephen Holden, ''The New York Times'', 10 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''relation network''' (RN) is an [[artificial neural network]] component with a structure that can reason about relations among objects. An example category of such relations is [[spatial relation]]s (above, below, left, right, in front of, behind).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01427.pdf|title=A simple neural network module for relational reasoning|last=Santoro|first=Adam|authorlink=|last2=Raposo|first2=David|date=5 June 2017|eprint=|publisher=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Barrett|first3=David G.T.|last4=Malinowski|first4=Mateusz|last5=Pascanu|first5=Razvan|last6=Battaglia|first6=Peter|last7=Lillicrap|first7=Timothy|archive- url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNs can infer relations, they are data efficient, and they operate on a set of objects without regard to the objects' order.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
In June 2017, [[DeepMind]] announced the first relation network. It claimed that the technology had achieved "superhuman" performance on multiple [[Question answering|question-answering]] problem sets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Design ==
RNs constrain the functional form of a neural network to capture the common properties of relational reasoning. These properties are explicitly added to the system, rather than established by learning just as the capacity to reason about spatial, translation-invariant properties is explicitly part of [[convolutional neural network]]s (CNN). The data to be considered can be presented as a simple list or as a [[directed graph]] whose nodes are objects and whose edges are the pairs of objects whose relationships are to be considered. The RN is a composite function: &lt;math&gt; RN \left (O \right ) = f \phi \left ( \sum_{i,j} g\theta \left (o_i , o_j , q \right ) \right ),  &lt;/math&gt;

where the input is a set of “objects” &lt;math&gt; O = \left \lbrace o_1, o_2, ..., o_n \right \rbrace, o_i \in \mathbb{R} ^m &lt;/math&gt; is the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; object, and fφ and gθ are functions with parameters φ and θ, respectively and ''q'' is the question.

'''Staff Sergeant Reckless''' (c. 1948 – May 13, 1968), a decorated [[Horses in warfare|war horse]] who held official rank in the United States military,{{sfn|Blackman, Jr.|2012|p=4}} was a [[mare]] of [[Mongolian horse]] breeding.  Out of a [[race horse]] dam, she was purchased in October 1952 for $250 from a Korean stableboy at the [[Seoul]] racetrack who needed money to buy an artificial leg for his sister.  Reckless was bought by members of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and trained to be a [[pack horse]] for the [[M20 recoilless rifle|Recoilless Rifle]] Platoon, Anti-Tank Company, [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marine Regiment]], [[1st Marine Division]].{{sfn|Blackman, Jr.|2012|p=4}} She quickly became part of the unit and was allowed to roam freely through camp, entering the Marines' tents, where she would sleep on cold nights, and was known for her willingness to eat nearly anything, including scrambled eggs, beer, [[Coca-Cola]] and, once, about $30 worth of poker chips.

She served in numerous combat actions during the [[Korean War]], carrying supplies and ammunition, and was also used to evacuate wounded.  Learning each supply route after only a couple of trips, she often traveled to deliver supplies to the troops on her own, without benefit of a handler. The highlight of her nine-month military career came in late March 1953 during the [[Battle for Outpost Vegas]] when, in a single day, she made 51 solo trips to resupply multiple front line units. She was wounded in combat twice, given the battlefield rank of corporal in 1953, and then a [[battlefield promotion]] to sergeant in 1954, several months after the war ended.  She also became the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated in an [[amphibious landing]], and following the war was awarded two [[Purple Heart]]s, a [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)#Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal|Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal]], was included in her unit's [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]s from [[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation|two countries]], as well as other military honors.

Her wartime service record was featured in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', and [[Life (magazine)|''LIFE'' magazine]] recognized her as one of America's 100 all-time heroes. She was retired and brought to the United States after the war, where she made appearances on television and participated in the [[United States Marine Corps birthday ball]]. She was officially promoted to [[Staff Sergeant#United States|staff sergeant]] in 1959 by the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]].{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}}  She gave birth to four [[foal]]s in America and died in May 1968. A plaque and photo were dedicated in her honor at the [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]] stables and a statue of her was dedicated on July 26, 2013 at the [[National Museum of the Marine Corps]] in [[Quantico, Virginia]]. On May 12, 2018, a bronze statue of Sergeant Reckless was placed and dedicated in the Kentucky Horse Park, Lexington Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kentucky.com/news/local/counties/fayette-county/article209055514.html|title=Sergeant Reckless Korean War horse statue going to KY Horse Park|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyforward.com/statue-of-heroic-korean-war-horse-sgt-reckless-to-be-dedicated-at-kentucky-horse-park-on-may-12/|title=Statue of heroic Korean War horse Sgt. Reckless to be dedicated at Kentucky Horse Park on May 12 - KyForward.com|date=1 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Sergeant Reckless was [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] colored with a [[horse markings|blaze and three white stockings]].{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} Her date of birth and parentage are unconfirmed, but she was estimated to be around three or four years old when she was purchased by members of the United States Marine Corps in October 1952. She was sold to the Marines by her owner, a young Korean stableboy called Kim Huk Moon,{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=23–108}} though that was not his real name.{{sfn|Geer|1955|loc=Author's Note}} The horse was originally named ''{{lang|ko|Ah Chim Hai}}'' in [[Korean language|Korean]],{{sfn|Geer|1955|p=48}} which translates to "Morning Flame" or "Flame-of-the-Morning",{{sfn|Equestrian News|2012}}{{sfn|Coakley|1991|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A War Horse Earns Her Sergeant’s Stripes: 1953 {{!}} The Saturday Evening Post|url = http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2012/01/14/history/post-perspective/marines-find-real-war-horse-1953.html|website = www.saturdayeveningpost.com|accessdate = 2015-09-09|first = The Saturday Evening Post|last = Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; also reputed to be the name of her [[Glossary of equestrian terms#D|dam]], a [[racehorse]] at the track in Seoul. Moon sold the horse, whom he had nicknamed "Flame", to Lieutenant Eric Pedersen for $250 in order to buy a leg [[prosthesis]] for his sister, who had stepped on a [[land mine]].{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=109–113}} The horse's breeding was thought to be primarily [[Mongolian horse|Mongolian]] though she did have some features, particularly the shape of her head, that were similar to horses of [[Thoroughbred]] lineage. She was small, standing only {{hands|14}} and weighing {{convert|900|lb|kg}}.{{sfn|Miller|2013}}{{sfn|Geer|1955|p=7}}

==Military service==
[[File:Reckless with Sgt. Latham.jpg|thumb|Reckless with her primary trainer, Platoon Gunnery Sergeant Joseph Latham]]
In October 1952, Pedersen{{efn|Sometimes misspelled as "Pederson"{{sfn|Geer|1955|loc=Foreword}}}} received permission from [[Colonel]] Eustace P. Smoak to purchase a horse for his platoon.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} Based in mountainous terrain, Pederson needed a pack animal capable of carrying up to nine of the heavy 24-pound shells needed to supply the [[recoilless rifle]]s used by his unit, the Recoilless Rifle Platoon of the 5th Marine Regiment.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}}{{sfn|Equestrian News|2012}}{{sfn|Coakley|1991|p=23}} The day after he received permission, on  October 26, 1952,{{sfn|Equestrian News|2012}} Pedersen, Sergeant Willard Berry, and Corporal Philip Carter drove a jeep with a trailer to the Seoul racetrack.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=130–132}} Pedersen paid for the horse with his own money.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=124–125}} Moon was reluctant to sell the horse, though he needed to,{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=109–113}} and cried when "Flame" departed.{{sfn|Geer|1955|p=117}}  The Marines renamed her "Reckless" as a contraction of the name of the Recoilless rifle and a nod to the daredevil attitude associated with those who used the gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reckless Pride Of The Marines : Andrew Geer : Free Download &amp; Streaming|url = https://archive.org/details/recklessprideoft011755mbp|website = Internet Archive|accessdate = 2015-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her primary trainer and the person Reckless was closest to was platoon [[Gunnery Sergeant]] Joseph Latham.{{sfn|Geer|1955|p=120}} Private First Class Monroe Coleman was her primary caretaker.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} In addition to Pedersen, Latham, and Coleman, Lieutenant Bill Riley and Sergeant Elmer Lively were also involved with the training and care of Reckless.{{sfn|Miller|2013}}{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}}{{sfn|Geer|1955|loc=Author's Note}} Pedersen had his wife ship a [[pack saddle]] from their home in California so Reckless could better fulfill her primary role as a pack animal.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=142–143}} The recoilless rifle platoon had its own medical corpsman, Navy Hospitalman First Class George "Doc" Mitchell, who provided the majority of medical care for Reckless.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=120, 161}}

The Marines, especially Latham, taught Reckless battlefield survival skills such as how not to become entangled in [[barbed wire]] and to lie down when under fire.{{sfn|Miller|2013}} She learned to run for a [[bunker]] upon hearing the cry, "incoming!"{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} The platoon called it her "hoof training" and "hoof camp". The horse was initially kept in a pasture near the encampment.{{sfn|Miller|2013}} Reckless had a gentle disposition and soon developed such a rapport with the troops that she was allowed to freely roam about the camp and entered tents at will,{{sfn|Litalien|1984|p=30}} sometimes sleeping inside with the troops, and even lying down next to Latham's warm tent stove on cold nights.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} She was fond of a wide variety of foodstuffs, entertaining the platoon by eating scrambled eggs and drinking [[Coca-Cola]] and beer.{{sfn|Litalien|1984|p=30}} Food could not be left unattended around her.{{sfn|Kilgannon|2012}} She was known to eat bacon, buttered toast, chocolate bars, hard candy, shredded wheat, peanut butter sandwiches and mashed potatoes. However, Mitchell advised the platoon that she not be given more than two bottles of Coke a day.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}}  Her tastes were not confined to foodstuffs; she once ate her [[horse blanket]],{{sfn|Coakley|1991|p=23}} and on another occasion ate $30 worth of Latham's winning poker chips.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}}{{sfn|Litalien|1984|p=30}}

[[File:Reckless_under_fire.jpg|thumb|left|Reckless under fire in Korea]]
Reckless's baptism under fire came at a place called Hedley's Crotch, near the villages of Changdan and Kwakchan.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=143–144}} Though loaded down with six  recoilless rifle shells, she initially "went straight up" &lt;!--per source, didn't specify if reared or leaped--&gt;and all four feet left the ground the first time the [[M20 recoilless rifle|Recoilless Rifle]] was fired. When she landed she started shaking, but Coleman, her handler, calmed her down.  The second time the gun fired she merely snorted, and by the end of the mission that day appeared calm and was seen trying to eat a discarded helmet liner.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} She even appeared to take an interest in the operation of the weapon.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=143–144}} When learning a new delivery route, Reckless would only need someone to lead her a few times. Afterwards she would make the trips on her own.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=181–183}} There was a standing order not to ride Reckless, but in early December 1952, someone violated that order and took Reckless on a ride that included a sprint through a [[minefield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Reckless: Pride of the Marines|last = Geer|first = Andrew|publisher = E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc.|year = 1955|isbn = |location = archive.org|pages = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was not injured during the unauthorized ride.{{sfn|Geer|1955|p = 158}}

Her most significant accomplishment came during the [[Battle for Outpost Vegas|Battle of Panmunjom-Vegas]] (also known as the Battle of Outpost Vegas/Vegas Hill) over the period March 26–28, 1953, when she made 51 solo trips in a single day, carrying a total of 386 recoilless rounds (over 9,000 pounds, carrying 4 to 8 24-pound shells on each trip) covering over 35 miles that day. The whole Battle of Vegas lasted 3 days.{{sfn|Miller|2013}}{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}}{{sfn|Litalien|1984|p=30}}{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=172–189}}{{efn|Sometimes erroneously reported as 5 days.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=172–189}}}} She was wounded twice during the battle: once when she was hit by shrapnel over the left eye and another time on her left flank.{{sfn|Coakley|1991|p=23}}  For her accomplishments during the Battle of Vegas Hill, Reckless was promoted to corporal.{{sfn|Geer|1955|p=210}}&lt;!--was she ever "officially" declared "enlisted" or designated a "private" prior to this? UNCLEAR FROM SOURCES, I wondered this too.--&gt;

[[File:Sgt Reckless with recoilless-rifle.jpg|thumb|Reckless beside a 75mm recoilless rifle]]
When not on the front lines, Reckless packed other items for the platoon, and was particularly useful for stringing telephone wire. Carrying reels of wire on her pack that were played out as she walked, she could string as much wire as twelve men on foot.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} She became the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated in an amphibious landing when the 5th moved from [[Camp Casey, South Korea|Camp Casey]] to [[Inchon]], planning to participate in amphibious landings hundreds of miles south of Inchon.{{sfn|Litalien|1984|p=30}} The commanding officer of the transport halted loading operations when he saw the platoon on the dock with Reckless. He refused to take her on board his clean ship,{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=189–191}} which had won an award for being the cleanest ship in the previous two years.{{sfn|Geer|1955|p=191}} She was allowed on board after the Marines produced the loading plan, approved by him, which specifically listed Reckless and her equipment.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=189–191}} Once the ship was underway, she became sick&lt;!--probably [[horse colic]]---&gt;, making a mess&lt;!--had to be diarrhea, horses physiologically are incapable of vomiting, maybe need to clarify, ANSWER--it only says sick and mess, not specific enough to answer--&gt; on the ship's decks during the first part of the voyage. She could not be disembarked due to a storm, but soon became accustomed to the motion of the ship at sea and had no more problems.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} The 1st Marine Division was moved to a rest area soon after the move, and while there some platoon members posed with Reckless and a sign challenging the Thoroughbred [[Native Dancer]] to a race. They called their race the "Paddy Derby", the field "Upsan Downs", and the conditions differed from a typical horse race: 1.5 miles over paddies and hills, carrying 192 pounds of ammunition, and no riders. The Marines never received a reply; Native Dancer came in second in the [[Kentucky Derby]], and went on to win the [[Preakness Stakes]] and [[Belmont Stakes]].{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=191–193}}{{sfn|Baltimore Sun|2013}}

[[Randolph M. Pate]], then the commander of the 1st Marine Division, gave Reckless a battlefield promotion from corporal to sergeant in a formal ceremony, complete with reviewing stand, on April 10, 1954, several months after the war ended.{{sfn|Geer|1955|loc=Introduction, pp. 208–210}} She was also given a red and gold blanket with insignia.{{sfn|Geer|1955|loc=Introduction, pp. 200–202}} Reckless was promoted again, to staff sergeant ([[U.S. uniformed services pay grades#Enlisted pay grades|E-6]]), on August 31, 1959, at Camp Pendleton, California. This promotion was also awarded by Pate, then the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Pate personally presided over the ceremony, and Reckless was honored with a 19-gun salute and a 1,700-man parade of Marines from her wartime unit.{{sfn|Sgt Reckless video|2010}} She was an early example of an animal holding official rank in a branch of the United States military.{{sfn|Kilgannon|2012}}

==Retirement==
[[File:Reckless Rotation Ceremony.png|thumb|left|Sergeant Reckless at her stateside rotation ceremony, 1954. PFC William Moore is holding her. He accompanied her on the trip to America.]]

For her exemplary service to the Marine Corps, Reckless was awarded two Purple Hearts (for the wounds received during the Battle of Vegas), a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with bronze star, the [[National Defense Service Medal]], a [[Korean Service Medal]], the [[United Nations Korea Medal]], a [[Navy Unit Commendation]], and a [[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation]].{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} She would wear these awards on her horse blanket, plus a [[Fourragere|French Fourragere]] that the 5th Marines earned in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Equestrian News|2012}}

An article in ''The Saturday Evening Post'', published on April 17, 1954, while Reckless was still in Korea,{{sfn|Geer|1955|loc=Author's Note}} resulted in a campaign by American supporters to get the Marines to bring her to the United States. An executive at Pacific Transport Lines, Stan Coppel, read the article and offered to let Reckless ride free on one of his company's ships from [[Yokohama]] to [[San Francisco]].{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} Prior to her departure for America, a ceremony, including a band, for Reckless' rotation to the United States was held during half time of a football game between the Marine Corps and Army. Reckless left Korea  for Japan aboard a [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] transport plane.{{sfn|Geer|1955|loc=Introduction, pp. 208–210}} She then sailed from Yokohama on October 22 aboard the ''SS Pacific Transport'', due in San Francisco on November 5, 1954.{{sfn|Coakley|1991|p=23}} A typhoon delayed the ship's arrival until the evening of November 9. Reckless and her caretakers stayed aboard until the next morning. Reckless got sick during the storm and was once knocked out of her stall onto the deck by the storm, which happened near the end of the trip. 
{{quote box

Reckless's entry into the United States was not without its challenges. The [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs Bureau]] was not much of a problem but the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] insisted a medical check and lab tests be completed before she disembarked from the ship once it reached San Francisco, which would make her late for the Marine banquet where she was to be the guest of honor. The Marines contacted Agriculture Department officials in Washington, D.C. who agreed to allow her off the ship after her blood was drawn for lab tests, with the understanding that if she had [[glanders]] or [[covering sickness|dourine]], she would be destroyed or sent back to Japan. Many of the Marines who actually knew her were incensed at what they considered an affront to her honor when they learned that dourine was an equine sexually transmitted disease.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=211–217}} The night before she arrived, she once again ate her blanket, but a new one with ribbons and insignia was made just in time for her disembarkation. She was led off the ship by Lieutenant Pedersen and set foot on American soil in San Francisco on November 10, 1954,{{sfn|Geer|1955|loc=Author's Note, p. 124}} coincidentally the birthday of the &lt;!--creation of? maybe say "anniversary"? MARINES call it their birthday--&gt; Marine Corps. For the [[Marine Corps birthday ball|Marine Corps Birthday Ball]] held that day, she rode an elevator, and then ate both cake and the flower decorations.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}}
[[File:Staff Sergeant Reckless.jpg|thumb|Sergeant Reckless at her promotion to Staff Sergeant, 1959]]

Reckless was kept by Pedersen's family for a brief time before moving to a more permanent home with the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. A second article about Reckless appeared in ''The Saturday Evening Post'' on October 22, 1955. These two articles and the book ''Reckless: Pride of the Marines'' (1955) were written by the commander of the 2nd Battalion, [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Andrew Geer, who kept notes about Reckless during the war.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} She made several public appearances, including [[Art Linkletter]]'s show ''[[House Party (radio and TV show)|House Party]]'', but had to cancel an appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' due to the typhoon.{{sfn|Kilgannon|2012}} Ed Sullivan had wanted her to appear on his November 7 show and was willing to pay the costs to get her there right after the scheduled, and delayed, November 5 arrival. Reckless never did appear on Sullivan's show.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=211–217}}

Reckless was well cared for and treated as a VIP during her time at Camp Pendleton. The Marine Corps was also careful not to allow her to be exploited by commercial interests.{{sfn|Geer|1955|pp=223–224}} She produced four [[foal]]s there: [[colt (horse)|colts]] Fearless (1957), Dauntless (1959), and Chesty (1964); her last foal, a filly born circa 1965–1966, died a month after birth and was unnamed.{{sfn|Miller|2013}}{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} Her offspring Chesty was named after [[Chesty Puller]], one of the few Marines ever allowed to ride Reckless.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} Puller was a Marine Corps [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] and the most decorated United States Marine of all time.{{sfn|Marine Corps News|2013}} Reckless retired from active service with full military honors at Camp Pendleton on November 10, 1960.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}}{{sfn|Kilgannon|2012}} She was provided free quarters and feed in lieu of retirement pay, per Marine Corps documents.{{sfn|Sgt Reckless video|2010}} 

[[File:PFC Fearless, Camp Pendleton, circa 1959 (15022185003).jpg|thumb|Reckless's son, Fearless, in 1959.]]

Reckless developed arthritis in her back as she aged and injured herself on May 13, 1968, by falling into a [[barbed wire]] fence. She died under sedation while her wounds were being treated.{{sfn|Tuscaloosa News|1968}} At the time of her death, she was estimated to be 19 or 20 years old.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} There is a plaque and photo commemorating her at the Camp Pendleton stables.{{sfn|Equestrian News|2012}} The first race at Aqueduct racetrack, New York, was designated "The Sgt Reckless" on November 10, 1989.{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=78–85}} In 1997, Reckless was listed by ''LIFE'' magazine as one of America's 100 all-time heroes.{{sfn|Sgt Reckless video|2010}}

==Memorials ==
A statue by sculptor Jocelyn Russell of Reckless carrying ammunition shells and other combat equipment was unveiled on July 26, 2013, in Semper Fidelis Memorial Park at the [[National Museum of the Marine Corps]], one day before the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. There is a lock of her [[tail (horse)|tail hair]] in the base of the statue.{{sfn|Bartel|2013}} The statue's plaque includes a quote from Sergeant Harold Wadley, who served in battle alongside Sergeant Reckless: "The spirit of her loneliness and her loyalty, in spite of the danger, was something else to behold. Hurting. Determined. And alone. That's the image I have imprinted in my head and heart forever."&lt;ref name=Dedication&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Reckless Dedication|url=http://www.koreanwar60.com/gallery/operation-reckless-dedication|website=Department of Defense 60th Anniversary of Korean War Commemoration Committee|date=July 26, 2013|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5748">Most pregnant women can engage in '''sexual activity during pregnancy''' throughout [[gravidity]].

==Decreased sexual desire and frequency==
Most research suggests that, during [[pregnancy]], sexual desire and frequency of sexual relations decrease.&lt;ref name="Bermudez"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Influence of the Gestation Period on Sexual Desire|journal=Psychology in Spain|year=2001|author=M.P. Bermudez |author2=A.I. Sanchez |author3=G. Buela-Casal|volume=5|issue=1|pages=14–16|url=http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/2001/2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fok"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual behavior and activity in Chinese pregnant women|author=Wing Yee Fok |author2=Louis Yik-Si Chan |author3=Pong Mo Yuen|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|volume=84|issue=10|pages=934–938|date=October 2005
|pmid= 16167907|doi=10.1111/j.0001-6349.2005.00743.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In context of this overall decrease in desire, some studies indicate a second-trimester increase, preceding a decrease.&lt;ref name="Reamy"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexuality and pregnancy. A prospective study|journal=J Reprod Med.|date=June 1982|volume=27|issue=6|pages=321–|author=Reamy K|author2=White SE |author3=Daniell WC |author4=Le Vine ES
 |pmid=7120209}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these decreases are not universal: a significant number of women report greater sexual satisfaction throughout their pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Influence of gestational period on sexual behavior|journal= J Egypt Public Health Assoc.  2007|year=2007|volume=82|issue=1–2|pages=65–90|author=Khamis MA|author2=Mustafa MF |author3=Mohamed SN |author4=Toson MM|pmid=18217325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low-risk behavior==
Sex during pregnancy is a low-risk behaviour except when the physician advises that sexual intercourse be avoided, because it may, in some pregnancies, lead to serious pregnancy complications or health issues such as a high-risk for premature labour or a ruptured uterus.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Such a decision may be based upon a history of difficulties in a previous childbirth. However, it has been observed that evidence in this area is lacking and physicians' advice is more likely to be based on supposition than scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Moscrop A (Apr 2012). "Can sex during pregnancy cause a miscarriage? A concise history of not knowing". Br J Gen Pract. 62 (597): e308–10. PMC 3310038  . {{PMID|22520919}}. doi:10.3399/bjgp12X636164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological usefulness==
Some studies in the 1980s and 1990s contend that it is useful for pregnant women to continue to be sexually active, specifically noting that overall sexual satisfaction was correlated with feeling happy about being pregnant, feeling more attractive in late pregnancy than before pregnancy, and experiencing [[orgasm]].&lt;ref name="Reamy" /&gt; Sexual activity has also been suggested as a way to prepare for induced labor; some believe the natural prostaglandin content of seminal liquid can favor the maturation process of the cervix making it more flexible, allowing for easier and faster dilation and effacement of the cervix. However, the efficacy of using sexual intercourse as an induction agent "remains uncertain".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030515/2123.html Methods for Cervical Ripening and Induction of Labor - May 15, 2003 - American Family Physician&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention of pre-eclampsia==
There is tentative evidence for [[Pre-eclampsia#Exposure to partner's semen|exposure to partner's semen as prevention for pre-eclampsia]], largely due to the absorption of several immune modulating factors present in seminal fluid.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite web| author= Sarah Robertson|  title=Research Goals --&gt; Role of seminal fluid signalling in the female reproductive tract| url=http://health.adelaide.edu.au/og/people/robertsons.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/677CY45U2?url=http://health.adelaide.edu.au/og/people/robertsons.html| archivedate=2012-04-22| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sarah A. Robertson |author2=John J. Bromfield |author3=Kelton P. Tremellen | title=Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia—a unifying hypothesis | journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=253–265 | year=2003 | pmid=12896827 | doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fetus protected by amniotic fluid==
During pregnancy, the fetus is protected from thrusting during sexual penetration by the [[amniotic fluid]] in the womb and by the woman's [[cervix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/sex-during-pregnancy.aspx Sex During Pregnancy - March of Dimes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==After pregnancy==
[[Sex after pregnancy|Sexual intercourse after giving birth]] can begin when the couple are both ready. However most American couples wait until after six weeks and they should consult their physician if they have any concerns.&lt;ref name="pregnancy video"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/videos/about/pregnancy|title=Pregnancy video|accessdate=2009-01-22|publisher=Channel 4|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ovulation and thus pregnancy can begin prior to a return to regular menses, so women who resume intercourse in the postpartum period should use a reliable form of contraception unless pregnancy is desired.

'''Sibling abuse''' includes the [[Physical abuse|physical]], [[Emotional abuse|psychological]], or [[sexual abuse]] of one [[sibling]] by another.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811563767|title=Sibling abuse : hidden physical, emotional, and sexual trauma|last=R.|first=Wiehe, Vernon|date=1997|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=9780761910091|edition=2nd|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=811563767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sibling Aggression: Assessment and Treatment|last=Caspi|first=Jonathan|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|year=2012|isbn=9780826124159|location=eBook Academic Collection (EBSCOhost)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fourth category that brought attention from researchers, such as Stauffacher &amp; DeHart and Card, Stucky, Sawalani, &amp; Little, during the first decade of the 21st century is sibling relational abuse which derives from [[relational aggression]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Almost all brothers and sisters fight. Abuse occurs when one one sibling consistently intimidates, terrorizes or controls another.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Sibling abuse occurs most often in [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional]], [[neglect]]ful or abusive homes when parents fail to set boundaries or discipline abusive children.&lt;ref name="umich"&gt;[http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/yourchild/sibabuse.htm University of Michigan Health System: Sibling abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laviola, M. (1992). Effects of older brother-younger sister incest: A study of the dynamics of 17 cases. Child Abuse and Neglect, 16, p. 409-421.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1982 study found that of 60 per cent of children who witnessed abuse between their parents later acted out the scene with their siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Pfout, Schopler, &amp; Henley, "Forgotten Victims of Family Violence," ''Social Work'', July 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; They also are more likely to abuse others when they grow up.

==Types of sibling abuse and prevalence==
{{tone|section|date=November 2013}}
According to many authorities and researchers, sibling abuse is one of the most common forms of abuse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/family-relationships-sibling-rivalry/44341.aspx Stepp, G. "From Sibling Violence to Brotherly Love"]&lt;/ref&gt; however, its occurrence is largely overlooked by society at large and by investigators into [[interpersonal violence]]:

===Physical abuse===
Sibling physical abuse is far more common than peer bullying and other forms of family abuse, such as spousal or child abuse.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; It includes but is not limited to hitting, biting, slapping, stabbing, shoving, punching and even tickling.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; It is very difficult to calculate prevalence rates for different reasons that lie within the family or in cultural norms and beliefs. Within the family, adults have difficulty recognizing abuse because sibling competition and conflict are very common. Aggression is even considered to have a positive side in sibling relationships because it helps children gain skills to build relationships outside the family circle. Other individuals prefer to deny the situation and continue family life as if the problem didn't exist. The victim does not complain because of fear of retaliation from the perpetrator or because he/she is unable to recognize abuse from acceptable sibling aggression. On the other hand, cultural norms and beliefs deter individuals from openly addressing it because they don't want to be pointed out by society. Correct reporting of sibling abuse faces multiple challenges starting with the fact that it is under reported for the reasons stated above, professional child care providers having considerably different definitions of the term and the lack of a system to track the wide information. Sibling physical abuse persists from childhood through adulthood, with prevalence rates varying across studies and its intensity and frequency declining as the victim and or perpetrator grow up.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Hotaling, Straus, &amp; Lincoln&lt;ref&gt;Hotaling, G. T., Straus, M. A., &amp; Lincoln, A. J. (1990). Intrafamily violence and crime and violence outside the family. In M. A. Straus and R. J. Gelles (Eds.), Physical Violence in American Families (p. 431-470). New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books&lt;/ref&gt; found that sibling aggression was somewhat common even in families that could not be classified as pervasively abusive, with 37% of 498 children committing at least one act of serious abuse during the previous year; in abusive families, 100% of children committed at least one act of serious abuse. Irfan and Cowburn&lt;ref&gt;[http://shura.shu.ac.uk/602/1/fulltext.pdf Disciplining, Chastisement and Physical Child Abuse: Perceptions and Attitudes of the British Pakistani Community]&lt;/ref&gt; report that in Pakistani immigrant families in the UK, "Among perpetrators of abuse, 35% (highest proportion) of physical abuse was perpetrated by siblings, 33% by mothers and 19% by fathers."

Several studies show that sisters are more likely to be victimized by brothers than vice versa.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Graham-Bermann, S. A. and Cutler, S. E. (1994). The Brother-Sister Questionnaire: Psychometric assessment and discrimination of well-functioning from dysfunctional relationships. Journal of Family Psychology, 8(2), p. 224-238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finkelhor, D. and Baron, L. (1986). Risk factors for child sexual abuse. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 1(1), p. 43-71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, sisters can also abuse brothers, and traditional gender roles can allow such abuse to go unchecked. Schwartz and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M., O'Leary, S. G., &amp; Kendziora, K. T. (1997).  Dating aggression among high school students.  Violence and Victims, 12, 295-305.&lt;/ref&gt; found that while women are more likely to use physical aggression during disagreements, parents are more likely to view male aggression more negatively than female aggression, even when the abusive acts are identical (e.g., boys throwing objects during a fight is seen as a more serious transgression than girls throwing objects during a fight). Similarly, Tyree and Malone&lt;ref&gt;Tyree, A., &amp; Malone, J. (1991).  How can it be that wives hit husbands as much as husbands hit wives and none of us knew it?  Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; report that women's violence as adults is more strongly correlated with aggression towards siblings during childhood.

=== Psychological abuse ===
Psychological abuse includes name calling, belittling, teasing, insulting, threatening to harm, and the destruction of personal property.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Adults, be it the parents or professional care providers, have difficulty differentiating between psychological aggression and abuse because it is difficult to identify when the balance of power is not evenly distributed, hence, the consequences of the aggression are not only injury but also control or domination of one sibling over the other.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Although it has been found to be the most prevalent type of abuse in sibling conflict, prevalence rates are difficult to calculate because of the difficulty in differentiating aggression from abuse.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Whipple and Finton&lt;ref&gt;Whipple, E. and Finton, S. 1995. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p05n783079216781/ Psychological maltreatment by siblings: An unrecognized form of abuse]. Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal, Vol. 12, no. 2, pp 135-146&lt;/ref&gt; report that "[[emotional abuse|Psychological maltreatment]] between siblings is one of the most common yet often underrecognized forms of child abuse.Bagley and Ramsey, Mullen, Martin, Anderson, Romans and Herbison, Kurtz, Gaudin, Wodarski, and Howing, and Beitchman et al., are some of the researchers that have found different negative psychological, academic and social consequences to be related to sibling aggression and abuse but causal inference requires more study.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Caffaro, J. and Conn-Caffaro, A. report, based on their research, that adult sibling abuse survivors have much higher rates of emotional cutoff (34%) with brothers and sisters than what is evident in the general population (&lt;6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223843633_Treating_sibling_abuse_families|title=Treating sibling abuse families|last=Caffaro|first=John|last2=Conn-Caffaro|first2=Allison|date=2005-07-01|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual abuse===
{{further|Child-on-child sexual abuse}}Sibling sexual abuse includes penetration, touching, and other behaviors with sexual connotation that not necessarily require touching.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To differentiate sexual abuse from sexual curiosity or playing innocent games there needs to be coercion, secrecy and domination over one sibling. Prevalence rates are also difficult to calculate for several reasons: victims do not realize that they are suffering abuse until they reach maturity and have a better understanding of the role they played during the encounters, they are afraid of reporting, and there is no consensus on a definition of sibling sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Ryan&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, G. (2005) Preventing Violence and Trauma in the Next Generation. J Interpers Violence 2005; 20; 132 {{doi|10.1177/0886260504268605}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes how, "Child protection has focused on adult-child [sexual] relationships, yet we know that more than 40% of all juvenile-perpetrated child sexual abuse is perpetrated in sibling relationships."

Caffaro &amp; Conn-Caffaro (1998; 2005) define sibling sexual abuse as sexual behavior between siblings for which the victim is not developmentally prepared, which is not transitory, and which does not reflect age-appropriate curiosity. It may or may not involve physical touching, coercion, or force. Bank and Kahn&lt;ref&gt;Bank, S. P. &amp; Kahn, M. D. (1982). The sibling bond. New York, NY: Basic Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; found that most sibling incest fell into one of two categories: "nurturance-oriented incest" and "power-oriented incest". The former is characterized by expressions of affection and love, while the latter is characterized by force and domination.

Rudd and Herzberger&lt;ref&gt;Rudd, J. M., and Herzberger, S. D. (1999). Brother-sister incest/father-daughter incest: A comparison of characteristics and consequences. Child Abuse and Neglect, 23, pp. 915-928.&lt;/ref&gt; report that brothers who committed incest were more likely to use force than fathers who commit incest (64% vs. 53%). Similarly, Cyr and colleagues&lt;ref name="Cyr"&gt;Cyr, M., Wright, J., McDuff, P., &amp; Perron, A. (2002). Intrafamilial sexual abuse: Brother-sister incest does not differ from father-daughter and stepfather-stepdaughter incest. Child Abuse and Neglect, 26, p. 957-973.&lt;/ref&gt; found that about 70% of sibling incest involved sexual penetration, substantially higher than other forms of incest. Bass and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Bass, L., Taylor, B., Kunutson-Martin, C. and Huenergardt, D. (2006) [http://proquest.umi.com/pqdlink?Ver=1&amp;Exp=01-06-2016&amp;FMT=7&amp;DID=1008319951&amp;RQT=309&amp;attempt=1&amp;cfc=1 Making Sense of Abuse: Case Studies in Sibling Incest]. [[Contemporary Family Therapy]], Vol 28, no 1, pp 87-109&lt;/ref&gt; write that "sibling [[incest]] occurs at a frequency that rivals and may even exceed other forms of incest," yet only 11% of studies into child sex abuse examined sibling perpetrators. Rayment and Owen&lt;ref&gt;S. Rayment and N Owen. (1999) [http://www.sasian.org/pdf/owen.pdf WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHERE SIBLING INCEST HAS OCCURRED: THE DYNAMICS, DILEMMAS AND PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS]. Paper presented at the Children and Crime: Victims and Offenders Conference convened by the Australian Institute of Criminology and held in Brisbane, 17–18 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt; report that "[in comparison of] the offending patterns of sibling offenders with other teenage sex offenders [...] Sibling abusers admitted to more sexual offences, had a longer offending history and a majority engaged in more intrusive sexual behaviour than other adolescent sex offenders. The sibling perpetrator has more access to the victim and exists within a structure of silence and guilt." A survey of eight hundred college students reported by [[David Finkelhor]] in ''Journal of Marriage and Family Counseling'' found that fifteen percent of females and ten percent of males had been sexually abused by a sibling.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelhor, D. (1978). Psychological, cultural, and family factors in incest and family sexual abuse. ''Journal of Marriage and Family Counseling'', 4, 41-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relational abuse ===
Relational abuse includes gossiping, humiliating in front of others, preventing socialization with desired groups. It is challenging to identify and calculate prevalence rates because it is normally done indirectly so the perpetrator is unknown to the victim. Additionally, an apparently good sibling relationship, with no physical or emotional direct aggression, may hide this type of abuse. Likewise, physical and emotional abuse are more notorious in bad sibling relationships.

==Identifying sibling abuse==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As a rule, parents and society expect fights and aggression among siblings. Because of this, parents often don't see sibling abuse as a problem until serious harm occurs."&lt;ref name="umich" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sibling rivalry]], competition and disagreements are considered a normal component of childhood and adolescence. To identify physical, psychological and relational sibling abuse, practitioners and parents need observe behavior and ask questions about the sibling's relationships that will help them understand if there are characteristics that differentiate aggression from abuse. Sexual sibling abuse requires additional considerations.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Victims may initially deny the existence of any type of abuse but this may be because they haven't realized it yet. Different questions about the prevalence of types of aggression, frequency, intention of harm, magnitude of the aggression and unidirectional dominance help assess the existence of abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Regarding sexual abuse, individuals are less likely to openly talk about it, unlike other forms of abuse such as physical or psychological. For this reason, in addition to ask direct questions about sibling sexual abuse, practitioners and parents must look out for behaviors that may indicate the presence of sexual abuse. Another challenge comes when differentiating between sexual abuse and adequate sexual behavior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The biggest difference relies in that incest happens with the consensus of both siblings while sexual abuse does not. A victim may not be aware that he/she did not consent because of innocence or lack of understanding of what was happening. The latter generally happens to children who are too young to understand sexual implications and boundaries.

Weihe&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; suggests that four criteria should be used to determine if questionable behavior is rivalry or abusive. First, one must determine if the questionable behavior is age appropriate, since children use different conflict-resolution tactics during various developmental stages. Second, one must determine if the behavior is an isolated incident or part of an enduring pattern: abuse is, by definition, a long-term pattern rather than occasional disagreements. Third, one must determine if there is an "aspect of [[victimization]]" to the behavior: rivalry tends to be incident-specific, reciprocal and obvious to others, while abuse is characterized by secrecy and an imbalance of power. Fourth, one must determine the goal of the questionable behavior: the goal of abuse tends to be embarrassment or domination of the victim.

==Risk factors==
There are several risk factors associated with sibling abuse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sibling Aggression: Assessment and Treatment|last=Caspi|first=Jonathan|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=14–19, 223–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be categorized into family system, parenting behavior, individual, and other risk factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Family System ===
This category of risk factors associated with sibling abuse looks at the family system as a whole. It includes negative and conflictual parent-child relationships,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman, Kiecolt, &amp; Edwards|first=|date=2005|title=Physical violence between siblings: a theoretical and empirical analysis|url=|journal=Journal of Family Issues|volume=2698)|pages=185–200|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; parent hostility toward a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams, Conger, &amp; Blozis|first=|date=2007|title=The development of interpersonal aggression during adolescence: the importance of parents, siblings, and family economics|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=78(50|pages=1526–1542|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[spousal abuse]], partner conflict, marital conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haj-Yahia &amp; Dawud-Noursi|first=|date=1998|title=Predicting the use of different conflict tactics among Arab siblings in Israel: a study based on social learning theory|url=|journal=Journal of Family Violence|volume=13|pages=81–103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intrafamily violence and crime and violence outside the family in Physical violence in American families: Risk factors and adaptations to violence in 8,145 families|last=Hotaling, Straus, &amp; Lincoln (Straus &amp; Gelles Eds.)|first=|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=431–470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stocker &amp; Youngblade|first=|date=1999|title=Marital conflict and parental hostility: links with children's sibling and peer relationships|url=|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|volume=13 |issue=4|pages=598–609|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; mother's marital dissatisfaction and negative emotional expressiveness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stocker, Ahmed, &amp; Stall|first=|date=1997|title=Marital satisfaction and maternal emotional expressiveness: links with children's sibling relationships|url=|journal=Social Development|volume=6 |issue=3|pages=373–385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; maternal self-criticism,&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia, Shaw, Winslow, &amp; Yaggi|first=|date=2000|title=Destructive sibling conflict and the development of conduct problems in young boys|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=36 |issue=1|pages=44–53|via=|pmid=10645743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacKinnon-Lewis, Starnes, Volling &amp; Johnson|first=|date=1997|title=Perceptions of parenting as predictors of boys' sibling and peer relations|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=33|pages=1024–1031|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volling &amp; Belsky|first=|date=1992|title=The contribution of mother-child and father-child relationships to the quality of sibling interaction: a longitudinal study|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=63 |issue=5|pages=1209–1222|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; financial stress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=|date=2001|title=Physical aggression and sexual behavior among siblings: a retrospective study|url=|journal=Journal of Family Violence|volume=16 |issue=3|pages=255–268|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams, Conger, &amp; Blozis|first=|date=2007|title=The development of interpersonal aggression during adolescence: the importance of parents, siblings, and family economics|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=78 |issue=5|pages=1526–1542|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; low family cohesion, family disorganization and household chaos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brody, Stoneman, &amp; McCoy|first=|date=1994|title=Forecasting sibling relationships in early adolescence from child temperaments and family processes in middle childhood|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=65|pages=771–784|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eriksen &amp; Jensen|first=|date=2006|title=All in the family?

=== Parenting behavior ===

=== Individual ===
This category of risk factors associated with sibling abuse considers individual traits of the offender child and the victim child. For offender children, known individual risk factors include lack of empathy for victims,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silverman|first=|date=1999|title=Sibling violence: its relation to childhood observation of caretaker violence and factors derived from the brother-sister questionnaire|url=|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: the Sciences and Engineering|volume=60(5-B)|pages=2368|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; aggressive temperament,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munn &amp; Dunn|first=|date=1988|title=Temperament and the developing relationship between siblings|url=|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|volume=12|pages=433–451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; lower or higher self-esteem than peers,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson, Henggeler, Harris, Cigrang, Schinkel, Rodrigue, et al.|first=|date=1992|title=Contributions of sibling relations to the adaptation of youths with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus|url=|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=60 |issue=1|pages=104–112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; unmet personal needs for physical contact in emotion-deprived environments,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The sibling bond|last=Bank &amp; Kahn|first=|publisher=Basic Books|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; experience of victimization, including by siblings,&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caffaro &amp; Conn-Caffaro|first=|date=2005|title=Treating sibling abuse families|url=|journal=Aggression and violent behavior|volume=10|pages=604–623|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; sibling care taking of younger brothers and sisters,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baum|first=|date=1998|title=Correlates of sibling violence|url=|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: the Sciences and Engineering|volume=58(11-A)|pages=4442|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=|date=1984|title=Child abuse by siblings|url=|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=8|pages=311–317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and boredom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prochaska &amp; Prochaska|first=|date=1985|title=Children's views of the causes and "cures" of sibling rivalry|url=|journal=Child Welfare|volume=64 |issue=4|pages=427–433|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For victim children, a known risk factor is psychological distress such as anger, depression, and anxiety from violence victimization by siblings (linked to re-victimization).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuevas, Finkelhor, Clifford, Ormrod, &amp; Turner|first=|date=2010|title=Psychological distress as a risk factor for re-victimization in children|url=|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=34 |issue=4|pages=235–243|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuner, Finkelhor, &amp; Ormrod|first=|date=2010|title=Poly-victimization in a national sample of children and youth|url=|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=38 |issue=3|pages=323–330|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other risk factors ===
Several other risk factors are associated with sibling abuse. One is birth order and age spacing.

Sociocultural background also factors into sibling abuse. Some known sociocultural background risk factors include cultural practices such as primogeniture and patriarchy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman &amp; Edwards|first=|date=2004|title=An integrated theoretical model of sibling violence and abuse|url=|journal=Journal of Family Violence|volume=19 |issue=3|pages=185–200|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; disability of a sibling,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Linares|first=|date=2006|title=An understudied form of intra-family violence: sibling-to-sibling aggression among foster children|url=|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=11|pages=95–109|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; family economic pressure,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; excessive sibling caregiving,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and ethnic/cultural background in which sibling aggression is widely condoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rapoza, Cook, Zaveri, &amp; Malley-Morrison|first=|date=2010|title=Ethnic perspectives on sibling abuse in the United States|url=|journal=Journal of Family Issues|volume=31 |issue=6|pages=808–829|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Parental alcoholism,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; parental support of child aggression,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and social glorification of violence in the media&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; have also been associated with sibling abuse.

For researchers, giving attention to sibling relationships&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; and developing prevention programs in collaboration with practitioners&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; are potential prevention methods for sibling abuse. For the culture at large, Caspi proposes not accepting sibling aggression as normal,&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; public awareness and educational campaigns,&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; and making sibling aggression visible.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

== Treatment of sibling abuse ==
John V. Caffaro outlines clinical best practices for treatment of sibling abuse in ''Sibling Abuse Trauma: Assessment and Intervention Strategies for Children, Families, and Adults'' (2014).&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sibling Abuse Trauma: Assessment and Intervention Strategies for Children, Families, and Adults|last=Caffaro|first=John|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=164–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include “extra precautions to ensure the victim's safety, such as locks on doors, increased adult supervision, and cooperation of parents, extended family members, and the community”, “individual treatment for the victim and the offender, often with different clinicians possessing expertise in child abuse trauma”, and “no conjoint sibling or family meetings with the offender until he or she has accepted full responsibility for the abuse and until the therapist is satisfied that the family can and will protect the victim from further abuse”.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

== Media portrayals ==
An important plot point within the traditional [[fairy tale]] of [[Cinderella]] is the [[eponymous]] main-character's cruel treatment at the hands of her stepsisters (with their mother's implicit approval).

The 1991 made-for-TV movie "My Son, Johnny" is a rare fictionalized portrayal of sibling abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102495/ IMDB page]&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Corin Nemec]] as a teenager victimized by his older brother, played by [[Rick Schroder]]. The film was inspired by the real-life case of Philadelphia fifteen-year-old Michael Lombardo, tried and acquitted for the 1985 killing of his nineteen-year-old brother, Francis "Frankie" Lombardo, who had battered and abused him for years.&lt;!--plot summary &amp; further info on IMBD page--&gt;

British soap opera, ''[[Brookside]]'', ran a controversial storyline in 1996, featuring incest between siblings [[List of Brookside characters|Nat and Georgia Simpson]] that resulted in a pregnancy, which was followed by an [[Abortion in the U.K.|abortion]]. The sympathetic portrayal of the situation attracted criticism from commentators such as [[Peter Hitchens]] (in his book ''[[The Abolition of Britain]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hitchens, Peter|title=The Abolition of Britain |publisher=Quartet Books; New edition (1 April 2000)|year=2000|isbn=0-7043-8140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian animated series ''[[Total Drama Pahkitew Island]]'', the second half of the fifth season of ''[[Total Drama]]'', brings in Amy and Samey, the show's first twin sibling pair. Amy is the mean twin, while Samey (who prefers to be "Sammy") is the nice twin who has to deal with Amy's abuse towards her. Amy even attempts to kill Samey, but she survives by having a parachute. Later, a contestant bonds with Samey and gives her the courage to stand up to Amy and get her eliminated.

== Notable examples ==
[[Cheyenne Brando]], the daughter of the legendary actor [[Marlon Brando]], confessed that her brother [[Christian Brando|Christian]] seemed to be in love with her and that he was jealous of her boyfriend Dag Drollet; that is why Christian killed him in 1990, according to Cheyenne. Christian stated during his trial that Cheyenne told him that Dag was abusive to her, that he wanted to protect her and that he never meant to kill Dag; it was a terrible accident. Christian was sentenced to ten years in jail in 1991 and Cheyenne committed suicide in 1995. Cheyenne was abusive toward her two sisters, Maimiti and Raiatua, as well as with [[Marlon Brando]], and Tarita, her parents, particularly her mother. [[Tarita Teriipaia]] wrote a book in 2005, which revealed Cheyenne terrorized her own family when she began to suffer from [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilcinema.canalblog.com/archives/2012/11/30/25703882.html|title=1990-2004: "Brando's Affair", Family drama and Death of Marlon.

The French serial killer [[Guy Georges]] physically abused his adoptive elder sisters when he was 14, nearly killing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grands.criminels.free.fr/guygeorges.html|title=Guy Georges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian actor [[Hugh Jackman]] opened up the physical and verbal abuse by his older brother in 2013.

'''Solitary confinement''' is a form of [[imprisonment]] distinguished by living in single cells with little or no contact to other inmates, strict measures to control [[contraband]], and the use of additional security measures and equipment. It is specifically designed for disruptive inmates that are security risks to other inmates, the prison staff, or the prison itself. It is mostly employed for violations of discipline, such as [[murder]], [[hostage-taking]], [[deadly assault]], and [[riot]]ing. However, it is also used as a measure of protection for inmates, whose safety is threatened by other inmates. Prison authorities consider solitary confinement an administrative placement measure, not a punishment.

Solitary confinement is colloquially referred to in [[American English]] as "the hotbox", "the hole", "AdSeg" (administrative segregation), the "SHU" (pronounced "shoe"), an acronym for "Special Housing Unit" or "Security Housing Unit"; in [[Australian English]] as "the Slot" or "the Pound"; in [[British English]] as "the block", "The Segregation Unit", or "the cooler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/5559761/Army-captain-was-real-life-Cooler-King-from-The-Great-Escape.html |title=Army captain was real life 'Cooler King' from The Great Escape |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |author=&lt;!--no by-line--&gt; |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/3517476.stm |title=Cooler King recalls Great Escape |work=[[BBC News]] |author=&lt;!--no by-line--&gt; |date=16 March 2004 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called prison "'segregation' and 'restrictive housing.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Solitary confinement has received severe criticism for having detrimental psychological effects&lt;ref name="arrigo" /&gt; and, to some and in some cases, constituting [[torture]].&lt;ref name="gawande9" /&gt; According to a 2017 review study, "a robust scientific literature has established the negative psychological effects of solitary confinement", leading to "an emerging consensus among correctional as well as professional, mental health, legal, and human rights organizations to drastically limit the use of solitary confinement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haney|first=Craig|date=2017-11-03|title=Restricting the Use of Solitary Confinement|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092326|journal=Annual Review of Criminology|doi=10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092326|issn=2572-4568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical controversy ==

Research surrounding the possible psychological and physiological effects of solitary confinement dates back to the 1830s. When the new prison discipline of separate confinement was introduced at the [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in Philadelphia in 1829, commentators attributed the high rates of mental breakdown to the system of isolating prisoners in their cells. Charles Dickens, who visited the Philadelphia Penitentiary during his travels to America, described the "slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Notes|last=Dickens|first=Charles|publisher=Chapman and Hall|year=1842|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison records from the Denmark institute in 1870 to 1920 indicate that staff noticed inmates were exhibiting signs of mental illnesses while in isolation, revealing that the persistent problem has been around for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter Scharff |last=Smith |title='Degenerate Criminals': Mental Health and Psychiatric Studies of Danish Prisoners in Solitary Confinement, 1870–1920 |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |date=August 2008 |volume=35 |number=8 |pages=1048–1064 |doi=10.1177/0093854808318782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first comment by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] about solitary confinement's effect on prisoner mental status was made in 1890 (In re Medley 134 U.S. 160).&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/In_re_Medley/Opinion_of_the_Court&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; In it the court found that the use of solitary confinement produced reduced mental and physical capabilities.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; The use of solitary confinement in prisons was first introduced to regulate unruly prisoners and keep them away from the rest of the prison society (Haney, Craig; Lynch, Mona). However, solitary confinement has been linked to several developments of mental disorders, one of which being [[Ganser syndrome]]. A man developed Ganser syndrome after being held in solitary confinement for a long term sentence; however, that development is seen as rare and is unlikely in most cases.

The effects of solitary confinement on mental health are undeniable. According to the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry online, solitary confinement can cause an array of mental disorders, as well as provoke an already existing mental disorder in a prisoner, causing more trauma and symptoms. Solitary confinement is a form of imprisonment practiced worldwide, but no positive effects of the punishment have been proven (Jaapl). Nonetheless, penal confinement involving solitude has been described as having a beneficent effect on [[anthrophobes]].{{citation needed|reason=Cannot find source – Murchinson was 13 in 1900 and JGP didn't exist until 1924|date=June 2016}} &lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murchison |first1=Carl |title=The Journal of Genetic Psychology |date=1900 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Use ==
The practice is used when a prisoner is considered dangerous to themselves or to others, is suspected of organizing or being engaged in illegal activities outside of the prison, or, as in the case of a prisoner such as a [[pedophilia|pedophile]] or [[witness]], is at a high risk of being harmed by another inmate or inmates. The latter example is a form of [[protective custody]]. Solitary confinement is also the norm in [[supermax prison]]s where prisoners who are deemed dangerous or of high risk are held. It may be hard to determine the number of people currently being held in solitary confinement because some prisons have a hard time defining it. However, it is estimated that 80,000 to 100,000 people are currently in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Effects and access to care ===
The effects of solitary confinement on juveniles can be highly detrimental to their growth.

Many interviews described how their placement in solitary confinement exacerbated the stresses of being in jail or prison. Many spoke of harming themselves with staples or razors, having hallucinations, losing touch with reality, and having thoughts of or attempting suicide – all this while having very limited access to health care.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|29–35}}

Juveniles in solitary confinement are routinely denied access to treatment, services, and programming required to meet their medical, psychological, developmental, social, and rehabilitative needs.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|3,92}}  The ACLU and the Human Rights Watch have made recommendations at both a State and Federal level regarding their lack of access to medical services etc.

As well as severe and damaging psychological effects, solitary confinement manifests physiologically as well. Solitary confinement has been reported to cause [[hypertension]], [[headaches]] and [[migraines]], profuse sweating, [[dizziness]], and [[heart palpitations]]. Many inmates also experience extreme weight loss due to digestion complications and abdominal pain. Many of these symptoms are due to the intense anxiety and sensory deprivation. Inmates can also experience neck and back pain and muscle stiffness due to long periods of little to no physical activity. These symptoms often worsen with repeated visit to solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy Corcoran|first1=Mary|title=Effects of Solitary Confinement on the Well Being of Prison Inmates|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2015/spring/corcoran|website=NYU Steinhardt Department of Applied Psychology|publisher=NYU Steinhardt|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legality ===
The [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on Torture and other UN bodies have stated that the solitary confinement (physical and social isolation of 22–24 hours per day for 1 day or more) of young people under age 18, for any duration, constitutes cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

==== Human rights ====
In the UK, the state has a duty to “set the highest standards of care” when it limits the liberties of children.&lt;ref name=alex2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crook |first=Frances |title=Where Is Child Protection in Penal Custody? |date=September 2006 |journal=Criminal Behavior &amp; Mental Health |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=137–141 |doi=10.1002/cbm.627 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbm.627/abstract |subscription=yes |access-date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe, Frances Crook included, that incarceration and solitary confinement are the harshest forms of possible punishments and “should only be taken as a last resort.” &lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; Additionally, because children are still mentally developing, incarceration should not encourage them to commit more violent crimes.&lt;ref name= alex2 /&gt;

==== Effects ====
The [[penal system]] has been cited as failing to protect juveniles in custody.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; In the UK, “twenty-nine children have died in penal custody in 1990. Some 41% of the children in custody were officially designated as being vulnerable.”&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; This is attributed to the fact that isolation and physical restraint are being used as the first response to punish them for simple rule infractions.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; Moreover, Frances Crook argues that these punitive policies not only violate their basic rights, but also leave the children mentally unstable and left with illnesses that are often ignored.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; Overall, the solitary confinement of youth is considered to be counterproductive because the “restrictive environment…and intense regulation of children” aggravates them, instead of addressing the issue of rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt;

===History in the United States===
The [[penal system]] in the United States developed under two separate systems known as the [[Auburn system]] and [[Separate system|Pennsylvania system]].&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; The current system of solitary confinement was derived originally from the Pennsylvania model which was characterized by "isolation and seclusion." &lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Evidence has shown that [[Quakers]] and [[Calvinists]] supported solitary confinement as an alternative form of punishment. At the time it was meant to provide a prisoner with solitude “to reflect on his misdeeds” and restore his relationship with God.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griest|first=Stephanie Elizondo|title=The Torture of Solitary Confinement|url=http://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/spring-2012-the-age-of-connection/the-torture-of-solitary/|date=Spring 2012|journal=[[The Wilson Quarterly]]|volume=36|issue=2|pages=22–29|access-date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitary confinement was intended as an alternative to public floggings which were common at the time. In 1818, New York reformer and Friend, [[Thomas Eddy]], lobbied for [[Penal labour|inmate labor]] and solitary confinement in place of other forms of punishment such as [[hanging]]. Shortly after, New York decided to include solitary confinement and inmate labor into their penal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Graber|title='When Friends Had the Management It Was Entirely Different': Quakers and Calvinists in the Making of New York Prison Discipline|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/254531|journal=Quaker History|date=Fall 2008|volume=97|number=2|pages=19–40|doi=10.1353/qkh.0.0011|subscription=yes|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|US Federal Prison system]], solitary confinement is known as the Special Housing Unit (SHU),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/mcr/MCR_visit_hours.pdf Institution Supplement – Visiting Regulations, USP McCreary] (from the Bureau of Prisons, US Department of Justice website.

California's prison system also uses the abbreviation SHU, but it stands for Security Housing Units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Facilities_Locator/COR.html Visitors, State Prison, Corcoran (CSP-COR)], from the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] website. (Retrieved 12 June 2016.)&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, it is known as the Special Management Unit (SMU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solitarywatch.com/2011/05/22/voices-from-solitary-an-insane-asylum-disguised-as-an-smu/ |title=Voices from Solitary: An Insane Asylum Disguised As an SMU |publisher=[[Solitary Watch]] |date=22 May 2011 |first1=James|last1=Ridgeway |first2=Jean|last2=Casella}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current estimates of the number of inmates held in solitary confinement are difficult to determine, though generally the minimum held at any given time has been determined to be 20,000, with estimates as high as 80,000.&lt;ref name="naday"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naday|first1=Alexandra|last2=Freilich|first2=Joshua|last3=Mellow|first3=Jeff|title=The Elusive Data on Supermax Confinement|url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/88/1/69|journal=[[The Prison Journal]]|volume=88|number=1|date=March 2008|pages=69–93|doi=10.1177/0032885507310978|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Juveniles ===
Juveniles are held in solitary confinement in jails and prisons across the United States, often for days, weeks, months, or even years in order to punish, protect, house, or treat some of the youth held there.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|2}} There is significant controversy surrounding the use of solitary confinement in cases of juveniles.

===Troubled Teen Industry===
The Troubled Teen Industry is a loosely connected series of for-profit [[wilderness therapy]] programs, boot camps, [[therapeutic boarding schools]], and [[residential treatment centers]].  These facilities house youth after parents sign away custody of their children.  These children can be sent to these facilities for any reason, without committing a crime, without a trial, and without legal representation.  Solitary confinement is used widely in these programs, including wilderness programs, where children are left alone for weeks in the wilderness.  Some programs place children in solitary rooms.  Other times, "code silence," or "comm block," is used, which means that the child is not allowed to speak, and the other inmates must ignore them and pretend they do not exist.  This practice was documented at [[Island View Residential Treatment Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://testkitchen.huffingtonpost.com/island-view/|title=The Troubled-Teen Industry Has Been A Disaster For Decades. It's Still Not Fixed.|website=The Troubled-Teen Industry Has Been A Disaster For Decades. And It's Still Not Fixed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychiatric hospitals===
Patients in psychiatric hospitals are often put into solitary confinement, usually for 24 hours at a time, when staff members determine that they are a danger to themselves or others.

===Federal prisons ===
The use of SHUs within the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] is regulated under {{CodeFedReg|28|541}}. When placed in the SHU, prisoners are either in "administrative detention status", a non-punitive status which removes prisoners from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of correctional facilities, or protect the public, or "disciplinary segregation status", a punitive status imposed only by a Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO) as a sanction for committing prohibited acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscfr|28|541|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 100 prohibited acts, all of which may result in solitary confinement, including unauthorized physical contact such as kissing, using abusive or obscene language, feigning illness, [[Right to petition in the United States|circulating a petition]], insolence towards a staff member, engaging in or encouraging a group [[demonstration (protest)|demonstration or protest]], and participating in or encouraging a [[strike action|labor strike]] (also known as a [[prison strike]]), gang activity, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscfr|28|541|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State prisons and municipal jails ===

He has been in SHU for over 20 years after violent incidents directed at prison staff.

Solitary confinement is becoming more and more popular throughout the U.S. with some "supermax" prisons have nothing but solitary confinement cells. "Some people are held in solitary confinement in special "supermax" prisons, such as California's Pelican Bay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5584254|title=At Pelican Bay Prison, a Life in Solitary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia's Red Onion, and the federal government's ADX in Florence, Colorado. At least 44 states&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urban.org/uploadedPDF/411326_supermax_prisons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the federal system now have supermax prisons, which are generally composed solely of solitary confinement cells. Other prisoners live in SHUs, RHUs, and IMUs within ordinary prisons, and even inside local jails."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== California ====
When California opened its first "adjustment center", the goal was to return prisoners to the mainline prison population and ultimately to a society through an enrichment program of psychological and social services.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haney|first1=Craig |last2=Lynch|first2=Mona |title=Regulating Prisons of the Future: A Psychological Analysis of Supermax and Solitary Confinement |journal=[[New York University School of Law|NYU]] Rev. Law &amp; Social Change |year=1997 |volume=23 |pages=478–558 |url=http://www.probono.net/prisoners/stopsol-reports/416694.Regulating_Prisons_of_the_Future |access-date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the plan was never executed. In 1983, [[George Deukmejian]] was elected as the California governor and during his time, he formed what was then the state's newest prison – a massive, windowless “security housing unit” (SHU). SHU was intended to segregate over a thousand prisoners from the rest of the prison system through isolation. Deukmejian boasted that the [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] was a "state-of-the-art prison that will serve as a model for the rest of the nation...".&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt;

The prisoners are kept confined to their cells almost twenty-three hours a day and all forms of human contact through refined locking and monitoring systems are minimized. Pelican Bay SHU was one of the first visible “super-maximum security” facilities and thus it attracted lots of media attention.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt; Those opposing the conditions of California's “supermax” resulted in the federal court criticizing certain features of the prison but left the basic regimen of segregation and isolation largely intact.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt;

One of the policies of supermax confinement among other policies is designed to increase punishment by removing gang members from the mainline population and subject them to solitary confinement, whether it is for a set amount of time or an indefinite duration. In a recent study, it noted that the California Department of corrections has implemented ways to fix their alleged gang problem, such as using ‘confidential informants,’ segregating gang members, intercepting gang communications, setting up task forces to monitor and track gang members, locking up gang leaders in high security prisons, and ‘locking down’ entire institutions.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt;

These facilities, supermax prisons, were originally designed to contain and control the worst criminals and those who did not adhere to the rules of prisons, AKA "the worst of the worst".&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; As of 2001, the count of inmates in administrative segregation in California was 5,982 representing an 80.2% change over time, but this number is not quite correct due to deficient files provided.&lt;ref name="naday" /&gt; Increasingly, the practice of using solitary confinement long term, instead of the intended three-month period, in the supermax prisons as inmate management has become the norm.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; The selected inmates, who wear jumpsuits that differentiate them from the general population, will spend around 23 hours a day alone in a cell where they are offered very little and fully monitored as is procedure at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] which is one of the largest supermax prisons in the United States.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; In order to be sent to Pelican Bay, the inmate has either committed murder, assault, riots, threatening staff or fellow inmates, and even gang affiliation which must be validated by the prison staff.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt;

There are 22 SHU units of Pelican Bay which include 132 eight-cell pods that are lit by heavy Plexiglass skylights enclosed by steel cell doors.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; The inmates are provided with a concrete slab as a bed, a toilet, small shelf, and a concrete stool with no windows in an 80 sq. foot space.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; SHU inmates are allotted for an hour and a half of exercise every day where they are taken to a 26 by 20 foot area surrounded by 20 foot high cement walls.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; Only one prisoner from each pod can move at a time and will be placed in waist restraints for any medical/dental appointments to assist in the examination process and may also have leg restraints placed on them before they are able to leave the unit depending on the purpose of the appointment.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt;

In [[San Quentin State Prison]], the violence rates were still high in the 1980s despite the similar lockdowns and procedures of Pelican Bay because these prisoners use the small windows out of lockdown to either harm themselves or others.&lt;ref name="kupers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kupers |first=Terry A. |title=What To Do With the Survivors? Coping With the Long-Term Effects of Isolated Confinement |journal=[[Criminal Justice and Behavior]] |volume=35 |number=8 |date=August 2008 |pages=1005–1016 |doi=10.1177/0093854808318591 |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/35/8/1005 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically will try not to harm themselves while in the psychiatric hospital ward either, but they will plan out while in lockdown until they can see their plan through.&lt;ref name="kupers" /&gt; However even as they near their release dates, they are moved to “prerelease programs” out of the SHU which are successful with some prisoners, but it causes most others to become even more uncontrollable and unpredictable due to their mental states that aren’t properly cared for or screened.&lt;ref name="kupers" /&gt;

In May 2012, California's prison system faced a lawsuit from the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] and a group of California attorneys for the use of long terms of solitary confinement, some lasting for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Devereaux|first=Ryan |title=Prisoners challenge legality of solitary confinement lasting more than a decade |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/31/california-prison-lawsuit-solitary-confinement |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=31 May 2012 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, easing some conditions for inmates in near-solitary confinement in California prisons has died in the state legislature. The bill was among others supposed to reform Security Housing Units rules to allow the inmates to keep photographs and make a phone call after three months of good behavior was listed as inactive on Friday after a decision on Thursday evening by state Senator Loni Hancock to drop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bernstein|first=Sharon |title=Bill to reform California's near-solitary prison units dies |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/30/us-usa-california-prisons-idUSKBN0GU01D20140830 |date=30 August 2014 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Maryland ====

In 2012, a report was conducted by the [[Vera Institute of Justice]] revealed that Maryland's use of restricted housing was twice the national average (8.5% versus an average of 4%).&lt;ref&gt;[https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/interfaithaction/pages/13/attachments/original/1412026936/VERA_study_-_Review_of_MD_Use_of_Segregation_in_Adult_Prisons.pdf?1412026936 Vera Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation was introduced in &lt;ref name="2014 bill"&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-03-31/news/bs-ed-solitary-confinement-20140330_1_solitary-confinement-discipline-inmates-prisoners 2014 bill]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

According to a psychiatrist, Dr. Annette Hanson's article,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shrink-rap-today/201108/solitary-confinement-rumor-and-reality&lt;/ref&gt;  who works with Maryland's Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), prolonged segregation does not provide deleterious effects on inmates. DPSCS also asserted that solitary confinement doesn't exist in their institutions.&lt;ref name="2014 bill"/&gt;

==== New York ====
Since the 1980s, the [[New York City Department of Correction]] has increased the use of segregation as a discipline and management tool. In effect, segregation is a secondary sentence imposed by the correctional facility, which is usually unrelated to the conviction for which the person is incarcerated.&lt;ref name="browne2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Browne|first1=Angela |last2=Cambier|first2=Alissa |last3=Agha|first3=Suzanne |title=Prisons Within Prisons: The Use of Segregation in the United States |journal=[[Federal Sentencing Reporter]] |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=October 2011 &lt;!--Sentencing Within Sentencing--&gt; |pages=46–49 |doi=10.1525/fsr.2011.24.1.46 |url=http://www.vera.org/pubs/prisons-within-prisons-segregation |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are high rates of use of solitary confinement in [[New York (state)|New York]] when compared to other U.S. states.  Within the New York prison system, solitary confinement is frequently imposed for nonviolent, “trivial prisoner offenses.” Usually the common misconception is that solitary confinement is a punishment of last resort, reserved for inmates who present a threat of violence or escape.&lt;ref name=casella&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casella|first1=Jean |last2=Ridgeway|first2=James |title=New York's Black Sites |date=11 July 2012 |journal=[[The Nation]] |volume=295 |issue=5 |pages=18–24 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/new-yorks-black-sites/ |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates that are released from solitary confinement go through a “transitional unit” but failure in the program results in their return to solitary confinement.  Overall, most of the inmates fail and return to solitary confinement.&lt;ref name="okeefe2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Keefe |first=Maureen L. |title=Administrative Segregation from within: A Corrections Perspective |journal=[[The Prison Journal]] |volume=88 |issue=1 |date=March 2008 |pages=123–143 |doi=10.1177/0032885507310999 |url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/88/1/123.abstract |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York has the highest rate of “disciplinary segregation” in the country, making solitary confinement a regular every day action among the prison. Although prisons nationwide have decreased use of solitary confinement, the [[New York City Department of Correction]] expanded its capacity by 27 percent in 2011 and another 44 percent in 2012, according to the NYC Jails Action Coalition. Although the DOC housed 1,000 more inmates in 1990 than it does today, its jails have more solitary cells now. Due to this the city is topping the charts of municipalities with a high rate of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=bartlett /&gt; On any given day, there are about 4,500 men, women, and children in some form of isolated confinement in New York State prisons. This is not including New York City's jails, which are run under a separate system, where those in solitary confinement reach close to 1,000 or more.&lt;ref name="casella"/&gt;

A new bill was introduced by Councilman [[Danny Dromm]] would require the [[Department of Correction]] to post a monthly report on its website about punitive segregation. It would also require data on the number of people in punitive segregation, the length of time in this setting, the nature of the infractions, age, mental health, if they were prescribed medication or moved to a hospital, violence against others and inmate requests.&lt;ref name=bartlett /&gt; Many are supportive of this bill with the goal being to make jail facilities safer for inmates and correction officers.Individuals who are released and experience solitary confinement go back into their communities and reoffend at higher rates than general population prisoners causing them to land back into prison.  Policy changes that will reduce the use and long-term impact of segregation will benefit not only the staff and prisoners in these units but also ultimately the well-being of facilities, systems, and the community.&lt;ref name="browne2011"/&gt;  Councilman Dromm also issued a separate resolution seeking to end the practice of the time owed. For example, an inmate, because of good behavior or other reasons, might only have served 100 of his or her 180-day sentence in solitary and then was released. A few years or even decades later the person is rearrested. Under current rules he or she must complete those unserved 80 days in solitary. This resolution however is only a request since the Council does not have the authority to make the [[Department of Correction]] adhere.&lt;ref name=bartlett&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bartlett |first=Josey  |title=Bill aims to reduce solitary confinement |url=http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/bill-aims-to-reduce-solitary-confinement/article_45a63073-4949-51ee-a404-72d7816288c0.html |date=25 April 2013 |work=Queens Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== New York City: Rikers Island =====
The [[New York City Department of Correction]]s reported that in fiscal year 2012 more than 14.4 percent of all adolescents detained at [[Rikers Island]] between the ages of 16 and 18 were held in at least one period of solitary confinement while detained.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|131–132}} The average length of time young people spent in solitary confinement at Rikers Island was 43 days. More than 48 percent of adolescents at this institution have diagnosed mental health problems.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|132}} As violence associated with the [[crack epidemic]] became increasingly common, new measures were taken. The Red ID card system, instituted in the early 1990s, was a way of identifying inmates with histories of inciting riots, cuttings, stabbings, and other dangerous behaviors. It almost always meant the convict had spent time in a notorious ward designated for punitive confinement called "The Bing" (HDM 5 Block). Prisoners  Pavle Stanimirović, James Rosado, Tyrone Green, Pedro Hernandez, [[Willie Bosket]], Hector Rivera, [[Ángel Nieves Díaz|Ángel Díaz]], John Maldonado and Dominick Pollatti all spent time in "The Bing."

The New York City Department of Correction ended punitive segregation for adolescents in December 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/566-14/de-blasio-administration-ends-use-punitive-segregation-adolescent-inmates-rikers-island#/0|title=De Blasio Administration Ends Use of Punitive Segregation for Adolescent Inmates on Rikers Island|date=17 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended punitive segregation for young adults, 18 to 21, in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/10/officially-ponte-says-rikers-solitary-confinement-banned-for-young-adults-106128|title=Ponte says solitary confinement of young inmates now officially banned at Rikers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly due to the case of [[Kalief Browder]].

==Europe==
The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has three labels for solitary confinement: [[complete sensory isolation]], [[total social isolation]] and [[relative social isolation]].&lt;ref name="Verdictp3"&gt;{{cite report |title=Oslo District Court declaratory judgement for breach of the ECHR art. 3 &amp; 8; Anders Behring Breivik plaintiff |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/f/domisakenomsoningsforhold15107496tviotirabbstaten.pdf |date=20 April 2016 |format=PDF |access-date=25 April 2016 |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429020641/http://www.dagbladet.no/f/domisakenomsoningsforhold15107496tviotirabbstaten.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], or CPT, defines solitary confinement as "whenever a prisoner is ordered to be held separately from other prisoners, for example, as a result of court decision, as a disciplinary sanction imposed within the prison system, as a preventative administrative measure or for the protection of the prisoner concerned".&lt;ref name="Verdictp3"/&gt;

In [[Italy]], a person sentenced to more than one life sentence is required to serve a period of between 6 months to 3 years in solitary confinement.

=== United Kingdom ===
Solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure for prisoners in Europe was largely reduced or eliminated during the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="gawande9"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gawande|first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/30/090330fa_fact_gawande |title=Is long-term solitary confinement torture?|work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, only 40 out of 75,000 inmates held in [[England and Wales]] were placed in solitary confinement cells.&lt;ref name="tapley10"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tapley|first=Lance |title=The Worst of the Worst: Supermax Torture in America |date=1 November 2010 |url=http://www.bostonreview.net/tapley-supermax-torture-in-america.php |publisher=[[Boston Review]] |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secure housing units ==
Officially, the purpose of placing prisoners in secure housing units (SHUs) is to increase control over dangerous inmates. Some hope the SHU encourages prisoners to reflect on their actions. These units are characterized by extreme isolation of prisoners who "are housed in small cells with solid steel doors…for 22 to 23 hours per day."&lt;ref name=arrigo&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arrigo|first1=Bruce A. |last2=Bullock|first2=Jennifer Leslie |title=The Psychological Effects of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners in Supermax Units |date=19 November 2007 &lt;!--published online before print--&gt; |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy &amp; Comparative Criminology |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=622–640 |doi=10.1177/0306624X07309720 |url=http://ijo.sagepub.com/content/52/6/622.abstract |subscription=yes |access-date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates are also deprived of social interaction and denied access to educational or therapeutic programs and health care while being held in SHUs.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
It has been shown that the conditions of these secure housing units have severe mental and psychological effects on prisoners.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Prisoners in SHUs are isolated for long periods of time. Instances of assault and torture against these prisoners in response to trivial things have also been cited.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Social isolation housing, can reduce environmental stimulation, and causes a feeling of loss of control over all aspects of a prisoner's daily life. These environmental stimulations include but aren't limited to hypersensitivity to stimuli, distortions and hallucinations, increased anxiety and nervousness, diminished impulse control, severe and chronic depression, appetite loss and weight loss, heart palpitations, talking to oneself, problems sleeping, nightmares, self-mutilation, difficulties with thinking, concentration, and memory, and lower levels of brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birckhead|first=Tamar|year=2015|title=Children in isolation: the solitary confinement of youth|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/wflr50&amp;div=4&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#|journal=Law Journal Library|volume=|pages=1–80|via=George Mason University Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common justification by officials is that prisoners of certain natures deserve to be punished for the threat that they pose to society.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; This can be attributed to the fear of increasing crime rates and therefore, support the government's effort to enforce harsher forms of punishment.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt;

The most "notorious example of the extreme social isolation found in supermaximum custody units" is the SHU at [[SouthPort]] NYDOCS [[Upstate Correctional Facility]] &amp; [[Pelican Bay State Prison]].&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; From studying conditions at Pelican Bay, researchers argue that long-term social isolation "carries major psychiatric risks." &lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Prisoners are susceptible to developing mental illnesses because they are confined to coffin-like conditions and denied access to basic health services.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Illnesses range from anxiety, clinical depression, and self-mutilation to suicidal thoughts and SHU syndrome.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Yet, it is important to note that the duration of the isolation is the most important factor in determining the effects of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name= arrigo /&gt;

=== Scrutiny ===
[[Supermax prison]]s, large-scale implementations of secure housing units, employ solitary confinement to isolate predatory, disorderly inmates from the rest of the prison community.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Kate |last1=King |first2=Benjamin |last2=Steiner |first3=Stephanie R. |last3=Breach |title=Violence in the Supermax: A Self Fulfilling Prophecy |journal=[[The Prison Journal]] |volume=88 |number=1 |date=March 2008 |pages=144–68. |url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/88/1/144 |doi=10.1177/0032885507311000 |access-date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Bureau of Prisons create special supermax facilities to contain the most aggressive inmates in a protective effort.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Kate King, professor and director of Criminal Justice at [[Murray State University]], Benjamin Steiner, professor of Criminal Justice at the [[University of Cincinnati]], and Stephanie Ritchie Breach, director of the Third District Youth Court, explain how while violence has always been a factor in prison life, the level of aggression is magnified in facilities where all such members of the prison system are concentrated.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; These scholars argue that the violent nature of supermax prisons such as [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] are perpetrated by prison culture itself.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; King, Steiner, and Breach question the effectiveness of these institutions and claim the violent reputation of American prisons stems from this departure from the treatment model.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Supermax prisons are also scrutinized on legal and ethical bases. Scholars Jesenia Pizarro and Vanja Stenius note that the overall constitutionality of these prisons are still quite unclear.&lt;ref name=pizarro2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pizarro|first1=Jesenia |last2=Stenius|first2=Vanja M.

=== Recidivism ===
Shira E. Gordon, a University of Michigan Law Student, argues that solitary confinement leads to an increase in [[recidivism]] and violence. To substantiate this conclusion, she cites two quantitative research based studies that support this nexus and counters those who argue that solitary confinement deters recidivism.&lt;ref name=gordon2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Shira E.|title=Solitary Confinement, Public Safety, and Recidivism|journal=[[University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform|U. Mich. J. Law Reform]]|volume=47|issue=2|year=2014|pages=495–528|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/mjlr/vol47/iss2/6/|access-date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Mears and William Bales “compared recidivism rates by matching…prisoners who were incarcerated in solitary confinement with prisoners who had been in the general prison population.”&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; They found that "24.2 percent of the prisoners held in solitary confinement were reconvicted of a violent crime compared to 20.5 percent of prisoners held in population."&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; And this behavior may be attributed to the mental illnesses prisoners may develop, as well as the dehumanizing treatment they are subject to.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Psychiatric ===
According to a March 2014 article in ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', “Inmates in jails and prisons attempt to harm themselves in many ways, resulting in outcomes ranging from trivial to fatal.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaba|first1=Fatos |last2=Lewis|first2=Andrea |last3=Sarah|first3=Glowa-Kollisch |last4=Hadler|first4=James |last5=Lee|first5=David |last6=Alper|first6=Howard |last7=Selling|first7=Daniel |last8=MacDonald|first8=Ross |last9=Solimo|first9=Angela &lt;!--and Amanda Parsons, Homer Venters--&gt; |title=Solitary Confinement and Risk of Self-Harm Among Jail Inmates |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |volume=104 |issue=3 |date=March 2014 |pages=442–447 |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301742 |format=PDF |access-date=18 March 2014 |display-authors=1 |doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301742 |pmid=24521238 |pmc=3953781}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some inmates are known to have psychiatric disorders prior to entering the prison, others develop mental disorders as a result of being placed in solitary confinement. A main issue within the prison system and solitary confinement is the high number of inmates who turn to self-harm.&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt; Studies have shown that the longer one stays in the prison, the more at risk he or she is to self-harm.

One study has shown that “inmates ever assigned to solitary confinement were 3.2 times as likely to commit an act of self-harm per 1000 days at some time during their incarceration as those never assigned to solitary.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt; The study has concluded that there is a direct correlation between inmates who self-harm and inmates that are punished into solitary confinement. Many of the inmates look to self-harm as a way to “avoid the rigors of solitary confinement.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt; Mental health professionals ran a series of tests that ultimately concluded that “self-harm and potentially fatal self-harm associated with solitary confinement was higher independent of mental illness status and age group.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt;

Physicians have concluded that for those inmates who enter the prison already diagnosed with a mental illness, the punishment of solitary confinement is extremely dangerous in that the inmates are more susceptible to exacerbating the symptoms.&lt;ref name=metzner2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metzner|first1=Jeffrey L. |last2=Fellner|first2=Jamie |title=Solitary Confinement and Mental Illness in U.S. Prisons: A Challenge for Medical Ethics |date=March 2010 |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|J Am Acad Psychiatry Law]] |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=104–108 |url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/1/104.full |access-date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional organizations, like the [[National Commission on Correctional Health Care]] (NCCHC), the [[Society of Correctional Physicians|American College of Correctional Physicians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Society of Correctional Physicians Calls for Caution Placing Mentally Ill in Segregation An Important Band-Aid|url = http://jcx.sagepub.com/content/20/2/92|journal = Journal of Correctional Health Care|date = 1 April 2014|issn = 1078-3458|pmid = 24659757|pages = 92–94|volume = 20|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/1078345814522959|first = Marc F.|last = Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA), work to improve the mental health services, however, the systems within the prisons "remain woefully inadequate."&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt;  "Psychological effects can include anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive disturbances, perceptual distortions, obsessive thoughts, paranoia, and psychosis."&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; These studies suggest that a main issue with isolating prisoners who are known to have mental illnesses is that it prevents the inmates from ever possibly recovering. Instead, many "mentally ill prisoners decompensate in isolation, requiring crisis care or psychiatric hospitalization." It is also noted that if a prisoner is restrained from interacting with the individuals they wish to have contact with they exhibit similar effects.&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt;

Suicide is often seen as a means to escape from solitary confinement, especially amongst those who deal with deeper mental illnesses like depression. Depression is one of the most common reasons why inmates often kill themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/what-does-solitary-confinement-do-to-your-mind/|title=What Does Solitary Confinement Do To Your Mind?|work=FRONTLINE|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitary confinement has been said to increase symptoms of those with mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/05/solitary.aspx|title=Alone, in 'the hole'|work=apa.org|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Environment is a factor ====
"Prisoner mental health is becoming increasingly important," and has caught the attention of the [[World Health Organization]], which aims to reduce the "effects of imprisonment on mental health."  One study focused on the "prison environment rather than on individual factors."&lt;ref name=walker2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker|first1=J. |last2=Illingworth|first2=C. |last3=Canning|first3=A. |last4=Garner|first4=E. |last5=Woolley|first5=J. |last6=Taylor|first6=P. |last7=Amos|first7=T. |title=Changes in Mental State Associated with Prison Environments: A Systematic Review |date=18 November 2013 &lt;!--Epub--&gt; |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=427–36 |doi=10.1111/acps.12221 |display-authors=1 |pmid=24237622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study tested two time periods, short-term and long-term, that evaluated the "mental state changes in response to changes in the environment or prison setting."&lt;ref name=walker2013/&gt; It ultimately concluded that solitary confinement was "associated with negative effects on mental health."&lt;ref name=walker2013/&gt; Segregation, though similar to solitary confinement, could not be proven to have lasting negative effects on inmates, although those who were segregated had worse mental health than those who were not segregated. The study also concluded that crowding had its own problems, as "increased levels of social density had negative effects on the mental health of inmates."&lt;ref name=walker2013/&gt;

===Social===
Some sociologists argue that prisons create a unique social environment that do not allow inmates to create strong social ties outside or inside of prison life. Men are more likely to become frustrated, and therefore more mentally unstable when keeping up with family outside of prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lindquist|first=Christine H. |title=Social Integration and Mental Well-Being Among Jail Inmates |journal=Sociological Forum |volume=15|issue=3 |date=September 2000 |pages=431–455 |doi=10.1023/A:1007524426382 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1007524426382 |subscription=yes |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme forms of solitary confinement and isolation can affect the larger society as a whole. The resocialization of newly released inmates who spent an unreasonable amount of time in solitary confinement and thus suffer from serious mental illnesses is a huge dilemma for society to face.&lt;ref name="kupers" /&gt; The effects of isolation unfortunately do not stop once the inmate has been released. After release from segregated housing, psychological effects have the ability to sabotage a prisoner's potential to successfully return to the community and adjust back to ‘normal’ life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/health/solitary-confinement-mental-illness.html|title=Solitary Confinement: Punished for Life|last=Goode|first=Erica|date=3 August 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inmates are often startled easily, and avoid crowds and public places. They seek out confined small spaces because the public areas overwhelm their sensory stimulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Criticism==

===Ineffectiveness===
In 2002, the Commission on Safety and Abuse in America, chaired by [[John Joseph Gibbons]] and [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] found that: "The increasing use of high-security segregation is counter-productive, often causing violence inside facilities and contributing to recidivism after release."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/Confronting_Confinement.pdf |title=Confronting Confinement: A Report of The Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's Prisons |date=8 June 2006 |authors=John J. Gibbons &amp; Nicholas de B. Katzenbach, co-chairs |accessdate=18 June 2011 |format=PDF &lt;!--publisher-The Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's Prisons--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solitary confinement has been traditionally used as a behavioral reform of isolating prisoners physically, emotionally and mentally in order to control and change inmate behavior. Recently arrived inmates are more likely to violate prison rules than their inmate counterparts and thus are more likely to be put in solitary confinement. Additionally, individual attributes and environmental factors combine to increase an inmate's likelihood of being put into solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Kenneth|title=Adjusting to Prison Life|journal=Crime and Justice|volume=16|pages=275|doi=10.1086/449208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture===
{{POV section|date=June 2016|talk=Torture_NPOV}}
Solitary confinement is considered to be a form of [[psychological torture]] with measurable long-term physiological effects when the period of confinement is longer than a few weeks or is continued indefinitely.

The documented psychological effects led one judge in a 2001 suit to rule that "Solitary confinement units are virtual incubators of psychoses—seeding illness in otherwise healthy inmates and exacerbating illness in those already suffering from mental infirmities."&lt;ref&gt;''Ruiz v. Johnson'', 154 F.Supp.2d 975 (S.D.Tex.2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, as of 2016, there have been thirty-five U.S. Supreme Court cases petitioning solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://solitarywatch.com/resources/u-s-supreme-court-cases/|title=U.S. Supreme Court Cases|date=11 December 2010|newspaper=Solitary Watch|language=en-US|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, UN Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan E. Méndez, told the General Assembly's third committee, which deals with social, humanitarian, and cultural affairs, that the practice could amount to torture.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40097|title=UN News - Solitary confinement should be banned in most cases, UN expert says|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=18 October 2011|website=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Considering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles,” he warned.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

In November 2014. the United Nations Committee Against Torture noted that full isolation for 22–23 hours a day in super-maximum security prisons is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_COC_USA_18893_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations have also banned the use of solitary confinement for longer than 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author1=Ramin Skibba |url=https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2018/hidden-damage-solitary-confinement | title=The hidden damage of solitary confinement |date= June 22, 2018 |magazine=[[Knowable Magazine]]|doi=10.1146/knowable-062118-065101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse===
Misuse of solitary confinement has been widely controversial. In immigration detention centers, reports have surfaced concerning its use against detainees in order to keep those knowledgeable about their [[Human rights|rights]] away from other detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Homer|last1=Venters |first2=Dana|last2=Dasch-Goldberg |first3=Andrew|last3=Rasmussen |first4=Allen S.|last4=Keller |title=Into the Abyss: Mortality and Morbidity Among Detained Immigrants |journal=[[Human Rights Quarterly]] |date=May 2009 |volume=31|number=2|pages=474–495 |doi=10.1353/hrq.0.0074 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/265311 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[prison-industrial complex]] itself, reports of solitary confinement as punishment in work labor prisons have also summoned much criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang|first1=Tracy F.

===Access to healthcare===
Research has shown that the routine features of prison can make huge demands on limited coping resources. After prison many ex-convicts with mental illness do not receive adequate treatment for their mental health issues, because health services turn them away. This is caused by restrictive policies or lack of resources for treating the formerly incarcerated individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Primm|first1=Annelle B. |last2=Osher|first2=Fred C. |last3=Gomez|first3=Marisela B. |title=Race and Ethnicity, Mental Health Services and Cultural Competence in the Criminal Justice System: Are we Ready to Change? |journal=Community Mental Health Journal |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=557–569 |doi=10.1007/s10597-005-6361-3 |pmid=16142538 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study focusing on women and adolescent men, those who had health insurance, received mental health services, or had a job were less likely to return to jail.

===Ethics===
Treating mentally ill patients by sentencing them into solitary confinement has captured the attention of human rights experts who conclude that “solitary confinement may amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment” that violates rights specifically targeting cruel, inhuman treatment.&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; Health care professionals and organizations recognize the fact that solitary confinement is not ethical, yet the segregating treatment fails to come to a halt.&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; “Experience demonstrates that prisons can operate safely and securely without putting inmates with mental illness in typical conditions of segregation.” &lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; Despite this and medical professionals’ obligations, segregation policies have not changed because mental health clinics believe that “isolation is necessary for security reasons.” &lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; In fact, many believe that it is ethical for physicians to help those in confinement but that the physicians should also be trying to stop the abuse. If they cannot do so they are expected to undertake public advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzner|first=Jeffrey L.|last2=Fellner|first2=Jamie|date=1 March 2010|title=Solitary Confinement and Mental Illness in U.S. Prisons: A Challengefor Medical Ethics|url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/1/104|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=104–108|issn=1093-6793|pmid=20305083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

The legality of solitary confinement has been frequently challenged over the past sixty years as conceptions surrounding the practice have changed.  Much of the legal discussion concerning solitary confinement has centered on whether or not it constitutes torture or cruel and unusual punishment. While [[international law]] has generally begun to discourage solitary confinement's use in penal institutions,&lt;ref name=conley2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conley |first=Anna |title=Torture in US Jails and Prisons: An Analysis of Solitary Confinement Under International Law |date=April 2013 |journal=Vienna J. on Int'l Const. Law |volume=7 |pages=415–453 |url=http://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/vioincl7&amp;section=52 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; opponents of solitary confinement have been less successful at challenging it within the [[United States legal system]].

===International law===

Throughout the twentieth century, the [[United Nations]]' stance on solitary confinement has become increasingly oppositional. International law has reflected this change, and UN monitoring has led to a major reduction of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

In 1949, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].  Although the Declaration is non-binding, the basic human rights outlined within it have served as the foundation of [[customary international law]].&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  The relevance of the Declaration to solitary confinement is found in Article 5, which states that “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a5 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights] (UN.org)&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, if solitary confinement is believed to constitute torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, then the country practicing solitary confinement is violating the provisions set by the UDHR.

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), effective 1976, reiterates the fifth article of the UDHR; Article 7 of the ICCPR identically states, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|title=OHCHR - International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|work=ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ICCPR is a legally binding agreement, any nation that is signatory to the covenant would be violating international law if it practiced torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.

At the time that the UDHR and ICCPR were adopted, solitary confinement was not yet believed to constitute torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; Its practice, therefore, was not believed to violate international law. This changed, however, after the UN definition of torture was outlined in detail in the 1984 [[Convention Against Torture]] (CAT); Article 1.1 of the CAT states that torture is "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person" for any reason such as obtaining information or punishment, and Article 16 of the same convention prohibits "other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". Based on these provisions, many members of the UN began to believe that solitary confinement's detrimental psychological effects could, indeed, constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, if not, torture.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; In the years following the CAT, UN representatives "have publicly decried the use of solitary confinement as a violation of the CAT and ICCPR," as well as the UDHR.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

In more recent years, UN representatives have strengthened their efforts to stop solitary confinement from being used worldwide.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; The urgency with which representatives have undertaken these efforts is largely due to the [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs|UN Special Rapporteurs]] on Torture, [[Manfred Nowak]] and [[Juan E. Méndez|Juan Méndez]].&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; Nowak and Méndez have both "repeatedly unequivocally stated that prolonged solitary confinement is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and may amount to torture".&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Nowak and Méndez have been especially critical of long-term or prolonged solitary confinement, which they define as lasting fifteen days or more.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; Their authority and explicit characterization of solitary confinement as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment has led the UN to include long-term to indefinite solitary confinement in the group of practices that violate the provisions outlined in the UDHR, ICCPR, and CAT. Solitary confinement lasting for a short period of time, however, is allowed under international law when used as a last resort, though Nowak, Mendez, and many other UN representatives believe that the practice should be abolished altogether.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

=== United States law ===
In the U.S., opponents of solitary confinement have argued (with varying success) that the practice violates prisoners’ [[Constitutional right#United States|Constitutional rights]]. Despite the long history of litigation over the practice, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has yet to definitively state whether or not solitary confinement is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of long-term solitary confinement only once in the ‘‘[[Wilkinson v. Austin]]'’ case. In contrast to the Supreme Court's inaction, lower courts of the U.S. have imposed constitutional limitations on the use of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; Despite such limitations, the federal courts have refused to find that solitary confinement is per se unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; The U.S. has also effectively “insulated itself from any official sanction for international violations by not submitting to the jurisdiction” of committees that enforce the ICCPR or CAT.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

====Eighth Amendment====

Since solitary confinement has been designated as “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” under international law, many lawyers have argued that it is also the kind of “cruel and unusual punishments” prohibited by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. Proving this to be the case, however, has been a difficult task for attorneys at every level of the court system.

In light of the serious, long-lasting psychological effects solitary confinement can have, inmates have argued that the mental injuries they suffer qualify as “cruel and unusual punishment.” Prison officials contend that placing inmates in prolonged solitary confinement is necessary for various reasons.  Some of these reasons include separating violent prisoners from the general population, separating vulnerable inmates (such as juveniles) from others, and punishing those prisoners who attempt to cause riots or try to escape.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt; Prisoners argue, however, that the nature of these kinds of offenses does not justify the use of solitary confinement; in their eyes “there is simply no strong security need for the total social isolation that exists at some supermax prisons”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;

A large portion of the court cases addressing solitary confinement have approached the practice as a violation of Eighth Amendment rights. Courts have generally agreed that solitary confinement is, indeed, a violation of the Eighth Amendment for inmates with preexisting mental illness or juveniles.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt; However, the Supreme Court concluded that “while there was a risk of serious psychological injury to inmates, that risk was not of ‘sufficiently serious magnitude’ to find a ‘per se’ violation of the Eighth Amendment for ‘‘all’’ prisoners placed in long-term solitary confinement”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;

Showing that solitary confinement constitutes cruel and unusual punishment has proven difficult for inmates and their attorneys. The Supreme Court requires ‘extreme deprivations’ in order to have merits for a ‘conditions-of-confinement claim’ and courts have also held that inmates are only protected against “certain kinds of extreme deprivations” by the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt; In ‘‘[[Farmer v. Brennan]]’’, the Supreme Court set two requirements that must be fulfilled in order to challenge solitary confinement as “cruel and unusual”.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt; First, prisoners must show that a “substantial risk of serious harm to inmates” and second, that the prison officials were “deliberately indifferent” to such risk.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt; To prove a prison official's “deliberate indifference,” the prisoner must “show evidence that the official was ‘actually’ aware of a prisoner's serious need and chose to ignore it”.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; Since the psychological impact of solitary confinement is not believed to be “objectively” cruel and unusual within the U.S. legal system, and because it is difficult to establish that prison officials are “indifferent” to prisoner health and safety, inmates and attorneys alleging these two requirements have faced limited success.

The [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] (PLRA) further complicates inmates’ ability to claim that solitary confinement's psychological damage constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Section 1997e(e) of the PLRA states that {{quote|no Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cockrell|first=John F.|title=Solitary Confinement: The Law Today and the Way Forward|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/89007447/solitary-confinement-law-today-way-forward|journal=[[Law &amp; Psychology Review]]|volume=37|date=March 2013|pages=211–227|access-date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This demonstrates that the Eighth Amendment provides “greater protection” against physical injury than against mental pain.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;  Therefore, unless a prisoner can demonstrate physical injury as a result of solitary confinement, he or she is unable to recover damages for any “mental or emotional injury” the confinement causes.  As a result, the Eighth Amendment has not always been proven to be the most effective approach to argue against the practice of solitary confinement.

==== Due process and the Fourteenth Amendment ====
Litigating against solitary confinement on the basis of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and [[due process clause|due process]] is another less common strategy inmates have used.  The Fourteenth Amendment limits the “types of prisoners” that can be placed in solitary confinement and the time the prisoners can be confined.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  The due process clause within the Fourteenth Amendment also regulates solitary confinement in that prisoners must be given reviews before and during their placement in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  Court cases made on these bases do not necessarily address any “underlying problems” of solitary confinement, but they do call for increased monitoring, hearing, and reviews.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;

Inmates who are placed in solitary confinement “must be accorded meaningful periodic review to ensure that segregation [solitary confinement] is not a ‘pretext for indefinite confinement’”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lobel|first=Jules|title=Prolonged Solitary Confinement and the Constitution|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume11/issue1/Lobel11U.Pa.J.Const.L.115(2009).pdf|journal=[[Journal of Constitutional Law|J. Const. Law]]|volume=11|issue=1|date=December 2008|pages=115–138|format=PDF|access-date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Jules Lobel, professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, explains, {{quote|When a prisoner is placed in a supermax, the due process requirement of meaningful periodic review requires that his or her behavior be re-evaluated at regular intervals to determine whether supermax confinement is still warranted.}} Lobel contends that the trend in U.S. supermax prisons is to not submit these reviews at all or to provide a review with a predetermined outcome to keep the prisoner in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;  If this is indeed the case, then such inmates’ due process rights are violated.

In ''[[Wilkinson v. Austin]]'', the Supreme Court held that, in addition to the due process right to meaningful review, prisoners also have a due process right to “a statement of the reasons why they were placed or retained at the supermax” so they can better understand how to behave in the future in order to be released from solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;  Lobel argues that this “implies that the officials must provide something more than a general statement that the prisoner is very dangerous”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;  According to Lobel this is not what usually happens at supermax facilities, so the inmates’ due process rights are violated in this way as well.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;

In recent circuit court cases, courts have ruled that solitary confinement of 305 days or more constitutes an “atypical and significant hardship” that implicates due process.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;

==== Alternative litigation techniques ====
Recognizing that the amount of proof needed to show that solitary confinement violates prisoners’ rights “is simply too high to trigger constitutional protections,” attorneys have started to approach solitary confinement from a different angle.  John F. Cockrell, a recent graduate from the University of Alabama School of Law, suggests that those who challenge solitary confinement do so in context of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA).&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;  Cockrell reasons that {{quote|When claims under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments fail, [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990#Title II|Title II]] [of the ADA] may offer an avenue to improve the provision of services to the mentally ill in prisons and solitary confinement, but ipso facto improving the conditions under which all inmates in solitary confinement live.}}

In the past few years, several internal committees and administrative bodies involved in the United States prison and legal systems have also begun to question solitary confinement's legality.  In June 2012, for example, the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|US Senate Judiciary Committee]] held its first hearing on solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Likewise, as of 2013, the [[US Bureau of Prisons]] has announced that it will conduct its first review of how solitary confinement is used in federal prisons.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Additionally, the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] found multiple violations of the Constitution and ADA after investigating the use of solitary confinement for mentally ill inmates in two Pennsylvania prisons.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  The [[US Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] Agency (ICE) has also revised segregation procedures for detainees.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

=== Mentally ill inmates and juveniles ===
Studies have illustrated that mentally ill inmates and juveniles are two groups more severely affected by solitary confinement than other prisoners.  As such, the [[Solitary confinement of mentally ill prisoners in the United States|solitary confinement of mentally ill inmates]] and juveniles has been upheld as cruel and unusual in both international and US courts.

The UN has “expressly prohibit[ed] solitary confinement of juveniles and individuals with mental illness”.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Convention on the Rights of the Child have played major roles in establishing the UN's position on solitary confinement of mentally ill inmates and juveniles respectively.

Within the US legal system, too, courts have held that the solitary confinement of the mentally ill is “cruel and unusual”.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  In fact, David Fathi, Director of the ACLU's [[National Prison Project]], found that “every federal court that has considered claims by severely mentally ill prisoners held in solitary confinement has found this treatment unconstitutional”.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  These court rulings are significant in light of the fact that more than half of the prisoners currently serving jail time in the US are mentally ill according to the US Bureau of Prisons.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Furthermore, approximately 30% or more of prisoners in solitary confinement are mentally ill.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  These rulings have the potential to dramatically change how prisons deal with mentally ill inmates, as prison officials would no longer be able to “warehouse” “difficult” prisoners if they have a preexisting mental illness.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  It should be noted, however, that these rulings do not guarantee that the mentally ill will not be put in solitary confinement; while they are considered a vulnerable group, these prisoners still have “limited” recourse to the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;

One landmark case, ''Madrid v. Gomez'', challenged the conditions of the Security Housing Unit (SHU) in the [[Pelican Bay State Prison]].  The court ruled that the current conditions were not “per se violative of the Eighth Amendment” with respect to all inmates.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;  However, in regard to SHU's isolation of the mentally ill and the conditions of their solitary confinement, the court found that the prison had violated the Eighth Amendment.  Despite it being a landmark case, the rulings of the case have yet to set a trend among cases against other prison systems because SHU's conditions were known to be more extreme and harsh than other supermax prisons.

Juveniles who are charged as adults and placed in adult prisons are usually put in [[protective custody]], and often the conditions of protective custody are similar to those of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  Juvenile justice experts, social scientists, and national correctional standards all agree that solitary confinement is an “ineffective therapeutic tool” that is detrimental to juveniles who are still in an “uncertain, unformed state of social identity”.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  Given that they are developing mentally and physically, some experts have suggested that “they are severely and permanently damaged by such conditions to a greater extent than adults”.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

==Actions==
The use of long-term solitary confinement, along with other grievances, has triggered organized resistance from prisoners and advocacy groups in the United States. Prisoners in California and elsewhere have launched hunger strikes, citing cruel and unusual uses of solitary confinement as a major reason. Hundreds of prisoners in the United States, acting through the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, have in 2012 filed a petition against solitary confinement at the [[United Nations]]. The petition alleges that solitary confinement constitutes torture and should be addressed by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/california-prisons-solitary-confinement-challenged-un-petition-429116 |title=California Prisons' Solitary Confinement Challenged In UN Petition |work=[[International Business Times]] |date=23 March 2012 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2013 California prisoner hunger strike]] saw approximately 29,000 prisoners protesting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/california-prison-hunger-strike-30000_n_3567639.html |first=Kathleen |last=Miles |title=California Prison Hunger Strike: 30,000 Inmates Refuse Meals |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=9 July 2013 |language=en |access-date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statewide hunger strike reaching 2/3 of California's prisons began with the organizing of inmates at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]]. On 11 July 2011, prisoners at Pelican Bay State Prison began a hunger strike to “protest torturous conditions in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) there”...and to advocate for procedural and policy changes like the termination of the “debriefing process” which forces prisoners “to name themselves or others as gang members as a condition of access to food or release from isolation”.&lt;ref name=lauren1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Marjorie |title=Prisoners Strike Against Torture in California Prisons |date=July 2011 |journal=National Lawyers Guild Review |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=61–62 |url=http://marjoriecohn.com/prisoners-strike-against-torture-in-california-prisons |access-date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 7,000 inmates throughout the California prison system stood in solidarity with these Pelican State Bay prisoners in 2011 by also refusing their food.&lt;ref name=lauren1 /&gt; Also in solidarity with the 2011 Pelican Bay prisoners on strike is the Bay Area coalition of grassroots organizations known as the [[Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity coalition]]. This coalition has aided the prisoners in their strike by providing a legal support force for their negotiations with the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] (CDCR) and by creating and running a media based platform to raise support and awareness for the strikers and their demands among the general public.&lt;ref name=lauren1 /&gt;

The CDCR's failure to meet the demands of the Pelican State Bay Prison hunger strikers in 2011 resulted in the aforementioned [[2013 California prisoner hunger strike]]. Similar to the Pelican Bay State Prison hunger strike is the organizing of January 2011 in the supermax [[Ohio State Penitentiary]], where prisoners Bomani Shakur, Siddique Abdullah Hasan, Jason Robb, and Namir Abdul Mateen began a hunger strike “to protest what they call their harsh mistreatment under solitary confinement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goodman|first1=Amy |last2=Lynd|first2=Staughton |title=Prisoners at Supermax Ohio Penitentiary Begin Hunger Strike to Protest 17+ Year Solitary Confinement |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=4 January 2011 |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/1/4/prisoners_at_supermax_ohio_penitentiary_begin_hunger_strike_to_protest_17_year_solitary_confinement |access-date=12 June 2016}} (Video interview w. transcript).&lt;/ref&gt; These prisoners decided to start rejecting their meals until they could be relocated from solitary confinement to [[death row]] where their treatment as prisoners would improve. Another example took place in Fall of 2010, when prisoners throughout Georgia's prison system organized a strike in opposition to violations of the US Constitution 8th amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment for minute infractions of rules.&lt;ref name=lauren2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Casella|first1=Jean |last2=Ridgeway|first2=James |title=Georgia Prisoners' Strike: "We Locked Ourselves Down" |work=[[Solitary Watch]] |date=13 December 2010 |url=http://solitarywatch.com/2010/12/13/georgia-prisoners-strike-we-locked-ourselves-down/ |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates throughout the state, in facilities like Rogers State Prison and [[Hays State Prison]] engaged in a “self-imposed [[lockdown]]” to incite action from the [[Georgia Department of Corrections]] in meeting their demands.&lt;ref name=lauren2 /&gt; Similar to other prison strikes demanding systemic change in the policing and policies of prisons like the Pelican State Bay hunger strike, this self-imposed lockdown strike has reached “across multiple facilities and across racial and factional lines”.&lt;ref name=lauren2 /&gt;

Solitary confinement has served as a site of inspiration for protest-organizing against its use in and outside of prisons and conversely, as a response tactic for prisons to react to the protest-organizing of its prisoners. In March 2014, authorities at the [[Northwest Detention Center]] in Washington relegated multiple detainees to solitary confinement units after their participation in protests for the improvement of conditions within the facility and in solidarity with activist organizing against deportation escalations outside of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Honig|first1=Doug |last2=Lee|first2=Melissa |title=Hunger Strikers Released from Solitary Confinement at New Detention Center |date=4 April 2014 |publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Washington State |url=https://aclu-wa.org/news/hunger-strikers-released-solitary-confinement-nw-detention-center |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizing against the use of solitary confinement isn't limited to the work of prisoners subject to or at risk for this treatment. Community organizing outside of prisons has also occurred to shed light on the use of solitary confinement in prisons and work towards its abolition or highly refined use. Free and accessible journals like “Turning the Tide: Journal of Anti-Racist Action, Research, &amp; Education” and web-based projects like [[Solitary Watch]] and the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition website also work to disseminate information about the use of solitary confinement in prisons and support actions to bring about the end of this practice in prisons.

Dr. Eisenman, an Art History professor and activist, who is involved in many “stop max” movements centered in Illinois, studies solitary confinement and explains its eventual decline.&lt;ref name=Proponents&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenman|first=Stephen |title=The Resistible Rise and Predictable Fall of the US Supermax |journal=[[Monthly Review]] |date=November 2009 |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=31–45 |doi=10.14452/mr-061-06-2009-10_4 |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2009/11/01/the-resistable-rise-and-predictable-fall-of-the-u-s-supermax/ |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1800s solitary confinement was practiced in the penitentiary systems and its implementation and popularity at various prisons grew throughout the centuries.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; The practice of solitary confinement grew partly because of stigmatizing language used to refer to certain prisoners like ‘the worst of the worst,’ which became a form of “self-justifying the logic of torture”.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; Yet, as the use of solitary confinement progressed, public discourse around solitary confinement transitioned from a legitimate form of punishment to torture.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; Because many prisoners in solitary confinement suffered severe mental and physical illnesses, Eisenman describes that by the end of the nineteenth century “prisoner isolation and sensory deprivation were widely understood to be forms of torture”.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; Therefore, human rights groups condemned the use of solitary confinement or ‘supermax’ systems, and national and local ‘stop max’ movements have initiated in America and worldwide to stop the use of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt;

==Alternatives and reform==

===Possible alternatives===
Scrutiny of super-maximum security prisons and the institutionalization of solitary confinement is accompanied by suggestions for alternative methods. One alternative is to administer medical treatment for disorderly inmates who display signs of mental illness.&lt;ref name=sahil3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrcat.org/torture-in-us-prisons/learn-more-/alternatives-to-solitary-confinement|title=Alternatives to Solitary Confinement - National Religious Campaign Against Torture|first=Heather|last=Rice|website=www.nrcat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Corrections|Correction Department]] of [[New York City]] implemented plans to transfer mentally ill inmates to an internal facility for further help rather than solitary confinement in 2013.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Dora B. Schriro, correction commissioner, said that treatment would help turn a “one size fits all” policy into a program to promote success in jail and the outside world.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; A second alternative is to deal with long-term inmates by promoting familial and social relationships through the encouragement of visitations which may help boost morale.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Carl Kummerlowe believes that familial counseling and support may be useful for inmates nearing the end of a long-term sentence that may otherwise exhibit signs of aggression.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; This alternative would help inmates cope with extreme long term sentences in prisons such as those harbored in [[Pelican Bay State Prison|Pelican Bay]].&lt;ref name=king /&gt; A third alternative would involve regular reevaluation and accelerated transition of isolated inmates back to prison population to help curb long-term effects of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; These alternative methods suggest a more [[restorative justice]] approach to handling high-security offenders.

===Recent reform===
Many states such as [[Colorado]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Maine]] have implemented plans to reduce use of supermax prisons and solitary confinement and have begun to show signs of reform.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Joseph Ponte, Corrections Commissioner of Maine, cut supermax prison population by half.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Colorado has announced reforms to limit the use of solitary confinement in prisons following a study that showed significant levels of confinement and isolation in prisons.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Washington has also showed signs of decreased use of solitary confinement, low segregation of overall prison population, and emphasis on alternative methods.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt;

== Counter-arguments ==
There have been studies that have shown no difference between inmates in solitary confinement and those in normal lockup. For example, "Effect of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners" examines a study that compared twenty prison inmates that were put into isolation to twenty inmates from [[Prison|general population]] that were used as the controls.  The subjects were tested immediately before and after being put into isolation and the results showed that although there was a slight difference in subjective feelings, there were no mental or [[psychomotor retardation|psychomotor]] changes.&lt;ref name=walters1963&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walters|first1=Richard |last2=Callagan|first2=John |last3=Newman|first3=Albert |title=Effect of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |date=February 1963 |volume=119 |issue=8 |pages=771–73 |doi=10.1176/ajp.119.8.771 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.119.8.771?journalCode=ajp |access-date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Effect of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners" argues that the negative effects of solitary have often been overemphasized and that the reason these negative findings are often reported is due to the characteristic difference between those who end up in solitary confinement and those who do not.&lt;ref name=walters1963/&gt;

"Reactions and Attributes of Prisoners in Solitary Confinement," analyzes multiple studies conducted at different prisons throughout the United States.  There was no difference found in the stress levels between the inmates inside of solitary confinement and those in general lockup according to this study.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suedfeld|first1=Peter |last2=Ramirez|first2=Carmenza |last3=Deaton|first3=John |last4=Baker-Brown|first4=Gloria |title=Reactions and Attributes of Prisoners in Solitary Confinement |journal=[[Criminal Justice and Behavior]] |volume=9 |issue=3 |date=September 1982 |pages=303–40 |doi=10.1177/0093854882009003004 |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/9/3/303.abstract |access-date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews were conducted that showed that inmates had a fear of the mental effects that solitary confinement would have, but that mental harm rarely occurred.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt; There was also no significant difference between the results of the [[CPI]] Scale between the control and the experimental group according to "Reactions and Attributes of Prisoners in Solitary Confinement."&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt; This article proposes the idea that some inmates have inherent characteristics that allow them to better adapt to solitary confinement while others do not, similar to the ability to adapt to any new environment.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt;  Furthermore, it showed that the majority of inmates adapted to solitary confinement within a few days finding ways to pass time such as sleeping, thinking about the future, and exercising.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt; This article argues that this study gives a better representation of the effects of solitary confinement as it claims the participants are average inmates in traditional solitary confinement conditions, rather than controlled experimental conditions. The conclusions drawn from this study include the argument of consistency; that in order to prove that solitary confinement is harmful to inmates, there needs to be some sort of consistent negative result and their findings do not match this.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt;

It should be emphasized that these studies were conducted in 1963 and 1982, respectively.

==Proponents==
Proponents{{who|date=October 2016}} of solitary confinement propound that solitary confinement can improve the safety of inmates and prison staff. Earlier justifications for solitary confinement in the mid 20th century included protection for a prisoner whose sexual orientation, religion, or race were far too different and seen as vulnerable to attack from fellow inmates.{{cn |date= October 2018}}

==Solitary Confinement of Women ==
{{main|Solitary confinement of women}}
While studies have shown the effects of solitary confinement to be detrimental to all inmates, '''solitary confinement of women''' has particular consequences for women that may differ from the way it affects men. Solitary confinement rates for women in the [[United States]] are roughly comparable to those for men&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://solitarywatch.com/facts/faq/|title=FAQ|date=2012-01-31|website=Solitary Watch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and about 20% of prisoners will be in solitary confinement at some point during their prison career.

== Incidence ==
According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]’ report from 2011-2012, about 20% of female prison inmates and 17% of female jail inmates spent some time in solitary confinement during that year, numbers which are comparable to rates for men.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Solitary confinement is allegedly used to prevent violence within the prison population, and is becoming more common with the prison industrial complex and the rise in incarceration rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In most prisons, inmates that are put into solitary confinement fall into one of three categories: disciplinary segregation, voluntary administrative segregation, and involuntary administrative segregation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bottos, Shauna. 2007. ''Profile of Offenders in Administrative Segregation: A Review of the Literature''. Research Report No. B-39. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; Disciplinary segregation is used as a punishment, while administrative segregation is a preventative measure intended to protect either the inmate being isolated or the other inmates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While segregation as a disciplinary measure or a precaution that protects other inmates is allegedly reserved for offenders who have committed violent acts while in prison, women in particular are often put into solitary for much smaller offenses, such as throwing things or talking back to guards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2001-01-01|title=Telling the Story: A Study in the Segregation of Women Prisoners|jstor=29768065|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=196–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often used against women who complain of sexual assault from prison guards or other inmates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union. 2014. “Worse Than Second-Class: Solitary Confinement of Women in the United States.” Retrieved May 2, 2016 (https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/worse_than_second-class.pdf).
&lt;/ref&gt; Once they are in solitary confinement, women are often monitored more closely and disciplined more harshly than men are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Disciplinary segregation ===
An offender who has committed a “serious disciplinary offense” may be put in solitary confinement as a punitive measure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inmates put into disciplinary segregation are not required to be given the same privileges as those put into administrative segregation,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the duration of their stay in isolation tends to be shorter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wichmann, Cherami and Kelly Taylor. 2004. ''Federally Sentenced Women in Administrative Segregation: A Descriptive Analysis''. Research Report No. R-158. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; According to a magazine written by inmates in a California prison, the practice operates under a “guilty until proven innocent” protocol, holding prisoners in solitary confinement even before it is clear that they committed the infraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preasmyer|first=Amy|date=2014|title=Together we can make a difference|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmates who are considered to be politically threatening are sometimes put into isolation; although the United States does not officially hold political prisoners, some inmates in solitary confinement are there because of their political activism. This justification often means that minorities are more likely to end up in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Administrative segregation ===
Administrative segregation, or “ad seg," is typically more common than disciplinary segregation, and serves to protect either the inmate being placed in solitary or others in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An offender may be put into administrative segregation if they are thought to be dangerous to others or if their own safety is in danger, or if “the inmate has the potential to interfere with an ongoing investigation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Often women who vocalize the fact that they feel threatened by someone else will be put into solitary confinement, and similarly, if they are accused of acting threatening in any way, they are put into solitary without being able to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rojo|first=Misty|date=2014|title=Solitary Torture in Women’s Prisons|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are put into administrative segregation tend to be those women who have had trouble adjusting to prison life and who are seen as “high-risk” and “high-needs” when they enter the prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because this type of segregation is not intended as punishment, inmates in administrative segregation are legally required to be treated in the same way as those in general confinement in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Voluntary ====
Women prisoners sometimes request to be put into solitary confinement, most often for their own protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, some women are thought to request solitary confinement to avoid “further assaults on their identity” that might arise from their interactions and experiences in prison.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2006-01-01|title=TO BE, ONE HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE: Spatio—temporality in Prison Segregation|jstor=23639455|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|volume=46|issue=4|pages=587–612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that women who have been in voluntary administrative segregation tend to have high personal or emotional needs, and some have struggled with substance abuse, although few have difficulty with “community functioning.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Involuntary ====
Women prisoners who are deemed to be dangerous to other prisoners are sometimes put into administrative segregation; a prisoner can also be put in segregation if the officers determine that she herself is in danger and needs this protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Like women who are voluntarily put into segregation, these women tend to have high personal and emotional needs, but many of them also have difficulties functioning in the community or associating with other people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Women put in segregation ===
In general, women tend to be subjected to harsher disciplinary practices in prisons than men.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shaylor, Cassandra. 1998. “It's Like Living in A Black Hole: Women of Color and Solitary Confinement in the Prison Industrial Complex.” ''New England Journal on Criminal and Civil Confinement'' 385:390-420.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of solitary confinement, women are often put into segregation for committing small errors while in prison, for example spitting at a guard, while men must commit more violent infractions, such as attacking a guard, for segregation to become necessary.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This could arise from the fact that women in prison are held to especially high standards of femininity, and prisons encourage them to conform to very traditional ideas of being a woman.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This model of femininity requires women to be “pure, passive, heterosexual, and located in motherhood."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When women do not comply with this standard while imprisoned, they are punished further. In fact, some prisons specifically isolate women who seem “butch” or not traditionally feminine.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Arkles, Gabriel. 2009. "Safety and Solidarity Across Gender Lines: Rethinking Segregation of Transgender People in Detention." Temple ''Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review'' 18(2):515-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another catalyst for being put into solitary confinement that applies overwhelmingly to women is that prisoners who complain of abusive treatment by guards are often segregated as retaliation. In particular, women who speak out after guards have sexually harassed them are often put into segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not only does this mean that guards who are guilty of sexually harassing inmates go unpunished, it also decreases the likelihood that women will report harassment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In some prisons, women may be put into solitary confinement because their mental health issues prove to be too difficult for the authorities to deal with or are exhausting their resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the prison authorities are unable to address their inmates’ health concerns, they may put them into solitary confinement to avoid solving the problem. This means that the women in solitary confinement are often already at risk for mental health or other challenges, due to previous health concerns or sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Consequences for women ==
Solitary confinement has been shown to be detrimental to the mental and physical well-being of all inmates, but there are some ways in which being put into segregation can be more harmful for women than for men. This is often due to patriarchal structures that exist outside of the prison environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They “experience segregation ''as women''”; they are both subjected to slightly different treatment than men are and their perception of this treatment may differ as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
Being put into solitary confinement can be very damaging to the mental health of female inmates, particularly those with a history of mental or physical illness, as has been found in a number of studies that observed and interviewed women who were being held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Being held in a small space without access to objects, recreation, or human contact can lead to claustrophobia, anger, depression, hallucinations,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=The Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766384|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; insomnia, and obsessive ideation or fixation on dying.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=Follow-Up Report on the Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766385|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a psychosomatic level, inmates in solitary confinement often experience a loss of appetite and/or weight, dizziness, or heart palpitations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Prison staff often do not respond adequately to complaints of any of these symptoms, and sometimes refuse to offer medical care or medication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some of the anxiety that inmates, particularly female inmates, experience in solitary confinement comes from a loss or confusion of identity. Prisoners in solitary confinement are not allowed to decorate the small rooms that they are in or to bring most of their possessions that they were allowed in general confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This prevents the women from having any sort of entertainment, but also exacerbates feelings of a loss of individuality and of personal identity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Studies of the conditions of segregation, and interviews with the women who are subjected to them, have shown that women may also experience a collapse or confusion of identity while in prison because of their removal from their community and because of the unusual experience of space and time while in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Prisoners attach a lot of importance to the items that they have in their rooms; when they are placed into solitary confinement and no longer allowed to keep these identifying objects with them, they begin to lose their sense of self.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Further, because prisoners kept in segregation often interact little with the outside world, and because the routines of eating and cleaning may be different from in general confinement, the women lose their ability to mark time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''The Fire Inside'' magazine, written by offenders in California women's prisons, quotes one prisoner as saying that her recommendation for those held in solitary confinement is “to create a schedule” and figure out the time of day, because it “helps to assert control over your own life and not be totally defined by whatever ‘routine’ the prison is forcing on you.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehorn|first=Laura|date=2014|title=Surviving Solitary|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of their identity that is destroyed is their ability to form relationships with others. In most societies, women are perceived as being particularly social; having relationships with other people is seen as an essential element of their role as women in particular. This is of course impossible when in solitary confinement. It has been argued that this has a harmful effect on women especially. These conclusions were drawn from interviews with women who were still in solitary confinement, women who had been in solitary but had since been transferred back to the general prison population, and women who had been in solitary but had been released from incarceration, suggesting that these effects carry over beyond their time in segregation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some prisons do allow inmates in solitary confinement to use recreation rooms and exercise yards, but these are often monitored by cameras, creating a sense of powerlessness and humiliating and deterring the women from using these facilities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Feelings of powerlessness or hopeless are exacerbated by the fact that women are often unsure of how long they will be held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

All of these factors combined can have different effects on women, making them either increasingly anxious or increasingly indifferent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While some women feel desperate and angry, others attempt to feel as little as possible in order to mitigate the effects of segregation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Because of the detrimental effect on their mental stability, inmates in solitary confinement often resort to self-harm; this behavior is more common in women than in men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can sometimes lead to women being held in solitary confinement for longer, as punishment for their destructive actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, it reinforces the guards’ perceptions of these women as particularly violent or dangerous to the rest of the prison community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Sexual abuse ===
Women in solitary confinement are often watched over by male guards, which can result in sexual harassment ranging from discomfort caused by guards watching them during private moments to nonconsensual sexual contact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Male guards often are present while women shower or undress, stripping away the women's right to the privacy of their own bodies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because women in solitary confinement experience so little human contact, the gaze of their guards is often the only interaction that they have with another person; this can exacerbate the feelings of loss of privacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Similarly, the clothing the women are required to wear is sexualized and humiliating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}} In some prisons, women in segregation wear a “baby doll,” a long shapeless dress, with no underclothes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}} Although men sometimes are required to wear the “baby doll” as well, women find that wearing it while being watched by their male guards is degrading and makes them feel powerless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}}

Beyond this, women in segregation are sometimes subjected to sexual abuse or physical harassment by their male guards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They are often forced to undergo thorough strip searches, during which the guards are more forceful and invasive than is strictly necessary&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and serves mostly to demonstrate the guards’ authority over the inmates.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Because so many female inmates have been victims of sexual or physical abuse, this forces them to relive the trauma of their previous abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be especially devastating for women whose mental states are already deteriorating, due to prior mental illness or to the effects of being in segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It can also result in pregnancy, and pregnant women in solitary confinement—whether the pregnancy was a result of a rape by a guard or not—are often denied proper medical care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women have also reported stories of being publicly humiliated when asking for additional sanitary pads during their menstrual periods,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or being forced to hand in their used pads in order to acquire a new one, according to the women who contributed to ''The Fire Inside'' magazine.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They are entirely dependent on male guards, even for such personal needs as this.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Separation from children ===
Women are more likely than men to be the primary guardian of a child or children; having a mother who is in solitary confinement, then, can be very detrimental to the children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Inmates in solitary confinement have much less frequent contact with family members, and when they do, they are usually separated by a partition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although inmates are allowed some visits from immediate family members, a long background check is required.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Children with mothers in prison are at a greater risk for depression or anxiety, substance abuse, or involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These factors are only furthered by the more distanced relationship that becomes necessary with a mother in solitary confinement and the restrictions on visitation that accompany that.

=== Reentry ===
Women who are released from solitary confinement into the general prison population are more likely than men to experience stigmatization and humiliation from the prison guards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This often leads to them isolating themselves and not interacting with other prisoners even when they are not in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Once they are released from prison, too, they often have a harder time adjusting to being a part of society again, and frequently end up back in prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ex-offenders who were held in solitary confinement are more likely to commit violent acts against others once released than those who spent all their time in the general prison population.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As one California prisoner who wrote for ''The Fire Inside'' prison magazine put it, “We go through these kind of mental, emotional, and spiritual stages. At first when you get here you’re angry and disoriented…Paranoia sets in…I slowly began to think of this cell as my safe place…What happens next year when they take the box away?” She, and other women in solitary confinement, become unequipped to deal with the outside world and the knowledge of technological advancement, social interaction skills, and mental stability that it requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Stages of the SHU|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women of color in solitary confinement ==
In general, women of color, like men of color, are more likely to be put in prison than white women and men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Likewise, they are thought to be somewhat disproportionately represented in the solitary confinement population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margo|first=Schlanger,|date=2013-01-01|title=Prison Segregation: Symposium Introduction and Preliminary Data on Racial Disparities|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/articles/461/|journal=Michigan Journal of Race and Law|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2011-2012, 16% of white prison inmates, 20% of black/African American prison inmates, 16% of Hispanic or Latino prison inmates, and 20% of prison with some other racial identification were in solitary confinement at some point. The difference was slightly less pronounced in jails, with 17% of white, 17% of black/African American, 15% of Hispanic/Latino, and 21% of other inmates spending time in solitary confinement. There is no data available that specifically documents the intersection between race and gender.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5433|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) - Use of Restrictive Housing in U.S. Prisons and Jails, 2011–12|website=www.bjs.gov|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of people of color in isolation is only slightly higher than the number of white people, their experiences in solitary confinement may differ. Women in solitary confinement are treated as less than human, in ways which parallel not only the larger societal degradation of women but also that of people of color. The sexually abusive nature of their interactions with the guards, and the denial of medical care, social contact, and resources, can be seen as racialized. In particular, guards often refer to women in solitary confinement using slurs that are both misogynist and racist.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Women who are put into solitary confinement are often isolated because of actions that challenge dominant perspectives of femininity. Because women of color are often seen as possessing these non-feminine qualities already, they are more susceptible to being put into solitary confinement because of this kind of behavior. Black women are often perceived as “aggressive and recalcitrant,” Latina women are thought to be “loud and belligerent, sexually aggressive, or…unable to speak English,” and Native American women are seen as “backward, savage, and/or primitive.” Because of these preconceptions, women of color are thought to deviate strongly from the feminine ideal, which can be grounds for putting them in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Representations of crime in popular media serve to perpetuate racial stereotypes as well. Offenders of color, including women, are often portrayed as violent, hypersexual, or drug-addicted. While this is true of women of color in the general prison population as well as those held in solitary confinement, there is a particularly strong culture of fear that is built up around segregation units and the prisoners who are held there.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Inmates who appear to belong to particular minority groups are often profiled by prison guards as more likely to be dangerous, violent, or involved in a gang, and therefore are moved into isolation; for example, prisoners who speak a language other than English are sometimes targeted as foreign and therefore gang-involved or dangerous.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerness|first=Bonnie|last2=Lewey|first2=Jamie Bissonette|date=2014-01-01|title=Race and the Politics of Isolation in U.S. Prisons|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–41|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stolist''' is a term used to describe something within the culture of [[ancient Egypt]].

The stolist was a person participating within the society of ancient Egypt who held the rank of [[priest]], and whom we understand to have been an adorner of divine images. At some time stolists belonged to a group or guild known as ''nekrostolisteis'', as is attested to by the [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds of the [[Siwa Oasis]], this particularly being an inscription dating to the [[1st century]] C.E.&lt;ref&gt;D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2793">'''Truid Aagesen''' ([[Floruit|fl]]. 1593–1625) was a Danish composer and organist in the service of the Danish king.

Little is known about Aagesen's early life but his musical mentor and spiritual adviser was Jesuit Father [[Laurentius Nicolai Norvegus]] with whom he studied music. Aagesen was appointed organist of the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]] in [[Copenhagen]] on 23 June 1593. He studied in Venice with [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] from 1599 to 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Oskar Garstein, ''Rome and the Counter-Reformation in Scandinavia,'' page xxxviii 1992 "Here one of the principal figures was the cathedral organist in Copenhagen a certain Truid Aagesen, who had studied music in Venice and in Germany, and had made his name as a composer by producing Missa a cinque voci Basci amorosi .."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1600, he went to [[Prague]] as a royal commissioner for the Danish king [[Christian IV]]. Between 1609 and 1611, he is supposed to have taught at the court and therefore received subsidies from the royal treasury. In 1613, the Danish king published a letter stating that all men of the "[[Roman Catholic|popish]]" religion must leave [[Denmark]]. Aagesen, who had been suspected of being on the pope's payroll as early as 1604, was informed of a ruling made in the governing body of Copenhagen University on 15 September 1613 that, since he was popishly inclined, he should not be allowed to continue as organist. In 1615, he was replaced by [[Johan Meincke]]. After that he seems to have vanished from history but he is known to have lived in Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]) in 1625.

His only known published music is a set of secular ''Cantiones'' for three voices which were published in [[Hamburg]] in 1608 under his [[Latinized name]], Theodoricus Sistinus. He was also known under the name Trudo Haggaei Malmogiensis.
