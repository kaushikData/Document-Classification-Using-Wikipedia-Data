[[File:AceOfAces-Game.png|400px|thumb|right|Original Ace of Aces game showing case, two player books and instruction sheet]]
'''''Ace of Aces''''' is a two-player combat picture book game designed by Alfred Leonardi and first published in 1980 by [[Nova Game Designs]].

== Gameplay ==
Each set includes a pair of small books, one for each player (generally marked 'German' and 'Allied').  These are like [[gamebooks]] in that instead of reading through them, a person is 'at' one particular page, and the book represents a [[World War I]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]].  Each player turns to the same page number in his book; the illustration on that page shows the view from the cockpit of his airplane, looking at the opponent.  Along the bottom of the page is series of maneuvers that can be performed, with page numbers listed under them (while the page numbers are different with each page, the maneuvers are constant).

Each player selects a maneuver. Both players then announce the corresponding numbers. Each player turns to the page number announced by the opponent, looks up his own maneuver there, and turns to the page number listed under it. After both players have done this, they are on the same (new) page, looking at new views of each other. The process is repeated until one player has maneuvered his opponent into the sights of his guns and can shoot him down.

The maneuvers in both books are the same, with each set representing a range of aircraft with similar handling characteristics.  Different sets are completely compatible with each other and can be used together, as long as opposing books are selected.

Additionally, a single player can in essence "fly solo" by picking up any single book and executing maneuvers.  The result is not unlike using the aircraft pictured in the book's pages as a fixed, non-moving spatial reference point.  This provides an easy way for newcomers to the game to get a feel for what each maneuver does, and hence a reasonably quick way to get up to a competitive level of play against opponents.

Gameplay could further be customised by using an included sheet of rules which provided for "intermediate" and "advanced" games. These games added factors such as altitude difference, ammunition supply, windspeed and jammed guns to the basic game (which assumed the guns always worked and had an endless supply of ammunition, and that the players would fly at the same altitude throughout in still air).

Despite what some perceived as a lack of "realism", the basic game was extremely popular and simple to learn, and it could be played anywhere there was room for two people to sit or stand.

==Other games==
''Ace of Aces'' was the first game of this type, but others were done later.  ''Bounty Hunter'' used much the same format for an [[western movie|old west]] [[gunfight]] (only one set was released, ''Shootout at the Saloon'').  ''Dragonriders of Pern'' used the ''Ace of Aces'' format in a contest to stop [[Thread (Pern)|Threadfall]]. Alfred Leonardi also designed the ''[[Lost Worlds (gamebook)|Lost Worlds]]'' combat book game system which is sometimes mistakenly described as using the ''Ace of Aces'' system. [[Joe Dever]] also used this style of books in a fantasy setting for his Combat Heroes books.

In 1989, West End Games released a set of books with the title "Starfighter Battle Book: X-wing vs. Tie Interceptor", using exactly the same Ace of Aces format: even the shooting pages are the same as those in the earlier game.

==Reception==
Nick Schuessler reviewed ''Ace of Aces'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 45.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Schuessler |first= Nick |date=November 1981 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=45|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schuessler commented that "enjoy trying to figure out how this little paper computer always gets you back to the same page with the right pictures showing."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt; In 1981, ''Ace of Aces'' won the [[Charles Roberts Award|Charles Roberts]]/[[Origins Award|Origins]] ''Gamers Choice'' of 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1980/list-of-winners |title=Origins/Charles Roberts Award Winners (1980) |publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design |accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415213107/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1980/list-of-winners |archivedate=2008-04-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was inducted into the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1993/list-of-winners |title=Origins Award Winners (1993) |publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design |accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106005056/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1993/list-of-winners |archivedate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named ''Ace of Aces'' as one of the ''Millennium's Best Games''.  According to that magazine the game is "nothing more than a hex-based single-unit wargame, [but] what made ''Ace of Aces'' great was the presentation. By completely hiding the actual mechanics of the game in the flipbooks, it didn't ''feel'' like a wargame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Best "Other" Game and The Millennium's Most Influential Person|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)| url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1306| date=1999-12-24|last=Haring| first=Scott D.| accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reprint project ==

The game is long out of print, but in June 2012 a Kickstarter project was initiated to reprint the game, with the permission and cooperation of the game's designer. The project was successful and the game was republished in January 2014.

'''''Alien Breed 3D II: The Killing Grounds''''' is the fifth game in Team17's ''[[Alien Breed]]'' franchise, a series of [[science fiction]]-themed shooters largely inspired by the ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' films. It was published in 1996 by Ocean Software.

Team17 had originally intended this to be its final Amiga title. Following the success of ''[[Worms (computer game)|Worms]]'', Team17's first multi-format release, the company was looking to get out of the Amiga game market, which had become stagnant over the years. As it transpired, ''The Killing Grounds'' was not Team17's final Amiga title{{mdash}}''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' was released the following year.

Team17 made the game's [[source code]] freely available in March 1997, on the cover CD of [[Amiga Format]] magazine issue 95.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160610175317/http://girv.net/blog/2009/alien-breed-3d.html Alien Breed 3D] by John Girvin "In March 1997, Team17 released the source code to AB3D’s sequel, "Alien Breed 3D II: The Killing Grounds" (known as TKG), on the cover CD of Amiga Format issue 95. It was megabytes of undocumented, disorganised, messy assembly language. Andy Clitheroe, the lone programmer of both games, must have been some kind of genius, I think. The official release was of the TKG source code. However, when poking around the CD I found the original (and equally messy) AB3D source too." (archived, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.successdenied.com/2010/12/alien-breed-3d-ii-quellcode/ alien-breed-3d-ii-quellcode] on successdenied.com by Vince (December 13, 2010, in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aminet.net/search?query=a3dsrc a3dsrc] src mirror on aminet.net&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
With the success of ''[[Alien Breed 3D]]'', Team17 decided to follow it up with a sequel. This time Team17 was aiming even higher, hoping to recreate something similar to the ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' engine on an [[Amiga]]. Team17 had included two versions of the game spread over 5 disks: one with high-quality sound and textures, the other with reduced quality versions. The reduced version was supposedly able to run on a non-expanded [[Amiga 1200]], although the game ran slowly.

Their project, however, was perhaps over-ambitious. Most Amigas of the time struggled to run the game, even with upgraded RAM and accelerator cards. Even with the fastest CPU at that time (MC68060 @ 66&amp;nbsp;MHz), the game could not be played smoothly with high details in fullscreen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amiga Power]] Issue 65, September 1996, pages 14-17&lt;/ref&gt; Most Amiga enthusiasts have only been able to play the game in recent years using [[emulator|emulation]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Poor level design, no collision-detection with monsters, and repetitive sounds did nothing to aid the gameplay experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amiga Power]] Issue 65, September 1996, pages 14-17&lt;/ref&gt;

An editor was shipped with the game, allowing users to create their own levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amiga Format]] Issue 91, December 1996, pages 90-91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

{{Empty section|date=May 2018}}

== Cancelled sequel  ==
A PC/[[Dreamcast]] follow-up to ''The Killing Grounds'', entitled ''Alien Breed: Conflict'', began development in 1999. The development was cancelled due to the size of the project. To date, ''Conflict'' remains as the only title in the series that was developed specifically for the PC and as the only PC game in the series developed solely by Team17 (the PC version of ''[[Alien Breed (video game)|Alien Breed]]'' was ported by [[MicroLeague]], while ''[[Alien Breed: Tower Assault]]'' were ported to the PC by East Point Software). According to what little information there is concerning this game, ''Conflict'' was also planned to be a first-person shooter and, presumably, would have followed on directly where ''The Killing Grounds'' left off.

'''Allusion''' is a [[figure of speech]], in which an object or circumstance from unrelated context is referenced covertly or indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=allusion {{!}} Definition of allusion in English by Oxford Dictionaries |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/allusion |website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A covert, implied or indirect reference" (''[[OED]]''); Carmela Perri explored the extent to which an allusion may be overt, in "On alluding" ''Poetics'' '''7''' (1978), and [[M. H. Abrams]] defined allusion as "a brief reference, explicit or indirect, to a person, place or event, or to another literary work or passage". (Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' 1971, ''s.v. "Allusion"'').&lt;/ref&gt; It is left to the audience to make the direct connection;&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Fowler, ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage''.&lt;/ref&gt; where the connection is directly and explicitly stated (as opposed to indirectly implied) by the author, it is instead usually termed a [[reference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/allusion|title=the definition of allusion|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reference|title=the definition of reference|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/allusion |title=Allusion |date=2015 |quote=allusion, in literature, an implied or indirect reference to a person, event, or thing or to a part of another text. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the arts, a literary allusion puts the alluded text in a new context under which it assumes new [[poetic function|meanings and denotations]].&lt;ref name="BenPorot76p107"/&gt; It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate.&lt;ref name="BenPorot76p107"/&gt; Literary allusion is closely related to [[parody]] and [[pastiche]], which are also "text-linking" [[literary device]]s.&lt;ref name="BenPorot76p107"&gt;Ben-Porot (1976) pp.107-8 quotation: {{quotation|The literary allusion is a device for the simultaneous activation of two texts. The activation is achieved through the manipulation of a special signal: a sign (simple or complex) in a given text characterized by an additional larger "referent." This referent is always an independent text. The simultaneous activation of the two texts thus connected results in the formation of intertextual patterns whose nature cannot be predetermined. ... The "free" nature of the intertextual patterns is the feature by which it would be possible to distinguish between the literary allusion and other closely related text-linking devices, such as parody and pastiche.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a wider, more informal context, an allusion is a passing or casually short statement indicating broader meaning. It is an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication, such as "In the stock market, he met his Waterloo."

==Scope of the term==
[[File:NAMA Tablette 1287.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Backside of a clay tablet from [[Pylos]] bearing the motif of the [[Labyrinth]], an allusion to the mythological fight of [[Theseus#The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur|Theseus and the Minotaur]]]]

In the most traditional sense, ''allusion'' is a literary term, though the word has also come to encompass indirect references to any source, including allusions in [[film]] or the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name="preminger"&gt;Preminger &amp; Brogan (1993) ''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics.'' Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, allusions are used to link concepts that the reader already has knowledge of, with concepts discussed in the story. In the field of film criticism, a film-maker's intentionally unspoken visual reference to another film is also called an [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. It may even be sensed that real events have allusive overtones, when a previous event is inescapably recalled by a current one. "Allusion is bound up with a vital and perennial topic in literary theory, the place of authorial intention in interpretation", William Irwin observed, in asking "What is an allusion?"&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, "What Is an Allusion?" ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' '''59''' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the hearer or reader's comprehending the author's intention, an allusion becomes merely a decorative device. 
Allusion is an economical device, a [[figure of speech]] that uses a relatively short space to draw upon the ready stock of ideas, cultural [[meme]]s or emotion already associated with a topic. Thus, an allusion is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the covert reference in question, a mark of their [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref name="preminger"/&gt;

==Allusion as cultural bond==
The origin of ''allusion'' is in the Latin verb ''ludere, lusus est'' "to play with, jest."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Recognizing the point of allusion's condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity between the maker of the allusion and the hearer: their shared familiarity with allusion bonds them. Ted Cohen finds such a "cultivation of intimacy" to be an essential element of many [[jokes]].&lt;ref&gt;(Cohen, ''Jokes: Philosophical Thoughts on Joking Matters'' [University of Chicago Press] 1999:28f). Irwin 2001:note 8 noted the parallel.&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspect of the referent must be invoked and identified for the tacit association to be made; the allusion is indirect in part because "it depends on something more than mere substitution of a referent."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 2001:288&lt;/ref&gt;

The allusion depends as well on the author's intent; a reader may search out parallels to a figure of speech or a passage, of which the author was unaware, and offer them as unconscious allusions—coincidences that a critic might not find illuminating.{{dubious|date=April 2014}} Addressing such issues is an aspect of [[hermeneutics]].

William Irwin remarks that allusion moves in only one direction: "If A alludes to B, then B does not allude to A. The Bible does not allude to Shakespeare, though Shakespeare may allude to the Bible." Irwin appends a note: "Only a divine author, outside of time, would seem capable of alluding to a later text."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 2001:289 and note 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the basis for Christian readings of [[Bible prophecy|Old Testament prophecy]], which asserts that passages are to be read as allusions to future events due to Jesus's revelation in {{Bibleref|Luke|24:25-27|TNIV}}.

Allusion differs from the similar term [[intertextuality]] in that it is an intentional effort on the author's part.&lt;ref name="preminger"/&gt; The success of an allusion depends in part on at least some of its audience "getting" it. Allusions may be made increasingly obscure, until at last they are understood by the author alone, who thereby retreats into a [[private language]] (e.g. "Ulalume", by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).

==Academic analysis of the concept of allusions==
In discussing the richly allusive poetry of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', R. F. Thomas&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Thomas, "Virgil's ''Georgics'' and the art of reference" ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology '' '''90''' (1986) pp 171–98.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished six categories of allusive reference, which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere. These types are:
# ''' Casual Reference''', "the use of language which recalls a specific antecedent, but only in a general sense" that is relatively unimportant to the new context;
# ''' Single Reference''', in which the hearer or reader is intended to "recall the context of the model and apply that context to the new situation"; such a specific single reference in Virgil, according to Thomas, is a means of "making connections or conveying ideas on a level of intense subtlety";
# ''' Self-Reference''', where the ''locus'' is in the poet's own work;
# ''' Corrective Allusion''', where the imitation is clearly in opposition to the original source's intentions;
# ''' Apparent Reference''' "which seems clearly to recall a specific model but which on closer inspection frustrates that intention"; and
# ''' Multiple Reference''' or '''Conflation''', which refers in various ways simultaneously to several sources, fusing and transforming the cultural traditions.

A type of literature has grown round explorations of the allusions in such works as [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' or [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''.

==Examples==
In [[Homer]], brief allusions could be made to mythic themes of generations previous to the main narrative because they were already familiar to the epic's hearers: one example is the theme of the [[Calydonian Boar|Calydonian boarhunt]]. In [[Hellenistic]] Alexandria, literary culture and a fixed [[literary canon]] known to readers and hearers made a densely allusive poetry effective; the poems of [[Callimachus]] offer the best-known examples.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], alluded to the [[Gettysburg Address]] in starting his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech by saying 'Five score years ago..."; his hearers were immediately reminded of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s "Four score and seven years ago", which opened the Gettysburg Address. King's allusion effectively called up parallels in two historic moments without overwhelming his speech with details.

A [[sobriquet]] is an allusion. By [[metonymy]] one aspect of a person or other referent is selected to identify it, and it is this shared aspect that makes a sobriquet evocative: for example, "the city that never sleeps" is a sobriquet of (and therefore an allusion to) New York.

An allusion may become trite and stale through unthinking overuse, devolving into a mere [[cliché]], as is seen in some of the sections below.

===15 minutes of fame===
[[Andy Warhol]], a 20th-century American artist most famous for his [[pop-art]] images of [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell soup]] cans and of [[Marilyn Monroe]], commented on the explosion of media coverage by saying, "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes."
Today, when someone receives a great deal of media attention for something fairly trivial, and he or she is said to be experiencing his or her "[[15 minutes of fame]]", that is an allusion to Andy Warhol's famous remark.

===Lot's Wife/Pillar of Salt===
According to the Book of Genesis, God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, but Lot, the nephew of Abraham, was given time to escape with his family before the destruction. God commanded Lot and his family not to look back as they fled. Lot's wife disobeyed and looked back, and she was immediately turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for her disobedience.

An allusion to Lot's wife or to a pillar of salt is usually a reference to someone who unwisely chooses to look back once he or she has begun on a course of action or to someone who disobeys an explicit rule or command.

===Cassandra===
In [[Greek mythology]], [[Cassandra]], the daughter of [[Troy|Trojan]] king [[Priam]], was loved by [[Apollo]], who gave her the gift of [[prophecy]]. When Cassandra later angered Apollo, he altered the gift so that her prophecies, while true, would not be believed. Thus, her accurate warnings to the Trojans were disregarded, and disaster befell them.

Today, a "Cassandra" refers to someone who predicts disasters or negative results, especially to someone whose predictions are disregarded.

===Catch-22===
This phrase comes from a novel by [[Joseph Heller]]. ''[[Catch-22]]'' is set on a [[U.S. Army Air Force]] base in [[World War II]]. "Catch-22" refers to a regulation that states an airman's request to be relieved from flight duty can only be granted if he is judged to be insane. However, anyone who does not want to fly dangerous missions is obviously sane, thus, there is no way to avoid flying the missions.

Later in the book the old woman in Rome explains that Catch-22 means "They can do whatever they want to do." This refers to the theme of the novel in which the authority figures consistently abuse their powers, leaving the consequences to those under their command. &lt;!--unnecessarily obscure:Catch-22 as it is currently construed is a misnomer as is "[[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]]" which is actually "[[Schrodinger's cat]]". (This puts those who know the difference in a double bind but not a Catch-22.)--&gt;

In common speech, "catch-22" has come to describe any absurd or [[no-win situation]].

===T. S. Eliot===
The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]] is often described as "allusive", because of his habit of referring to names, places or images that may only make sense in the light of prior knowledge. This technique can add to the experience, but for the uninitiated can make Eliot's work seem dense and hard to decipher.

===James Joyce===
The most densely allusive work in modern English may be ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' by [[James Joyce]]. [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Henry Morton Robinson]] wrote ''[[A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake]]'' (1944) that unlocked some of Joyce's most obscure allusions.

BARGE is formally open to "members of the rec.gambling" community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barge.org/barge2010info.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701091325/http://www.barge.org/barge2010info.html |archivedate=2010-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but registration must be done in advance over the Internet. BARGE organizers include Russell Fox, Rich Bremer, Jeff Deitch and Stevan Goldman.  Former organizers include Chuck Weinstock, Peter Secor, Michael "mickdog" Patterson, Nick Christenson, Bree Goldman and Mike Zimmers.

== BARGE history ==
The first BARGE was an informal gathering of a small number of participants of the rec.gambling newsgroup in Las Vegas in 1991 during [[SIGGRAPH]], a computer graphics convention. The next year, many of the same players got together and had a poker tournament at [[The Mirage]]. The poker tournament was No Limit Hold'em (as it still is, while additional poker tournaments have been added), and nine players participated. Since then, BARGE has been held at various Las Vegas locations (see below for a list).  Attendance has grown steadily, averaging about 200 participants.

In its earlier years, BARGE attendees were interested in Blackjack as much as they were in
Poker.  Some famous Blackjack players (card counters) who have attended BARGE include [[Andy Bloch]], [[Stanford Wong]], [[Arnold Snyder]] and 'Mr. M.'  Since around 1998, BARGE attendees and BARGE activities have centered much more around Poker.

In 2006 BARGE was moved to later in the month of August due to a conflict with the World Series of Poker as some attendees participated in both events.  Since then BARGE has returned to its traditional 1st weekend of August.

BARGE is the progenitor of all the other annual "ARG" events, including ATLARGE (held in Atlantic City), ESCARGOT (held in the Los Angeles area), FARGO (held in Connecticut, prior to 2014 at Foxwoods, now at Mohegan Sun), MARGE (held in Biloxi), EMBARGO (Winter Las Vegas event) and others.  

== BARGE traditions ==
Traditions are extremely important to BARGE.  For example, Scottro (a prominent BARGE participant) denied that his much-washed originally red hat was actually pink, resulting in dozens of players wearing pink baseball hats at the 2006 BARGE, held at the Venetian.  "To Throw Down the Pink Hat" has subsequently come to mean "to challenge someone to a heads-up poker match."

Perhaps the most famous BARGE tradition is "Presto!" as a nickname for a hold'em hand of pocket fives.  The term was originated by Frank Irwin (as slang for a blackjack) but its poker meaning is far more widespread, making appearances on multiple sets of commemorative chips, badges, etc.

Other BARGE traditions include multiple poker tournaments, a blackjack tournament, a video poker tournament, the Official ADB Darkside [[Craps]] Crawl, a Sushi outing with Sake tasting, the Unofficial BARGE Smoker and Bourbon Tasting, Karaoke night, and the only known [[Community_card_poker#Chowaha|Chowaha]] games played in casino settings for real money.  [[Chinese Poker]] has also been played at BARGE for many years.

After the BARGE banquet on Saturday evening, another tradition is played out. 'Reindeer games' – various exotic poker games—are spread.  These games include or have included [[Community_card_poker#Chowaha|Chowaha]], first spread at Binion's
in 1997; Binglaha (a variant of Omaha, in which whether the game is played high-only or high/low is determined after the flop betting by a roll of a die), first spread at Binion's in 2003, 'Must-drink, must-toke [[HORSE]]', and [[Lowball (poker)|Lowball]].

Whenever anyone busts out of a BARGE tournament, they are given a round of applause; not as an ironic gesture, but as a thank-you for participating in BARGE. Many players also bring a "bust-out gift," which they give to the player who busted them. These are typically small, memorable tokens, but have included such gifts as a decoupage "Last Supper" featuring Chris "Jesus" Ferguson (the late Don Perry's gift in 2005, the year he won) and an iPad (JK Scheinberg's gift in 2010).

The winner of the No-Limit tournament is traditionally tasked with designing a set of chips for next year's BARGE, with some sort of commemorative design.  These chip sets are then sold the next year.  The BARGE Chip Committee, currently headed by Patrick Milligan (circa 2008), helps the winner with the logistics and artwork.

'''Buck buck''' (also known as '''Johnny-on-a-Pony''', or '''Johnny-on-the-Pony''') is a children's [[game]] with several variants.&lt;ref name="ARE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dare.wisc.edu/?q=node/70 |title=buck buck | work=[[Dictionary of American Regional English]] |accessdate=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One version of the game is played when "one player climbs another’s back" and the climber guesses "the number of certain objects out of sight."&lt;ref name="ARE" /&gt; Another version of the game is played with "one group of players &lt;nowiki&gt;[climbing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the backs of a second group in order to build as large a pile as possible or to cause the supporting players to collapse."&lt;ref name="ARE" /&gt;

As early as the 16th century, children in Europe and the Near East played Buck, Buck, which had been called "''Bucca Bucca quot sunt hic?''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=221–222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ealms5PGJj0C&amp;pg=PT221#v=onepage | chapter=Johnny Ride a Pony|title=The Big Book of Rules: Board Games, Kids' Games, Card Games, from Backgammon and Bocce to Tiddlywinks and Stickball|author=Spadaccini, Stephanie|author2=John Farnsworth|last-author-amp=yes|year=2005|publisher=[[Penguin (publisher)|Penguin]]|isbn=978-0-452-28644-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hindman|first=Sandra|title=Pieter Bruegel's Children's Games, Folly, and Chance|journal=[[The Art Bulletin]]|date=September 1981|volume=LXIII|issue=3|pages=470–471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s painting [[Children's Games (Bruegel)|"Children's Games" (1560)]] depicts children playing a variant of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/Brueghel/pony.html | title=Game: Johnny On A Pony (Detail from Brueghel's Painting) | publisher=[[University of Waterloo]] | work=''Elliot Avedon Virtual Museum of Games'' | date=February 9, 2010 | accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Games and Great Ideas: A Guide for Elementary School Physical Educators and Classroom Teachers |author=Clements, Rhonda L. |page=10 |isbn=978-0-313-29460-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYi0CfWmzpUC&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q |year=1995| publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the game is sometimes called '''High Cockalorum''', but has a large number of different names in various local dialects. These include: 'Polly on the Mopstick' in [[Birmingham]], 'Strong Horses, Weak Donkeys' in [[Monmouthshire]], 'Hunch, Cuddy, Hunch' in west [[Scotland]], 'Mont-a-Kitty' in [[Middlesbrough]], 'Husky Fusky Finger or Thumb' in [[Nottinghamshire]], 'High Jimmy Knacker' in [[east London]], 'Jump the Knacker 1-2-3' in [[Watford]], 'Wall-e-Acker' or 'Warny Echo' in [[West London (sub region)|north West London]], 'Stagger Loney' in [[Cardiff]] and 'Trust' in [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/12/letters.theobserver |title=The Observer - Your Letters |last1= |first1= |date=12 August 2007  |website=theguardian.com |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=25 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is sometimes played in the [[mess|sergeants' or officers' messes]] of the [[British Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pprune.org/military-aviation/245199-mess-games-where-s-original-btw.html |title=Aircrew Forums - Military - Mess games |last1= |first1= |date=24 September 2006 |website=pprune.org |publisher=Professional Pilots Rumour Network |access-date=25 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other national variants==
{{original research section|date=January 2017}}
A similar game is played in South Korea (malttukbakgi)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWp8NR-wY58]. There is even a statue depicting it.[http://i.imgur.com/aTaya.jpg] Malttukbakgi (말뚝박기) is a game that both Korean girls and boys play up until high school. In malttukbakgi, there are two teams. Team A has one person stand up against the wall and the rest of the team have all their heads up in someone else’s butt/crotch area to form what looks like a big horse. Team B then jumps up onto the human horse one by one, each jumping with as much force as possible. If anyone from any team falls to the floor, that team loses. If everyone stays up, then the person against the wall and the person in front will play a game of gawibawibo (rock, scissor, paper) to determine the winner.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7t7yRicDA Turkish] [http://www.turkishculture.org/lifestyles/turkish-culture-portal/turkish-childrens-games-750.htm?type=1 game] called Uzun Essek, or "Long Donkey." The person standing up is called the Pillow, or the referee. One team bends over as you see in the picture, then the other team one by one jumps on the "Donkey." If the Donkey can stand the pressure, the first person to go in the jumping team puts up one or two with his fingers. If the donkey can guess the number right, they get to jump. If the jumpers fall to the ground, it is the donkey's turn to jump. If the donkey falls, the jumpers jump again.

==In popular culture==
[[Bill Cosby]]'s 1967 album ''[[Revenge (Bill Cosby album)|Revenge]]'' includes a track "Buck, Buck" in which he describes playing the game as a child. He mentions that in his hometown of [[Philadelphia]] it was called "Buck Buck," while in [[New York City]] it was known as "Johnny on the Pony." This track introduces [[Fat Albert]], "the baddest Buck Buck breaker in the world," who "weighed 2,000 pounds" and could cause earthquakes when he ran down the street. The character would later become the basis for the cartoon series ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'' which includes a buck buck episode (season 1 episode 6). The same story, in a slightly different form, is also included in Cosby's book ''Childhood''.

In the 2014 ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' film, the heroes use a game of buck buck as an attack that is key to their defeat of the main villain.&lt;ref&gt;M. Enois Duarte, "[http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/13353/teenagemutantninjaturtles2014.html Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) (Dolby Atmos)]", ''High-Def Digest'' (December 17th, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cheetahs San Diego CA.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Cheetahs, in [[San Diego]], California]]

'''Cheetah's Topless Club''' is a "[[strip club|gentleman's club]]" or topless bar located in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], best known for being featured in the 1995 movie ''[[Showgirls]]'', and also for having been owned by Mike Galardi, a nightclub owner who was investigated by the [[FBI]] with a controversial invocation of the ''[[Patriot Act]]''. The Cheetah's club in San Diego is a full nude club where no alcohol is served. It has achieved notoriety for having been frequented by some of the September 11 hijackers.

==Las Vegas Club==
The Las Vegas club was founded in 1991 by Michael Galardi, and employs about 150 dancers.  In 2004, Galardi admitted in a San Diego federal trial that he bribed Las Vegas officials in an attempt to influence strip club regulations.  In a Las Vegas federal court, he stated that he paid between $200,000 and $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Jan-24-Sat-2004/news/23067753.html |title=Liquor license status: Cheetah's owner to contest LV fine |publisher=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |first=Michael  |last=Squires |date=January 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club is managed by [[The Godfather (wrestler)|Charles Wright]], a retired [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known for his stints in [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] as a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] [[witch doctor]] ("Papa Shango") and as a [[pimp]] ("The Godfather"), and was also part of the [[Nation of Domination]] under the name Kama Mustafa.

In an April 2012 episode of NBC's ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]'', the New York City club entrance can be seen when Megan Hilty's character Ivy Lynn walks down the street.

The first planned collaboration between Khan and Shetty was a remake of ''[[Angoor (1982 film)|Angoor]]'' (1982).

Conceived as a "commercial" [[Romance film|romance]], the film was originally titled ''Ready Steady Po''. Filming began in [[Mehboob Studio]] in October 2012 and was completed by May 2013. A large part of the film was set in [[Ooty]], for which sets were constructed in Wai. The soundtrack for ''Chennai Express'' was composed by [[Vishal–Shekhar]], with the background score being composed by Amar Mohile. [[UTV Motion Pictures]] acquired the distribution rights of the film.

''Chennai Express'' was released theatrically in overseas markets on 8 August 2013 and a day later in India. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Regardless, it broke several box office records in India and abroad, becoming the quickest film to collect {{INRConvert|1|b}} net domestically. The film surpassed ''[[3 Idiots]]'' to become the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Bollywood film]] worldwide at that point. As of March 2018, it is the eleventh-highest-grossing Bollywood film worldwide. ''Chennai Express'' is also the first Bollywood film which was released on the same day in India and Peru.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Plot==
Rahul Mithaiwala is an orphaned bachelor living in [[Mumbai]]. Raised by his grandparents from the age of eight, Rahul's grandfather owns a chain of confectionery shops. Before his grandfather's 100th-birthday celebration, two of Rahul's friends invite him to accompany them on a vacation in [[Goa]], which he accepts. Rahul's grandfather dies on the eve of the celebration, just when he witnesses [[Sachin Tendulkar]] on TV in a [[cricket]] match get [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissed]] on his 99th [[Run (cricket)|run]]. His grandmother tells Rahul that his grandfather wanted his ashes to be divided into two parts{{mdash}}one of each to be immersed in the [[Ganges|Ganga]] and [[Rameswaram]]. She asks Rahul to take the ashes to Rameswaram and disperse them. Reluctantly, he accepts her request but is also eager to attend the Goa trip.

Rahul and his friends plan to dump the ashes at Goa but his grandmother wants to see him off, forcing Rahul to travel by train. He books a single ticket on the ''Chennai Express'', planning to meet his friends along the way, at [[Kalyan Junction railway station|Kalyan Junction station]]. However, Rahul forgets to take the ashes, and he almost misses the train when he returns to collect them. As he tries to leave the train, he notices a young woman running to board it. He helps her and four other people board the moving train, but the train leaves the station before he can get off.

Rahul tries to flirt with the woman, who starts communicating by singing parodies of [[Bollywood song and dance|Hindi film songs]], and explains that the four men are trying to kidnap her. Rahul lends her his mobile phone so that she can contact her friends, but the men with her grab it and throw it from the train. Rahul is annoyed, but says nothing because the men are carrying weapons. Rahul tells the Travelling Ticket Examiner about them, but they push the inspector into a river below a bridge. Panicked, Rahul learns that the men are her cousins, and that her name is Meenalochni "Meena" Azhagusundaram. She is fleeing from a [[forced marriage]] to ruffian Tangaballi. Her father, Durgeshwara Azhagusundaram is a powerful headman of the local mafia in [[Tamil Nadu]].

Meena takes Rahul to her father and introduces him as her lover. Tangaballi challenges Rahul to a duel that Rahul unknowingly accepts, due to his lack of knowledge in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. On the night of the duel, Rahul escapes with the help of a local policeman, Shamsher, but he ends up on a ship with Sri Lankan terrorists and smugglers. A gun battle ensues between the police force and the terrorists. When the police officers investigate and take Rahul into custody, he tells his story and ends up back in Komban.

Terrified and once again surrounded by Azhagusundaram's sickle-wielding henchmen, Rahul pretends to take Meena hostage and escapes with her in her father's car, battling Azhagasundaram's men. When the car breaks down, Rahul and Meena quarrel and part ways. Rahul, not knowing which way to go, returns to Meena, who takes him to the Vidhamba village. Meena tells the villagers that they are a married couple who needs protection and rest, to which the villagers agree.

Meena then realises that she has fallen in love with Rahul. When Rahul plans to sneak away, she argues, not wanting to earn the villagers' distrust. Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to disperse his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going. He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her.

Rahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Azhagusundaram and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul is bigger than their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves a message that love knows no regional or language barriers and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what the common man can achieve.

==Production==
===Development and casting===
[[Mayank]] and [[Rohit Shetty]] had originally planned to team up with [[Shah Rukh Khan]] for a remake of the 1982 film, ''[[Angoor (1982 film)|Angoor]]''. After the 2011 blockbuster ''[[Singham]]'', Shetty had begun writing the script of the film but left it half-finished. The script of ''Chennai Express'' was ready for Khan as a back-up, because of the difficulty of obtaining the actor's filming dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/srk-says-yes-to-rohit-shettys-chennai-express-602786 |publisher=[[NDTV]] |title=SRK says yes to Rohit Shetty's Chennai Express |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113190321/http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/srk-says-yes-to-rohit-shettys-chennai-express-602786 |archivedate=13 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reading the script, Khan liked the idea and agreed to star in it before the ''Angoor'' remake, causing ''Angoor''{{'s}} remake to be postponed. Shetty said the film is "a hard-core commercial film with a romantic angle. The story is about this man's travel from Mumbai to Rameshwaram and what happens during the journey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/celebrities/features/type/view/id/2889 |title=I'm making Chennai Express with SRK – Rohit Shetty |publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |date=16 November 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207233235/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/celebrities/features/type/view/id/2889 |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 68 minutes of footage were enhanced with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] by [[Reliance MediaWorks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/slideshow/type/view/id/1518|title=68 minutes of CGI to augment narrative|author=Philip Bode|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|date=5 September 2013|accessdate=27 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113185544/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/slideshow/type/view/id/1518|archivedate=13 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SRK at CE promotion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Chennai Express'' was initially written as a backup project for Khan (pictured).]]
Khan was the first actor to be approached with the script and was the first lead actor to be signed for the film. Rohit Shetty stated that despite the title, Khan would not play a South Indian in the film. The casting of the lead heroine was the subject of much press speculation; [[Kareena Kapoor]], [[Asin]] and [[Deepika Padukone]] were rumoured to be involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/news/2012/shahrukh-khan-beefy-muscles-chennai-express-190312.html |title=Shahrukh Khan develops Beefy Muscles for Chennai Express |author=Nabanita |publisher=[[One India]] |date=19 March 2012 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002100837/http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/news/2012/shahrukh-khan-beefy-muscles-chennai-express-190312.html |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shetty denied those rumours, stating that the cast would be finalised in April 2012, and that he was going to cast an established actress in the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/news/2012/shahrukh-khan-chennai-express-lady-mystery-210212.html |title=Rohit Shetty Furious |publisher=[[One India]] |author=Nabanita |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002101206/http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/news/2012/shahrukh-khan-chennai-express-lady-mystery-210212.html |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, it was confirmed that [[Deepika Padukone]] had been signed to play the female lead opposite Khan, and photographs showing Padukone and Khan shooting were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/j5ue1kjP0Dus3qKfDCMf6M/Deepika-Padukone-This-time-I-bullied-him-a-lot.html|title=I bullied Shah Rukh Khan a lot: Deepika Padukone on Chennai Express|first=Udita|last=Jhunjhunwala|date=7 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Padukone's second film opposite Khan, with whom she made her Bollywood debut in the 2007 blockbuster ''[[Om Shanti Om]]''.&lt;ref name="filming"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/photogallery/7579-7.html |title=StarGaze: SRK, Deepika Padukone on the sets of 'Chennai Express' and more |publisher=[[CNN-IBN]] |date=6 October 2012 |accessdate=14 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009233650/http://ibnlive.in.com/photogallery/7579-7.html |archivedate=9 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/chennai-express-deepika-to-star-with-shah-rukh/281584-8-66.html|title=Deepika to star with Shah Rukh|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=12 August 2012|accessdate=14 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009233704/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/chennai-express-deepika-to-star-with-shah-rukh/281584-8-66.html|archivedate=9 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with this film, which was released on Women's Day, Khan wished to have the name of his female co-star appear above his own in the credits.&lt;ref name=LadiesFirst&gt;{{cite news|title=Women's Day: It's ladies first for Shah Rukh Khan|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Womens-Day-Its-ladies-first-for-Shah-Rukh-Khan/articleshow/18843611.cms|newspaper=The Times of India|author=Thakkar, Mehul S|date=17 March 2013|accessdate=30 August 2014|quote=Starting with his upcoming film Chennai Express, the credit rolls will not feature his name first, but that of his leading actress.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311235943/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Womens-Day-Its-ladies-first-for-Shah-Rukh-Khan/articleshow/18843611.cms|archivedate=11 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 2013, the [[Nationalist]] political party [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]]'s film wing threatened to disrupt the film's premiere; it reportedly attempted to dislodge ongoing popular Marathi movies from cinemas that show only one film at a time. The party was upset with reports that the distributors of ''Chennai Express'' had demanded prime slots in single screen cinemas, and at some multiplexes, where the superhit Marathi film ''[[Duniyadari]]'' had been popular since 19 July. On 1 August 2013, both the film directors, Rohit Shetty and Sanjay Jadhav were called on by [[Raj Thackeray]] to find a solution. After listening to both parties, Thackeray ruled that if ''Duniyadari'' was not removed from single screen cinemas across the state, then the MNS would not object to the release of ''Chennai Express'' in Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/raj-thackeray-gives-chennai-express-green-signal-after-meeting-rohit-shetty-400076 |title=Raj Thackeray gives Chennai Express green signal after meeting Rohit Shetty |publisher=[[NDTV]] |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |date=1 August 2013 |accessdate=2 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802065833/http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/raj-thackeray-gives-chennai-express-green-signal-after-meeting-rohit-shetty-400076 |archivedate=2 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chennai Express'' was released in 10 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/chennai-express-will-be-released-in-ten-languages/story-20AD7zC1IyTPpjNKLtd1fN.html |title=Chennai Express will be released in ten languages |accessdate=2018-02-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203181336/https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/chennai-express-will-be-released-in-ten-languages/story-20AD7zC1IyTPpjNKLtd1fN.html |archivedate=3 February 2018 |df=dmy-all |date=2013-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cinema of Algeria''' refers to the [[film industry]] based in the north African country of [[Algeria]]. 

==The colonial era ==
During the era of French colonization, movies were predominantly a propaganda tool for the French colonial state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqeQ3zN18JEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=France at War in the Twentieth Century: Propaganda, Myth, and Metaphor|last=Delporte|first=Christian|date=2000|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781571817013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although filmed in Algeria and viewed by the local population, the vast majority of "Algerian" cinema in this era was created by Europeans.

The colonial propaganda films themselves generally depicted a stereotypical image of pastoral life in the colony, often focusing on an aspect of local culture that the administration sought to change,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} such as polygamy. One example of such a film is Albert Durec's 1928 ''Le Désir''.

Popular French cinema filmed or set in Algeria often echoed many of the tropes common in administration-funded films. For example, [[L'Atlantide (1921 film)|L'Atlantide]] was a wildly popular 1921 French-Belgian silent movie filmed in the [[Aurès Mountains]], [[Djidjelli]], and [[Algiers]] in what was then French Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abel|first=Richard|title=French Cinema: The First Wave, 1915-1929|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}}  Although not explicitly about Algeria, the movie (itself based on a popular book) depicts two French Foreign Legion officers and their love affair with the lascivious queen of a fictional Saharan kingdom. One of the earliest films to engage with the French presence in North Africa, the film emphasizes not only the romance and exoticism of the venture, but also European anxieties over their role in Africa and the possibly dangerous affects of inter-racial contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slavin|first=David Henry|title=Colonial Cinema and Imperial France, 1919–1939: White Blind Spots, Male Fantasies, Settler Myths|year=2001|publisher=JHU Press|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other films with similar themes followed, including ''Le Bled'' (1929), ''[[Le Grand Jeu (1934 film)|Le Grand Jeu]]'' (1934), and ''[[La Bandera (film)|La Bandera]]'' (1935).

European domination of the means of cinematic production ended in the early days of the Algerian War, when several Algerian nationalists from the [[Armée de Libération nationale|National Liberation Army]] (ALN) obtained basic film-making equipment which they used to create four short programs. These films were screened via a relay system to viewers in a variety of sympathetic socialist nations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Their content supported the growing nationalist rebellion, including the place of ALN hospitals and a [[Mujahideen]] attack on the French mines of the [[Société de l'Ouenza]].

==The emergence of Algerian cinema in the 1960s and 1970s==
Algeria became an independent nation in 1962, a topic which garnered heavy attention amongst Algerian movie productions of the 1960s and 1970s.

[[Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina]]'s canonical 1967 film ''[[The Winds of the Aures]]'' depicts a rural farming family whose lives are destroyed by colonialism and war. The plot depicts the tragic plight of a mother who leaves her home in the Aurès mountains of eastern Algeria to search desperately for her son, a nationalist who has followed in his father's footsteps but been captured by the French army. Symbolically, the film uses the family to represent the fate of the nation: impoverished, exploited, but struggling to be free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spaas|first=Lieve|title=Francophone Film: A Struggle for Identity|year=2001|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=135–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won an award at the [[1967 Cannes Film Festival]] for Best First Work.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2754/year/1967.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Winds of the Aures |accessdate=2009-03-08 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208075338/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2754/year/1967.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Algeria, one of the most famous films of this era is [[The Battle of Algiers]] (1966), an Algerian-Italian film that obtained three Oscar nominations.

Other examples of Algerian cinema from this era include ''[[Patrol in the East]]'' (1972) by ''[[Amar Laskri]]'', ''[[Prohibited Area]]'' (1972) by ''[[Ahmed Lallem]]'', ''[[The Opium and the Stick]]'' (1970) by [[Ahmed Rachedi (film director)|Ahmed Rachedi]], Palme d'Or-winner ''[[Chronicle of the Years of Fire]]'' (1975) by [[Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina]], and [[Costa Gavras]]' [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]''. A notable French-Algerian documentary about the aftermath of the war is the 1963 [[Peuple en marche]].

Along with decolonization and the Algerian War, the plight of urban youth is another common theme. One example of this theme is [[Merzak Allouache]]'s ''[[Omar Guetlato]]''.

Several comedy stars also emerged, including the very popular ''[[Rouiched]]'', star of ''[[Hassan Terro]]'' or ''[[Hassan Taxi]]''. In addition, [[Hadj Abderrahmane]] - better known under the pseudonym of the ''Inspector Tahar'' - starred in the 1973 comedy ''[[The Holiday of The Inspector Tahar]]'' directed by [[Musa Haddad]]. The most famous comedy of this period is ''[[Carnaval fi dechra]]'' directed by [[Mohamed Oukassi]], and starting [[Athman Ariouet]].

==Contemporary cinema, 1980 to the present==
Algerian cinema slumped in the mid-1980s, and major productions became rare. Some{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} attribute this fact to the state's unwillingness to subsidize Algerian film. There were a few success, including [[Mohamed Oukassi]]'s 1994 comedy ''[[Carnival fi Dachra]]'', filmed in [[Maghrebi Arabic]] and following the story of a man who runs for mayor of his village (or "dachra") only to be seduced by power and seek to become the president of Algeria. Director [[Merzak Allouache]]'s ''[[Athmane Aliouet]]'' and "[[Salut Cousin!]]" (1996) are two other examples of Algerian comedies produced in this era.

Some {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} characterize contemporary Algerian cinema to be in a rebuilding phase. The recent trend has been an increase of Francophone cinema, as opposed to films in  [[Algerian Arabic]]. Some {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} attribute this to the Francophone market encouraged by increased [[immigration to France]] in the 1990s. For example, Franco-Algerian productions such as [[Rachid Bouchareb]]'s ''[[Outside the Law (2010 film)|Outside the Law]]'' have met with great success (and controversy).

:A rakugo storyteller known for his perfectionist style of rakugo. His birth name is never specified, although Sukeroku took to call him "Bon". He was given the name "'''Kikuhiko'''" when he became a student of the Seventh Generation Yakumo. He was originally a dancer, but he ruined his leg in an accident and ended up being given to Yakumo. During his time as a student, he would struggle to find his own rakugo having placed too much emphasis on flawless execution, but he was able to find inspiration thanks to Sukeroku. He would go on to inherit the Yakumo name, but initially he refused thinking that he was not worthy of it. Following the deaths of Sukeroku and Miyokichi, he inherited the name to fulfill Sukeroku's vision of keeping rakugo going in a time where tastes in entertainment change. He would later on become the head of the rakugo association.
;{{Nihongo|Second Generation Sukeroku Yurakutei|二代目 有楽亭 助六|Nidaime Yūrakutei Sukeroku}} / {{Nihongo|Hatsutaro|初太郎|Hatsutarō}}

Despite his talent for rakugo, Yakumo refused to pass on his name to him due to the rebellious nature of his rakugo.  Following a heated argument, he was expelled from the school. He would move to the countryside to marry Miyokichi and start a family where he would spend his life drinking away in depression until Kikuhiko arrived to bring him back to doing rakugo again. He and Miyokichi died when they fell from a balcony in an inn where Sukeroku gives his last performance with Kikuhiko.
;{{Nihongo|Third Generation Sukeroku Yurakutei|三代目 有楽亭 助六|Sandaime Yūrakutei Sukeroku}} / {{Nihongo|Yotaro|与太郎|Yotarō}} / {{Nihongo|Kyoji|強次|Kyōji}}

Having been a big admirer of Kikuhiko's rakugo he decides to become his student. His desire to inherit Sukeroku's name that leads to conflicts between him and Yakumo due to Yakumo not wanting his brand of rakugo to be corrupted.

:A young woman who worked as a Geisha who first appeared as the Seventh Generation Yakumo's mistress whom he met in Manchuria. She became attracted to Kikuhiko due to his aloof personality and the two developed an on-again-off-again relationship. Eventually Kikuhiko rejected her and out of spite she began a relationship with Sukeroku which resulted in her becoming pregnant with their daughter, Konatsu. Sukeroku and Miyokichi eventually left for the countryside after Sukeroku's expulsion. However, she did not care for Sukeroku or Konatsu and instead turned to prostitution to earn money. After Kikuhiko appeared and rejected her advances again, she attempted suicide, but Sukeroku convinced her to stop. However, she slipped from a balcony and in his attempt to save her, both Miyokichi and Sukeroku fell to their deaths. However the actual cause of her death was revealed much later in the series. Her true given name was "'''Yurie'''".
;{{Nihongo|Konatsu|小夏}}
:{{anime voices|[[Yu Kobayashi]]}}
:Played by: [[Riko Narumi]] 
:Sukeroku's and Miyokichi's daughter. She learned her father's style of rakugo to entertain customers at a soba shop in the countryside. Following the death of her parents, Kikuhiko became her legal guardian. She holds a great deal of resentment for Kikuhiko as she initially believed he was responsible for her father's death, and more recently because he represents the 'old-fashioned' traditional rakugo that does not allow women to participate. She later gave birth to a child named Shinnosuke whose biological father's identity is not yet revealed. Later in the series, it was revealed that she had witnessed the death of Sukeroku and Miyokichi but had lost her memories of the incident.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">'''Fraser Film Release and Photographic Company''' was an Australian film company formed in 1912 by two brothers, Archie and Colin Fraser. It operated as a film exchange, importing movies from overseas, and production house, making shorts, features and documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26905393 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=16 May 1914 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120279958 |title=FRASER FILM EXCHANGE. |newspaper=[[The Referee (newspaper)|The Referee]]|location=Sydney |date=23 December 1914 |accessdate=9 November 2014 |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early financial support came from [[Giuseppe Borsalino]], an Italian businessman who invested in Italian films and used Fraser Films as an Australia outlet for his company.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Shirley and Brian Adams, ''Australian Cinema: The First Eighty Years'', Currency Press 1989 p 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Among the filmmakers who worked for them were [[Franklyn Barrett]], [[Raymond Longford]] and [[Alfred Rolfe (director)|Alfred Rolfe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120359799 |title=The Lure of the Movies—A Mammoth Enterprise. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sydney)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Sydney |date=1 March 1914 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |page=2 Supplement: SUNDAY TIMES GLOBE PICTORIAL |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some early successes, the company suffered from pressure exerted by the "combine" of [[Australasian Films]] and decline of production from Europe due to World War I where Fraser brought many of their films. The company wound up in 1918.&lt;ref name="Pike"&gt;Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, ''Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p 39&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fårö''' ({{IPA-sv|²foːrøː}}) is a [[Baltic Sea]] island just off north of the island of [[Gotland]], itself off mainland Sweden's southeastern coast. It is the second-largest island in the province and it is a popular summer resort. It has its own dialect (''Faroymal'', a dialect of [[Gutnish]]). Formerly a [[socken]] which includes the [[Gotska Sandön]] island,&lt;ref&gt;The exact extent of the socken, now district, can be obtained by clicking on ''Kartinställningar'' and check the ''Socken'' box in the menu of [http://www.fmis.raa.se/cocoon/fornsok/search.html?parish=920&amp;tab=2&amp;page=1 this map] from the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] database.&lt;/ref&gt; on 1{{nbsp}}January 2016, it was reconstituted into the [[Registration districts in Sweden|administrative area]] Fårö District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Förordning om district|trans-title=Regulation of districts|url=http://rkrattsdb.gov.se/SFSdoc/15/150493.PDF|date=17 June 2015|publisher=[[Ministry of Finance (Sweden)|Ministry of Finance]]|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Gotland-Fårö-kyrka 01.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Fårö Church]]
The island is separated from Gotland by the narrow Fårö-strait, and connected by two [[Ferry|car ferries]], operated by the [[Swedish Transport Administration]]. It has a total area of {{convert|111.35|sqkm|sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, of which {{convert|9.7|sqkm|sqmi|1|abbr=off}} are water areas or [[islet]]s.

On the islands of Fårö and Gotland are rock formations called "[[Stack (geology)|Rauk]]". They are a result of erosion during the [[Ice age]] and are unique to Gotland and Fårö.

The medieval [[Fårö Church]] is on Fårö.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lagerlöf|first1=Erland|last2=Svahnström|first2=Gunnar|title=Gotlands kyrkor|trans-title=Gotland's Churces|language=Swedish|id={{LIBRIS|7232718}}|date=1973|publisher=[[Rabén &amp; Sjögren]]|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-29-41035-5|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[asteroid]]s in the [[Asteroid belt]], [[List of minor planets: 9001–10000|9358 Fårö]], is [[List of Gotland related asteroids|named]] after the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=9358|title=9358 Faro (1992 DN7)|accessdate=6 June 2016|publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "Fårö" (in [[Modern Gutnish|Gutnish]] "Faroy") is derived from the words "ö", meaning island, and probably "far-", which is a [[word stem]] associated with travel like in the Swedish verb "fara" (to travel). The word Fårö probably means the island you have to travel to or the traveler's island. Mainland Swedes might misinterpret the name Fårö to be derived from ''får'', the (standard) Swedish word for [[sheep]], due to the many sheep on the island. That word is absent from [[Modern Gutnish]], which uses the word "lamm" (which in Swedish means "lamb").{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Military past==
{{Main article|Military on Gotland}}
Until the 1990s, Fårö and the North of Gotland were off-limits to foreigners because of a government military installation there.&lt;ref name="travel.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/travel/07cultured.html?pagewanted=print|work=The New York Times|first=Danielle|last=Pergament|title=The Enchanted Island That Bergman Called Home|date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were large, multilingual signs at the side of the roads informing visitors of this and the prohibition was strictly enforced. After the [[Cold War]] ended, the installation ([[Swedish Coastal Artillery]] regiment KA 3) was mostly shut down. A relic of the island's military past is a {{convert|203|m|ft}} tall radio mast at Holmudden at 57°57'33" N and  19°20'46" E.

==Cinematic heritage==
Swedish filmmaker [[Ingmar Bergman]] lived and died on Fårö and several of his films were filmed there, among them ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]'' (1961), ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'' (1966), ''[[Hour of the Wolf]]'' (1968), ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]'' (1968), ''[[The Passion of Anna]]'' (1969), and ''[[Scenes from a Marriage]]'' (1972),&lt;ref name="travel.nytimes.com"/&gt; as well as [[Liv Ullmann]]’s ''[[Faithless (2000 film)|Faithless]]'' (2000), based on a Bergman screenplay. The [[Bergman Week]] is tribute to the filmmaker held on the island every June.&lt;ref name=Boston&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peary|first1=gerald|title=For movie fans, an island getaway beckons|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/07/11/bergman_week_and_a_shrine_to_the_late_filmmaker_await_on_fr_sweden/|website=www.boston.com|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrei Tarkovsky]] wanted to film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' on Fårö but was denied access by the military. ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was filmed further south on [[Gotland]] at [[När]].

==Tourism==
An annual event on Fårö is "Fårönatta" (Fårö Night), held in September, during which restaurants and bars stay open all night, craft stands are set up and the church holds a midnight Mass.&lt;ref name="travel.nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Fårö districts==
[[File:Sudersand.jpg|thumb|Sudersand]]

=== Digerhuvud ===
The Digerhuvud coast with Bjärge [[nature reserve]] is the largest [[Stack (geology)|stack]] area in Sweden, with hundreds of stacks along a {{convert|3.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} part of the coast. Close by is the Helgumannen fishing village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digerhuvud|url=http://www.gotland.net/plats/digerhuvud|website=www.gotland.net|publisher=Gotlands Media AB|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enderborg|first1=Bernt|title=Helgumannen fiskeläge|url=http://www.guteinfo.com/?id=585|website=www.guteinfo.com|publisher=Guteinfo|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coast is not suited for swimming due to its depth (up to {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=off}} close to the shore), and its strong currents.

An [[asteroid]] in the [[Asteroid belt]], [[10102 Digerhuvud]], is [[List of Gotland related asteroids|named]] after the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10102 Digerhuvud (1992 DA6)|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=10102|publisher=NASA|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fårö Fyr'' (Fårö Lighthouse)===
The ''[[Fårö Lighthouse]]'' lies on the island's northeastern point. It is {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} high and was built between 1846 and 1847.

===Langhammars===
The Langhammars peninsula and the Langhammars nature reserve on north-western Fårö are rocky beaches with [[Ice age]] stone monoliths known as [[Stack (geology)|rauks]]. Langhammars was the setting for [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film [[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]].&lt;ref name="travel.nytimes.com"/&gt;

===Sudersand===
The long, sandy Sudersand beach on north-eastern Fårö lies next to Sudersands Semesterby which rents cabins to tourists.

'''''Getting Doug With High''''' is a video and audio [[podcast]] show hosted by [[United States|American]] [[stand-up comedian]] and actor [[Doug Benson]].

==Format==
The show is typically broadcast live on [[YouTube]] 15 minutes after the hour, which gives enough time for the guests to get ready to start smoking [[cannabis]] when it is "4:20 somewhere," [[420 (cannabis culture)|a time associated with marijuana culture]].

Guests are invited onto the show to be interviewed while smoking marijuana alongside Benson. Each episode features different strains of ''sativa'' and ''indica'', and showcases a series of smoking implements of unusual design, often including pipes designed by Chameleon Glass.

The show features several recurring segments:
* ''High History''—The guests talk about the first time they ever smoked marijuana
* ''Pot Topics''—Doug talks about news related to cannabis, with a particular focus on which states have legalized and/or decriminalized marijuana or are close to passing a legislative or ballot initiative to do so.
* ''Pot Quiz Hop Shot''—Doug asks the guests a series of cannabis-related trivia questions.
* ''#HeavyMonkey''—Doug tries to get one of the guests to comment about the weight of a broken lighter shaped like a monkey. 
* ''Gabe Time  (now canceled)''—To close out the show, Doug brings out magician Gabe Dylan to perform a magic trick for the guest, who by this point is usually very high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/behind-the-scenes-with-doug-benson-on-the-first-talk-show-for-celebrity-pot-smokers-191832737.html|title=Behind the scenes with Doug Benson on the first talk show for celebrity pot smokers|date=7 March 2014|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Benson hosted an uninterrupted four hour and twenty minute version of the show at a festival hosted by [[Jash]] in [[Palm Springs, California]]. The show has also hosted live versions of the show, with at least five guests, in front of an audience in a theater.

'''Herbie Popnecker''' is a fictional comic book character that first appeared in ''[[Forbidden Worlds]]'' #73 in December 1958, published by [[American Comics Group]]. He was created by [[Richard E. Hughes]] (using the [[pseudonym]] "Shane O'Shea")&lt;ref name=markstein&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/herbie.htm Herbie]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/657G8ILtG?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/herbie.htm |date=2012-02-01 }} and [http://www.toonopedia.com/fatfury.htm The Fat Fury]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66xEsWrRD?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/fatfury.htm |date=2012-04-16 }} at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].  Archived ([https://www.webcitation.org/6CwAJtR4j?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/articles/herbie.htm Herbie] and [https://www.webcitation.org/66xEsWrRD?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/fatfury.htm The Fat Fury]) from the originals on December 14, 2012, and April 16, 2012, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ogden Whitney]].

Herbie is an antithetical hero: short, obese, unstylish, and young.  Deriving some of his powers from genetics and some from magical [[lollipop]]s from "the Unknown", Herbie can talk to animals and sometimes even inanimate objects (who all know him by name), fly at high enough speeds to quickly travel to other galaxies (by walking through the sky), become invisible, cast spells and summon spirits from other dimensions, quickly dispatch his enemies with apparent ease, and (once he got his own title) travel through time. Herbie is emotionless, terse, irresistible to women, consulted by world leaders, nearly [[omnipotent]], and more powerful than [[Satan]].

== Publication history ==
Herbie made several appearances in ''Forbidden Worlds'', in issues #73, #94, #110, #114, and #116—the final two issues with Herbie featured on the cover. Herbie also made a [[cameo appearance]]—albeit very much out of character—in ''Unknown Worlds'' #20, published in 1961.

Herbie received his own title, ''Herbie'', in April 1964. The series ran for twenty-three issues until February 1967, shortly before the demise of American Comics Group.

== Fictional character biography ==
Herbie's parents are unaware of his great powers and fame. His mother is reasonably supportive, however his father, Pincus Popnecker, repeatedly refers to him as a "little fat nothing" and wishes he had a son who "did something". Pincus believes himself to be a financial genius and, despite his wholesome and conservative "1950s dad" appearance, constantly engages in harebrained schemes; he inevitably fails in spectacular fashion and winds up in varying levels of trouble. Herbie is always obliged to bail him out in each circumstance, though the clueless Pincus never notices this and always takes the credit for victory himself.

Herbie is practically always shown with a lollipop, and lollipops are the main subjects of several stories. Herbie can "bop" adversaries with his lollipops, immediately defeating them. Herbie intimidates his adversaries by asking them rhetorically, "You want I should bop you with this here lollipop?", which almost always results in them backing down.

=== Fat Fury ===
In ''Herbie'' #8 (March 1965), Herbie feels a need to become a costumed superhero, but after failing superhero school, he creates the Fat Fury by donning [[Union suit|full-body red underwear with a drop seat]], a blue cape, a blue plastic mask, and a [[plunger]] on his head. He is bare-footed. Herbie's obtuse father then begins to wish that his little fat nothing of a son could be more like the Fat Fury. 

As the Fat Fury, Herbie does not have any powers beyond the many he had before donning the costume. Although Herbie travels back in time, the Fat Fury never does. The Fat Fury was featured in even-numbered ''Herbie'' comics from #8 to #22.

== Powers ==
* Hypnotic eyes that can defeat opponents by staring
* Famous throughout history and able to depend on the help of others
* By talking to animals, able to gather information and use animals' abilities
* Powerful [[lollipop]]s (particularly hard-to-get [[cinnamon]]) provide [[superhuman strength]] and other special abilities
* Punching, often very rapidly
* Time travel (using a special lollipop and a [[grandfather clock]])
* Indestructibility—Herbie is often unaware he is even being attacked
* Fly, but doing so by walking upright. In addition to being able to walk on air and through space, he can walk underwater. Herbie can also fly underground and often breaks through walls
* Invisibility—early on, Herbie could become invisible, but stopped using that power by the third ''Herbie'' issue
* Magic—visiting the Unknown, a mysterious spirit world

== Recurring gags ==
There are many recurring gags in Herbie comics:
* Herbie speaks very little. He is terse, leaving out many words.
* Herbie is unemotional, in spite of everything around him, understating everything he says. Herbie's captions are free of exclamation points, except when his lollipops are threatened.
* Women swoon over Herbie, loving his round physique. Sometimes women who first loved Herbie eventually run off with an animal (e.g., alien bug king, gorilla, camel).
* Herbie encounters many [[look-alike]]s, most of whom he thinks are ugly.
* Although very obese, Herbie does not eat much, especially in later issues, although he sometimes sleeps while he eats. He is always sleeping, much to the dismay of his father.
* Herbie sometimes bites his adversaries, and sometimes they bite him.
* Herbie wears many disguises, most of which are absurd.
* Herbie often appears, to his embarrassment, in boxer shorts.
* Herbie sometimes happens to have just the right item for the job: marshmallows in King Arthur's time, worms to drop in Mao's mouth, a bicycle pump in his pocket, or a blowtorch in the frozen north. ("Never mind where I got it from, either.")&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Bob "The Popnecker Papers: A Herbie History," Amazing Heroes #173, November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==
In a review of the [[Dark Horse Comics]] collections ''Herbie: Volume One'' and ''Herbie: Volume Two'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Hughes' Herbie Popnecker as,
{{quote|...a corpulent kid with half-lidded eyes, thick glasses and a hideous bowl cut. His father calls him a "little fat nothing", not realizing that Herbie is actually a colossus striding across the cultural landscape of his era. With the aid of his super-empowering lollipops, Herbie punches out [[Sonny Liston]], confronts [[Fidel Castro]] and gets sent on a secret mission by [[U Thant]]. Hughes took a while to perfect his stories' tone of deadpan absurdity, but Whitney’s slightly stiff, matter-of-fact artwork improves the gags by understating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/books/review/Wolk-t.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Douglas |last=Wolk |authorlink=Douglas Wolk |date=December 5, 2008 |title=Holiday Books: Comics |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |archivedate=December 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CwFmR4vG?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/books/review/Wolk-t.html?_r=0 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Collections and revivals ==
In the 1990s, there were some attempts to revive Herbie. [[A-Plus Comics]] (which had purchased the [[American Comics Group]] reprint rights) published six black-and-white issues of reprints in 1991. [[Dark Horse Comics]] published two issues of a planned twelve in 1992, the first with a new story by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. ''[[Flaming Carrot Comics]]'' #31 (1994) featured an appearance by Herbie (words and pictures by [[Bob Burden]]).  [[America's Comic Group]] (a publisher affiliated with A+ Comics) published a new story written by [[Roger Broughton]] with artwork by Dan Day.

In 2008, [[Dark Horse Comics]] announced that they would reprint the original Herbie stories in a series of hardcover archive volumes.  The first Herbie Archives came out in August 2008 ({{ISBN|978-1-59307-987-1}}) and collects Herbie stories from ''Forbidden Worlds'' #73, 94, 110, 114, 116, ''Unknown Worlds'' #20, and ''Herbie'' #1–5.  The second came out in December 2008 ({{ISBN|978-1-59582-216-1}}), and collects issues #6–14.  The third and final volume came out in April 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-59582-302-1}}), and collects issues #15–23.

==Awards==
Herbie comics received the [[Alley Award]] for Best Humor Comic Book 1964 and 1965.
The Herbie Archives received the [[Eisner Award]] for Best Humor Publication in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4321">'''Hitlisten''', also known as '''Tracklisten''', is a [[Denmark|Danish]] top 40 [[record chart]] that is updated every Thursday [[midnight]] on the website hitlisten.nu. The weekly Danish singles chart [[Track Top-40]] combines the 40 best-selling tracks from [[Music download|legal music downloads]] and the sales of [[Single (music)|music singles]] on either [[Compact Disc|CD]] or [[Gramophone record|vinyl]]. The data are collected by [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Music Control]], who also compile the chart on behalf of [[IFPI]] (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry).

== 1965–1993: early IFPI charts ==
This chart began in April 1965 as a monthly top 20 chart compiled by the Danish branch of the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI). It was published in several major Danish newspapers. Prior to that several Danish charts were compiled by competing newspapers.
From April 1969 it went weekly after Denmark's Radio stopped publishing their weekly top 20 chart.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jigEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=denmark+singles+chart+international+federation+of+the+phonographic+industry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ul11Al9x3h&amp;sig=5qX9fX3IXyJ4D7dr41Lt-pwbdxw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gW8fT6raBsre0QGrg-wF&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Billboard: IFPI forms sales chart (May 3, 1969)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
From May 1973 to December 1978 singles and albums were presented on the same chart due to a request from Denmark's Radio for variety in their chart show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danskehitlister.dk/?hitlist_id=12&amp;y=1973&amp;hitlist_item_id=1361 The first mixed IFPI chart from May 1 1973]&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period only few singles reached the top. The formats were finally split again in January 1979.

== 1993–2001: Nielsen Music Control and IFPI ==
Danish IFPI continued producing single charts in the 1980s and 1990s even though not many singles were sold. From 1993 the Danish charts have been compiled by [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Music Control]] (originally AC Nielsen).

== 2001–2007: Hitlisten ==
The Danish Singles Chart Hitlisten consisting of Single Top-20 and Download Top 20 was relaunched 1 January 2001 and served as official chart for Danish [[record sales]] until end of October 2007.

== 2007–present: Tracklisten/Hitlisten ==
The track list was established on 2 November 2007 replacing the Hitlisten charts that were discontinued end of October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pladebranchen.nu/?id=426 |title=Hit-nyt: Singlelisten bliver til Tracklisten |date=2007-10-23 |publisher=IFPI Danmark}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=da&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=da&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pladebranchen.nu%2F%3Fid%3D426 English translation])&lt;/ref&gt; The chart is supervised by [[IFPI Denmark]] and contains three charts:
*[[Track Top-40]] (for singles)
*[[Album Top-40]] (for albums)
*Streaming Top-20. (for singles)

Hitlisten also continues to publish specialised charts:
*Compilation Top-10
*Bit Album Top-20
*Bit Track Top-20
*Ringtoner Top-10
*Airplay Top-20 (for radio airplays)
*Musik DVD Top-10
*Entertainment DVD Top-10
*TV-serie DVD Top-20

Track list was also updated back to week 1, 2007, thus creating an overlap of sometimes differing chart #1s between Hitlisten and Tracklisten for the period 1 January 2007 and 2 November 2007 (weeks 1 to 42 / 2007). For this period, the Hitlisten charts continue to be considered as the official charts for singles record sales.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

'''Humorina'''  ({{lang-ru|Юморина}}, '''Yumorina''') is an annual festival of [[humor]] held in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]] on and around the [[April Fools' Day]] since 1973. It was invented in 1972 by the Odessa [[KVN]] team after the all-[[Soviet Union|Union]] KVN contests and the corresponding [[TV show]] were discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umorina2007.od.ua/?t=history Humorina timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928122749/http://www.umorina2007.od.ua/?t=history |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Imperia Online JSC was officially founded in September 2009, but the idea for it was born along with its main product - the [[Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game|MMORTS]] Imperia Online. Detailed research and crafting of the gameplay, mechanics and programming for the company's main product were done by the game’ and company's founders Dobroslav Dimitrov - Gameplay Designer, and Moni Dochev - Freelance Developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Imperia Online: How to Build a Game for 25 Million Users?|url=http://80.lv/articles/interview-with-imperia-online-how-to-build-a-game-for-25-million-users/|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005 an idea grows into a concept and on August 23 Era 1 of Realm 1 of Imperia Online goes live and the story begins.

In 2006 realms of 2 brand new upgraded Imperia Online's versions are officially live. The game is translated into 12 languages thanks to the freelance Community managers and translators the company assigned. In the same year the first of its kind Imperia Online tournament is held - Nomads Invasions.

In 2007 Imperia Online JSC launched Galactic Imperia - a new web-based project with Modern Military context.

Almost a whole year of conceptualizing complicated game mechanics leads to the final publication of Global Wars in March 2008.

In 2009, Imperia Online JSC launched its first [[role-playing game]] - [[Imperial Hero]]. The [[Role-playing game|RPG]] was published after a year of conceptual and technical development. Again in 2009 Ludo was launched for [[iOS]] and [[Facebook]] - the classic turn-based board game now can be played with thousands of real players online.

'''''Impossible Mission II''''' is a 1988 [[computer game]] developed by [[Appaloosa Interactive|Novotrade]] and published by [[Epyx]]. It was released for the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Enterprise 128|Enterprise 64 and 128]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[MS-DOS]] based PCs, [[Atari ST]], [[Apple IIe]] with at least 128K, [[Apple IIc]], [[Apple IIGS]] and [[Amiga]] computers. In 2004, it was one of the games featured on the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]].

''Impossible Mission II'' is a direct sequel to Epyx's 1984 game ''[[Impossible Mission]]''. The game follows directly from the same plot, with Elvin Atombender seeking revenge, and the player having to stop him. The overall game structure and basic gameplay is mostly similar, but there are a few differences and new features.

==Gameplay==
The game takes place in Elvin's [[fortress]], which consists of nine [[tower]]s.&lt;ref name="Retro122"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bevan | first= Mike | date = December 2013 | title = The History of... Impossible Mission | work = [[Retro Gamer]] | issue = 122 | pages = 44–49 | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the eight outer towers has a specific theme, such as [[computer]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[furniture]] and so on. Each tower consists of several rooms connected by two vertical corridors with [[elevator]]s and two horizontal corridors leading to other towers.  The corridors leading between different towers are locked, and can only be unlocked by figuring out a numerical puzzle.

Each tower contains the numbers zero through nine in three different colors.  The computer interface allows the player to try various number combinations to see if they are correct.

The elevator to the central tower is unlocked by finding a [[password]], which is encoded in a piece of [[music]].  Each of the eight outer towers has a musical piece locked inside a safe.&lt;ref name="Retro122"/&gt;  The final password consists of six distinct musical pieces.  Two of the pieces in the towers are duplicates.  The player must rewind the tape so that the next musical piece records over the duplicate, erasing it.

The main addition over the previous game is the addition of new types of enemy [[robot]]s and devices for the player to use. Whereas the original game only included security bots and a special flying [[ball]] robot, ''Impossible Mission II'' has the following types of robots:
* Security bot, like in the previous game.
* Shovel bot, tries to push the player character over the edge of a platform.
* Suicide bot, like a shovel bot, but also jumps off the edge itself.
* Mine bot, lays deadly [[land mine]]s on the floor.
* Pest bot, is harmless to the touch, but rides around on the lifts, foiling the player's designs.
* Squat bot, springs up from the floor, sending the player character onto a higher floor or crushing him against the ceiling.
The "ball" type robot is no longer present.

As well as snoozes that temporarily freeze the robots and lift resets, the player can now collect [[bomb]]s and mines that can be used to blow up holes in the floor, or to open [[safe]]s. Bombs explode after a specific time, whereas mines explode if the player or an enemy robot touches them.

==Development==
Unlike most computer game sequels of the time, ''Impossible Mission II'' did not use any code from the original game.&lt;ref name="Retro122"/&gt; The graphics were remade from scratch using a [[raster graphics|bitmap]] animation tool called Film Director.&lt;ref name="Retro122"/&gt; The lead platform was the [[Atari ST]], with work on the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] ports being started once the Atari ST version was nearly complete.&lt;ref name="Retro122"/&gt; All the rooms in ''Impossible Mission II'' were redesigned for the ZX Spectrum version.&lt;ref name="Retro122"/&gt;

According to Novotrade programmer László Szenttornyai, who coded the Spectrum version, the [[NES]] version of the game "almost wasn't released because of the strict situation between [[Epyx]] and [[Nintendo]]."&lt;ref name="Retro122"/&gt;

The game received mixed reviews from critics. Common criticisms were the game's overt similarity to and lack of improvement from the original ''Impossible Mission''&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GMach"/&gt; and the extremely limited sound.&lt;ref name="SUser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GMach"/&gt; However, the challenging puzzles,&lt;ref name="YSinc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crash"/&gt; impressive player character animations,&lt;ref name="Crash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YSinc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; and the tension of playing against the clock&lt;ref name="Crash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; were all praised by multiple critics.

==Sequels==
''Impossible Mission'' and ''Impossible Mission II'' were followed by ''[[Impossible Mission 2025]]'', an Amiga exclusive. ''Impossible Mission 2025'' abandoned the corridor layout of different rooms and instead includes one big room. The player also has the choice of three different characters: the normal secret agent, a female [[gymnast]], and an [[Android (robot)|android]].

'''Iron Crown Enterprises''' ('''ICE''') has produced role playing, board, miniature, and collectible card games since 1980. Many of ICE's better-known products were related to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s world of [[Middle-earth]], but the ''[[Rolemaster]]'' rules system, and its science-fiction equivalent, ''Spacemaster'', have been the foundation of ICE's business.

==History==
In college in the late 1970s, while running a six-year ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' campaign set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, [[Pete Fenlon]], [[S. Coleman Charlton]], and [[Kurt Fischer (game designer)|Kurt Fischer]] began to develop a set of unique house rules; after most of them had graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] in 1980, many of the group's principals decided to turn their rules into a business and formed Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE), named after a regalia of Middle-earth.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}} Besides Felon and Charlton, the original ICE also included [[Rick Britton|Richard H. Britton]], [[Terry K. Amthor]], [[Bruce Shelley]], [[Bruce Neidlinger]], Kurt Fischer, [[Heike Kubasch]], Olivia Fenlon, and a few others.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|133}}

ICE was incorporated in 1980, shortly after the youngest of the principal founders graduated from the [[University of Virginia]]. Among the founders were [[Pete Fenlon]] (then in Law school), [[Rick Britton]], [[S. Coleman Charlton]], Bruce Neidlinger, [[Terry K. Amthor]], Kurt Fischer, [[Bruce Shelley]], and [[Heike Kubasch]]. The company originally only had a few full-time staff, relying on volunteer work from the other founders. But as income increased, it brought more on as employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/tabletop/columns/days-of-high-adventure/7337-Rolemaster-Puppetmaster-Catan-Master-Pete-Fenlon&lt;/ref&gt;

ICE quickly published three products: ''[[Arms Law]]'' (1980), ''The Iron Wind'' (1980), and ''Manassas'' (1981).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|133}} ''Arms Law'' was the first release of the house rules from the University of Virginia days, and thus became the start of ''[[Rolemaster]]'', although at that time ''Rolemaster'' was not seen as a standalone RPG but was offered as an alternative combat system for ''AD&amp;D''.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|133}} ''The Iron Wind'' was a system-generic campaign centered on a fantastic island, and although it was unsupplemented for years it would eventually be recognized as the first release in ICE's ''Loremaster'' campaign setting.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|133}} ''Manassas'' was a Civil War era [[Miniature wargaming|wargame]] set in ICE's home state of Virginia.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|133}}

ICE began by publishing a series of rules supplements, beginning with "Arms Law", which were intended to serve as modular add-ons to other RPG systems offering greater detail. This was followed by "Spell Law" and Character/Campaign Law." In time, these supplements were tied together to form an RPG system of their own, ''[[Rolemaster]]''. Concurrent with the rules supplements, ICE began releasing world campaign content materials in what was originally called the "Loremaster" series, beginning with "Iron Wind".

''Rolemaster'' had grown out of a Middle-earth game, so ICE approached [[Tolkien Enterprises]] seeking a license to ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', which Tolkien Enterprises granted because no one else had ever asked.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|134}} Tolkien Enterprises signed an exclusive, worldwide license with ICE in 1982, and ICE started the Middle-earth line off with a generic sourcebook that could be used with AD&amp;D or other games, called ''A Campaign and Adventure Guidebook for Middle-earth'' (1982).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|134}}

The company enjoyed a sudden jump in status when it acquired the license to produce an official fantasy RPG based upon [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s world of [[Middle-earth]], which would come to be known as ''MERP'' ("[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]"). According to some interpretations, at the time of its publication ICE's ''Middle-earth Role Playing'' was the second best selling fantasy RPG after [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]'s ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.

ICE then added the science fiction RPGs ''[[Spacemaster]]'' and ''[[Cyberspace (role-playing game)|Cyberspace]]'' to its line, and, with the rise of [[collectible card game]]s, the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''. ICE also published a moderately successful space miniatures battle game called ''[[Silent Death]]'', based on ''Spacemaster'' but with simpler mechanics. ''Silent Death'' was released in two major editions, with supplemental books and a fair number of paintable lead miniatures.&lt;ref name="bh8"&gt;{{cite web |last=Appelcline  |first=Shannon  |coauthors= |title= #8:  ICE, Part One: 1980-1992 |url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory8.phtml |date=2006-11-21 |work=A Brief History of Game  |publisher=RPGnet |accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICE also expanded its original Loremaster supplements into a full-blown fantasy world to support [[Rolemaster]], called the [[Shadow World (role playing game)|Shadow World]], supported by dozens of adventures and sourcebooks. ICE signed in 1986 a publication contract to take over [[Hero Games]]' production and distribution.  Later with Hero Games staff leaving for other jobs, ICE took over the creative reins of Hero's products.&lt;ref name="bh8"/&gt;

Iron Crown branched out into the solo gaming books under the Tolkien Quest (later called Middle-earth Quest) and Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries book lines.&lt;ref name="bh8"/&gt; Unknown to ICE at the time, the Middle-earth Quest books violated ICE and Tolkien Enterprises' contract with Tolkien's book publishing licensee, George Allen &amp; Unwin. (ICE and TE considered the books to be games, and so fall under their license, but the format came too close to being literary books). ICE was forced to recall and destroy the whole line of books, at devastating cost.  Meanwhile, ICE sued the Narnia licensor as they turned out to not have the necessary rights to license Narnia to ICE.  That company went bankrupt from the legal settlement and was unable to pay ICE their damages.  ICE reached terms in 1988 for a gamebook license with the estate of J.R.R. Tolkien and George Allen &amp; Unwin for four new Middle-earth Quest books, beginning with "Spy in Isengard".  However, the solo game book market was going soft by this time.  ICE canceled all solo game book lines, with dozens of books still in development.  Returns were high on the [[Sherlock Holmes]] Solo Mysteries line.  All this brought ICE to near bankruptcy in a "voluntary-type of receivership".&lt;ref name="bh8"/&gt;

Despite ICE's many successes and overcoming many setbacks over 17 years, in 1997 ICE suffered financial difficulties from a rapid decline in its distribution net; nearly 70% of ICE's distributors either went bankrupt or became moribund. There has been some debate over whether Tolkien Enterprises forced ICE into bankruptcy in order to get the gaming license in anticipation of the upcoming new movie franchise.&lt;ref name="rpg.net"&gt;https://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory9.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The company entered bankruptcy and filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] in October 2000. This bankruptcy cost ICE the Middle-earth license, ending both the [[MERP]] and [[Collectible card game|CCG]] lines. Many of the authors and illustrators were not paid for substantial amounts of work.&lt;ref name="rpg.net"/&gt;

===Aurigas Aldebaron===
[[File:Ironcrownenterprises.png|thumb|right|ICE's logo since relaunch]]
In December 2001, ICE's assets were purchased by [[Aurigas Aldebaron]] LLLC, an [[intellectual property]] ownership company backed by several wealthy individuals.  The new owners licensed the Iron Crown Enterprise name and other assets to [[Mjolnir LLC]] until 2011. Starting in January 2011, licensing was transferred to Guild Companion Publications Ltd.

In 2016 Aurigas Alderbaron merged with Guild Companion Publications Ltd to create a single company: Guild Companion Publications. This company both holds the Iron Crown Enterprises intellectual property and produces and sells Iron Crown products.

'''Issuu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|s|.|j|uː}}) is an [[electronic publishing]] platform.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=39836841 |title=Company Overview of Issuu, Inc. |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Issuu was founded in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] in 2006&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt; by Michael and Ruben Bjerg Hansen, Mikkel Jensen, and Martin Ferro-Thomsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/about |title=About issuu |publisher=issuu.com |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[software]] was used by several [[online publication]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/garden/the-thriving-online-shelter-magazine-industry.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Thriving (Online) Shelter Magazine Industry |author=Steven Kurutz |publisher=New York Times |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, [[page view]]s for the company reached about seven to eight billion per month.&lt;ref name=Roush /&gt; Publications are available in thirty different languages.
In 2014, the company released '''Clip''', a tool that allows readers to take a snapshot of any part of a publication and share that on [[social media]] or through [[email]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/07/09/issuu-launches-clip-help-users-publishers-share-best-16m-publications/ |title=Issuu launches Clip to help users and publishers share the best of its 16m publications |author=Martin Bryant |publisher=The Next Web |date=9 July 2014 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year the company had around 80 million monthly [[unique visitor]]s, with 32 million monthly arriving from [[Web search query|web]] or [[mobile search]]es.&lt;ref name=Perez&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/03/issuu-brings-its-youtube-for-magazines-to-the-iphone-and-ipad/ |title=issuu Brings its "YouTube for Magazines" to the iPhone and iPad |author=Sarah Perez |publisher=TechCrunch |date=3 October 2014 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/07/14/issuu-raises-10m-to-become-youtube-for-catalogs-magazines/|title=Issuu Raises $10M to Become ‘YouTube’ for Catalogs, Magazines|first=Lora|last=Kolodny|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Issuu also partnered with LinkedIn, which built-in Issuu magazine integration into basic LinkedIn profiles.&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-issuu-embed-partnership-2014-2?op=1|title=You Can Use This New LinkedIn Feature To Highlight Your Work And Make Your Profile Pop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the number was around 85 million unique visitors per month, with 21 million publications publishing through Issuu (amounting to about 15,000 new publications per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinesocialmedia.net/20150219/issuu-has-85m-users-with-magazines-by-pdf/|title=Issuu has 85M users with magazines by PDF - Online Social Media|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, the company opened an office in [[Palo Alto, California]] and appointed CEO Joe Hyrkin, formerly of Reverb, Trinity Ventures, and [[Yahoo!]], to helm its [[Silicon Valley]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/59118-fast-growing-issuu-appoints-joe-hyrkin-ceo.html |title=Fast Growing issuu Appoints Joe Hyrkin CEO |author=Calvin Reid |publisher=Publishers Weekly |date=16 September 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/05/08/joe-hyrkin-how-to-manage/|title=How to be more bossy at work (in a good way)|date=8 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company soon moved its headquarters to the Palo Alto location.&lt;ref name=Roush&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2013/12/04/issuu-now-california-based-helps-niche-publishers-go-digital/|title=Issuu, Now California-Based, Helps Niche Publishers Go Digital - Xconomy|date=4 December 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the move, the founders of Issuu stated that they chose the city as they saw social media and digital distribution partnerships as the key to its growth, rather than focusing mostly on publishing relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2013/09/27/cassidy-issuu-shows-silicon-valleys-vital-role-in-global-commerce/|title=Cassidy: Issuu shows Silicon Valley’s vital role in global commerce – The Mercury News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances and partnerships==
In July 2014, Issuu raised $10 million in a Series B round to bring the total capital it has raised since it was founded to $21.5 million. That round of investment was led by [[KDDI]] and Sunstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hottopics.ht/stories/consumer/issuu-changing-digital-content-market/ |title=Is this the future of digital content for publishers? |author=Viral Shah |publisher=Hot Topics |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Issuu partnered with Peecho, to embed a cloud printing button into Issuu publication documents. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/04/11/peecho-brings-its-cloud-print-button-to-issuus-vast-online-document-library/|title=Peecho Brings its Cloud Print Button to Issuu - The Next Web|first=Martin|last=Bryant|date=11 April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Issuu acquired publishing software maker Magma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/05/issuu-hits-10-million-digital-publications-acquires-publishing-software-maker-magma/|title=Issuu Hits 10 Million Publication, Buys Software Firm Magma|first=Robin|last=Wauters|date=5 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Issuu partnered with LinkedIn, which built in Issuu magazine integration into basic LinkedIn profiles. &lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt; In January 2016, [[Micromedia Publications]] began publishing its seven weekly newspapers through the Issuu service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://issuu.com/micromediapubs/stacks |title=Micromedia issuu page |publisher=issuu.com |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apps==
In 2014 Issuu released its iOS app to access Issuu on Apple devices. The app includes an offline reading list function that allows users to read from the Issuu app without being online. The app can also stack publications back to back so that they can be read in succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appadvice.com/appnn/2014/10/shelf-control-free-magazines-issues-are-right-at-your-fingertips-with-issuu-for-ios|title=Shelf Control: Free magazine issues are right at your fingertips with Issuu for iOS|first=AppAdvice Staff|last=Author|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the app was released on Android in January, and received between one and five million downloads over the front part of 2014.&lt;ref name=Perez /&gt; Previous to the launch of the company’s 2014 apps, Apple had rejected an app from Issuu three times during 2009 (before the company expanded into the US).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/issuu-gets-android-app/|title=Magazine reader Issuu joins the Android Army, offers 15 million publications|date=21 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2008, the site was a [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) finalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/sxsw-web-awards/ |title=Gowalla Tops Foursquare at SXSW Web Awards (But Benson Smokes 'em All) |author=Michael Calore |publisher=Wired |date=14 March 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Issuu was named one of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''&amp;apos;s 50 Best Websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1918031_1918016_1918004,00.html |title=50 Best Websites 2009 |author=Adam Fisher |publisher=Time |date=24 August 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Issuu has hosted the scam site 1340 Art Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1340art.com/|title=1340Art - International art Magazine.|website=1340Art - International art Magazine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite alarms raised since at least 2017,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.agora-gallery.com/advice/blog/2017/05/25/how-to-recognize-art-scam/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creators.mn.co/posts/1301726|title=Mighty Creators|website=Mighty Creators}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1430470|title=1340art magazine, possible scam? - WetCanvas|website=www.wetcanvas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; over submission fees to a nominally existent magazine, and uncompensated sublicensing of submitted art, Issuu has not posted a warning or issued a statement regarding the matter, as of April 2018. The company began offering paid subscriptions in October of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goodereader.com/blog/digital-magazine-news/issuu-unveils-paid-subscriptions|title=Issuu Unveils Paid Subscriptions|website=goodereader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2018, Issuu app users were reporting unauthorized charges on their credit cards for up to $420.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/issuu.com|title=ISSUU Reviews - 1.4 Stars|website=www.sitejabber.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1571">'''Jacob's Inn''' was a notable 18th century inn located in [[Thompson, Connecticut]]. 

The inn was founded by Nathaniel Jacobs, who was born in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] in 1683. 
He bought two large properties in Thompson in for $5400 in 1742, and stayed there for the rest of his life. He was an important member of the [[Congregational Church]]
He died in 1772 at age 90, and the inn was taken over by his son John Jacobs after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cutter|first1=William Richard|title=New England Families, Genealogical and Memorial: A Record of the ..., Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Jacobs was known as 'Landlord Jacobs.' The Inn was called a Halfway House because it was approximately halfway between [[Hartford]] and [[Boston]].

The inn was notable because both [[George Washington]] and the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] spent time there. Washington once wrote in his journal that he apparently did not enjoy a breakfast that he had at the inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thompson Historical Society Newsletter|url=http://www.thompsonhistorical.org/Newsletters/2001_WINTER.PDF|website=The Thompson Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Once, Washington's coach left the inn without him, but he was able to overtake it on foot. Also notably, Lafayette left his masonic apron at the Inn, and it was passed down through the Jacobs family. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carleton|first1=Hiram|title=Genealogical and Family History of the State of Vermont: A Record ..., Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Redemption: Kickboxer 5''''' (also known as '''''Kickboxer 5: The Redemption''''' and simply as '''''The Redemption''''' on the opening title card) is a 1995 [[direct-to-video]] American [[martial arts film]] starring [[Mark Dacascos]] and directed by Kristine Peterson. The film is the fifth entry in the [[Kickboxer (film series)|''Kickboxer'' franchise]] and the first to have a plot that does not revolve around a member of the Sloane family. It instead revolves around a character named  Matt Reeves, said in dialogue to be a friend of the Sloane family.

==Plot==
Negaal is a South African former kickboxer turned promoter who is gearing up to start his own kickboxing organization. When American champion David Sloane refuses to join, Negaal sends his men Moon, Bull, and Pinto to eliminate Sloane. Seen in a bluescreen opening credit sequence, Sloane manages to break Moon's leg but is ultimately killed by Bull and Pinto. 

Matt Reeves is a former kickboxer turned martial arts teacher. As a friend of Sloane's, he is shocked to learn of his death. That night, his one-time student Johnny Styles is competing for the now vacant United States Championship. When Johnny wins the title, he is approached by Moon, Bull, and Pinto to join the Negaal Kickboxing Federation. Johnny decides to meet with the trio but Matt is suspicious. When his friend Charlie informs him that the three men also talked to David just two days before he was found murdered, Matt races to find Johnny. Johnny refuses the offer from Negaal and is forced to fight Bull and Pinto who overwhelm him and break his back. Matt arrives to fend them off but he is too late to help Johnny. 

When Negaal gets word of what has happened, he wants Matt dead. Bollen, Negaal's right hand man, recruits Paul Croft, a former member of Negaal's organization who is freed from prison on the condition he kills Matt. That night, Matt is confronted by Paul, who instead of killing him, warns him about Negaal. Matt decides to head to Johannesburg, South Africa to find Negaal. Paul finds out Matt is on the plane and the two end up sitting next to each other. When they arrive at the airport, Moon is awaiting Paul, who hides Matt in an attempt to prove he did his job. However, Paul attempts to escape and is confronted by Negaal's thugs until Matt arrives to help. Shocked by the turn of events, Moon escapes as does the thugs. Matt and Paul part ways and when Matt finds an address, he goes there to find a regular shop. When he inquires the shopkeeper about Negaal, Bollen just happens to be there and both he and his men attempt to go after Matt. Returning the favor from the airport incident, Paul arrives to help Matt. It is also revealed that it was Bollen who sent Paul to prison in the first place and Paul wants revenge. The duo fight off the thugs, but then find themselves arrested for causing trouble at the shop when Bollen forces the shopkeeper to rat on them. 

Meanwhile, Negaal has been presenting champions from all over the world with an ultimatum: join his federation or die. Fearing for his life, the French Champion reluctantly joins. After the two incidents involving Matt and Paul, Negaal confronts Moon, Bull, and Bollen and proceeds to shoot Bull in the head with a hunting rifle. When the German Champion refuses to join the federation, he challenges Negaal to a fight on the lawn. Negaal kills the German Champion with the "tiger claw", an illegal strike that he had used on the Dutch Champion years ago when he was a kickboxer, resulting in him getting a lifetime ban from the sport. 

With the help of fellow prisoner Joseph, Matt and Paul escape when one of the guards was revealed to be one of Negaal's men. The trio make their escape and separate with Matt and Paul catching up to Angie, who is revealed to be Paul's younger sister. She is wondering what is going on and is unhappy when it is revealed that Negaal is the reason. While Paul served his prison sentence, the patriarch of the Croft family had died. Matt and Paul convince Angie that they must stop Negaal once and for all if they are to ever be happy again. Both men begin to train with Matt discovering a way to counter Negaal's fatal blow when he breaks an arrow using his neck muscles to show that a fatal blow can in fact, be countered. As they learn Negaal is planning a major party, they decide to crash it along with Angie, who defies Matt and Paul and goes undercover as well.

When Paul finally confronts Bollen in the backyard, Matt sees Negaal at the roulette table and begins to win, angering Negaal. When Negaal learns that the man who is winning is the one he's been after this whole time, Matt finally exposes Negaal to everyone for who he really is. The goons arrive and Matt defeats them all and finally is ready to take on Negaal. As the two begin their fight, they go from Negaal's office to the lawn. When Negaal attempts the "tiger claw" to Matt's neck, Matt uses his counter technique and unleashes a "tiger claw" of his own hitting Negaal right in the heart. Negaal falls and Matt proceeds back to the office, where he grabs the United States Championship belt. Negaal returns to grab the belt back. Repeating "It's mine", Matt's "tiger claw" finally takes its effect and Negaal finally dies. Matt retrieves the belt as he, Paul, and Angie walk off as police sirens are heard.

'''Linda and Terry Jamison''' (born January 12, 1965) are [[United States|American]] identical twins based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] who perform as [[psychic]]s. The Jamisons predictions have been featured in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid newspapers]], and they have appeared in various media. They claim to have [[Mediumship|channeled]] the spirits of dead celebrities and predicted future events such as the [[September 11 attacks]], however critics question the accuracy of their predictions.

== Education and background ==
The Jamisons grew up in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]]. Their parents, Jane and [[Philip Jamison]], were writers and painters.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/beyondbelief/psychic-twins-predictions-include-elections-911-attacks/story?id=13886759|title='Psychic Twins' Say Their Predictions Include Elections, 9/11 Attacks|last2=Matthews|first2=Theresa|website=abcnews.com|last3=Brown|first3=Tim|last1=Chang|first1=Juju|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jamisons attended [[Temple University]], and later worked as painters and performance artists.&lt;ref name="HWD" /&gt;

== Career as "The Psychic Twins" ==
After leaving West Chester, they moved to [[Los Angeles]] and refocused their career as [[psychic]]s, calling themselves "The Psychic Twins", reportedly charging more than $500 per person for psychic readings.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HWD" /&gt; According to the Jamisons, they have predicted the future and contacted spirits of the dead, such as [[Lady Diana]], [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myall|first1=Steve|last2=Roberts|first2=Anna|title=These 'psychic' twins claim they predicted 9/11 and talk to Princess Diana|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/psychic-twins-claim-predicted-911-6056128|website=Daily Mirror|publisher=Mirror Company|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HWD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Chris|title=What the Psychic Twins Think Is in Store for This Year|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/what-psychic-twins-think-is-852418|website=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jamisons predictions have often been featured in tabloid newspapers such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'',&lt;ref name="CSI"&gt;{{cite web|last=Emery|first=Gene|title=Psychic Predictions 2004|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/psychic_predictions_2004|website=CSICOP|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; and according to the Jamisons, they have made numerous appearances in print, television, and on stage with "major stars".&lt;ref name="HWD" /&gt;

The Jamisons widely claim to have predicted the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] during a November 2, 1999 interview on the [[Art Bell]] radio show.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt; However, according to show transcripts, their actual statement was: "We are seeing terrorist attacks on Federal Government, excuse me, federal buildings. Particularly South Carolina or Georgia, by July 2002 and also the New York Trade Center, the World Trade Center in 2002." The September 11 attack occurred in 2001, not 2002, and it was common knowledge that the buildings had been previously attacked by terrorists in the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]], calling into question the Jamisons' claims.&lt;ref name="Yahoo7"&gt;{{cite web|title=How psychic twins predicted 9/11 terrorist attacks|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/9878867/how-psychic-twins-predicted-9-11-terrorist-attacks/#page1|website=[[Yahoo7]]|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leon Jaroff]], in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], pointed out that the Jamison twins were also frequently incorrect. For example, in December 2003, the Twins predicted that [[Saddam Hussein]] would be killed by U.S. troops in early 2004, and that [[Pope John Paul II]] would die in June 2004 (he actually died in April 2005). They also incorrectly predicted that the Bush/Gore election would be a "crashing bore", and that actress [[Jennifer Lopez]] would announce that she was pregnant by June 2005.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaroff |first=Leon |title=So Far, Psychics Are Batting .000 |url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/jaroff/article/0,9565,1012261,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831010526/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1012261%2C00.html |archive-date=31 August 2013 |website=Time.com |accessdate=29 November 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jamison twins maintain a YouTube channel on which YouTube stars [[Shane Dawson]] and [[Trisha Paytas]] have appeared.&lt;ref name="HWD" /&gt;

As of 2016 the twins were criticized for their inaccuracy in the Clinton/Trump election, claiming that [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]] would win. This created a lot of backlash and controversy on YouTube.

{{nihongo|'''''Marriage Counselor Tora-san'''''|男はつらいよ 夜霧にむせぶ寅次郎|Otoko wa Tsurai yo: Yogiri ni Musebu Torajirō}} is a 1984 Japanese comedy film directed by [[Yoji Yamada]]. It stars [[Kiyoshi Atsumi]] as Torajirō Kuruma (Tora-san), and Rie Nakahara as his love interest or "Madonna".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tora-san.jp/toranomaki/movie33/madonna.html|title=男はつらいよ 夜霧にむせぶ寅次郎 (Madonna)|accessdate=2010-01-30|publisher=[http://www.tora-san.jp/ www.tora-san.jp]|language=Japanese}} (official site)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Marriage Counselor Tora-san'' is the thirty-third entry in the popular, long-running ''[[Otoko wa Tsurai yo]]'' series.

==Synopsis==
In Shibamata, Tokyo, Tora-san's family prepares for a wedding. Meanwhile, the traveling Tora-san meets an old acquaintance in Iwate Province. Tora-san refuses to drink with him, afraid that the acquaintance, now settled and married, will again become attracted to Tora-san's wandering existence. Tora-san becomes attracted to a female barber, but must break off their relationship so that she too can live a secure life. She instead gets into an abusive relationship with a motorcyclist.&lt;ref name="Kinejun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinejun.jp/cinema/id/17482|script-title=ja:男はつらいよ 夜霧にむせぶ寅次郎|accessdate=2010-01-30|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Kinema Junpo]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324083428/http://www.kinejun.jp/cinema/id/17482|archivedate=2012-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Galbraith"&gt;{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Galbraith IV |authorlink= Stuart Galbraith IV|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/28077/tora-san-33-tora-sans-marriage-counselor/|title=Tora-san 33: http://www.molodezhnaja.ch/torasan33.htm (Region 3) |date=2007-05-15|accessdate=2010-01-30|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical appraisal==
[[Stuart Galbraith IV]] writes that ''Marriage Counselor Tora-san'' is a better entry in the ''[[Otoko wa Tsurai yo]]'' series, though it differs considerably from other films in the series, both formally and thematically. Tora-san's wandering life is portrayed harshly, rather than light-heartedly, and his family's stable life is shown in the more positive light. Galbraith concludes, "With its darker tone and atypical structure, ''Tora-san's Marriage Counselor'' is like a breath of fresh air following a series of recent, somewhat repetitive entries."&lt;ref name ="Galbraith"/&gt; The German-language site molodezhnaja gives ''Marriage Counselor Tora-san'' three and a half out of five stars.&lt;ref name="molodezhnaja"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.molodezhnaja.ch/torasan33.htm|title=Tora-San's Marriage Counselor|accessdate=2010-01-30|publisher=[http://www.molodezhnaja.ch/ www.molodezhnaja.ch]|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
''Marriage Counselor Tora-san'' was released theatrically on August 4, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanese-cinema-db.jp/details/14058|title=男はつらいよ 夜霧にむせぶ寅次郎|accessdate=2010-01-30|publisher=Japanese Cinema Database ([[Agency for Cultural Affairs]])|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415211015/http://www.japanese-cinema-db.jp/details/14058|archivedate=2014-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the film has been released on videotape in 1987 and 1996, and in DVD format in 2005 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=149116|script-title=ja:男はつらいよ　夜霧にむせぶ寅次郎  (1984)|accessdate=2010-01-30|publisher=allcinema.net|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Ian Grade, Baron Grade of Yarmouth''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 8 March 1943) is an English [[Media proprietor|television executive]] and [[businessperson|businessman]]. He was chairman of the [[BBC]] from 2004 to 2006 and executive chairman of [[ITV plc]] from 2007 to 2009.&lt;ref name="BBC2009stepdown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8013801.stm|title=Grade to step down as ITV chief|date=23 April 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, he has been a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[life peer]] in the [[House of Lords]].

==Early life==

Grade was born into a [[Jewish]] show business family originally called Winogradsky; his father was the theatrical agent [[Leslie Grade]] and his uncles were the impresarios [[Lew Grade]]&lt;ref name="transdiffusion"&gt;{{cite web |author=Writer Glenn Aylett EMAIL MORE ARTICLES |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/tvheroes/michael_grade.php |title=Michael Grade The most popular media mogul in Britain |publisher=Transdiffusion.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011101447/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/tvheroes/michael_grade.php |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bernard Delfont]]. When he was three years old his mother left the family to conduct a relationship with wrestling commentator [[Kent Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-419296/Grade-bids-farewell-BBC-leaps-troubled-rival-ITV.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Geoffrey | last=Levy | title=Grade bids farewell to BBC and leaps across to troubled rival ITV | date=28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grade was brought up by his grandmother, and only saw his non-Jewish mother once more as an adult.&lt;ref name="Freedland"&gt;Michael Freedland [http://www.thejc.com/arts/arts-interviews/46372/interview-michael-grade "Interview: Michael Grade"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 10 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Stowe School]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[St Dunstan's College]] in [[London]].

==Career==
Grade joined the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' in 1960, and was a sports columnist from 1964 to 1966. By his own account (as related on [[Channel 4]] chat show ''The Late [[Clive James]]''), the job had been organised by his father. When Leslie Grade suffered a serious stroke in 1966, the 23-year-old Michael moved into his theatrical business. In 1969, he moved to London Management &amp; Representation. Among the artists whom Grade represented were [[Morecambe and Wise]] (he successfully negotiated the duo's defection from [[Associated Television|ATV]] to [[BBC2]] in 1968) and [[Larry Grayson]].

===LWT===
Grade entered the television industry in 1973 when he joined [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) as Deputy Controller of Programmes (Entertainment).&lt;ref name="Newcomb"&gt;Steve Bryant "Grade, Michael (1943- )" in Horace Newcomb (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of Television''], Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2004, pp.1020-21&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he bought the scripts of an Afro-American&lt;!-- Contemoporary usage in 1976. --&gt; sitcom ''[[Good Times]]'' which had an all-black cast.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Malchow [https://books.google.com/books?id=l8xT0epJ5OoC&amp;pg=PA189 ''Special Relations: The Americanization of Britain?''], Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2011, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; Adapted as ''[[The Fosters (1976 TV series)|The Fosters]]'' (1976–77), it became the first British sitcom to have an entirely black cast. At LWT, Grade worked with both [[John Birt]] and [[Greg Dyke]].

After he became Director of Programmes in 1977, Grade commissioned the series ''[[Mind Your Language]]'', but later cancelled it. At an event at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival|Edinburgh Television Festival]] in 1985, he agreed that the series was racist, and said that "it was really irresponsible of us to put it out".&lt;ref&gt;Sarita Malik [https://books.google.com/books?id=kY_xA-5d1VkC&amp;pg=PA97 ''Representing Black Britain: Black and Asian Images on Television''], Thousand Oaks, California: Sage, 2002, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; In what was termed 'Snatch of the Day' by the press in 1978, Grade attempted the acquisition of exclusive screening rights to [[The Football League|Football League]] matches. Previously the BBC had held the more desirable rights, but the [[Office of Fair Trading]] intervened, and Grade's purchase was revoked. The package of recorded highlights on Saturday evenings now alternating each season between ITV and the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Bradford [https://books.google.com/books?id=an7Vc7XIXsYC&amp;pg=PT822 ''When Saturday Comes''], London: Penguin, 2005, p.882-83&lt;!-- Page number retrieved from the html address, but the Kindle edition has only 477 pages. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1978, Grade managed to place under contract the entertainer [[Bruce Forsyth]] who had helped the BBC to dominate the Saturday evening television ratings through the decade via ''[[The Generation Game]]'' series. His new vehicle was titled ''Bruce Forsyth's Big Night'' and was intended to feature all his talents in one programme lasting two hours. The budget was £2million for a fourteen-week run.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Stenson [https://books.google.com/books?id=i_gpoToGeywC&amp;pg=PT91 ''Brucie: The Biography of Sir Bruce Forsyth''], London: John Blake Publishing,  p.88&lt;/ref&gt; The new series was considered a disaster, with the press turning against the host, but did achieve an initial audience of 14 million.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Forsyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=XcYLmLuXxYMC&amp;pg=PP198&amp;lpg=PP198 ''Bruce: The Autobiography''], London: Pan, 2001, p.198&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Generation Game'', with new host Larry Grayson, managed to achieve a larger audience.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Moran [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfZEAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT195 ''Armchair Nation: An intimate history of Britain in front of the TV''], London: Profile Books, 2013, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; LWT's ''Big Night'' was not re-commissioned.

Grade announced at a press conference in May 1979 that LWT had secured a contract with a production company formed by television dramatist [[Dennis Potter]] and his producer [[Kenith Trodd]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Cook [https://books.google.com/books?id=JXi7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA102 ''Dennis Potter: A Life on Screen''], Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998, pp.102-3&lt;/ref&gt; The corporate association proved short-lived, with both sides having insufficient experience for budgeting drama shot on film, and was terminated by Grade in the summer of 1980.&lt;ref name="Cook194"&gt;Cook ''Dennis Potter'', p.194-97&lt;/ref&gt; Only three of what had been projected as six filmed plays by Potter were shot and screened.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Carpenter ''Dennis Potter'', London: Faber, 1999 [1998], p.394&lt;/ref&gt; Grade though, was directly involved with some of the playwright's later commissions.

Grade approved production of ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]'' and initiated the long-running arts' programme ''[[The South Bank Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;Rowena Mason [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/5206668/Michael-Grade-at-ITV-it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time.html "Michael Grade at ITV: it seemed like a good idea at the time",] ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Grade left LWT to begin a two-year period as the president of [[Embassy Television]] in the United States. In ''The Times'' he was quoted as stating, "It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; it is, if you like, a gamble I want to take".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=American TV post for Michael Grade | first=Kenneth | last=Gosling | newspaper=The Times | date=22 September 1981 | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pay rose from £32,000 to $250,000 per annum.&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;Janine Gibson and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/03/broadcasting.politicsandthemedia3 "Amid the suits, a man who stands out"], ''The Guardian'', 3 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he was largely involved in developing  and selling sitcoms in this period: "When you read 30 or 40 comedy scripts a week, you get a bit barking."&lt;ref name="Freedland"/&gt; Grade produced for the only time in his career his only series, a nine-part adaptation of ''[[Kane and Abel (novel)|Kane and Abel]]'', the novel by [[Jeffrey Archer]]. In a ''[[The Jewish Chronicle|Jewish Chronicle]]'' interview with [[Michael Freedland]] in 2011, Grade said he had "missed public service broadcasting, real drama, news, current affairs".&lt;ref name="Freedland"/&gt;

===BBC===
Grade joined [[BBC Television]] in 1984 as Controller of &lt;!-- BBC 1 until 1997. --&gt;[[BBC One|BBC 1]], taking "the biggest pay cut in history" he told Michael Freedland; his salary went down from $500,000, excluding large bonuses to £37,000 a year.&lt;ref name="Freedland"/&gt; Later he became Director of Programmes in 1986,&lt;ref name="Newcomb"/&gt; and Managing Director Designate in 1987. His tenure as Controller was rocky.

Grade cancelled ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' while fighting [[Thames Television]] for the rights to the series (although this decision was subsequently reversed). He cut short the expensive serialisation of ''[[The Tripods]]'' trilogy, written by [[Samuel Youd|John Christopher]], because he was dissatisfied with the ratings it had achieved after two seasons. He also considered cancelling the sitcom ''[[Blackadder]]'', judging the first series to be unfunny.&lt;ref name="Gibson"/&gt; In exchange for renewing ''Blackadder'', he required that it become a wholly studio-based production on a lower budget.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lewisohn {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/blackadderii_7770765.shtml |title="Blackadder II" |accessdate=2005-04-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408060711/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/blackadderii_7770765.shtml |archivedate=8 April 2005 |df= }}, BBC Guide to Comedy (c.2003) via the Wayback Machine&lt;/ref&gt;

Grade agreed the BBC should make Dennis Potter's ''[[The Singing Detective]]'' (1986) after a brief meeting with [[Jonathan Powell (producer)|Jonathan Powell]], then the BBC's Head of Drama.&lt;ref name="Midgley"&gt;Neil Midgley [http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-02/michael-grade-i-think-the-bbc-has-become-too-bureaucratic "Michael Grade: 'I think the BBC has become too bureaucratic'"], ''Radio Times'', 2 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was a highlight of this period, but came under criticism from [[Mary Whitehouse]] and the tabloid press for its content.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenetr ''Dennis Potter'', p.455-56&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the depiction of an illicit sexual encounter in Episode Three, Grade said: "There are very few people in television drama that you are prepared to trust with scenes like this. But Dennis Potter is one of them".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Cook ''Dennis Potter: A Life on Screen'', p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as Controller, Grade was also responsible for purchasing the Australian [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]'' for BBC1's new [[Daytime television|daytime]] schedule; it debuted on British television on 27 October 1986. He was also responsible for repeating ''Neighbours'', at first exclusively an afternoon programme, in a later [[timeslot]] (on the advice of his daughter, Alison, who was annoyed that she could not watch it due to her being at school). This proved to be a successful scheduling decision, with audiences in excess of 18&amp;nbsp;million for the new 5.35&amp;nbsp;pm broadcasts. Other successes during Grade's tenure included the debut of soap operas ''[[EastEnders]]'' and ''[[Howards' Way]]'', and the broadcast of the charity rock concert [[Live Aid]].

====''Doctor Who'' controversy====
It was announced in February 1985 that the next series of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', scheduled to run from January 1986, would be postponed as Grade had decided that the programme's budget would be better spent on other drama productions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Cook [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/feb/28/doctor-who-television "Doctor Who fans upset as BBC postpones new series"], ''The Guardian'', 28 February 1985 (website reprint: 28 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; What became an 18-month hiatus for ''Doctor Who'' (the series did not resume until September 1986) prompted a strong reaction from viewers. In an interview in 2004, Grade said of the series: "I thought it was horrible, awful. I thought it was so outdated. It was just a little show for a few pointy head ''Doctor Who'' fans. It was also very violent and it had lost its magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2005/04/25/feature_michael_grade_feature.shtml | title= Michael Grade interview | publisher=BBC | accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an appearance on the BBC's ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]'' in 2002, Grade chose the series as one of his hates, criticised its production values and admitted that he had little interest in, or sympathy for, [[science fiction]].

[[Eric Saward]], the [[script editor]] of ''Doctor Who'' at the time of its suspension, responded to Grade's criticism a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;During the [[audio commentary]] of the 2008 DVD of the ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[Warriors of the Deep]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, Grade's comments were unfair because he was in the position to allocate more resources to the programme and thus improve its quality. However, actress [[Katy Manning]], who had portrayed [[Jo Grant|a companion]] of [[Jon Pertwee]]'s Doctor, praised Grade's treatment of the series on the DVD commentary for ''[[The Mind of Evil]]''. In her view, Grade "was actually doing the right thing", and she credited the long break with rejuvenating the series.&lt;ref&gt;Voice-over commentary on the BBC DVD "[[The Mind of Evil]]" (1971, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Grade decided to fire actor [[Colin Baker]] from the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|title role]] of ''Doctor Who''. Years later he explained that he thought Baker's portrayal of the Doctor was "utterly unlikeable; absolutely God-awful in fact".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news

Following the end of the [[Doctor Who (2005)|first series]] of the revived ''[[Doctor Who]]'' in 2005, he wrote a letter to [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]], the [[BBC Director General]], congratulating all involved in the production on its success, signing-off with "PS &lt;!--sic--&gt;never dreamed I would ever write this. Must be going soft!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Dean |title=Doctor Who's greatest enemy finally surrenders |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,1511605,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 June 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the ''[[Radio Times]]'' in 2012, Grade commented: "From clunky [[Dalek]]s that couldn't go up and down stairs to the filmic qualities today of ''Doctor Who'', it's a transformation... The show still leaves me cold, but I admire it, which I never did before."&lt;ref name="Midgley"/&gt;

===Channel 4===
Grade accepted the post of [[chief executive]] of [[Channel 4]], succeeding [[Jeremy Isaacs]], and taking up his post at the beginning of 1988.&lt;ref name="Newcomb"/&gt; It was a decision which led Isaacs to criticise the appointment and to threaten to "throttle" Grade if the nature of the Channel was altered.&lt;ref&gt;Howell Raines [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/arts/london-will-mrs-thatcher-squeeze-beeb-will-british-tv-be-americanized-stay-tuned.html "London: Will Mrs. Thatcher Squeeze the Beeb? Will British TV Be Americanized? Stay Tuned . . . ''], ''New York Times'', 20 December 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

He phased out some of its more high-brow programming, for which he was accused of "[[dumbing down]]"; Grade retorted that in the same week that he moved to Channel 4, it had shown a repeat of the 1984 adaptation of ''[[The Far Pavilions]]'', featuring American actress [[Amy Irving]] "[[Blackface|blacked up]]" as an Indian princess. During this period, he was also attacked by the conservative press: ''[[Daily Mail]]'' columnist [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] dubbed him Britain's "[[pornographer]]-in-chief".

Grade was successful in developing the station at a time when Channel 4 was obliged to award a proportion of its advertising revenue to the rival [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. In addition to securing talent from the BBC, he recognised the improving quality of US television output, making series such as ''[[Friends]]'' and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' the mainstays of the channel's schedule. Grade became involved in a dispute with [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] regarding the satire ''[[Brass Eye]]'' after repeatedly intervening in the production to order edits to various episodes, and re-scheduling some instalments for sensitivity.

Grade left Channel 4 in 1997 to head First Leisure Corporation, He departed two years later, following a substantial internal re-structuring, to return to the media industry as [[chairman]] of the new Pinewood and Shepperton Film Studios Company.

===Return to the BBC===
Grade was on the board of the poorly received [[Millennium Dome]] project, and has served as chairman of Octopus Publishing, the [[Camelot Group]], and Hemscott (a position that he intends to relinquish).

He had ambitions to become Chairman of the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|BBC Board of Governors]] in 2001, but was beaten to the post by [[Gavyn Davies]]. Following Davies' resignation in the aftermath of the [[Hutton Inquiry]] report, it was announced on 2 April 2004 that Grade had been appointed BBC Chairman; his only demand was that he would not have to give up his job as a director of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.]] He took up his post on 17 May.

On 19 September 2006, Grade became non-executive chairman of online food delivery company [[Ocado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/264-michael-grade-becomes-ocado-chairman Michael Grade becomes Ocado chairman | Econsultancy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/21/ocado-chairman-idUSL6N0AQEX820130121|title=Michael Grade to step down as Ocado chairman |publisher=Reuters|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the role on 23 January 2013, after which he was replaced by Sir [[Stuart Rose]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-22/ocado-appoints-rose-to-succeed-michael-grade-as-chairman.html|title=Ocado Appoints Rose to Succeed Michael Grade as Chairman|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/21/uk-ocado-chairman-idUKBRE90K0WD20130121 | work=Reuters | first=Paul | last=Sandle | title=Michael Grade to step down as Ocado chairman - FT | date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ITV===
On 28 November 2006, Grade and the BBC confirmed that he was to resign from his position within the corporation to replace Sir [[Peter Burt]] as Chairman, and [[Charles Allen, Baron Allen of Kensington|Charles Allen]] as Chief Executive, of one of the companies forming part of its commercial rival, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. He became Executive Chairman of [[ITV plc]] on 8 January 2007.

During Grade's tenure, ITV has struggled with falling advertising revenue and viewing figures. Upon appointment, Grade announced that his first priority would be to work as a senior partner at ITV Network Limited to improve ITV programming, as well as strengthen its digital channels, [[ITV2]], [[ITV3]], [[ITV4]] and [[CITV]]. On 12 September 2007, Grade announced a controversial five-year re-structuring plan for ITV plc-owned regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| last=Holmwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans would result in the consolidation of the ITV regional news programmes in England, with regions now broadcasting a single service per region rather than multiple, specialised, local services (for example, [[Yorkshire Television|ITV Yorkshire]] would no longer broadcast in separate Northern and Southern regions). They would also merge fully [[Border Television|ITV Border]] with [[Tyne Tees Television|ITV Tyne Tees]], and [[ITV Wales &amp; West|ITV West]] with [[Westcountry Television|ITV Westcountry]], effectively ending two regions' tenure as independent players within ITV; the proposals have been criticised by [[BECTU]] and the [[National Union of Journalists]].&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; Any such changes would be subject to approval by [[Ofcom]].

In March 2009, Grade initiated libel action against another television executive, [[Greg Dyke]], and ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper over allegations of improper conduct made by Dyke about Grade, relating to his move from the BBC to ITV in 2006. The newspaper subsequently withdrew the allegations and published an apology, admitting that the allegations had no justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/01/michael-grade-times-action-greg-dyke | title= Michael Grade: I sued over Dyke piece to protect my reputation for honesty | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Ben | last=Dowell | date=1 May 2009 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2009, Grade announced he would be stepping down as chief executive to become non-executive chairman at the conclusion of regulatory reviews into advertising contract rights and digital TV, at some point before the end of 2009.&lt;ref name=BBC2009stepdown/&gt;

==Personal life==
Grade was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54993 |date=31 December 1997 |page=9 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he published his autobiography, ''It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time'', and married his third wife, Francesca Leahy; they have a son, Samuel.

==MileySaveFuzzy.com==
The website was created on October 24, 2009. On the website, the anonymous fan claimed that if Miley Cyrus did not come back to Twitter by November 16 (a deadline which was later extended to November 22&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mileysavefuzzy.com/updates.html |title=Will Miley save Fuzzy? - Updates |publisher=Mileysavefuzzy.com |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;), their cat, Fuzzy, would be killed and eaten. The fan claimed this action is legal in their country. The website includes several pictures of Fuzzy, as well as a cat [[recipe]]s section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mileysavefuzzy.com/recipes.html |title=Will Miley save Fuzzy? - Recipes |publisher=Mileysavefuzzy.com |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2009, the Miley Cyrus fan posted a new update on the website, named ''Fuzzy's Demise'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mileysavefuzzy.com/demise.html |title=Will Miley save Fuzzy? - Fuzzy's Demise |publisher=Mileysavefuzzy.com |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the cat is dead. The fan claimed that the cat was taken to a clinic and was [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]], and was later eaten. A very detailed explanation of the entire process is described, and pictures of a supposedly dead Fuzzy were posted.

Shortly after the update was announced, there were difficulties accessing the website. An error page showed up, presumably due to the large amount of hits it received, causing bandwidth issues.{{or|date=September 2012}}

==Public response and legitimacy==
The website received media attention throughout the [[United States]] and in other countries, such as Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/chance/gente/noticia-miley-cyrus-vuelves-twitter-mato-gato-20091030135408.html |title='Miley Cyrus, o vuelves a Twitter o mato a mi gato'. |publisher=Europapress.es |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.eslamoda.com/chismes/?p=6745 |title=Eslamoda.com &amp;#124; Chismes!

The campaign was also mentioned on various radio stations across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.961kiss.com/pages/tallcathy.html?an=WTF-IS-WRONG-WITH-PEOPLE |title=96.1 Kiss |publisher=96.1 Kiss |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.973thehawk.com/showdj.asp?DJID=46684 |title=(Khki-Fm) |publisher=97.3 The Hawk |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People working against the site have contacted organizations such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] and [[Humane Society of the United States|The Humane Society]], who responded on their official forums and by email, saying that nothing can be done, as no crime is being committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mileysavefuzzy.com/updates.html |title=Will Miley save Fuzzy? - Updates |publisher=Mileysavefuzzy.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://streetteam.peta2.com/public/folder_view.cfm?pageid=341&amp;option=view_thread&amp;postid=3176128&amp;folderid=727 |title=PETA2 // Boards |publisher=Streetteam.peta2.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], '''prosody''' is the way the [[composer]] sets the text of a [[Vocal music|vocal composition]] in the assignment of [[syllable]]s to [[Musical note|note]]s in the [[melody]] to which the text is sung, or to set the music with regard to the ambiance of the lyrics. For example, a [[songwriter]] might align downbeats or [[accent (music)|accent]]s with [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]ed syllables or important words, or create musical accompaniment to the meter of the lyrics. Also, prosody can mean how the music supports the connotation, or emotive nature, of a song.

Any musical work with a singer, regardless of the [[genre]], requires its composer or songwriter to examine the interplay between the music and the words. For example, the mood of the music typically matches that of the lyrical content: for example, when the lyrics address a sad topic, the music would sound sad. Of course, composers might work differently, setting a textual mood against a contrasting musical mood. However, the term "prosody" tends to refer not to the matching of music with content, but with the matching of a melody with the language itself, so that the words being sung come across as naturally as possible. According to Mark Altrogge: "Generally when writing songs and [[poetry]], we want to accent a phrase like we'd speak it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblazingcenter.com/2010/10/songwriting-tip-watch-your-prosody.html|work=The Blazing Center|title=Songwriting Tip: Watch Your Prosody|author=Mark Altrogge|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703063018/http://theblazingcenter.com/2010/10/songwriting-tip-watch-your-prosody.html|date=2010|archivedate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melodies that do not come relatively close to approximating speech make the words hard to understand; melodies that go beyond the point of clarity and come even closer to approximating speech make the singer sound more human and therefore have a stronger emotional impact on the listener.

A melody with good prosody will not assign long notes to relatively insignificant syllables, nor will it put them on the beat or give them any sort of accentuation. The [[Musical phrasing|musical phrases]] will match the [[grammatical phrase]]s, so that musical pauses happen in places that would be natural for a speaker.

'''[[Prostitution]] ([[:no:Prostitusjon|''Prostitusjon'']]) in [[Norway]]''' is illegal, in that offering [[consideration]] for sexual acts (''seksuelle tjenester'' or ''seksuelle ytelser''),&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; but not selling sex, is a criminal offence. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] law prohibiting the buying of sexual acts (''sexkjøpsloven'') came into effect on 1 January 2009, following the passing of new legislation by the Norwegian parliament (''[[Storting]]'') in November 2008.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806760.stm |title=New Norway law bans buying of sex. BBC News Jan 1 2009 |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soliciting and advertising "sexual services" is also illegal under the Norwegian Criminal Code (''Straffeloven'') section 378 and section 202(3).&lt;ref name=sflorey/&gt;

== History ==

=== Early era ===
In early times, [[proscription]] of prostitution fell under more general laws on [[fornication]] and [[adultery]], particularly after the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation]]. Around this time, sexual acts started to be moved from [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] (largely with [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]) to [[criminal law]]. For instance, in one part of [[Mediaeval]] law, the [[Frostathing Law]], it is stated, "If a woman lies with a man whom she is not allowed to possess, she owes a fine of three marks, just as he does with whom she lies". Regulation of sexuality in the [[High Middle Ages]] was largely a function of the Church, for whom only [[heterosexual]] sexual relations within [[marriage]] were acceptable. Despite this, prostitution was not considered amongst the most serious sexual crimes, but was frequently associated with other nuisances such as gambling, drinking, and causing a disturbance.

=== Nineteenth century ===
[[File:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilægens venteværelse.jpg| 250 px|thumb|right|[[Albertine i politilægens venteværelse|Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room]], by [[Christian Krohg]], 1886-1887&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harriet.nasjonalmuseet.no/ukenskunstverk/index.php?showimage=19|title=Ukens kunstverk -|website=harriet.nasjonalmuseet.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Prostitution was criminalized in Norway with the introduction of the new [[Norwegian Code|Criminal Code]] (''Norske Lov'') in 1842, but was made legal again when the Penal Code (''Straffeloven'') was revised in 1902,&lt;ref name=sflorey/&gt; when the prohibition of both the sale and purchase of sex was lifted. However, even during that time, it was actually tolerated and regulated in practice, in the larger cities such as [[Oslo]], [[Bergen]], and [[Trondheim]]. While prostitution was defined as an immoral [[vice]], it was street prostitution that was especially frowned upon, being visible. It was also considered important to distinguish between "decent" and "indecent" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/prostitution-old-oslo|title=Prostitution in old Oslo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schiøtz, A. (1980). Prostitusjon og prostituerte i 1880-åras Kristiania, in A. M. Gotaas (Ed.), Det Kriminelle kjønn: om barnefødsel i dølgsmål, abort og prostitusjon (pp. 35-81). Pax, Oslo 1980 Pax.&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation of prostitution in Europe (''Regulationism'') was closely tied to the concept that prostitution was a source of venereal disease, requiring medical supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Davidson and Leslie Hall (eds), Sex, sin and suffering: venereal disease and European society since 1870, London and New York, Routledge, 2001, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Spongberg, Feminizing venereal disease: the body of the prostitute in nineteenth-century medical discourse, Basingstoke, Macmillan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aina Schiøtz, ‘Prostitusjon og prostituerte i 1880-åras Kristiania’, in Anne-Marit Gotaas, Brita Gulli, Kari Melby and Aina Schiøtz (eds.), Det kriminelle kjønn: om barnefødsel i dølgsmål, abort og prostitusjon, Oslo, Pax, 1980, pp. 35-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kari Melby, "Prostitusjon og kontroll", in Anne-Marit Gotaas, Brita Gulli, Kari Melby and Aina Schiøtz (eds.), Det kriminelle kjønn: om barnefødsel i dølgsmål, abort og prostitusjon, Oslo, Pax, 1980, pp. 83-85&lt;/ref&gt; 
This form of regulation first appeared in Bergen, then the largest Norwegian municipality, in 1816, in (what is now known as) Oslo in 1840, and Trondheim in 1844. Regulation was at least on the surface contrary to the Penal Code which had made [[fornication]] and hence prostitution a criminal offence in 1842. In practice the latter law was considered only to apply to males.

The media, the church, and social commentators started to express concerns about prostitution which was labelled as ''The Great Social Evil''. Various institutions stated a desire to rescue 'fallen women', and help them exit their trade and 're-enter society', training them for positions such as domestic servants.&lt;ref name=Beitnes/&gt;

In the mid-nineteenth century, there was a growth of organized society, in which religious and philanthropic organizations developed, many of which had a predominance of women members. Amongst these were "societies for the defense of moral standards", concerned ''inter alia'' with prostitution and the government's failure to deal with it. (UNESCO 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;13)

Brothels were eventually prohibited in Norway in 1887 as part of a pan-European moral reform campaign of ''Abolitionism'' that replaced Regulationism and was supposed to end prostitution.&lt;ref name=Beitnes/&gt; The change in the Penal Code in 1902 did not, however, mean that prostitution was more tolerated by society. The exchange of sex in one's own home was now legal, but [[loitering]] and [[procurement]] was not, and women seen selling sex in public were directed to "rehabilitation" programs.&lt;ref name=mls12/&gt;

=== Modern era ===
A Pan-[[Scandinavia]]n conference on prostitution was held in [[Lillehammer]] in 1993. Sex workers participated, and the emphasis was on [[harm reduction]]. [[Liv Jessen]] from Pro-Sentret compared this to the punitive approach of the radical "Women's Front" (''Kvinnefronten''), a feminist activist group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ccies/no.php International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: Norway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126184352/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ccies/no.php |date=26 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate on what to do was to continue for another 30 years.&lt;ref name=mls12/&gt; ''Kvinnenfronten'' had been founded in 1972, and was to work for a change in the law over all of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40647443|title=A glimpse into 30 years of struggle against prostitution by the women's liberation movement in Norway|first=Agnete|last=Strøm|date=10 April 2018|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|volume=17|issue=34|pages=29–37|doi=10.2307/40647443|pmid=19962635|doi-broken-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework==
The criminal Code deals with organized crime (Section 60a), third parties (''tredjeparts''), and procurers, such as [[pimps]]&lt;ref name=HG257/&gt; ([[:no:Hallik|''hallik'']], ''halliker'' (pl.))&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/hallik|title=hallik|first1=May-Len|last1=Skilbrei|first2=John Christian|last2=Elden|date=10 July 2017|publisher=|via=Store norske leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[madams]] (S 202), purchase of sexual "services" (S 202a), purchase under 18 (S 203), and human trafficking ([[:no:Menneskehandel|''menneskehandel'']])&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; (S 224).

===Norwegian General Civil Penal Code (''Straffeloven'')===

'''Section 60a'''&lt;br&gt; 
"If a criminal act has been committed as part of the activity of an organized criminal group, the maximum penalty laid down in the penal provision shall be increased to double its prescribed limit, but not by more than five years' imprisonment.
An organized criminal group is here defined as an organized group of three or more persons whose main purpose is to commit an act that is punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years, or whose activity largely consists of committing such acts. An increase of the maximum penalty pursuant to the present provision shall be applicable in relation to statutory provisions that give legal effect to the penalty limit, unless it is otherwise provided."
 
'''Section 202''' &lt;br&gt; 
"Anyone who
a) promotes the engagement of other persons in prostitution, or
b) lets premises on the understanding that such premises shall be used for prostitution or is grossly negligent in this respect

shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

Any person who in a public announcement unambiguously offers, arranges or asks for prostitution shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.

In this provision, prostitution means that a person engages in sexual activity or commits a sexual act with another person in return for payment."

'''Section 202a''' &lt;br&gt; 
"Any person who
a) procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act, for himself/herself or for another person, in return for payment or agreement to provide payment,
b) procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act in return for another person paying or agreeing to pay, or
c) in the manner described in a) or b) above induces someone to carry out acts that are equivalent to sexual intercourse with himself/herself

shall be liable to a fine or up to 6 months' imprisonment or both.

If the sexual intercourse or act has been particularly humiliating in its nature, but it is not punishable under any other law, the punishment is imprisonment for a term of up to 1 year."

'''Section 203'''&lt;br&gt; 
"Any person who, in return for payment, procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act from a person under the age of 18, shall be liable to a fine or up to 2 years’ imprisonment. Being mistaken about someone’s age does not affect criminal liability, unless diligent good faith has been shown."

'''Section 224'''&lt;br&gt; 
"Any person who by force, threats, abuse of another person's vulnerability or other improper conduct exploits another person for the purpose of
a) prostitution or other sexual purposes,
b) forced labour or forced services, including begging,
c) military service in a foreign country, or
d) removal of any of the said person's organs,
or who induces another person to allow himself or herself to be used for such purposes, shall be guilty of human trafficking, and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

Any person who
a) makes arrangements for such exploitation or inducement as is mentioned in the first paragraph by procuring, transporting or receiving the person concerned,
b) in any other way aids and abets such exploitation or inducement, or
c) provides payment or any other advantage in order to obtain consent to such exploitation from any person who is in a position of authority over the aggrieved party, or who receives such payment or other advantage shall be liable to the same penalty.

Any person who commits an act referred to in the first or second paragraph against a person who is under the age of 18 shall be liable to a penalty independently of any use of force or threats, abuse of a person’s vulnerability, or other improper conduct. Being mistaken about someone’s age does not affect criminal liability, unless diligent good faith has been shown.

Gross human trafficking is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years. In deciding whether the offence is gross, particular importance shall be attached to whether the person exposed to the act was under the age of 18, whether gross violence or coercion was used or whether the act led to considerable gain."

=== Other acts ===
'''The Planning and Building Act'''&lt;br&gt;
Specifies requirements for premises where commercial activities take place, used to close massage parlours occupying premises that do not meet the requirements for commercial activities.

'''Tax and VAT'''&lt;br&gt;
All income is taxable, including income from prostitution, but implementation varies. Some people have been made to pay tax on their estimated earnings from prostitution, while some have registered as self-employed, to benefit from the rights that taxpayers have. Most services are liable to VAT.&lt;ref name=sflorey/&gt;&lt;ref name=taxing/&gt;&lt;ref name=tax/&gt;

'''Welfare''' &lt;br&gt;
Prostitution is not considered legal work in Norway. Those entitled to social welfare benefits may claim economical support from [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration|NAV]] when not employed and indigent.

'''Immigration Act''' &lt;br&gt;
It is for foreigners to work as prostitutes in Norway, because prostitution is not considered legal work. ''Section 27'' states that foreigners can be deported for breaches of the peace.

'''Police Act'''&lt;br&gt;
''Section 7'' (Public order and peace) allows the police to stop breaches of the peace or intervene when there is reason to fear such a breach.

'''Child Welfare Act'''&lt;br&gt;
Protects and gives rights to children under the age of 18. If a child is in the company of sex workers, this may lead to intervention under the act. All government employees have a duty to report to the child welfare authorities if they see a child who may be suffering from neglect.

'''Communicable Diseases Control Act'''&lt;br&gt;
Entitles residents to preventive care, diagnosis and treatment for such diseases. It does not allow collective restrictions to be imposed on sex workers.

== Prostitution in Norway today ==
In 2013, it was estimated there were 3,000 sex workers (''prostituert'', ''prostituerte'' (pl.))&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; working in Norway&lt;ref name=taxing/&gt; ([[Demographics of Norway|population]] 5 million),.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssb.no/a/english/kortnavn/folkendrkv_en/2012k4/hittil00-en.html Population per 1 January 2013 and population changes in 2012. Counties] SSB, retrieved 14 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Earnings from sex trade are estimated at 390 million [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] (£39m., $US63m., €48m.).&lt;ref name=taxing/&gt;

Norwegian prostitutes make a clear distinction between the term "prostitute" and "sex worker", seeing "prostitution" as a derogatory word (''nedlatende ord''). They also describe themselves as ''gledespike'' (literally, ''fille de joie''), or ''hjelpepleier'' (health worker).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ba.no/nyheter/article6924505.ece|title=Lever dobbeltliv som mor og sexarbeider|date=16 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in most countries, prostitution takes on a number of different forms, including [[street prostitution]] (''Gateprostitusjon'') and indoor prostitution in [[brothels]] (''[[:no:bordell|bordell]]'', ''bordeller'' (pl.)).&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; Technically, both street work and brothel operations (''bordellvirksomhet'')&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; are legal, even though purchase of those "services" is not, but as with other countries, technological change has resulted in a shift to offering "services" from [[street solicitation]] to [[mobile phones]] and the [[internet]].&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; While brothels are technically legal in that there is no explicit law banning then (''de jure''), the sex purchase ban prevents them operating overtly (''de facto''). As a form of protest, it was suggested that some sex workers might operate free brothels that circumvent the ban, to make this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article12190064.ab|title=Gratis bordeller öppnas i Norge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/2839300.html|title=Vil åpne gratis "bordell"|first=Magnus|last=Blaker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theantifeminist.com/norwegian-sex-activisit-on-eivind-berge/|title=Norwegian Sex Activist on Eivind Berge : 'The Law on Paying for Sex Leads to Angry Young Men' The Antifeminist, 16 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was stated that this was an exercise designed primarily to stimulate debate on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/3436342.html|title=- Sexkjøpsloven fører til sinte, unge menn|first=Nina|last=Bjordal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current law banning purchase creates an administrative anomaly, since any money earned is illegal, yet is taxable.&lt;ref name=sflorey/&gt;&lt;ref name=taxing/&gt;&lt;ref name=tax/&gt; Recent legislative proposals have included a ban on advertising. Some sex workers have complained about the lack of government consultation with them.&lt;ref name=taxing/&gt; In July 2014, the Nadheim City Mission has reported that street prostitution levels in Norway have returned to those prior to the introduction of the law in 2009.&lt;ref name=DV21714/&gt;

== Sex purchase ban ==

=== First consideration ===
The possibility of criminalizing the purchase of sex was discussed in an official report in 1997; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/nouer/1997/nou-1997-23.html?id=141115 |title=NOU 1997: 23. Seksuallovbrudd. Justisdepartmentet 1997 |publisher=Regjeringen.no |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
however, neither the [[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Justice Department]] (''Justis- og politidepartementet'') nor the [[Storting]] (Parliament) were in favour of taking this step. The Department did, however, promise to re-look at the situation in two years.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/otprp/19992000/otprp-nr-28-1999-2000-.html?id=160376|title=Ot.prp. nr. 28 (1999-2000)|first=Justis- og|last=politidepartementet|date=28 January 2000|website=Regjeringen.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Norway then criminalized the purchase of sex from people under the age of 18 in 2000 (Law 76, 11 August; Penal Code art. §203). 
&lt;ref&gt;Straffeloven § 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=just04/&gt;

=== Working group report 2004 ===
Although [[Prostitution in Sweden|Sweden]] had banned the purchase of sex in 1999, opinions remained divided in Norway. In 2003, as part of its ''Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Women and Children''
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/rapporter_planer/rapporter/2004/statusrapport---regjeringens-handlingspl.html?id=457572 |title=Regjeringen handlingsplan mot handel med kvinner og barn 2003-2005. Justis- og politidepartementet, Oslo, 12 Feb 2003 |publisher=Regjeringen.no |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the Justice Ministry investigated the situation in both the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (which had recently legalized [[brothels]]) and Sweden to better inform the debate, and concluded that neither approach would be appropriate at that point. 
&lt;ref name=just04&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/jd/Documents-and-publications/Reports/Reports/2004/Purchasing-Sexual-Services.html?id=106214 |title=Purchasing Sexual Services in Sweden and the Netherlands:Legal Regulation and Experiences. Justice Department, 8 October 2004 |publisher=Regjeringen.no |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/rapporter_planer/rapporter/2004/sexkjop-i-sverige-og-nederland.html?id=278400 |title=Sexkjøp i Sverige og Nederland: Reguleringer og erfaringer. Justis- og politidepartementet, 8. Oktober 2004 |publisher=Regjeringen.no |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The working group for this report was chaired by Professor [[Ulf Stridbeck]], of [[Oslo University]]'s [[University of Oslo Faculty of Law|law school]].

With regard's to Sweden's law, the group found that reliable data was unavailable, the law was difficult to enforce, and had had little impact (p.&amp;nbsp;23).
&lt;ref name=just04/&gt;
The difference between the two countries they saw was the different way they defined prostitution, and hence approached it (p.&amp;nbsp;45). They were particularly concerned about the unintended effects of the Swedish approach (p.&amp;nbsp;52).

=== Changing policy due to immigration ===
The debate which finally led to the introduction of the sex purchase ban concerned the effects of the arrival of women from [[Africa]], typically [[Nigerian]], on the streets of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/12/15/nyheter/innenriks/sexkjop/sexkjoploven/prostitusjon/19418698/|title=Prostitusjon på nettet har trolig økt etter sexkjøploven|language=Norwegian|date=15 December 2011|work=[[Dagbladet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was argued that human trafficking was fuelled by a demand for sex and that therefore a ban was necessary, and whether [[solicitation]] was offensive.

=== Current law (''Sexkjøpsloven'') ===
In November 2008, the Storting passed legislation which criminalized purchasing sex (''sexkjøploven''). This became Section 202a of the Norwegian [[Penal Code]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/jd/whats-new/News/2008/criminanlizing-the-purchase-of-sexual-ac.html?id=537854 |title=Criminalizing the purchase of sexual activity. Ministry of Justice, 1 December 2008 |publisher=Regjeringen.no |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Section 202a'''

''Any person who''

    ''(a) engages in or aids and abets another person to engage in sexual activity or commit a sexual act on making or agreeing payment'',&lt;br&gt;
    ''(b) engages in sexual activity or a sexual act on such payment being agreed or made by another person, or'' &lt;br&gt;
    ''(c) in the manner described in (a) or (b) causes someone to carry out with herself or himself acts corresponding to sexual activity'',

''shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.''

''If the sexual activity or sexual act is carried out in a particularly offensive manner and no penalty may be imposed pursuant to other provisions, the penalty shall be imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ban extends to Norwegians outside of Norway ([[Extra-territorial|extra territorial]] law).

=== Effect of sex purchase ban ===
Despite an initial drop in the visibility of street prostitution,

later reports suggested it had returned to its previous levels.

It stated that the law had met its mandate, and that the street market had been reduced, and probably also the indoor market, but that this was more difficult to estimate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Main findings'''.&lt;br&gt;
''The ban on purchasing sexual services has reduced demand for sex and thus contribute to reduce the extent of prostitution in Norway. The enforcement of the law, in combination with the laws against trafficking and pimping, makes Norway a less attractive country for prostitution based trafficking than what would have been the case if the law had not been adopted. Furthermore, the economic conditions for prostitution in Norway are reduced following the implementation of the law. These effects are in line with the intentions of the law and are thus not considered as unintended side effects. This report does not find any evidence of more violence against prostitutes after the ban on buying sex entered into force''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Response ====
Critics argued that while one could show trends in prostitution, it was simplistic to argue that they were a direct result of regulatory change, given the complex social phenomenon and the many forces acting on it. [[Vidar Brein-Karlsen]] (FrP), the Justice Secretary, has promised a thorough parliamentary inquiry (''stortingsmelding'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/sexkjoepsloven/ny-rapport-prostitusjonen-i-norge-redusert-etter-sexkjoepsloven/a/23271620/|title=Ny rapport: Prostitusjonen i Norge redusert etter sexkjøpsloven|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/sexkjoepsloven/hege-grostad-tror-det-er-store-moerketall/a/23271841/|title=Hege Grostad: Tror det er store mørketall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/norge/_-sexkjopsevaluering-_for-spinkel_-1.11869647|title=– Sexkjøpsevaluering "for spinkel"|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/norge/_-nei_-loven-er-ingen-suksess-1.11875910-|title=– Nei, loven er ingen suksess|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusions conflict with other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/ostlandssendingen/ingen-har-oversikt-over-sexsalg-1.11678026|title=Ingen har oversikt over sexsalg|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition of "success" has been a subject of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/08/11/nyheter/innenriks/sexkjop/prostitusjon/menneskehandel/34719779/|title=Snever tilnærming til prostitusjonsmarkedet i ny rapport, mener PION-sjef|date=11 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also states that the it has become much more difficult to be a sex worker in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/incoming/article7664307.ece#.U-tt-2O8PuV|title=Er det positivt at sexarbeideres inntekt går ned?

== Politics of prostitution ==
The 2008 sex purchase ban was passed by the centre-left [[Red–green coalition (Norway)|red-green coalition]] government. At the time of the passage of the purchase law, it was opposed by the centre-right opposition parties in the Storting, including the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservatives]] (''Høyre'', H), the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] (''Fremskrittspartiet'', FrP), and the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberals]] (''Venstre'', V). The bill passed 44 to 28, with the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] (''Arbeiderpartiet'', A/Ap), [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left]] (''Sosialistisk Venstreparti'', SV), [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre]] (''Senterpartiet'', Sp), and [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]] (''Kristelig Folkeparti'', KrF) voting in favour, and the Conservatives, Progress Party, and Liberals voting against.

The opposition parties continued to express their objections, according to Conservative MP [[Bent Høie]] and [[Anniken Hauglie]], a fellow Conservative and Commissioner for Social Services in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/politisk/opposisjonen-vil-fjerne-sexkjoeploven-3958365.html#.UrxLsrSLVEk Opposisjonen vil fjerne sexkjøploven.

Following revelations that selling sex was as prevalent as ever, and that reporters posing as clients were easily able to negotiate transactions, Conservative MP [[André Oktay Dahl]], deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice (''[[Justiskomiteen]]''), called for a repeal of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/vil-fjerne-sexkjoeploven-3474578.html#.UrxQ4rSLVEk|title=Vil fjerne sexkjøploven.

=== 2013 elections ===
The change of government in the September [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2013|2013 election]] which created a Conservative (48 seats) led coalition with the Progress Party (29 seats) created an opportunity for the laws to be revisited, and the Liberals (9 seats) pressed for reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annemodus.wordpress.com/2013/12/11/our-nations-disgrace-soon-a-bygone-embarrassment/|title=Norway's disgrace – soon a bygone embarrassment?|date=11 December 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/4160-norway-venstre-to-press-the-government-on-the-sex-purchase-law|title=Venstre to Press the Government on the Sex Purchase Law - The Nordic Page|date=9 December 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Høie has now become the [[Minister of Health and Care Services]].

Amongst those continuing to support the law are the Christian Democrats (10 seats), who wish to see the law strengthened. They and the Liberals hold the balance of power in supporting the minority Conservative coalition government. Opposition parties supporting the law include the Labour Party, which holds the greatest number of seats (55), and the Socialist Left (7 seats). Critics of the law include [[Sveinung Rotevatn]] (V) and Conservative leader [[Trond Helleland]], as well as the Green (''De Grønne'', MDG) (1 seat).&lt;ref name=NPN/&gt; [[Marthe Hammer]] (SV), leader of her party's women's movement, sees the law as having symbolic value, sending a message that buying sex is unacceptable.&lt;ref name=taxing/&gt; However, even the KrF agree the effects of the law should be evaluated. Support is particularly strong amongst the youth wings of the parties.&lt;ref name=NiE/&gt; The twelve member Justice Committee is currently chaired by [[Hadia Tajik]] (A), a strong supporter of the law, with [[Anders Bjørnsen Werp]] (H) and [[Kjell Ingolf Ropstad]] (KrF) as deputies. [[Jan Arild Ellingsen]] represents Progress on the committee, and is an outspoken critic, as is Ropstad. Werp and [[Minister of Justice and Public Security|Justice Minister]] Anders Anundsen (FrP) saying only that they will review the evaluation. News from the Nadheim City Mission in July 2014 that the levels of prostitution in Norway had returned to those before the introduction of the law, reignited the debate, with Rotevatn stating that there was a sufficient majority in parliament to rescind the law, and that unless the evaluation produced startlingly positive results, this should now proceed.&lt;ref name=DV22714/&gt;

In November 2013, the Mayor of Oslo, [[Stian Berger Røsland]], stated that selling sex was now so prevalent in Oslo that the government should ban the sale as well as purchase of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/20131118/oslo-mayor-calls-for-ban-on-sex-workers|title=Oslo mayor calls for ban on sex workers|date=18 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2014, all parties had created platforms around prostitution policy.&lt;ref name=NiE/&gt;

The law is supported by women's organizations such as the radical feminist ''Kvinnefronten''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/3713-women-organizations-react-to-prostitution-article|title=Women Organizations React to Prostitution Article - The Nordic Page|date=7 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvinnefronten.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=255:fare-sexkjopslova-er-truga-av-hogrekreftene Kvinnefronten: Fare- sexkjøpslova er truga av høgrekreftene! 9 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite political opposition, the law has public support, 65% in January 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/20140102/strong-support-for-prostitution-laws-survey|title=Strong support for prostitution laws - survey|date=2 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at least one newspaper editorial has called for repeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.no/meninger/leder/Moralismens-overtak-3162484.html#.U-p9_GO8PuW|title=Moralismens overtak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C Krohg-Trett.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Christian Krohg: ''Trett'' ({{lang-en|"Tired"}}) 1885 from the ''Albertine'' series]]
In 1886, [[Christian Krohg]] wrote a novel titled ''[[Albertine (Krohg novel)|Albertine]]'' (see illustration above) about a seamstress of that name living in what was then Christiana (Oslo) forced into prostitution by poverty and abuse. Although the book was confiscated, and Krogh was fined, the ensuing debate expedited the abolition of prostitution in Norway. Krohg also executed several paintings on the Albertine theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Christian Krohg |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Knut |last=Berg |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Christian_Krohg/utdypning_%E2%80%93_2 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nmk2&gt;{{cite book |title=Norges Malerkunst |volume=1 |first=Knut|last=Berg |year=1991 |publisher=Gyldendal |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |pages=430–431|isbn=978-82-05-20587-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, prostitution was a frequent theme in nineteenth century literature.&lt;ref name=Beitnes/&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Norway}}
Norway is a destination and, to a lesser extent, transit and source country for women and girls subjected to sex trafficking. Trafficking victims identified in Norway primarily originate from Eastern Europe and Africa, particularly Bulgaria, Lithuania, Nigeria, and Romania, as well as victims from Pakistan and the Philippines.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Norway 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282723.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Norway as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 1]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

The '''Pussycat Theaters''' were a chain of [[Adult movie theater]], operating between the 1960s and the 1980s. Pussycat Theaters had 30 locations in California and were known for their cat-girl logo.

==History==
[[David F. Friedman]] and [[Dan Sonney]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dl0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=Pussycat|title=Los Angeles Magazine|first=Emmis|last=Communications|date=1 May 2002|publisher=Emmis Communications|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded Pussycat Theaters. Dan Sonney invented the name, based on Woody Allen film ''[[What's New Pussycat?|What's New Pussycat]]''. Friedman has also cited the Pink Pussycat burlesque club on Santa Monica Boulevard as having previously established the word "pussycat" in relation to "pink" porn, since the early 1960s. The first Pussycat Theater opened in March 1966 on 444 South Hill Street, [[Los Angeles]]. Within two years, there were almost a dozen locations, from [[San Diego]] to [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/LethalWeapon3.shtml|title=Lethal Weapon Filming Locations - Part 3|first=Gary|last=Wayne|date=|website=www.seeing-stars.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-VIEW-THEATRE-1970-photo-6656-HOLLYWOOD-BLVD-original-still-DONALD-SUTHERLAND/310595974200|title=NEW-VIEW THEATRE 1970 photo 6656 HOLLYWOOD BLVD original still DONALD SUTHERLAND  - eBay|author=|date=|website=eBay|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/product_info.php/products_id/3862|title=Hollywood Historic Photos - News-View Theatre 1944|author=|date=|website=hollywoodhistoricphotos.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://losangelestheatres.blogspot.com/2017/02/ritz-theatre.html|title=Ritz Theatre|author=|date=|website=losangelestheatres.blogspot.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Vince Miranda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-05/news/mn-15735_1_family-oriented-theaters|title=Pussycat Theater Founder Miranda Dies|first=BURT A.|last=FOLKART|date=5 June 1985|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; bought a 50% share of the company. Miranda was unable to prevent those outside California from using the Pussycat name. Miranda spent $1 million to improve the decor of the theaters. They were known for being cleaner and fancier than other such places. The interiors featured red and gold [[carpet]]ing, [[velveteen]] fixtures, beveled glass, mirror walls, [[chandelier]]s, [[oil painting]]s, [[mural]]s, and merchandise bearing the Pussycat logo. Some Pussycat theaters sold [[popcorn]] from the [[box office]] to pedestrians on the sidewalk, with no obligation to buy a ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/view-of-the-pussycat-theater-formerly-known-as-the-sunset-news-photo/627234754|title=The Pussycat Theater|author=|date=|website=gettyimages.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nK1MvP2L_IC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=Pussycat|title=Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life|first=Howard|last=Sounes|date=1 December 2007|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/losangelesmoviepalaces/lakewood|title=Lakewood Theatre - [more] Los Angeles Movie Palaces|author=|date=|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vince Miranda and George Tate (who were lovers) shared ownership of Walnut Properties, the company that owned the Pussycat Theaters. Miranda may have had exclusive California license to show ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', a hugely lucrative film. His main competitors were the [[Mitchell brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nightflight.com/filmmaker-gregory-dark-his-fallen-angels-and-the-other-side-of-hollywood/|title=Filmmaker Gregory Dark, his “Fallen Angels,” and the other side of Hollywood|author=|date=|website=nightflight.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents who lived near the theaters complained to the city governments that children could see the images of women on posters, ads, and cardboard stand-ups. Community members wanted the theaters to close. The citizens groups and government sued Walnut Properties under a variety of laws, including [[obscenity]], [[public nuisance]], [[Zoning|rezoning]], [[eminent domain]], The [[Red Light Abatement Act]], and the US Supreme Court's "preponderance" redefinition of porn theaters. Walnut Properties was served with over 100 civil lawsuits filed between 1973 and 2005. Between 1977 and 1994, at the Pussycat Theater in Santa Monica, "the Los Angeles Police Department made 2000 arrests for [[Sexual misconduct|lewd conduct]] on the premises." In 1981, an ordinance was passed banning adult movie theaters in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timeline.com/rise-fall-porn-theater-172c45c7065f|title=Watching porn in public: The rise and fall of the adult movie house|author=|date=12 August 2016|website=timeline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://losangelestheatres.blogspot.com/2017/01/hollywood-theatres-overview.html|title=Los Angeles Theatres: Historic Hollywood Theatres: an overview|first=B.|last=Counter|date=|website=losangelestheatres.blogspot.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://obrag.org/2010/09/the-strand-theater-part-1-the-year-the-porno-theater-was-blocked/|title=The Strand Theater-Part 1: the Year the Porno Theater Was Stopped|author=|date=|website=obrag.org|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/patron-buys-a-ticket-at-the-pussycat-theatre-may-3-1995-in-news-photo/813922114|title=Pussycat Theater In Buena Park, California|author=|date=|website=gettyimages.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adsausage.com/freep3/|title=ADSAUSAGE - vintage advertising library.|author=|date=|website=www.adsausage.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, pornographic [[videotape]] sales began to compete with adult theaters, reducing theater attendance. At the age of 52, Vince Miranda died of complications related to cancer in 1985. George Tate and his new paramour Jonathan Cota inherited Walnut and the Pussycat Theaters. The IRS imposed a federal tax lien of $6,047,760 on Miranda's estate. The theaters were losing money fast. Many theaters are given to debtors in lieu of money, and/or converted to general admission theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/50/case.html|title=Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976)|author=|date=|website=justia.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, fewer than 20 California Pussycats remained, and by 1992, only a dozen were still open. In 1994, Walnut Properties filed for bankruptcy, claiming liabilities of $17.7 million.

By 2003, all the theaters were lost except one at 7734 Santa Monica Boulevard. Filmmaker [[Roger Corman]] saved the last Pussycat Theater by brokering a deal with an unnamed buyer. In 2004, Cota threatened to file a lawsuit against the [[The Pussycat Dolls|Pussycat Dolls]], for trademark infringement on the Pussycat name. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] declared the Pussycat trademark to be "abandoned" and the case was dismissed. Today, Cota runs the last Pussycat Theater, which now shows homosexual pornography. The name was changed to the Tomkat, then to Studs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studswesthollywood.com/|title=Studs at the Pussycat|author=|date=|website=studswesthollywood|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rede dos Emissores Portugueses''' ('''REP''') (n [[English language|English]], '''Network of Portuguese Transmitters''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Portugal]].   REP was founded in 1926 by Eugenio de Avillez P1AE, an early Portuguese radio experimenter.&lt;ref name="rep"&gt;Rede dos Emissores Portugueses (2008). [http://www.rep.pt/ Rede dos Emissores Portugueses] official web site.  Retrieved Aug. 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Key membership benefits of the REP include a [[QSL card|QSL]] bureau for those amateur radio operators in regular communications with other amateur radio operators in foreign countries, and the sponsorship of [[amateur radio operating award]]s and radio [[contesting|contests]]. The REP represents the interests of Portuguese amateur radio operators before Portuguese and international regulatory authorities.  REP is the national member society representing Portugal in the [[International Amateur Radio Union]], which it joined in 1931.&lt;ref name="iaru"&gt;International Amateur Radio Union (2008).

'''The National Lottery''' is operated by ITHUBA Holdings, to whom the licence was granted in 2015. The lottery is regulated by the National Lottery Commission, and was established in 2000.

Lottery tickets may be bought only by people of at least 18 years of age.

In the 2007 fiscal year transaction values totalled R3.972 billion, with an average of five million transactions per week. In the 2012 National lottery generated R4.7 billion in sales of Lotto and Powerball tickets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwc.co.za/en/assets/pdf/gambling-outlook-2013.pdf|title=Betting on Africa. 2nd annual edition, November 2013.

==History==
The National lottery was introduced to South Africa on 11 March 2000. At the time it was run by Uthingo.

After a marketing effort that aimed to reach 80 percent of South African homes directly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=National Lottery geared up to start on Thursday

|accessdate=9 September 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
more than 800,000 tickets were sold in the first day of availability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nearly R70 million worth of tickets were sold in the first three weeks of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002 operator [[Uthingo]] suggested a daily lottery to supplement the weekly draw. The concept, called Keno, was rejected by the trade and industry ministry in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In November 2003 the Lotto Plus game was launched, acting as a supplementary weekly lottery available on the purchase of a primary lottery ticket, with an entry fee of R1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In July 2006 the [[Gidani]] consortium, featuring Greek company [[Intralot]] as a technical partner, was judged the preferred bidder to operate the lottery for seven years starting April 2007. The operating licence was awarded in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2007 the [[High Court of South Africa|Pretoria High Court]] set aside that award on application by incumbent Uthingo, finding that the failure to adequately investigate the shareholders in some bidding consortia left room for conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2015, Lotto licences were awarded to ITHUBA. In 2015, 2 new games were introduced by Ithuba: EAZiWIN, an instant win game consisting of four types of indigenous inspired games; ''Morabaraba, Fafi Fortune''',''' 4 Siya Wina and Popa Feela'' and PowerBall Plus.

Players buy tickets with their choice of six different numbers between 1 and 52; there is provision for random numbers to be generated automatically for those who do not wish to choose, known as 'Quick Pick'.

In the draw, six numbered balls are drawn without replacement from a set of 52 balls numbered from 1 to 52. A further ''Bonus Ball'' is also drawn, which affects only players who match five numbers.

Prizes are awarded to players who match at least three of the six drawn numbers, with prizes increasing for matching more of the drawn numbers. All players who match all six drawn numbers win equal shares of the [[progressive jackpot|jackpot]]; the chance of doing so is 1 in 20,358,520. If four, five, or six balls are matched, the relevant prize is divided equally between all who match that many balls. If no player matches all six numbers, the jackpot is added to that of the next Lotto draw—a ''Rollover''.

The entry fee to the LOTTO draw is set at R5.00 per board.

The draw is conducted on Wednesdays and Saturdays on [[SABC 2]] at 20:56.

'''''The Anarchist''''' is a two-person 2012 play by [[David Mamet]] that opened in New York on Broadway and starred [[Patti LuPone]] and [[Debra Winger]].&lt;ref name=Brantley/&gt; The "anarchist" of the title has its origin related to and perhaps based upon members of the [[Weather Underground]], [[Judith Clark]] and [[Kathy Boudin]], former members of the Weather Underground, who took part in the [[Brink's robbery (1981)]].&lt;ref name=Lahr&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lahr|first1=John|title=Rough Justice|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/10/rough-justice|accessdate=29 July 2015|publisher=The New Yorker|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The play is set in the office of a prison parole review officer who is seen questioning and conducting an extended interview with a long-term prisoner incarcerated for a [[Weather Underground]]-type crime during which she killed two police officers.&lt;ref name=Brantley&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brantley|first1=Ben|title=War of Wills, Vocabularies and Virtues|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/theater/reviews/david-mamets-anarchist-at-the-golden-theater.html|accessdate=29 July 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt; The outcome denies the long-term prisoner access to parole based on the harsh nature of the crime and the lack of remorse shown for her crimes.

==Reception==

The New York production of the play was not well-received by critics.&lt;ref name=Trueman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trueman|title=David Mamet's The Anarchist bombs on Broadway|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/dec/05/david-mamet-anarchist-broadway|accessdate=29 July 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in his ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review of 2 December 2012, [[Ben Brantley]] wrote: "Mr. Mamet has always been preoccupied with words both as power tools and as camouflage. That’s true whether the language is lowdown (as in 'Glengarry' and '[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]') or high-flown (as in '[[Oleanna (play)|Oleanna]]'). This has often involved a certain verbal self-consciousness among his characters. But it has never been as acute as in 'The Anarchist,' in which both women are especially aware of words as instruments of misdirection and what Cathy calls the opacity of human motives. Theatergoers must really furrow their brows here just to follow the basic arguments, never mind the layers of motivation woven into them. And without giving away too much, I think it’s fair to reveal 'Anarchist' basically concludes that all those polysyllabic words mean nothing, when you come right down to it. Right is right, and wrong is wrong. When you reach the end of 'Anarchist,' you may feel you’ve traveled an unnecessarily winding road to get there."

Having officially opened on Sunday 2 December 2012, producers posted closing notices the following Wednesday and cut the run short on 16 December, after only 23 previews and 17 performances.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/dec/05/david-mamet-anarchist-broadway&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Book of Mormon: Original Broadway Cast Recording''''' contains the songs from the American musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'', with music, lyrics, and book by Trey Parker, Robert Lopez, and Matt Stone. It was recorded by the musical's original Broadway cast and released on May 17, 2011 to digital outlets. The album saw a physical release on June 7, 2011, in a deluxe package with liner notes provided by former ''[[The New York Times]]'' theatre critic [[Frank Rich]], as well as full lyrics and a synopsis of the musical. ''The Book of Mormon'' was named best musical theater album at the [[2012 Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref name=LATimesGrammy&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Gerrick D.|title=Grammys 2012: Backstage with 'Book of Mormon' winner Trey Parker|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/02/grammy-awards-2012-backstage-with-trey-parker-book-of-mormom.html|accessdate=February 14, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parker, Lopez, and Stone wrote the musical progressively over a period of six years, beginning in 2004. The recording for the album took place over three days, with the orchestra recording for one and the cast recording for another. [[Stephen Oremus]], Parker, Lopez, and Stone were the primary producers of the album. ''The Book of Mormon'' original cast recording was recorded at [[MSR Studios]], Studio A in New York City. The record has received positive reviews.

The recording received substantial commercial success after its initial digital release broke [[iTunes Store]] records and the subsequent album made a relatively strong debut on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. After the show's success at the [[2011 Tony Awards]] and an aggressive marketing campaign, the recording skyrocketed to number 3 on the chart and became the highest charting Broadway cast album in over four decades.

A [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] version is planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/the-book-of-mormon-is-going-vinyl|title=The Book of Mormon Is Going Vinyl|last=Gans|first=Andrew|date=June 23, 2016|website=Playbill|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording and post-production==
The cast recording for ''The Book of Mormon'' was recorded on March 21, 22 and 28, 2011.&lt;ref name="linernotes"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=The Book of Mormon |titlelink=The Book of Mormon (musical album) |others=the Original Broadway Cast |year=2011 |type=booklet |publisher=[[Ghostlight Records]] |id=B004X1M4DS |location=New York City }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two former dates were shortly before the show officially opened and the latter was days afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Peggy Fletcher|last = Stack|authorlink = Peggy Fletcher Stack|url = http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/51314880-78/mormon-lds-book-mormons.html.csp|title = ‘Book of Mormon’ musical called surprisingly sweet|publisher = [[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date = February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was recorded at Studio A in MSR Studios (formerly [[Right Track Recording]]) in New York City. The show's creators, Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Robert Lopez, served as producers for the album, as did ''The Book of Mormon'' producers Anne Garefino and [[Scott Rudin]]. In addition, [[Stephen Oremus]] (music director for ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'') and [[Kurt Deutsch]] (co-founder of [[Sh-K-Boom Records]], owner of Ghostlight Records) also served as producer and executive producer, respectively.&lt;ref name=linernotes/&gt;

Because of payment schedules imposed by union rules, Broadway cast recordings are traditionally recorded over a single 15-hour day, with all instruments and vocals tracked together.  In addition to reducing costs, this approach enables the singers to control the tempo of the songs.  But according to Frank Filipetti, who both recorded and mixed the album,&lt;ref name=linernotes /&gt;  ''The Book of Mormon'''s complex vocal arrangements called for a different strategy in which the instrumental tracks were recorded first, followed by a separate day dedicated to the cast. Filipetti said that the arrangements had "vocal parts within vocal parts within vocal parts. Trying to do all of that with the principal singers, rhythm section, orchestra, all in two or three takes in an all-day session wasn’t going to work." He credited Oremus and drummer Sean McDaniel for being able to anticipate the singers' phrasing. Other mixing challenges included "creating enough air and clarity for all the vocalists while still maintaining the vibrancy of [Lopez's] orchestral arrangements", as well as dealing with the score's wide range of musical styles.&lt;ref name=sonicscoop&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiss|first=David|title=Inside “The Book of Mormon” Cast Recording: Frank Filipetti Breaks Broadway’s Rules|url=http://www.sonicscoop.com/2011/06/08/inside-the-book-of-mormon-cast-recording-frank-filipetti-breaks-broadways-rules/|accessdate=July 7, 2011|newspaper=Sonicscoop|date=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Oremus and Lopez were heavily involved in the orchestra recording, whereas Stone and Parker were more invested in the vocal session. According to Filipetti, their main concern was making sure the jokes were coming across. The album was recorded to [[Pro Tools]] as to allow for multiple tracks of recordings to be present in the final cut. Mixing and mastering were done in April at Filipetti's studio in  [[West Nyack, New York]]. The album was mastered by [[Scott Hull (mastering engineer)|Scott Hull]].&lt;ref name=albumcredits.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Mormon [Original Broadway Cast]|url=http://albumcredits.com/Album/2191672#/Album/ProductionCredits/2191672|publisher=albumcredits.com|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filipetti set up Source Connect to enable the core producers—Oremus, Lopez, Parker and Stone—to listen in on the session in real time from Manhattan, with [[Skype]] providing an audio/video connection between the two locations.&lt;ref name=sonicscoop/&gt;

In the recording's liner notes, [[Frank Rich]] wrote that ''The Book of Mormon'' "scrupulously follows the old testament of Broadway circa 1945–1965, A.D., even while fondly spoofing it". He compares "I Believe” to “[[I Have Confidence]]” from ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', the opening number "Hello!" to “The Telephone Hour” in ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', and “Turn It Off” to “I’ll Never Be Jealous Again” from ''[[The Pajama Game]]''. Other songs, he writes, owe much to the parodies of [[Tom Lehrer]].&lt;ref name="Frank Rich liner notes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rich|first=Frank|title=Frank Rich’s Liner Notes for ''The Book of Mormon''|url=http://www.playbill.com/playblog/2011/05/frank-richs-liner-notes-for-the-book-of-mormon/|work=Playbill|accessdate=June 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625214159/http://www.playbill.com/playblog/2011/05/frank-richs-liner-notes-for-the-book-of-mormon/|archivedate=June 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristin Rawls, in her critique of the score, draws several parallels to other musicals. She likens "I Believe" to "I Have Confidence" from ''The Sound of Music'', citing similarities in their lyrics. She also makes a comparison between the Ugandans' version and presentation of Joseph Smith's story in "Joseph Smith American Moses" to "Uncle Tom's Cabin" from ''[[The King and I]]'', as well as the recalling and overlap of previous numbers in "Man Up" to ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'''s "One Day More".&lt;ref name="The Mormons Take Manhattan: The Book of Mormon soundtrack on God, Broadway and Africa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rawls|first=Kristin|title=The Mormons Take Manhattan: ''The Book of Mormon'' soundtrack on God, Broadway and Africa|url=http://globalcomment.com/2011/the-book-of-mormon-soundtrack-on-god-broadway-and-africa/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers have made other comparisons, arguing, for example, that "You and Me (But Mostly Me)" references "The Wizard and I" from ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', that "All-American Prophet" is a throw-back to ''[[The Music Man]]''{{'}}s "[[Ya Got Trouble]]"; and that "Hasa Diga Eebowai" spoofs "[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]" from ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]''.&lt;ref name="ology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.com/arts/album-review-book-mormon |title=Album Review: ''The Book of Mormon''|publisher=Ology.com|date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the audio was being  [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]], the musical's popularity exploded, giving the show a much higher profile than when the album was first recorded.&lt;ref name=sonicscoop/&gt; The cast album was promoted through advertisements running during Parker and Stone's ''[[South Park]]'' on [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref name=billboard/&gt; A free preview of the entire recording was released on [[NPR]] starting on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150631-NPR-Now-Offering-Free-Listen-to-Entire-Original-Cast-Recording-of-The-Book-of-Mormon |title= NPR Now Offering Free Listen to Entire Original Cast Recording of The Book of Mormon |work= Playbill |date= May 9, 2011 |accessdate= May 19, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110516001532/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150631-NPR-Now-Offering-Free-Listen-to-Entire-Original-Cast-Recording-of-The-Book-of-Mormon |archivedate= May 16, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sh-k-boom.com/bookofmormon.shtml |title=The Book of Mormon – Original Cast Recording – CD &amp;#124; Sh-K-Boom &amp; Ghostlight Records |publisher=Sh-k-boom.com |accessdate=May 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515134116/http://sh-k-boom.com/bookofmormon.shtml |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150224-The-Book-of-Mormon-Cast-Album-Will-Get-Digital-Release-May-17-In-Store-to-Follow-in-June |title=The Book of Mormon Cast Album Will Get Digital Release May 17; In-Store to Follow in June |work=Playbill |accessdate=May 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616111618/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150224-The-Book-of-Mormon-Cast-Album-Will-Get-Digital-Release-May-17-In-Store-to-Follow-in-June |archivedate=June 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excerpts from the cast recording are featured in an extended ''[[Fresh Air]]'' interview.

===Commercial performance===
During its first week of its [[iTunes Store]] release, the recording became "the fastest-selling Broadway cast album in iTunes history", according to representatives for the production, ranking No. 2 on its day of release on the iTunes Top 10 Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/BOOK-OF-MORMON-Cast-Recording-Named-Fastest-Selling-Ever-20110525 |title=''The Book of Mormon'' Cast Recording Named Fastest Selling Digital Release |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[Playbill]]'', "It's a rare occurrence for a Broadway [[cast album]] to place among the iTunes best sellers. The cast album for the [[Green Day]] musical ''[[American Idiot (musical)|American Idiot]]'' also ranked among the top 10 when it debuted in 2010."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/151019-The-Book-of-Mormon-Cast-Album-Debuts-on-iTunes-Top-10-Chart |title=The Book of Mormon Cast Album Debuts on iTunes Top 10 Chart |author=Adam Hetrick |work=Playbill |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522165628/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/151019-The-Book-of-Mormon-Cast-Album-Debuts-on-iTunes-Top-10-Chart |archivedate=May 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album debuted at number 31 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, with first-week sales of 13,000. The start for ''The Book of Mormon'' was also the best debut sales week for a cast set since ''[[The Little Mermaid (musical)|The Little Mermaid]]'' cast album in 2008. The cast album also started at No. 1 on the Top Cast Albums chart – the 24th topper since the list began in 2006.&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/470971/the-book-of-mormon-cast-album-scores-impressive-chart-debut|title=''The Book of Mormon'' Cast Album Scores Impressive Chart Debut|author=Keith Caulfield|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=May 26, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its initial success, the record fell to number 124 on the ''Billboard'' 200 with only 4,000 copies sold, and soon fell off the chart.&lt;ref name=billboard1/&gt;

However, after the show's success at the [[2011 Tony Awards]], ''The Book of Mormon'' cast album broke sales records again when it skyrocketed up the ''Billboard'' charts back to number 3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 on June 15, making it the highest charting Broadway cast album–and first top 10–since 1969, when ''[[Hair (Original Broadway Cast Recording)|Hair]]'' spent 13 straight weeks at No. 1.&lt;ref name="billboard1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/470542/adele-reclaims-no-1-on-billboard-200-book-of-mormon-makes-history|title=Adele Reclaims No. 1 on ''Billboard'' 200, ''Book of Mormon'' Makes History|author=Keith Caulfield|work=Billboard |date=June 15, 2011 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold over 61,000 copies, the largest sales week for any cast album since [[Nielsen SoundScan]] began tracking data in 1991. The previous best sales week for a cast set belonged to the original London cast recording of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)#Recordings|Highlights from The Phantom of the Opera]]'', which sold 54,000 over the Christmas week of 1992.&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/music/book_of_mormon_cast_album_breaks_I24Y3jOIIzVrPRWhZml2cM|title=''Book of Mormon'' cast album breaks sales record|work=New York Post |date=June 15, 2011 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many news outlets attributed its chart success not only to its physical release on June 7 and publicity from the Tony Awards, but to [[Amazon MP3]]'s sale pricing of the digital album.&lt;ref name="rstone1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/on-the-charts-amazon-gives-book-of-mormon-soundtrack-a-huge-boost-20110615|title=On the Charts: Amazon Gives ''Book of Mormon'' Soundtrack a Huge Boost|author=Steve Knopper|work=Rolling Stone |date=June 15, 2011 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retailer offered it at just $1.99 for three days during the sales tracking week that ended on Sunday (the night of the Tony broadcast). Amazon MP3 promoted the record aggressively through Twitter and through a commercial in the Tony Awards telecast.&lt;ref name=billboard1/&gt; As a result, 85 percent of the sales were digital downloads, a much higher ratio than usual.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/from-tonys-to-billboard-chart-good-week-for-book-of-mormon/|title=From Tonys to Billboard Chart: Good Week for ''Book of Mormon''|author=Ben Sisario|work=The New York Times |date=June 15, 2011 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Matthew Perpetua of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' complimented the recording's witty lyrics and memorable songs and stated the album would leave listeners "desperate to score tickets to see the actual show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/listen-to-the-hilarious-and-ridiculously-catchy-book-of-mormon-20110526 |title=Listen to the Hilarious and Ridiculously Catchy ''Book of Mormon''|last=Perpetua |first=Matthew |work=Rolling Stone |date=May 26, 2011 |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Jeffries of [[Allmusic]] stated that the music's style was vivid but traditional and the songs were "inspired" and provided a mixture of the "satirical, controversial, and the musical", but noted their coarse and blasphemic nature in his recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=David|title=The Book of Mormon – Review|publisher=Allmusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-book-of-mormon-r2191672/review|accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3120">[[File:Twistaplot.jpg|thumb|The cover for the first book in the series, written by [[R. L. Stine]].]]
'''Twistaplot''' is a series of [[children's literature|children's]] [[gamebooks]], that were published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] from 1982 to 1985. Books #1, #4, #9 and #14 were written by [[R.L. Stine]], who would go on to write the ''[[Fear Street]]'' series, and the ''[[Goosebumps]]'' series, which in turn, spawned the gamebook spin-off series, ''[[Give Yourself Goosebumps]]''. The remaining books were written by various authors including [[Louise Munro Foley]]. They were [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]'s response to the ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' series. After the success of the ''[[Goosebumps]]'' series, the books which were written by [[R. L. Stine]] were reissued with new covers in 1994 and 1995.

==Style and gameplay==
Twistaplot covers a wide variety of genres, including [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. Similar to the ''[[Give Yourself Goosebumps]]'' series, they are [[novels]] with branching plots. The books are written from the second-person perspective, in present-tense form. The protagonist in each book is never referred to by name, and the protagonist's gender is ambiguous. Thus the reader can easily imagine himself/herself as the protagonist of the storyline. But unlike the ''[[Give Yourself Goosebumps]]'' series, the books have interior illustrations.

==Spin-offs==
After the success of Twistaplot, the series spawned a series of computer games for Scholastic's electronic magazine, ''Microzine''. It also spawned another gamebook spin-off titled ''Pick-a-Path'', which was intended for a younger audience.

'''Western Leone''' is a [[Western (genre)|Western]]-style theme park in the province of [[Province of Almería|Almeria]], [[Andalusia]] (Spain).

'''Yisrael "Poli" Poliakov''' ([[Hebrew]]: ישראל פוליאקוב) (July 7, 1941 – October 30, 2007) was an [[Israel]]i [[comedian]] and actor. Poliakov was born in [[Jerusalem]], and grew up in [[Tel Aviv]]. He became one of the three members of the Israeli comedy group, [[HaGashash HaHiver]] (The Pale Tracker).&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite news |first= Shelly |last= Paz |title= Comic icon Yisrael 'Poli' Poliakov dies at 66

==Career==
Poliakov originally chose a career as a farmer and studied at the [[HaKfar HaYarok|Kfar HaYarok]] agricultural high school. This changed when he was spotted at a school party by members of [[Nahal Brigade]]'s entertainment [[:wikt:troupe|troupe]], and he was soon recruited by the group. In 1961, he joined the original singing band [[Hatarnegolim]] (The Roosters) that had been founded by [[Naomi Polani]], the original cast of which broke up in 1964.&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B9RV5UFtPNMC&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Neomi+Polani#v=onepage&amp;q=peloni&amp;f=false |title=The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Europe |publisher= |year=1999 |author=Don Rubin |accessdate=July 31, 2011|isbn=9780415251570 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kAxLAn6sOb4C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=Naomi+Polani#v=onepage&amp;q=Naomi%20Polani&amp;f=false |title=Popular music and national culture in Israel |publisher= |year= 2004|author= Motti Regev, Edwin Seroussi |accessdate=July 31, 2011|isbn=9780520236547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pqarchiver1999"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/42396744.html?dids=42396744:42396744&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jun+13%2C+1999&amp;author=Ury+Eppstein%2C+Michael+Ajzenstadt&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;desc=These+chicks+have+got+to+grow&amp;pqatl=google |title=These chicks have got to grow |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=June 13, 1999 |author=Ury Eppstein, Michael Ajzenstadt |accessdate=July 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poliakov appeared in a number of famous Israeli films, often with members of HaGashash HaHiver. His film credits include ''[[The Hit (Israeli film)|Schlager]]'' (The Hit) in 1979; ''Krav al Hava'ad'' (The House Committee) in 1986; and ''Givat Halfon Eina Ona'' (Halfon Hill Doesn't Answer) in 1975. He appeared in a number of Israeli television roles, and produced and acted in his daughter's television show, ''[[It's All Honey]]''.&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt;

Poliakov began working on stage as a theater actor in 2000.  His credits include ''[[The Israeli Family]]'', ''[[The Rubber Merchants]]'', ''God's Finger'', ''[[Mother Courage]]'' and ''The Return of Moris Shpigelman''.&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt;

===HaGashash HaHiver===
[[Abraham Deshe|Abraham "Pashanel" Deshe]], a producer and [[Talent agent|agent]] who died of cancer in 2004 at age 78, started HaGashash HaHiver in late 1963. The group was composed of three members – Poliakov, [[Yeshayahu Levy|Yeshayahu "Shaike" Levy]] and [[Gavriel Banai|Gavriel "Gavri" Banai]]. They created a "unique Israeli comedy group," according to the Jerusalem Post. Their jokes, which included the best and worst of [[Demography of Israel|Israeli society]], often achieved a [[cult status]] among fans.&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt;

In 2000, the group and its three members were awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for lifetime achievement &amp; special contribution to society for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) – Recipients’ C.V. | url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashas/Hagashas/KorotHayimGashash.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges wrote of their award decision:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The uniqueness of HaGashash HaHiver is in its two faces: On the one hand, it reflects the life and the culture that were created in Israel during its first 50 years and in the course of wars, immigration absorption and the struggle for its existence. On the other hand, it has taken an active role in shaping this culture, creating its language and sketching its identity.... Their language, Gashashit, and the images they created broke the walls of the inflexible Hebrew language and became standard idiomatic phrases, so much so that he who doesn't know them doesn't know a large part of the culture that has sprouted here. Phrases such as, 'Drive in peace, the keys are inside,' 'There was an engine?' [referring to a mechanic who cheats a client], 'Israbluff' and many others that became part of our everyday language.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) – Judges' Rationale for Grant to Recipients | url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashas/Hagashas/NimukeiAshoftimGashash.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Yisrael Poliakov died of cancer at the Rabin Medical Center-Beilinson Campus in [[Petah Tikva]] on October 30, 2007, at the age of 66, following a two-week hospitalization for heart problems. Poliakov's coffin was taken to [[Cameri Theater]] in Tel Aviv for a public [[funeral|memorial service]], and was buried in a cemetery in [[Kibbutz]] [[Einat]].&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

Fellow HaGashash HaHiver member Yeshayahu Levy told [[Israel Army Radio]]: "...lost a brother. There is no other word. We've been together since 1958, and he was part of me. He was a great talent, an outstanding comic actor, and a wonderful friend... The pain is great."&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

Actor [[Moshe Ivgi]], who costarred with Poliakov in ''The Rubber Merchant'', told the Jerusalem Post: "He was a great actor who was blessed with comic and dramatic qualities, and it was a pleasure to work with him. Poli was a modest and ego-free man, full of love, and I am sure he would have done so much more."&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

President [[Shimon Peres]] stated "Generations upon generations watched him and fell captive to his charm".&lt;ref name=jewishledger&gt;{{cite news |title= Israeli comic 'Poli' dies
