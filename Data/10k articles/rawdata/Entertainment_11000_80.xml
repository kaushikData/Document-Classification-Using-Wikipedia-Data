"'''(Can You) Feel the Passion'''" is a 1991 rave-theme House song recorded, written, and produced by the American/British group [[Blue Pearl]]. The single is to date the act's second best known song after Naked In The Rain. Can You Feel The Passion had better success in the United States, hitting No. 1 on both Billboard's [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/charts/1992-05-30/dance-club-play-songs Hot Dance Club Songs, Billboard.com, issue date May 30, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UK Dance Chart]] in 1992, while reaching No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/blue%20pearl/| title=Official Charts Company: Blue Pearl| publisher=Official Charts Company | accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The single is done in a spoken word type manner by lead singer [[Durga McBroom]], while the hook, riffs, and chorus melody provided by [[Martin Glover|Youth]] on the keyboards samples [[Bizarre Inc]]'s "[[Playing with Knives]]." Ironically, club DJs have used both "(Can You) Feel the Passion" and "Playing With Knives" in their bootleg mashups due to the former providing the lyrics and the latter's piano-heavy house feel.

'''''Cléopâtre captive''''' is a five-act [[tragedy]] by [[Étienne Jodelle]], presented on 9 February 1553, first before the King [[Henri II of France]] in the Hôtel de Reims, then at the [[Collège de Boncourt]]. The [[play (theatre)|play]] is part of the posthumous collection ''Les Œuvres et meslanges poetiques d'Estienne Jodelle Sieur du Lymodin'' (1574). [[Remy Belleau]] played the role of [[Cleopatra]], [[Jean Bastier de La Péruse]], that of [[Augustus|Octavian]]. It was the first "{{Interlanguage link multi|tragédie humaniste|fr}}", and Jodelle composed it in parallel with the first "[[humanism|humanist]] [[comedy]]", ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Eugène|fr}}''.

The performance was a success, and was followed by a celebration in the antique manner in [[Arcueil]], bringing together all participants and friends for a party known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pompe du bouc|fr}}.

== Summary ==
* '''Act 1''' : [[Mark Antony|Antony]]'s shadow announces to [[Cleopatra]] that she must die.
* '''Act 2''' : [[Augustus|Octavian]] fears that Cleopatra will commit suicide.
* '''Act 3''' : Cleopatra seeks to commiserate Octavian, offering him riches. Seleucus the servant reveals that she hides part.
* '''Act 4''' : Cleopatra decides to die.
* '''Act 5''' : Proculus narrates to Octavian the death of the Queen.

== Style ==
Jodelle was the first to use [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s in a tragedy (acts I and IV), but he also resorted to [[decasyllable]]s (acts II, III, V). In the choirs, he resorted to various meters: some verse have only three syllables.

The subject is taken from [[Plutarch]] (''Life of [[Mark Antony|Antony]]''). The action is reduced: the play tells the decision to die taken by Cleopatra and its implementation.

'''Comedy''' is a [[Film genre|genre]] of [[film]] in which the main emphasis is on [[humour]]. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/comedyfilms.html |title=Comedy Films |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending ([[black comedy]] being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.

Comedy, compared with other [[film genre]]s, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former [[stand-up comics]] transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity. While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary (such as ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' and ''[[Wag the Dog]]'').

==Subgenres==
A '''[[comedy of manners]]''' satirizes the manners and affectations of a social class, often represented by stock characters. Also, satirical comedy-drama &amp; the plot is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal. However, the plot is generally less important for its comedic effect than its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' created by [[William Shakespeare]].

'''[[Slapstick|Slapstick films]]''' involve exaggerated, boisterous action to create impossible and humorous situations. Because it relies predominately on visual depictions of events, it does not require sound. Accordingly, the subgenre was ideal for silent movies and was prevalent during that era. Popular silent stars of the slapstick genre include [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Roscoe Arbuckle]], and [[Harold Lloyd]]. Some of these stars, as well as acts such as [[Laurel and Hardy]] and [[the Three Stooges]], also found success incorporating slapstick comedy into sound films.

In a '''fish out of water comedy''', the main character or character finds himself in an unusual environment, which drives most of the humour. Situations can be neo noir crime comedy, satirical comedy-drama &amp; black comedy as sometimes as fantasy comedy behinds swapping gender roles, as in ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982); an age changing role, as in ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'' (1988); a freedom-loving individual fitting into a structured environment, as in ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' (1984); a rural backwoodsman in the big city, as in ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'', and so forth. The Coen Brothers are known for using this technique in all of their films, though not always to comic effect. Some films including people fitting the "fish-out-of-water" bill include ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998) and ''[[A Serious Man]]'' (2009).

A '''[[Parody film|parody or spoof film]]''' is a comedy that satirizes other film genres or classic films. Such films mockumentary, employ sarcasm, stereotyping, mockery of scenes from other films, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Examples of this form include ''[[Mud and Sand]]'' (1922), ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), ''[[Airplane!]]'' (1980), ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974),and ''[[Scary Movie]] (2000).

The '''anarchic comedy film''', as its name suggests, is a random or stream-of-consciousness type of humour which often lampoons a form of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Absurd Comedy|url=http://www.allmovie.com/subgenre/absurd-comedy-d622|publisher=Allmovies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre dates from the silent era, and the most famous examples of this type of film would be those produced by [[Monty Python]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sexton|first=Timothy|title=Anarchic Comedy from the Silent Era to Monty Python|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/news/anarchic-comedy-silent-era-monty-python-173500945.html|publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933) and ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' (1978).

The '''[[black comedy]]''' film deals with normally [[taboo]] subjects, including death, murder, crime, suicide, and war, in a satirical manner. Examples include ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955), ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The Loved One]]'' (1965), ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983), ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983), ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), ''[[The War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'' (1989), ''[[Heathers]]'' (1989), ''[[Your Friends &amp; Neighbors]]'' (1998), ''[[Keeping Mum]]'' (2005), ''[[Burn After Reading]]'' (2008), [[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|''The Wolf of Wall Street'']] (2013) and ''[[Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri]]'' (2017).

'''[[Gross out]] films''' are a relatively recent development and rely heavily on vulgar, sexual or "toilet" humour. Examples include ''[[Porky's]]'' (1982), ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' (1994), ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998), and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (1999).

It was not uncommon for the early [[romantic comedy]] film to also be a '''[[screwball comedy film]]'''. This form of comedy film was particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s. There is no consensus definition of this film style, and it is often loosely applied to slapstick or romantic comedy films. Typically it can include a romantic element, an interplay between people of different economic strata, quick and witty [[repartee]], some form of role reversal, and a happy ending. Some examples of the screwball comedy are: ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), and more recently, ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972).

===Hybrid subgenres===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}

====Action comedy====
Films in this sub-genre blend comic antics and action where the film stars combine with and one-liners with a thrilling plot and daring stunts. The genre became a specific draw in North America in the eighties when comedians such as [[Eddie Murphy]] started taking more action oriented roles such as in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. These types of films are often [[buddy films]], with mismatched partners such as in ''[[Midnight Run]]'', ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'', ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'', ''[[Starsky and Hutch (film)|Starsky and Hutch]]'', and ''[[Hot Fuzz]]''. [[Slapstick]] [[martial arts films]] became a mainstay of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] through the work of [[Jackie Chan]] among others. It may also focus on [[superhero]]es such as ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Hancock (film)|Hancock]]'', ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'', and ''[[Mystery Men (film)|Mystery Men]]''. It may focus on [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] such as ''[[Kung Fu Panda (franchise)|Kung Fu Panda]]''.

====[[Comedy horror]]====
Comedy horror is a type of film in which the usual dark themes and "scare tactics" attributed to horror films are treated with a humorous approach. These films either use goofy horror cliches, such as in ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'', ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|Haunted Mansion]]'', and ''[[Scary Movie]]'' where campy styles are favoured.  Some are much more subtle and don't parody horror, such as ''[[An American Werewolf In London]]''. Another style of comedy horror can also rely on over the top violence and gore such as in ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981), ''[[Re-Animator]]'' (1985), ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'' (1992), and ''[[Club Dread]]'' (2004) - such films are sometimes known as ''splatstick'', a portmanteau of the words ''splatter'' and ''slapstick''. It would be reasonable to put ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' in this category.

====[[Comedy thriller]]====
A genre that combines elements of comedy and thrillers, a combination of humor and suspense or action.  Films such as ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'', ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'', ''[[In Bruges]]'', ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]'', ''[[Grosse Point Blank]]'', ''[[The Thin Man]]'', ''[[The Big Fix (1978 film)|The Big Fix]]'', and ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]''.

====Fantasy comedy====
Fantasy comedy films are types of films that uses [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]], [[supernatural]] and or mythological figures for comic purposes. Most fantasy comedy includes an element of parody, or satire, turning many of the fantasy conventions on their head such as the hero becoming a cowardly fool, the princess being a klutz. Examples of these films include ''[[The Chipmunk Adventure]]'', ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'', ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', ''[[Ernest Saves Christmas]]'', ''[[Ernest Scared Stupid]]'', ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', and ''[[Shrek]]''.

====[[Comic science fiction]]====
Sci-fi comedy films, like most hybrid genre of comedy, use the elements of [[science fiction films]] to over the top extremes and exaggerated science fiction stereotypical characters. Examples of these types of films include ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'', ''[[Innerspace]]'', ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'', ''[[Men in Black (series)|Men in Black]]'', and ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]''.

====Military comedy====
{{anchor|Service comedy}}

Military comedy films involve comic situations in [[war film|a military setting]]. When a film is primarily about the experience of civilians called into military service and still feeling out of place, it may be referred to as a "service comedy". Because war is such a grim subject, many military comedies are set in peacetime or during wartime but away from battle zones. Military and service comedies include:

====[[Romantic comedy]]====
The '''romantic comedy film''' subgenre typically involves the development of a relationship between a man and a woman. The stereotyped plot line follows the "boy-gets-girl", "boy-loses-girl", "boy gets girl back again" sequence. Naturally, there are innumerable variants to this plot, and much of the generally light-hearted comedy lies in the social interactions and sexual tensions between the pair. Examples of this style of film include ''[[It (1927 film)|It]]'' (1927), ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931), ''[[It's a Wonderful World (1939 film)|It's a Wonderful World]]'' (1939), ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'' (1940), ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954), ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990), ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994), and ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998).

'''''Filament''''' was a quarterly erotic magazine aimed at women,&lt;ref name="OHC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/can-an-excivil-servant-finally-persuade-women-to-buy-erotica-1691814.html|title=Can an ex-civil servant finally persuade women to buy erotica?|last1=Taylor|first1=Jerome|date=28 May 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the United Kingdom. It ran for 9 issues, from June 2009 to December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=November 2011 |url=http://www.filamentmagazine.com/2011/11/all-good-things-must-come-to-an-end/ |author=Suraya |title=All Good Things Must Come To An End |accessdate=1 August 2012 |archivedate=2 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802053554/http://www.filamentmagazine.com/2011/11/all-good-things-must-come-to-an-end/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine featured both explicit and non-explicit pornographic imagery of men, designed specifically for heterosexual women (as distinct from that designed for gay men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filamentmagazine.com/FAQs.aspx |title=FAQ |accessdate=8 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726100010/http://www.filamentmagazine.com/faqs.aspx |archivedate=26 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The magazine claimed to use "academic and primary research" in producing its content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filamentmagazine.com/the-female-gaze/ |title=The Female Gaze, Filament Magazine website |accessdate=28 June 2009 |archivedate=19 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619065952/http://www.filamentmagazine.com/the-female-gaze/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reactions to ''Filament'' were varied.

==Erection Campaign==
In August 2009 ''Filament'' magazine began a campaign to become the first UK women's magazine to publish an [[erection]] pictorial, after the printers of its first issue declined to print the second if it contained such images. ''Filament'' sought to sell 328 further copies of the first issue to finance changing printer, and succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filamentmagazine.com/fundraise.aspx |title=Filament magazine erection campaign page |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809060058/http://www.filamentmagazine.com/fundraise.aspx |archivedate=9 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign attracted support from high-profile figures such as [[Zoe Margolis]] and [[Warren Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/13/women-erotica-sex-objects-magazine|author1=Kristina Lloyd|author2=Mathilde Madden|title=A limp response to women's erotica|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Gateball'''|ゲートボール|gētobōru|lead=yes}} is a mallet team sport inspired by [[croquet]].  It is a fast-paced, non-contact, highly strategic team game, which can be played by anyone regardless of age or gender.

Gateball is played on a rectangular court {{convert|20|m}} long and {{convert|15|m}} wide.  Each court has three gates and a goal pole.  The game is played by two teams (red and white) of up to five players.   Each player has a numbered ball corresponding to their playing order.  The odd-numbered balls are red and the even-numbered balls are white.  Teams score one point for each ball hit through a gate and two points for hitting the goal pole, in accordance with the rules.  A game of gateball lasts for thirty minutes and the winner is the team with the most points at the end of the game.

==History==
Gateball was invented in [[Japan]] by [[Suzuki Kazunobu]] in 1947.  At the time there was a severe shortage of rubber needed to make the balls used in many sports.   Suzuki, then working in the lumber industry on the northern island of Hokkaido, realised there was a ready supply of the wood used to make croquet balls and mallets.  He revised the rules of croquet and created gateball as a game for young people.&lt;ref name=Guttman&gt;Guttman, Allen and Lee Thompson (2001)  Japanese Sport: A History.  Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Gateball first became popular in the late 1950s when a physical education instructor introduced gateball to the women's societies and senior citizens’ clubs of Kumamoto City.  In 1962, the [[Kumamoto Gateball Association]] was formed and established a local set of rules. This version of the game became known nationally when it was demonstrated at a national fitness meet in Kumamoto in 1976.  Shortly afterwards the gateball's popularity exploded as local government officials and representatives of senior citizens’ organisations introduced the sport around the country.&lt;ref name=Guttman/&gt;

In 1984, the [[Japanese Gateball Union]] (JGU) was founded.  Under the leadership of its inaugural chairman, [[Ryoichi Sasakawa]], the JGU developed a unified set of rules and organised the first national meet.  The following year, the JGU joined with five countries and regions, China, Korea, Brazil, United States of America and Chinese Taipei, to form the World Gateball Union (WGU).  The WGU has since been joined by Bolivia (1987), Paraguay (1987), Peru (1987), Argentina (1989), Canada (1989), Singapore (1994), Hong Kong (1998), Australia (2003), Macao (2005), Philippines (2012) and Indonesia (2013). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gateball.or.jp/jguweb/wgu/organization/file/organization_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Gateball_Court.gif|thumbnail|right|600px|A gateball court showing the direction that a ball must pass through the three gates]] --&gt;
Gateball is played between two teams of up to five people on a rectangular field 15-20 meters long and 20-25 wide.  The two teams use five balls each, either red or white depending on the team, and play in an alternating fashion between red and white the balls numbered from 1 to 10.  Each player plays the same ball throughout the game.  At the beginning of the game the players, in order, place their ball in the designated “start area” and attempt to hit the ball through the first gate.  If they successfully pass through the gate they may play again.  If the player misses the first gate, or their ball passes through the first gate but ends up outside of the court, they pick up their ball and have to try again in the second round.(Since the 2015 rule changes, a ball going through the first gate but ending up out of bounds is deemed to have passed Gate1 but is an outball and will attempt to enter court on their next turn from the place the ball went outball).

When stroking, if the ball hits another ball, this is called a "touch".  If both the stroker's ball and the touched ball remain within the inside line, the stroker shall step on the stroker's ball and place the other touched ball so that it is touching the stroker's ball, and hit the strokers ball with the stick (this play is called a “spark”), sending the other touched ball off as the result of the impact.  By passing through a gate or sparking the ball, a player receives another turn.

One point is given for every gate the ball passes in order and two points for hitting the goal-pole.  The winner is the team with the most points at the end of thirty minutes.  As the red team always gets to play first, the white team always has the final turn, even if time has elapsed before the final white ball is called.

==Competitions==
===World Games===
In 2001, gateball was included as an exhibition event at the 6th World Games.  The competition was held in Akita Prefecture in Japan and was attended by teams from China, Japan, South Korea, the USA and Chinese Taipei.  The final was won by a team of mostly teenage players from Japan.

===World Gateball Championship===
The World Gateball Championships are held every four years.  The inaugural championship in 1986 was played in Hokkaido with teams from Brazil, China, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea and the United States of America.  Subsequent championships were held in Hawaii (1998); Toyama, Japan (2002); Jeju, South Korea (2006); Shanghai, China( 2010); and Niigata (Japan) in 2014.

The 10th World Championship was played on 17-19 September 2010 in Shanghai China.  The competition was contested by 96 teams from 14 countries/regions including Australia, Brazil, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Paraguay, the Philippines, South Korea, Russia and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gateball.or.jp/jguweb/wgu/competition/file/10_wag.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th World Championship was held in São Paulo In Brazil on September 21-23 in 2018.

'''Glen Hearst Taylor''' (April 12, 1904 – April 28, 1984) was an American politician, entertainer, businessman, and [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Idaho]].&lt;ref name=pmgtd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2gNMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lPkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7010%2C1216100 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Political maverick Glen Taylor dies |date=May 4, 1984 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/05/obituaries/glen-h-taylor-of-idaho-dies-wallace-running-mate-in-48.html |newspaper=New York Times |last=Flint |first=Peter B. |title=Glen H.

He was the [[U.S. vice president|vice presidential]] candidate on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 election]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Taylor was otherwise a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. By one measure Taylor was the second most liberal member of the U.S. Senate (trailing only [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]]), and the fourth most liberal member of Congress overall between 1937 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voteview.com/Is_John_Kerry_A_Liberal.htm Is John Kerry A Liberal?] (accessed January 20, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in a boarding house in [[Portland, Oregon]], Taylor was the twelfth of thirteen children of Pleasant John Taylor and Olive Higgins Taylor.&lt;ref name=prowohon&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uIeBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |last=Peterson |first=F. Ross |title=''Prophet without honor: Glen H. Taylor and the fight for American liberalism'' |date=1974 |pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a retired Texas ranger and wandering [[preacher]],&lt;ref name="Gunther"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunther|first=John|authorlink=John Gunther|title=[[Inside U.S.A. (book)|Inside U.S.A.]]|pages=107–113|location=[[New York City|New York]], [[London]]|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Brothers]]|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the family was with him in Portland for a protracted soul-saving meeting. The family [[Homestead (buildings)|homesteaded]] in [[North Central Idaho|north central]] Idaho near [[Kooskia, Idaho|Kooskia]], and Taylor attended the public schools. In 1919, after completing the eighth grade, he joined his older brother's [[stock theater]] company,&lt;ref name=pmgtd/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; and between 1926 and 1944, he became the owner and manager of various entertainment enterprises. Taylor was also a [[country-western]] singer; his older sister, Lena, became famous as a jazz singer under the name [[Lee Morse]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="ancestry"&gt;[http://boards.ancestry.com/topics.obits/108489/mb.ashx U.S. Senator Glen H. Taylor (1904–1094)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor was inspired to run for political office by [[King Camp Gillette]]'s book ''The People's Corporation''&lt;ref name="ancestry"/&gt; and [[Stuart Chase]]'s 1932 book ''A New Deal''. In 1935 Taylor unsuccessfully attempted to organize a [[Farmer–Labor Party (United States)|Farmer–Labor Party]] in [[Nevada]] and [[Montana]].&lt;ref name="PNQ"&gt;Pratt, William C. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/40489158 "Glen H. Taylor: Public Image and Reality"], ''[[Pacific Northwest Quarterly]]'', January 1969. (accessed January 20, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

By the late 1930s, Taylor had settled in [[Eastern Idaho|eastern]] Idaho at [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]]. His first political campaign was in 1938 for an open seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] from the [[Idaho's 2nd congressional district|second district]], but he finished a distant fourth in the Democratic primary.&lt;ref name="ancestry"/&gt;

Taylor first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1940 in a special election to fill the remaining term of the late [[William Borah]], but lost to appointee [[John W. Thomas]], with 47.1 to 52.9 percent. Despite being labeled as "semi-socialistic" and "communistic," he ran again in 1942 against Thomas and lost a closer race, 48.5 to 51.5 percent. Taylor lost both elections to Thomas because of stiff opposition from state Democratic Party leaders.&lt;ref name="PNQ"/&gt; Between elections Taylor supported himself as a painter's assistant and sheet metal worker in [[California]].&lt;ref name="Gunther"/&gt;

In a third try for the U.S. Senate, Taylor ran for the other Idaho seat in 1944, defeating incumbent [[David Worth Clark|D. Worth Clark]] in the Democratic primary, and Governor [[C. A. Bottolfsen]] in the general election. Taylor, the first professional actor ever elected to the [[United States Congress]], had never been east of [[Chicago]] prior to his election.&lt;ref name="Gunther"/&gt;

In the Senate, Taylor, known as "The Singing Cowboy," acquired a reputation for eccentric behavior. Upon his arrival in Washington D.C., Taylor rode his horse, Nugget, up the steps of the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyforsale.com/html/prodetails.asp?bw=0&amp;documentid=71488 GLEN TAYLOR Autograph] (accessed January 19, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Nugget also accompanied Taylor during a 1947 tour of the country highlighting his anti-war activism and opposition to the U.S. foreign policy of the time.&lt;ref name=igtonfto&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R3pWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZuUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7003%2C5678007 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=(AP photo) |title=Idaho's Senator Glen Taylor off on horse on trip |date=October 28, 1947 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tbcnpr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mOkpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9_8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4783%2C1882703 |newspaper=Toledo Blade |location=Ohio |agency=United Press  |title=Taylor begins cross-nation 'peace' ride |date=October 27, 1947 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hbsolon&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GiY_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wk0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3540%2C2001297 |newspaper=Tuscaloosa News |location=Alabama |agency=United Press |title=Horse-borne solon decides nag's no good |date=October 30, 1947 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wtsrahan&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XYpaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=604DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1770%2C5695537 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |location=Florida |agency=United Press |last=Othman |first=Frederick |title=Why the senator rides a horse across nation |date=November 9, 1947 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Taylor moved to Washington in preparation to be [[inaugural|sworn in]] in January 1945, the housing shortage caused by [[World War II]] continued to be in full swing and he and his family had a difficult time finding a place to live. In response, Taylor {{spaced ndash}} a musician and songwriter {{spaced ndash}} stood outside the U.S. Capitol building and sang, "O give us a home, near the Capitol dome, with a yard for two children to play ..." to the tune of ''[[Home on the Range]]''.&lt;ref name=tcpfhm&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MlcVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k-QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6851%2C486153 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Taylor croons plea for home  |date=January 4, 1945 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his family were offered several places to rent. Taylor was appointed to the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking and Currency]] after telling Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] that he was qualified for the post because he had been a depositor with several banks. In October 1945, Taylor submitted a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] to the Senate "favoring the creation of a [[World government|world republic]]."&lt;ref name="Gunther"/&gt;

In July 1946, at a convention of the [[National Lawyers Guild]] in Cleveland, Senator Taylor said:     &lt;blockquote&gt;Success of monopolies in dealing with the present Congress is evident in the wrecking of price control, profit-guaranteeing tax rebates, blocking of power projects in the Columbia and Missouri Valleys, pigeonholing of the minimum wage bill and in the emasculation of the 1944 [[Kilgore Reconversion Bill]] and the 1945 [[Murray Full-Employment Bill]]. &lt;br&gt; Monopolies have so influenced our foreign policy that it serves monopoly and monopolistic aims.&lt;ref&gt;

On election night in 1946, Taylor made national headlines by allegedly breaking the jaw of local Republican leader Ray McKaig in a hotel lobby in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].&lt;ref name=spelpn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MTwbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=70wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6640%2C2720543 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Press |agency=United Press |title=Senator packs election punch |date=November 6, 1946 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor claimed that McKaig had called him an obscene name, and struck him first with a punch that broke his nose,&lt;ref name=tcjawofpo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MeNXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l_UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6464%2C1120624 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Taylor cracks jaw of political rival |date=November 6, 1946 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nine&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Senator's Nose is Broken in Brawl|newspaper=Charleston Gazette|date=November 9, 1946|agency=Associated Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but McKaig denied those claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Confusion Surrounds Taylor-McKaig Tift|newspaper=Soda Springs Sun|date=November 14, 1946|agency=United Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKaig, 66, claimed that while he was lying on the floor Taylor proceeded to kick him in the face,&lt;ref name=plkifc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OONXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l_UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7181%2C3108813 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=United Press |title=Jaw in plaster, McKaig says Taylor "kicked me in face" |date=November 14, 1946 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Taylor denied that claim.&lt;ref name=nine/&gt;&lt;ref name=sttobbh&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3MtSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2n4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6751%2C877150 |newspaper=Deseret News |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |agency=Associated Press|title=Sen.

Taylor also feuded with other Idaho Democrats, often making critical remarks about [[Charles C. Gossett|Charles Gossett]], who resigned as governor in November 1945 to have his successor appoint him to the vacant U.S. Senate seat. During the 1946 Democratic primary in June, Taylor openly supported Gossett's opponent, [[George E. Donart|George Donart]], calling the appointed incumbent Gossett a "conservative" who "hobnobbed" with Republicans in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%208/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201946%20Grayscale/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201946%20Grayscale%20-%203175.pdf "Stassen Faces Severe Test In Nebraska"], ''[[The Daily Gazette|The Schenectady Gazette]]'', June 10, 1946. (accessed January 19, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Senate, Taylor became noted for lengthy speeches which were often critical of President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s policies, particularly in foreign affairs. He was particularly critical of the [[Truman Doctrine]] and the [[Marshall Plan]], both of which he believed brought the United States closer to war with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=4978 Our Campaigns – Candidate – Glen H. Taylor] (accessed January 20, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was decidedly less critical of the Soviet Union than most of his Senate colleagues, once noting that there was no need to criticize Soviet policy when there were 90 other Senators willing to do it every day.&lt;ref name="PNQ"/&gt;

===Civil rights activism===
Taylor was an early proponent of the [[civil rights movement]] and as a United States Senator openly opposed [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] policies and supporters. In January 1947 Taylor requested that the Senate delay the swearing in of [[Mississippi]] Sen. [[Theodore G. Bilbo]], who had been reelected in 1946, pending investigation of charges against Bilbo for corruption and civil rights violations. As a result, Bilbo – well known for his segregationist, racially charged rhetoric – was never formally seated for his final Senate term. The impasse was not completely resolved until Bilbo's death in August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Members_Death_Ends_a_Senate_Predicament.htm Member's Death Ends a Senate Predicament] (accessed January 19, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor was arrested on May 1, 1948, in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], by police commissioner [[Eugene "Bull" Connor]], for attempting to use a door reserved for African Americans, rather than the whites-only door, while attempting to attend a meeting of the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]]. He was subsequently convicted of disorderly conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Diane McWhorter, ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution'' (Simon &amp; Schuster/Touchstone, 2001), pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roswell connection===

In July 1947, Taylor was asked by a [[United Press International|United Press]] &lt;!-- added "International" in 1958 --&gt;reporter what he thought about reports [[Roswell UFO incident|that remnants of a UFO had been found]] by the Air Force near [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. Taylor replied that he almost hoped flying saucers would turn out to be spaceships from another planet. "They could end our petty arguments on earth." He went on to say that no matter what the UFOs turned out to be, they "can't be laughed off."

"Even if it is only a psychological phenomenon, it is a sign of what the world is coming to," Taylor explained. "If we don't ease the tensions, the whole world will be full of psychological cases and eventually turn into a global nuthouse."

===1948 vice presidential nomination===

In 1948 Taylor was chosen as the vice presidential candidate on the Progressive ticket headed by former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] of [[Iowa]].&lt;ref name=pmgtd/&gt; The unabashedly leftist Wallace/Taylor ticket failed to carry any states and won only 2.4 percent of the nationwide popular vote. The nomination prompted an effort by conservatives within the [[Idaho Democratic Party]] to expel him from its ranks, but was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=102956798 SEN. TAYLOR STILL A DEMOCRAT], ''The Daily News'' (Huntingdon, Pennsylvania), March 3, 1948. (accessed January 19, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950 reelection run==

In 1950, former Senator [[David Worth Clark]] sought to regain his Senate seat from Taylor. Taylor's run on the Progressive ticket earned him a reputation as an "incorrigible leftist" in Idaho and contributed to his defeat in his reelection campaign in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Schwantes, Carlos A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2o-jtlc5UTcC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=%22Glen+H.+Taylor%22+%22Charles+C.+Gossett%22+%22Time%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vqAuAlxr9P&amp;sig=47hNUfknsiYu-pOvwOFtDH-2i6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2Q4ZT9GlNdLs2AW-1N2EDA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Glen%20H.%20Taylor%22%20%22Charles%20C.%20Gossett%22%20%22Time%22&amp;f=false In Mountain Shadows: A History of Idaho], p. 242. (accessed January 20, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was defeated in the Democratic primary by Clark, who in turn lost in the general election to conservative Republican [[Herman Welker]].

* 1940 was a special election (November) to complete the final two years of the term vacated by the death of [[William Borah]] on January 19, 1940.&lt;br&gt;Thomas, a former U.S. Senator (1928–1933), was appointed to the seat by Governor C. A. Bottolfsen on January 27.

==Later life==

Taylor served as president of Coryell Construction Company from 1950 to 1952, but was forced to resign after being labeled a "security risk," jeopardizing a government contract. Afterwards he was often forced to work manual labor construction jobs.&lt;ref name="ancestry"/&gt; He ran again for the Senate in 1954 but was decisively beaten by Republican incumbent [[Henry Dworshak]], winning only 37.2 percent of the vote. His sixth and final Senate attempt came in 1956; he narrowly lost the Democratic primary to 32-year-old lawyer [[Frank Church]],&lt;ref name=ctctih&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UkBYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0vYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=872%2C4316815 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Church-Taylor contest 'tightest' in history |date=August 15, 1956 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csltwcc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=85RfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FTEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1517%2C5366895 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |agency=Associated Press |title=Church still leads Taylor with canvasses completed|date=August 22, 1956 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fcpwrt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SkIvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XEgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2557%2C723012 |newspaper=Deseret News |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |last=Fleeson |first=Doris |agency=(editorial)|title=Frank Church promises Welker real test |date=September 5, 1956 |page=18A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gtmynsg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SQIdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xYoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5160%2C693527 |newspaper=Sarasota Journal |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |title=Glen Taylor may head new splinter party |date=October 8, 1956 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then got 5.1 percent of the vote in the general election as a write-in candidate.&lt;ref name=ibntrec&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hspeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hDIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1101%2C851793 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |agency=Associated Press |title=Idaho balloting nearly ties record |date=November 8, 1956 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1958, Taylor proposed that Church take a [[Polygraph|lie detector test]] about fraud in the 1956 primary.&lt;ref name=chrejpl&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FjFWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7002%2C2442807 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Church rejects plan by ex-Senator Taylor |date=March 7, 1958 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Taylor and his wife Dora moved to [[Millbrae, California]], and began making hairpieces by hand based on a hairpiece Taylor made for himself in the early 1940s.&lt;ref name=pmgtd/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; By 1960 Taylor Topper Inc. had become the major manufacturer of [[Toupée|hair replacement]]s in the United States. Taylor told the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 1978 that it was something he was very familiar with. "I was 18, a juvenile leading man in a traveling show, and my hair had begun to fall out. There isn't much demand for bald juvenile leading men, and I tried everything – sheep dip, what have you – and that just made it fall out faster."

Taylor explained that he had run for public office without the hairpiece and found that voters "didn't have much use for bald politicians", but "I ran the fourth time with it and won." His original [[toupée]] was made from a tin pie plate, which he lined with pink felt and swatches of human hair. In 1958, he was granted a patent (#2,850,023) for his innovative product.&lt;ref name=tstytpe&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TTwsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LcwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4606%2C1210301 |newspaper=Spartanburg Herald |location=South Carolina |title=The Sen.

Glen and Dora Taylor had three sons between 1935 and 1942, Glen Arod – Dora spelled backward, followed by Paul Jon and Greg.&lt;ref name=pmgtd/&gt;

==Critical reception==
The show has received a generally positive reaction from critics and audiences alike. 
[[TV.com]]'s Ruth Margolis claimed that "[Amstell's] written a sitcom stuffed with gently funny moments and acerbic gems", but suggested "a few more naturalistic pauses would have just polished this into the self-assured comedy it so wants to be."&lt;ref name="TV.com"/&gt; Other publications had differing opinions. UK's ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''' claimed on their website that "[Amstell's] brilliantly funny but we won’t be inviting him round for tea."&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; Sam Wollaston of ''[[The Guardian]]'' asked, "Can Simon act, though? Well, it's hard to know really, given that he's essentially just being himself", but comes around to the opinion that "Grandma's House is sharply written, with some nice lines and a bit of edge to it."&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt; Two weeks later, Wollaston revealed "I'm enjoying Grandma's House more and more (...) there's a subtlety and a sharpness about it. And yeah, it's funny."&lt;ref name="The Guardian 2"/&gt;

Jewish media outlets such as the ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'' were pleased that the show was bringing [[Jewish humour]] to mainstream audiences&lt;ref name="Jewish Chronicle"/&gt; and the newspaper also described the show as "genius".&lt;ref name="Jewish Chronicle 2"/&gt;

A '''guest host''' (or '''guest presenter''' in the United Kingdom) is a host, usually of a [[talk show]], that substitutes for the regular host if they are, for example, ill or have other commitments. Although guest hosts are often undesirable, some shows have seen the guest host do a better job than the main host, and filling in as a guest host has helped to launch the careers of a variety of television and radio talents. In U.S. radio, the concept of a guest host is known as a "swing jock".

==History==

===''The Tonight Show''===
This phrase was popularized on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' during [[Johnny Carson]]'s 30-year reign as host from 1962 to 1992. Toward the end of his tenure, Carson was granted more personal time off, and substitute hosts would be seen on the air more often. "Permanent guest host" is an [[oxymoron]] that likely originated on ''The Tonight Show''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Some guest hosts of ''The Tonight Show'' have gone on to host talk shows of their own. [[Jay Leno]] went on to succeed Johnny Carson; [[Joan Rivers]] went on to host ''[[The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]; and [[David Brenner]] hosted the short-lived ''[[Nightlife (TV series)|Nightlife]]'' in the late-1980s.  [[Richard Belzer]] hosted ''[[Hot Properties (talk show)|Hot Properties]]'' on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime network]] in the mid-1980s{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. When Rivers was fired by FOX in 1988, ''The Late Show'' adopted a format consisting only of guest hosts.  One of them, [[Arsenio Hall]], went on to his own show, which lasted 1989 to 1994.

===''The View''===
''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' first became popular with the guest host format in between the arrivals and departures of the program's youngest co-hosts, [[Debbie Matenopoulos]], [[Lisa Ling]], and [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]]. Although a variety of celebrities took turns in the chair, only the younger co-hosts were eligible for the job. During its tenth season, ''The View'' began featuring a guest host each day; regular [[Barbara Walters]] did not appear with anybody yet was considered eligible to replace [[Star Jones]], who left the previous year. Following the departure of [[Rosie O'Donnell]] in 2007 the program looked to return to a panel of five women. The moderator role was given to comedian [[Whoopi Goldberg]] in August and Jones' role was given to actress and comedian [[Sherri Shepherd]] the week following Goldberg's debut. ''The View'' used the guest host format in place of Elisabeth Hasselbeck in 2009 while she was on maternity leave.

===Other guest host examples===
*''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' uses guest hosts as the permanent format.
*''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan ]]'':  the show adopted a guest host format when either [[Ryan Seacrest]] or [[Kelly Ripa]] is away.
*''[[Later (talk show)|Later]]'':  After [[Greg Kinnear]] left the program in 1996 for a film career, NBC's late night talk show went to a "guest host of the week" format featuring mostly young comedians and actors for two years before settling on [[Cynthia Garrett]] in 1998.
*''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|Late Late Show]]'':  In late 2004, between [[Craig Kilborn]]'s departure and [[Craig Ferguson]]'s hiring to CBS's ''Late Late Show'', ''Late Late'' rotated through several guest hosts, including [[Jim Rome]], [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Tim Robbins]], [[David Alan Grier]], [[Ana Gasteyer]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Michael Ian Black]], and [[Craig Ferguson]]. This format was used again during between the transition from Craig Ferguson to [[James Corden]] in the winter of 2015.
*''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'':  Rosie O'Donnell also used the format during the final season of her own talk show. Comedian [[Caroline Rhea]] was given the role of permanent guest host when receiving growing popularity for hosting when O'Donnell was on sick leave the previous year. Following O'Donnell's return, Rhea hosted every Friday edition of the program until it went off the air.  Like Joan Rivers with the Tonight Show, Rhea went on to host her own talk show the following year.  It, too, was cancelled after only one season.
*''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'': Despite Williams insisting she would never allow a guest host, the actor [[Jerry O'Connell]] filled in for her during March 2018.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, some shows have guest presenters on a permanent basis. ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' has used a different [[List of Have I Got News for You presenters|guest presenter]] for each show since [[Angus Deayton]]'s departure in 2002. On ''The Jack Docherty Show'' in the late 1990s, [[Jack Docherty]] was absent so often that the show (retitled ''Not the Jack Docherty Show'') more often than not had a fill-in. When [[Simon Amstell]] left his role on ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', [[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks presenters|guest hosts]] took over the role to December 2013, not unlike a similar incident during [[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 18|Series 18]].

===Other uses===
*The frequency of guest presenters on certain shows has been parodied by the [[Onion News Network]]'s Clifford Banes character, who never presents his show for a variety of absurd reasons, and is always replaced by a guest presenter.
*Daytime syndicated talk shows of the 1960s and 1970s most often featured a celebrity guest hosting the show ''alongside'' the show's host—most notable of these is ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''.
* [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]  had [[List of WWE Raw guest stars|weekly guest hosts]] (either celebrities, [[WWE Hall of Fame]]rs and injured or retired wrestlers) as [[kayfabe]] bookers on their flagship show ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''.

'''''Hannah Montana''''', also known as '''''Hannah Montana Forever''''' in its fourth and final season, is an American [[musical comedy]] television series created by [[Michael Poryes]], [[Rich Correll]], and [[Barry O'Brien]]. It focuses on [[Miley Stewart]] (portrayed by [[Miley Cyrus]]), who is a teenager living a [[Alter ego|double life]] as an average schoolgirl by day and as the famous recording artist Hannah Montana by night, which she keeps secret and only a few people know of her alter ego. The story follows the daily life of Stewart, her brother Jackson, her best friends Lily and Oliver, and her father Robby (Cyrus's real-life country singer father, [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]).

The series, produced by [[It's a Laugh Productions]] and Michael Poryes Productions, premiered on [[Disney Channel]] on March 24, 2006, garnering  5.4 million views, giving the Disney Channel the highest ratings in its history and concluded on January 16, 2011 after having aired four seasons and ninety-eight episodes. The [[soundtrack album]]s ''[[Hannah Montana (soundtrack)|Hannah Montana]]'' (2006), ''[[Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus]]'' (2007), ''[[Hannah Montana 3]]'' (2009), and ''[[Hannah Montana Forever]]'' (2010) were released to coincide with their respective seasons. In 2007, the success of the series led to the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]], which visited North America. The following year, it was adapted into the [[3D film]] ''[[Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert]]'' and its accompanying [[Best of Both Worlds Concert (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. In 2009, the first [[feature film]] of the series, titled ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'' was released to commercial success, and was additionally promoted through its accompanying [[Hannah Montana: The Movie (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. All seasons of the show have been distributed on DVD.

The series received generally favorable reviews from critics and was praised by audiences. Although it has been recognized as a "[[guilty pleasure]]" by several media outlets. The show's instant success is widely credited with the launch of Cyrus's career and her establishment as a [[teen idol]]. However, as she continued to develop an increasingly provocative image as the series progressed, the series has received criticism for appearing to be a negative influence on its younger audience.

Miley's best friend Lilly Truscott discovered her secret while attending a Hannah Montana concert.&lt;ref name="TVGuideSeriesPremiere"/&gt; Later in the first season, Miley herself revealed her secret to their close friend Oliver Oken with the intention of ending his romantic interest in Hannah Montana. Lilly and Oliver assumed the aliases Lola Luftnagle and Mike Standley III when appearing with Hannah in order to protect her secret. Meanwhile, Jackson is employed at Rico's Surf Shop, where his child-aged boss Rico Suave often assigns him to complete embarrassing tasks.

Miley, Lilly, and Oliver begin high school in the second season. Rico, who begins high school after skipping several grades, nearly discovers Miley's secret on several occasions. Later in the season, Miley admits to Jake Ryan, whom she initially disliked and later dated in the second season, that she is Hannah Montana. However, their briefly rekindled relationship ends after he struggles to adopt a normal, non-celebrity lifestyle, which Miley is concerned she will lose as a result of dating the actor.

While Miley is off shooting a movie (a parody of Indiana Jones), Lilly and Oliver begin dating in the third season. Though Miley initially feels uncomfortable with the changed dynamic of their friendship, she often helps the pair reconcile after arguing with one another. Miley herself begins dating Jake again, but develops feelings for her bandmate Jesse. Jackson moves into his own apartment while attending college, while Lilly moves in with the Stewart family after her mother finds work in Atlanta, Georgia. In the two-part season finale, Robby buys a ranch in Malibu to bring Miley's horse Blue Jeans from Tennessee, while Jackson leaves his apartment and returns home. Oliver also embarks on a tour with the band that lived above Jackson's former apartment.

In the fourth season, the Stewart family moves into their new ranch, and Miley finds out that Jake was cheating on her, from Oliver who has a photo of Jake nibbling another girl's ear. She breaks up with him and soon starts to date Jesse. He admits that he discovered her secret by paying attention to her actions, and it begins to inconvenience her friends and family. After much deliberation, Miley reveals to [[Jay Leno]]'s television audience that she is Hannah Montana. Afterwards, Miley and Lilly graduate high school, with arrangements to attend college. In the [[Wherever I Go (Hannah Montana)|series finale]], Miley and Lilly prepare to go to college, yet another movie offer comes up. Miley tries to make Lilly reject her, only to fail multiple times. She convinces Lilly to come with her to Paris (where the movie is shooting), however at the airport, Lilly decides not to go, but to return to college (this is due to Oliver convincing Lilly that Miley will get another movie role next year). Miley continues to Paris, only to come back, joining Lilly in [[Stanford]]. Jesse and Oliver guest star in that episode and a Montage of pictures play at the end of the episode.

==Cast and characters==
{{see also|List of Hannah Montana characters|List of Hannah Montana main characters}}
[[File:Miley Cyrus 38th People's Choice Awards (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Miley Cyrus (''pictured'') served as the series' central focus during its four-season run.]]
Throughout its run, the series was led by five (seasons 1 and 4) and six (seasons 2–3) primary characters. Its original main characters are [[Miley Stewart]] (portrayed by [[Miley Cyrus]]), [[List of Hannah Montana main characters#Lilly Truscott|Lilly Truscott]] ([[Emily Osment]]), [[List of Hannah Montana main characters#Oliver Oken|Oliver Oken]] ([[Mitchel Musso]]), [[List of Hannah Montana main characters#Jackson Stewart|Jackson Stewart]] ([[Jason Earles]]), and [[Robby Stewart]] ([[Billy Ray Cyrus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=[[Lilly, Do You Want to Know a Secret?]]|accessdate=September 8, 2013|series=Hannah Montana|network=[[Disney Channel]]|date=March 24, 2006|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second season, [[List of Hannah Montana main characters|Rico Suave]] ([[Moisés Arias]]), who originally appeared in a supporting capacity during the first season,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=It's My Party and I'll Lie if I Want To|accessdate=September 8, 2013|series=Hannah Montana|network=Disney Channel|date=April 21, 2006|season=1|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was integrated into the primary cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Me and Rico Down by the Schoolyard|accessdate=September 8, 2013|series=Hannah Montana|network=Disney Channel|date=April 23, 2007|season=2|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fourth and final season, Oken became a supporting character due to Musso's involvement on the television series ''[[Pair of Kings]]'', which aired on the [[sister station]] [[Disney XD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2010/07/mitchel-musso-to-appear-on-hannah-montana-forever/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719011124/http://www.bsckids.com/2010/07/mitchel-musso-to-appear-on-hannah-montana-forever/|title=Mitchel Musso To Appear On Hannah Montana Forever|author=Sarah Peel|publisher=BSC Kids|date=July 14, 2010|archivedate=July 19, 2010|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aforementioned character's storylines were largely developed by supporting cast members. Susan Stewart ([[Brooke Shields]]) is shown as Miley and Jackson's deceased mother in flashback scenes, while Aunt Dolly ([[Dolly Parton]]) is portrayed as Miley's godmother (Parton is Cyrus's real-life godmother). Jake Ryan ([[Cody Linley]]) was depicted as an actor for the popular television series ''Zombie High''. He briefly attended Seaview Middle School with Stewart, Truscott, and Oken, and engaged in an on-again/off-again relationship with Stewart in several points during ''Hannah Montana''. Roxy Roker ([[Frances Callier]]) was close friends with the Stewart family, and additionally served as their bodyguard during public appearances. Amber Addison ([[Shanica Knowles]]) and Ashley Dewitt ([[Anna Maria Perez de Tagle]]) are shown as stereotypical [[Queen bee (sociology)|school divas]], and are notably the rivals of Stewart and Truscott. Jesse ([[Drew Roy]]) is introduced as one of Miley's later love interests.

==Production==
[[Michael Poryes]], who is credited as co-creator, also co-created the hit [[List of Disney Channel series|Disney Channel Original Series]] ''[[That's So Raven]]''. The show is produced by [[It's a Laugh Productions, Inc.]] and Michael Poryes Productions, in association with Disney Channel Original Productions. It is filmed at [[Sunset Bronson Studios]] in Hollywood, California.

The original idea for this show was based on the ''[[That's So Raven]]'' episode "[[That's So Raven (season 3)#ep74|Goin' Hollywood]]", which served as the [[backdoor pilot]] for a sitcom tentatively called ''Better Days'' to star [[Alyson Stoner]], in which a child star of a popular TV show of the same name was to try her hand at going to a normal school. The episode "[[List of Hannah Montana episodes#ep14|New Kid in School]]" has the basic premise as that aforementioned episode.

As the show's concept was further developed, among those considered for the lead role of 'Chloe Stewart' were former ''[[American Juniors]]'' finalist [[Jordan McCoy]], future ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' actress [[Taylor Momsen]] and pop and R&amp;B singer [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]] (who rejected the role).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santamonicanews.info/article.asp/&amp;type=rq&amp;id=476.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930161522/http://www.santamonicanews.info/article.asp/%26type%3Drq%26id%3D476.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=JoJo Feature Story |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |work=Santa Monica Report |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miley Cyrus originally auditioned for the role of the "best friend"&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/hannahmontana-livin.html|title="Hannah Montana" Livin' the rock star life!

According to the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'', the TV series held a global audience of 200&amp;nbsp;million viewers in 2008. "If Miley’s viewers were a country, they would be the fifth largest population in the world – just ahead of Brazil."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=316998# |title=Teen queen is global brand by Stephen Armstrong 2009/05/21 (accessed June 24, 2009) |access-date=June 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528085301/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=316998# |archive-date=May 28, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2008, the Hannah Montana franchise had become so important that Disney convened an "80-person, all-platform international meeting to discuss Hannah Montana's future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/04/14/Disneys-Evolving-Business-Model|title=How Mickey Got His Groove Back|author=Karl Taro Greenfeld|work=[[Condé Nast Portfolio]]|date=April 14, 2008|accessdate=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608092713/http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/04/14/Disneys-Evolving-Business-Model|archivedate=June 8, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Disney business segments were represented at the meeting.

===Opening sequence===
The theme song for ''Hannah Montana'' is "[[The Best of Both Worlds (song)|The Best of Both Worlds]]" written by [[Matthew Gerrard]] and [[Robbie Nevil]], produced by Gerrard and performed by Miley Cyrus (as Hannah Montana). John Carta, who also composed the music cues to signify scene changes and commercial breaks for the first season, composed the music for the song. The song's lyrics describe the basic premise of the television series.

The full-length version of the song, which is 2 minutes, 54 seconds in length, was included on the show's soundtrack, released in October 2006. For the TV version of the theme, which lasts only 50 seconds, only the first two stanzas and the last two were used. "Just Like You" and "The Other Side of Me" were originally tested for the opening theme song, before "Best of Both Worlds" was chosen as the theme.

The opening sequence for the first two seasons features episode clips of each cast member when their name appears. Each cast member's name is "wiped" on the screen in a marquee-light-style. The sequence then switches to full-screen episode clips (most of the clips used in the Season One version of the sequence were of the early produced episodes) with the creator's names appearing in the second-to-last clip. The show's title logo design appears at the beginning and end of the sequence (the latter portion on the "concert stage" features Cyrus as her character Hannah Montana). The only change to the sequence for season two were the replacement of episode clips and the addition of the Disney logo above the show's title logo (this particular change was also implemented for later reruns of the first season).

For season three, a new version of the opening credits was used. It features Miley as herself and Hannah Montana in a [[Times Square]]-like setting. The names of the actors and actresses and clips from the show appear in a sort-of marquee board and it features Hannah Montana with her new wig and clothes style. The song playing is a remixed version of "The Best of Both Worlds", that was originally recorded for (and heard in) ''Hannah Montana: The Movie''. This marked the first time that a Disney Channel series has completely revamped its opening title sequence. The sequence was reformatted for high definition and slightly altered for season four, with the credit typing changed, the addition of the "Forever" wording in the main title logo, the removal of Mitchel Musso from the credit sequence and the inclusion of clips from season four episodes.

==Criticism==

===Cyrus's public image===

As Cyrus continued to develop an increasingly provocative image as ''Hannah Montana'' progressed, the series has received criticism for appearing to be a negative influence on its younger audience. In 2010 and 2011, she was recognized as the worst celebrity influence by JSYK, an [[AOL]]-owned service, presumably considering a series of sexually-inappropriate pictures and [[Internet leak|leaked]] footage of Cyrus smoking ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyfill.com/miley-cyrus-twotime-worst-influence-award-winner-82341|title=Miley Cyrus Two-Time Worst Influence Award Winner|publisher=Daily Fill|date=January 27, 2011|accessdate=September 5, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131124180333/http://dailyfill.com/miley-cyrus-twotime-worst-influence-award-winner-82341|archivedate=November 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Cyrus's friend [[Kelly Osbourne]] described that such reports "could not be farther from the truth", adding that "she has learned her lesson" after her ''Salvia divinorum'' incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kelly-osbourne-angrily-defends-pal-miley-cyrus-20102212|title=Kelly Osbourne Angrily Defends Pal Miley Cyrus|publisher=Us Weekly.

In 2012, Joe Paul Wilson from the [[Culture and Media Institute]] criticized her for "[becoming] the epitome of the anti-role model for young girls" after establishing a following through her "wholesome" persona as Hannah Montana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrc.org/articles/hollywood-promoting-women-behaving-badly|title=Hollywood Promoting Women Behaving Badly|author=Joe Paul Wilson|publisher=[[Culture and Media Institute]]|date=January 26, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232510/http://www.mrc.org/articles/hollywood-promoting-women-behaving-badly#|archive-date=December 2, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the ''[[New York Post]]'', Naomi Schaefer Riley noted that Cyrus "duped" the series' audience after assuming an increasingly provocative public image, posing as an "inherent danger" for younger children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2013/06/30/why-parents-are-terrified-of-miley/|title=Why parents are terrified of Miley|author=Naomi Schaefer Riley|newspaper=New York Post|publisher=News Corp|date=June 30, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918043442/http://nypost.com/2013/06/30/why-parents-are-terrified-of-miley/#|archive-date=September 18, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a controversial performance at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]], Melissa Henson of the [[Parents Television Council]] felt that parents would no longer feel comfortable allowing their children to watch ''Hannah Montana'' "knowing what Miley's current stage persona is", and further suggested that Disney would be forced to discontinue the franchise in light of the criticism.&lt;ref name="VMAs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/08/27/miley-cyrus-vmas-performance-hurt-disney-brand/|title=Did Miley Cyrus' VMAs performance hurt the Disney brand?|author=Hollie McKay|publisher=Fox News. 21st Century Fox|date=August 27, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904171004/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/08/27/miley-cyrus-vmas-performance-hurt-disney-brand/#|archive-date=September 4, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus herself had previously stated her displeasure in not being able to "erase that stuff [''Hannah Montana''] and start over", and acknowledged her attempts to "start as a new artist" with her fourth [[studio album]] and first record unaffiliated with Disney, ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/117838/I-Want-To-Erase-My-Past-Miley-Cyrus-Admits-Shes-Embarrassed-By-Hannah-Montana|title='I Want To Erase My Past': Miley Cyrus Admits She's 'Embarrassed' By Hannah Montana|author=Jason Chester|publisher=Entertainmentwise.

===Lawsuits===
[[Buddy Sheffield]] alleged that he pitched the concept for a television series titled ''Rock and Roland'' to the Disney Channel in 2001. The program would have focused on a junior high school student who led a secret double life as a rock star, though the network passed on the proposal. However, after ''Hannah Montana'' became a successful franchise, Sheffield filed a lawsuit against the Disney Channel in August 2007, commenting that he was owed "millions of dollars" in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=fbb0caac-e257-4f07-9fa7-0ca5ee357387|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827004849/http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=fbb0caac-e257-4f07-9fa7-0ca5ee357387|title=A Roundhouse Blow to Hannah Montana|author=Joel Ryan|publisher=E!

In April 2010, series co-creators [[Rich Correll]] and [[Barry O'Brien]] filed a lawsuit against the Disney Channel for $5 million over profits from the program. They claimed that they were denied their share of profits and pre-negotiated percentage-based bonuses based on their backend deals and [[Writers Guild of America, West]] requirements for writers who receive "created by" credits. Correll, who also directed a number of episodes, further alleged that he was unfairly terminated and blackballed by Disney after testifying in connection with a WGA arbitration. A third producer, [[Michael Poryes]], has previously filed a similar lawsuit in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thresq.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/04/hannah-montana-creators-sue-disney-for-profits.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413203604/http://thresq.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/04/hannah-montana-creators-sue-disney-for-profits.html|title='Hannah Montana' Creators Sue Disney For Profits|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=April 9, 2010|archivedate=April 13, 2010|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Hōsei Tsukitei'''|月亭 方正|Tsukitei Hōsei}}, formerly known as {{nihongo|'''Hōsei Yamasaki'''|山崎 邦正|Yamasaki Hōsei| born February 15, 1968}} is a Japanese solo comedian and ''[[rakugo]]'' performer, signed with [[Yoshimoto Kogyo]]. He is best known for being one of the five members (and the only solo comedian) of [[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Downtown Gaki no Tsukai]]'s regular cast. His role on the show is usually divided up between the ''suberi-kyara'' and the ''ijime-kyara''.

Outside of ''Gaki no Tsukai'', he has released three books, a CD single of his signature "Yamazaki Ichi-ban!" song, and has appeared in several Yoshimoto Kogyo compilations and DVD releases.

==Early life==
Hōsei was born in [[Nishinomiya, Hyōgo]] where from the age of five he took an interest in [[Kendo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Geinō-kai Tokugi-ō Kettei-sen TEPPEN |script-title=ja:芸能界特技王決定戦TEPPEN |trans-title=Showbiz Skills Playoffs TEPPEN |network=[[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] |date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; later joining a high school Kendo club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Gaki no Tsukai Zettai ni Waratte wa Ike Nai Kōkō |script-title=ja:ガキの使い絶対に笑ってはいけない高校 |trans-title=Gaki no Tsukai No-Laughing High School (2005) |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=4 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Nishinomiya South High School &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hyogo-c.ed.jp/~nishiminami-hs/gakkoutyou/g_aisatu.html |script-title=ja:ようこそ西宮南高等学校のホームページへ |access-date=29 June 2015 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Nishinomiya South High School Welcome Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; where being humorous was a desirable trait, popular among fellow students they coined the term {{nihongo|''kawaikkoii''|かわいっこいい|"cute / cool"}} for him.&lt;ref name="RefZero"&gt;{{cite episode |title=FROM ZERO |series=NEWS ZERO |network=[[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation|YTV]] |date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===New Star Creation (1987–1988)===

After graduating from high school, Hōsei joined [[Yoshimoto Kogyo]]'s 6th NSC (New Star Creation) [[Osaka]]-based school group in April 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lemontree.gozaru.jp/school/nsc_o1.html |script-title=ja:NSC大阪1期～10期生卒業生リスト |access-date=29 June 2015 |language=Japanese |trans-title=NSC Osaka Phase 1 to 10 Graduates List}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he teamed up with Hiromitsu Noriyasu &lt;ref name="RefNoriyasu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegoyuyu.com/index.php/features/features-news/interviews-en/618-yuyu-interview-hiromitsu-noriyasu |title=YuYu interview Hiromitsu Noriyasu |date=30 April 2007 |website=San Diego YuYu |access-date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form the ''[[owarai]]'' duo GSX (ガスペケ) who performed at the Yoshimoto-run {{nihongo|'''Shinsaibashi Ni-chōme'''|心斎橋筋2丁目}} theater alongside many other recruits and graduates, such as [[Downtown (Owarai)|Downtown]], [[Itsuji Itao]], Koji Higashino and Imada Koji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astand.asahi.com/entertainment/starfile/OSK201302190065.html |script-title=ja:アンチ吉本・お笑いレボリューション  |date=19 February 2013 |access-date=29 June 2015 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Anti-Yoshimoto, Comedy Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team Zero (1989–1993)===

In 1989, Hōsei and Hiromitsu Noriyasu made the move to [[Tokyo]] and renamed themselves as {{nihongo|'''Team Zero'''|チーム0}}, appearing on the nationwide '''DAY BREAK''' show.

Around the same time, [[Downtown (Owarai)|Downtown]] also moved on to [[Tokyo]] and Team Zero were frequent guests or regulars of their shows including '''[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]]''', '''Downtown Nari''' and '''Downtown Juice'''. In addition to appearing in [[Yoshimoto Kogyo]] sponsored shows such as '''Yoshimoto Village''', they also starred in the '''Funky Monkey Teacher''' series alongside [[Jimmy Onishi]].

Their efforts won them the ''Best Newcomer Award'' at [[Asahi Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s '''12th Rookie Comedian Grand Prix''' on January 15, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geinin.jp/prize/category/abcowaraishinjin.html |title=受賞データ ABCお笑い新人グランプリ  |access-date=30 June 2015 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Winners of ABC's Rookie Comedian Grand Prix}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hōsei's comedy partner Hiromitsu Noriyasu found a passion for film directing&lt;ref name="RefNoriyasu" /&gt; and by the end of September 1993, Team Zero decided to part ways towards their own solo careers.

===Solo debut (1994–1997)===

In addition to his regular appearances on [[Downtown (Owarai)|Downtown]]'s shows such as '''[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]]''' and '''Downtown Kazaana''', in 1994 Hōsei also became a regular on '''Tenshi no U・B・U・G''', a late night show hosted by Imada Koji and Koji Higashino. Initially he received much attention for his young appearance, however as his role in comedy gradually cemented towards being the ''{{Nihongo|hetare|へたれ|hopeless}} [[#Suberi-kyara|suberi-kyara]]'', his public image quickly changed. Work began to dry up and Hōsei considered quitting comedy until he was amused by an episode of '''Mutsugoro &amp; Fun Friends''', where a little [[Pug]] dog barked loudly and hopelessly confronted a large [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mutsugoro &amp; Fun Friends |script-title=ja:ムツゴロウとゆかいな仲間たち |network=[[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] |date=9 January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the underdog as inspiration he tried raising his voice and taking on comically hopeless confrontations, as seen in his ''[[#Ijime-kyara|ijime-kyara]]'' role, which brought in more work offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Kusano Kid |script-title=ja:草野☆キッド |network=[[Asahi Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |date=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/apipo/archives/51671803.html |script-title=ja:パグ師匠  |date=10 June 2009 |access-date=30 June 2015 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Pug Teacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hon'ne no dendō! ! Shinsuke ni wa Wakaru mai |script-title=ja:ホンネの殿堂!!紳助にはわかるまいっ |network=[[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] |date=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hōsei appeared in a number of direct-to-video releases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=No-Laughing Enthusiastic Teachers |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including starring roles in the live-action [[manga]] adaptations of [[Chameleon (manga)|'''Chameleon''']] and '''Pappakapā'''. In addition he took on roles within sitcoms, including a semi-regular part as a visiting fishmonger in '''Pokkapoka''', and a regular part in [[Ken Shimura]]'s sitcom '''Heisei Shimura Family''' where, although he was 28 ~ 30 at the time, he played the role of the 20 ~ 22-year-old son. With '''Denpa Shōnen International''' he made a number of trips abroad to take on dangerous challenges such as meeting [[the Mafia]] in [[Italy]], participating in the [[Running of the Bulls]] in [[Spain]] and searching for the [[Chupacabra]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/denpa/dvd/index.html |title=DVD情報電波少年的電波少年 |access-date=30 June 2015 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Denpa Shōnen DVD Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's television (1998–2000)===

Hōsei became a children's television presenter on the long-running '''Tensai Terebi-kun''' series, which also included performing in a number of stage plays.&lt;ref name="RefFromHere"&gt;{{cite episode |title=From Here Interview - Rakugoka Tsukitei Hosei |script-title=ja:インタビューここから落語家月亭方正 |network=[[NHK]] |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On set he mentored child actor '''[[Eiji Wentz]]''' who formally became his apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ]] |network=[[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] |date=21 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment work (2000–present)===

As a solo comedian, Hōsei flits between various regular and irregular appearances on variety shows. From 2000 he co-hosted an [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] internet radio talk show called {{Nihongo|''K'zStation Ore-tachi Yattemasu''|K'zStationオレたちやってま〜す}}, mentioning it as one of his only regular sources of work on [[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]]'s No Laughing series in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=No-Laughing Police Station |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began appearing yearly on the '''Drive A Go! Go!''' travel program, today his travels mainly focus on [[onsens]] around Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/drive/backnumber/ |title=Drive Go! Past Episodes List  |access-date=30 June 2015 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2003–2005 he frequently appeared on '''Ametalk''', establishing a weekly segment where [[Ameagari Kesshitai]] would intrude upon him whilst strangely dressed, leading to a comical confrontation with [[Hiroyuki Miyasako]] that would inevitably lead to Hōsei's defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/ametalk/dvd_new/archives/index.html |title=アメトーークDVD&amp;ブルーレイラインナップ  |access-date=30 June 2015 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Ametalk DVD &amp; Blu-ray List}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 onward he appeared more infrequently as a talk show guest.

He often performs in [[Yoshimoto Kogyo]] stage shows, particularly at the '''Lumine the Yoshimoto''' theater where he became known for the catchphrases {{Nihongo|''Ma~''|マー}} and {{Nihongo|''Yatta Ja~n''|やったじゃ～ん}}.&lt;ref name="RefExcite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.excite.co.jp/News/reviewbook/20130304/E1362324600397.html |title=Why I Became a Rakugo Book Review |date=4 March 2013 |website=Excite |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every so often he takes on drama or film roles such as in '''Tears of Kitty''' or the more recent '''Mentai Piriri 2'''.

After graduating as a [[#Rakugo|rakugo]] he moved to [[Osaka]] but continues to work as a solo comedian within the entertainment industry, typically on [[Kansai region]] shows such as '''Osaka Honwaka TV''' and '''Marco Polori''', whilst maintaining his regular role on '''[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]]''' in the [[Kantō region]]. He is a frequent guest on variety talk shows such as '''Uramayo''' and '''Kaitetsu! Emi Channel'''. Alongside comedian friend '''Jinnai Tomonori''' and his mentor '''Tsukitei Happo''' he regularly hosts the '''Yoshimoto Golden Biographies''' series, interviewing various [[Yoshimoto Kogyo]] comedians about their lives.

===Rakugo (2008–present)===

In 2008 Hōsei turned 40 and with the sense that he was going through the motions coupled with the public's dwindling reception he was feeling at a loss.&lt;ref name="RefZero" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RefFromHere" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RefExcite" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Gion Laugh |script-title=ja:祇園笑者 |network=[[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation|YTV]] |date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeking advice from '''Koji Higashino''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:月亭方正落語家転身は東野幸治さんの助言がきっかけ |url=http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20140126-00000002-wordleaf-ent |trans-title=How Tsukitei Hōsei Turned Rakugo after Koji Higashino's Advice |date=26 January 2014 |website=Yahoo! Japan |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hōsei began to listen to performer [[Shijaku Katsura II]], which sparked a passion for [[rakugo]]. He began practicising alone for around six months before approaching rakugo performer '''Tsukitei Hachimitsu''' who introduced him to his father, rakugo master '''Tsukitei Happo'''. Happo gave him the chance to perform the comical story {{Nihongo|'''Amida Pond'''|阿弥陀池}} for an audience on 11 May 2008 then invited him to a [[nomikai]] where Hōsei requested an apprenticeship. Happo accepted and thereafter mentored Hōsei for 5 years before submitting an application for him to officially join rakugo society.&lt;ref name="RefRakugoMyNavi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.mynavi.jp/articles/2010/07/09/housei/001.html |script-title=ja:山崎邦正、落語家人生を語る |trans-title=Yamazaki Hōsei's Tale of Rakugo Life |date=9 July 2010 |website=Mynavi News |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at first there was some reluctance from the governing board as a large part of his prior experience was unrelated to rakugo.&lt;ref name="RefFromHere" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Yoshimoto Golden Biographies Special |script-title=ja:よしもと黄金列伝!SP |network=[[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation|YTV]] |date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsukitei Happo appealed the decision and he was permitted to graduate, whereupon he adopted the title Tsukitei Hōsei from 2013 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyohive.com/article/2012/12/comedian-yamasaki-hosei-to-change-his-name-starting-in-2013 |title=Yamasaki Hōsei To Change His Name |date=18 December 2012 |website=TokyoHive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later published a book titled "Why I Became a Rakugo".&lt;ref name="RakugoBook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hōsei  |first=Tsukitei |date=January 2013 |script-title=ja:僕が落語家になった理由 |trans-title=Why I Became a Rakugo |language=Japanese |isbn=978-4-7572-2159-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to pursue rakugo further, Hōsei moved to [[Osaka]] with his family,&lt;ref name="RefRakugoLivedoor" /&gt; where the Tsukitei group is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hassyoutei.com/access/ |title=Access to Pavilion |access-date=30 June 2015 |website=Hassyoutei}}&lt;/ref&gt; He now regularly performs at rakugo theaters and festivals around Japan, including charity events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.mynavi.jp/articles/2010/07/09/housei/001.html |title=Tsukitei Hōsei at Genkidama Japan |date=16 October 2013 |website=Yahoo Japan Blog |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his first major solo rakugo performance, he received congratulatory flowers from '''Natsumi Ogawa''' ([[Masatoshi Hamada]]'s wife), which he later handed out to attendees as thanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/tukiteihousei/status/393650546684329984 |script-title=ja:菜摘さんからお花 |date=25 October 2013 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Flower's from Natsumi |website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; As rakugo stories are traditionally learnt by listening, Hōsei uses a [[portable media player]] with around 2,500 rakugo performances to help with memorization.&lt;ref name="RefZero" /&gt;

==Skills==

===Music===

Hōsei has a keen interest in various aspects of music and plays the piano as a hobby. In 1996, he obliged a viewer who wrote into the ''Downtown Kazaana'' show requesting him to perform a piano piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Downtown Kazaana |title=Episode #38 |network=[[Asahi Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |date=3 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1999, [[Downtown (Owarai)|Downtown]] would challenge him to perform a piano concert late at night while being terrorized by jump scares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=#491 山崎邦正 深夜の廃校でひとりぼっちのピアノコンサートの刑!! |trans-title=#491 Yamazaki Hōsei's Solo Late-night School Piano Concert Punishment!! |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=5 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Hōsei successfully completed a challenge to perform ''[[Étude Op. 10, No. 3 (Chopin)|Étude Op. 10, No. 3 by Chopin]]'' on a miniature toy piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Showbiz Arts Awards (ザ芸能界ウラ芸大賞) |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Composing is another hobby of his, an aspect heavily utilized within the '''Yamasaki Produce''' segments of [[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]], where he creates both the music and lyrics for various songs which the rest of the cast must perform. Outside of this series, he also composed tracks for the debut single of ''AiAi'' in 2002.

He greatly enjoys singing [[karaoke]] and has participated in a number of televised contests, most notably winning first place in the ''15th Comedian Karaoke King'' competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Comedian Karaoke King (歌うま王座) |network=[[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] |date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On other programs he has also parodied many music artists such as [[Gackt]], [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]] and [[V6 (band)|V6]].&lt;ref name="RefMonomane"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ze.em-net.ne.jp/~hdk/monomane/ |script-title=ja:ものまね王座決定戦データベース |trans-title=Monomane Playoffs Database |access-date=30 June 2015 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Hōsei has taken dance classes with an instructor and once showed footage of him practicing to [[Lady Gaga]] music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Meringue no Kimochi |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impersonations===

Hōsei acts as an [[impersonator]] and has participated in many contests on this theme, such as '''Monomane Battle''' and '''[[Monomane Grand Prix]]''', where he mimicked other comedians such as [[Ayako Imoto]] or parodied characters on shows like [[Death Note]].&lt;ref name="RefMonomane" /&gt; During impersonation segments of the [[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]] No Laughing series he'll sometimes be called upon multiple times to incite laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=No Laughing in Yugawara |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently Hōsei impersonates women such as the many popstars of the [[Shōwa period]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=#1068 Yamasaki's Shōwa Era Popular Song Hit Parade |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or acts in the role of fictional female characters such as the bride at a wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=#1248 Goodbye Tsukitei Hōsei |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he won 6th place in a "Who is the most beautiful transvestite in showbiz" contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/otameshi/contents/bn/0017/ |title=Otameshi #17 Summary |access-date=30 June 2015 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Masatoshi Hamada]] was chosen to cross-dress in the [[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]] No Laughing series, he commented that, "Yamazaki should do this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=No-Laughing Airport |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===

At one time Hōsei studied English for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Nep League |script-title=ja:ネプリーグ |network=[[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] |date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Imada Koji mentioned that he, [[Ameagari Kesshitai]] and a junior visited Hōsei's home for English conversation practise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fujitv.co.jp/LOVELOVE/talk/136.html |title=#136 LOVE LOVE あいしてる |date=14 August 1999 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also chosen to sing the occasional song in English, such as ''[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes#The Platters version|Smoke Gets in Your Eyes by The Platters]]'' which got a passing score in a karaoke contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sp.natalie.mu/owarai/news/24800 |script-title=ja:"歌がうまい王座"全16回の歴代王者が参戦する究極王座開催 |trans-title=Song King Competing Champions |date=6 December 2009 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the full extent of his present-day English proficiency is unknown.

===Miscellaneous===
After feeling a sense of anxiety from the highs and lows of the entertainment industry, Hōsei sought to expand his skill base and gain further qualifications to fall back on. As well as English and piano, he dabbled in various subjects such as computers and game creation to varying degrees of proficiency before settling into his [[rakugo]] studies.&lt;ref name="RakugoBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RefRakugoLivedoor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/7505587/ |script-title=ja:山崎邦正が落語家に転身した狙い |trans-title=Yamazaki Hōsei Turns to Rakugo |date=16 March 2013 |website=livedoor NEWS |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 32 he enrolled on an 8-year [[Psychology]] course at [[Rissho University]] but lost enthusiasm halfway through and dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Ametalk |script-title=ja:アメトーーク |network=[[TV Asahi]] |date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suberi-kyara==
''Suberu'' literally means “to slip”, but in owarai lingo, ''subetta'' refers to a joke or gag that fails to grab any laughs or reaction. (''Kyara'', short for ''kyarakuta'' or character.)&lt;br&gt;
Yamasaki's persona on the show (and in the owarai community in general) is of the unfunny underdog who tries very hard to be funny, but fails. His failure is always accentuated by a snide remark from one of the other members of the show. Though his jokes may be amusing, members will intentionally stifle their laughter to satisfy the running gag.

==Ijime-kyara==
''Ijimeru'' means to bully or pick on someone. Of all the members of ''Gaki no Tsukai'', Yamasaki takes the most physical abuse. The entire series, '''Yamasaki Vs. Moriman''', is based around a series of bizarre wrestling matches in which Yamasaki always loses to the larger and powerful Holstein Morio from the comedy duo, Moriman. The content of the matches changes with each battle, but past matches have found the two tossing hot cooking oil at one another, trying to force each other into a tub of blue [[kakigori]] syrup, and whacking one another with thick [[burdock]] roots.

Every year since 2007 during the ''No Laughing'' New Years Specials, Yamasaki inevitably comes face to face with an irate [[Masahiro Chono]]; a pro-wrestler, and is slapped.

==Personal life==

===Family===

Hōsei's tearful marriage was broadcast on [[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=#583 山ちゃんのハッピー結婚式大上映会!! |trans-title=#583 Yamazaki's Happy Wedding Premier!! |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=4 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aya Yamazaki would later feature in an episode highlighting her quirky answers to various questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=#874 クイズ山崎あやの500のコトト |trans-title=#874 Aya Yamazaki 500 Questions |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two daughters named Rara-chan and Momo-chan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]] |title=No-Laughing Earth Defense Force |network=[[Nippon TV|NTV]] |date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, 2012 his son Tenma-kun was born, Hōsei has noted how his birthday matches [[Hitoshi Matsumoto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Downtown DX |network=[[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation|YTV]] |date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hobbies===

Hōsei enjoys [[mahjong]] and invited [[Hitoshi Matsumoto]] to play with him as part of his 20th anniversary special. As an avid reader he became addicted to the work of [[Keigo Higashino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Kaiketsu! Emi Channel |network=[[Kansai Telecasting Corporation|KTV]] |date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time he engaged in table tennis matches with junior entertainers at a local community center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/yarisugi/backnumber/071027/ |title=Yarisugi #127 Summary |date=27 October 2007 |website=TV Tokyo |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes jet-skiing as a hobby &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shogo2015.tumblr.com/ |title=Tsukitei Hōsei's Column for Shōgo Hamada |access-date=30 June 2015 |website=Tumblr |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enjoys watching American series such as [[Desperate Housewives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/tukiteihousei/status/587821720666406913 |script-title=ja:お薦めのアメリカドラマ教えて |date=13 April 2015 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Recommend me some American drama |website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hōsei travels around Japan performing [[rakugo]], he keeps a {{Nihongo|Japanese temple stamp book|go shuin chou}} to commemorate his visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |script-title=ja:ほっとするわ |network=[[Kansai Telecasting Corporation|KTV]] |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joyce Beetuan Koh''' (born June 9, 1968) is a Singaporean [[composer]], [[sound artist]], and [[educator]]. 

== Career ==
Koh studied composition at [[King's College London]] under the tutorship of [[David Lumsdaine]], and at [[University of York]] with [[Nicola Lefanu]], receiving a PhD in Composition in 1997. She received the [[Nadia Boulanger]] scholarship and studied in Paris with [[Brian Ferneyhough]] at Royaumont in 1995, [[Tristan Murail]] in 1996, and at [[IRCAM]] Cursus in Music Computing 1997-98 with [[Hans Tutschku]] and [[Mikhail Malt]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jbtkoh.net | title=Joyce Beetuan Koh | work=Biography |  publisher= jbtkoh.net | accessdate=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Koh was a composer-in-residence at the [[Herrenhaus Edenkoben]] in 2004. In 2007, Koh become a founding faculty member of the music department of [[School of the arts, Singapore]], and then became Vice-Dean ([[interdisciplinary studies]]) at the [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] in 2010. Koh is a founding member of the Composers' Society of Singapore and served as its President 2013-16. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://composers.sg/profile/joyce-koh-bee-tuan/ | title=Joyce Koh Bee Tuan | work= Member webpage |  publisher= Composer Society of Singapore | accessdate=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honours ===
* Koh received the [[Young Artist Award]] from the [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]], Singapore, in the category for music, for her orchestra works TAI, commissioned by [[Singapore Symphony Orchestra]]. &lt;ref name=NAC Young Artist Award&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nac.gov.sg/singaporeartsscene/youngArtistAward/overview.html | title = Laureates of the Artist Awards | publisher = National Arts Council, Singapore | accessdate=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative work ==
=== Collaborations ===
Koh’s music has been performed by [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], Hungarian Radio [[Budapest Symphony Orchestra]], [[Stavanger Symphony Orchestra]], [[Singapore Symphony Orchestra]], Résonance Contemporaine, The Song Company of Australia, [[Nieuw Ensemble]], Take 5, and Reconsil, as well as by soloists including [Prodromos Symeonidis]], [[Frode Haltli]], and [[Thalia Myers]]. Her  compositions for dance include a series of works with The Arts Fission Company, for example ‘In the Name of Red’ (2015), a site-specific work for the inauguration festival of the [[National Gallery Singapore]]). Leaning on her concept of multimedia performance as a "theatre of music", Koh created Away We Go (2015) together with [[Étienne Turpin]], commissioned by [[NTU Centre of Contemporary Art]]), and On the String (2010), commissioned by [[Singapore Arts Festival]]). She co-created the interactive sound installation The Canopy (2010-13), presented at [[World Stage Design Festival]] (UK 2013) and [[International Computer Music Conference]] (UK 2011). Koh collaborated with theatre director [[Steve Dixon (actor)|Steve Dixon]] on adapting [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' in a one-actor piece with video and electroacoustic sound. &lt;ref&gt;Koh JBT &amp; Dixon S (2014), {{cite web | url=http://econtact.ca/16_2/koh-dixon_wasteland.html/ | title= The Music of T.S. Eliot’s Poetry: Integrating text, live performance, sound design and video in a multimedia theatre production of 'The Waste Land' | accessdate=2017-06-09}}, Canadian Electroacoustic Community (CEC), eContact 16.2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compositional style ===
Koh learned the piano from an early age. Her fascination for resonating strings in particular and sonic timbre in general led to taking up music professionally, coming to think of composition as a form of ‘calligraphy on a sonic canvas’. Through computer-assisted composition and audio processing, she could imagine sounds beyond those produced by acoustic instruments, and sonic space. She developed a concept of "theatre of music", where the sonic canvas became physical, i.e., the stage. That is, "whilst the narrative structure of the composition may be based on theatrical devices, the sound objects (effectively the play’s characters) are driven by musical identities and relationships". &lt;ref&gt;Loh J &amp; Haykal B (editors), (2014). Latitudes and Attitudes, Exhibition Catalogue, ICA LaSalle, {{ISBN|978-981-07-9067-7}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Haykal B (2014), {{cite web | url=http://econtact.ca/16_2/haykal_koh.html | title= Letting Time and Sound Pass: Interview with Singaporean composer Joyce Beetuan Koh | accessdate=2017-06-09}}, Canadian Electroacoustic Community (CEC), eContact 16.2&lt;/ref&gt; Koh’s work often starts with an external structure from architecture, calligraphy, or science. The 2010 multimedia performance ‘On the String’ is a consolidation of this approach. Asking herself: “What if we could hear the sounds of vibrating one-dimensional strings? Or the sonic texture created by various vibration patterns of a string curving space? If these imaginings were audible, what would they sound like?” Composition becomes a "systematic musicalisation of certain features of the scientific thought and, through interdisciplinary investigations (music, visual arts, interactive design, instrument design, light), culminates in a multimedia performance". &lt;ref name = "Koh &amp; Lindborg 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://permagnus.org/pm/research/projects/OTS/index.html | author = Koh, Joyce &amp; Lindborg, PerMagnus | title=On the String (web documentation of the creative process) | publisher=permagnus.org | accessdate=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

A group of modern dance was founded in 1980 by [[Birutė Letukaitė]] and several other young dancers. In 1982 they gave their first performance.  Under the leadership of B. Letukaite who remains Aura’s managing and artistic director this small group of dancers has grown into and has become the best known and most decorated modern/contemporary dance company in Lithuania.  In 1995 the City of Kaunas awarded Kaunas Dance theatre Aura the status of a municipal theatre that so far no other dance troupe in the country managed to achieve yet.

Since 1989 Kaunas Dance theatre Aura is the organizer of the International Modern Dance Festival.  Though the International Modern Dance Festival is first of all an integral part of cultural life and a meaningful tradition in Kaunas, the Festival is being brought to other Lithuanian towns too.  The unique feature of the Festival is the night performances shown at alternative spaces in Kaunas.

'''''Knights of Honor''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) game developed by [[Bulgaria]]n [[Black Sea Studios]]. It was published  by [[Sunflowers Interactive]] in Europe in 2004 and [[Paradox Entertainment]] in North America in 2005. The game takes place in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]], spanning the early centuries of the second millennium in three historical time periods. The player can choose to play as one of over 100 playable kingdoms.

==Gameplay==
''Knights of Honor'' is played on a large map of Europe spanning from Ireland to [[Armenia]] and from Scandinavia to the northern coast of Africa. The map is divided into parcels of land called provinces. Each province is governed by a city and contains several "Rural Areas" which can be towns, farms, monasteries and coast towns. These rural areas can't be altered and are placed randomly across the map before each game. The city, however has room for several buildings which can give bonuses to the rural areas or the city itself, such as more piety in the monasteries when a church is built or a higher income from the towns when a market is present in the city. Other buildings are needed to recruit certain units (such as a swordsmith for sword-wielding units or a fletcher for bow-wielding units) or to defend the city such as walls and towers. A city only has limited room for buildings. Thus, not all buildings can be built in a city and the player must carefully consider what to build for a particular city. Compared to other strategy games, building structures in ''KOH'' takes a rather long time. The main goal of the game is to become emperor of Europe. However, the player is free to do whatever they wish. There is no set time limit.

===Resources===
There are three kinds of resources which can be spent on a variety of upgrades. Money is needed to recruits units, build buildings, etc. It is earned by taxes, trading and kingdom power. Piety is used for increasing your kingdom power and converting provinces to your religion. Books are used to educate your knights and adopting provinces. Towns themselves also generate hammers (used to construct certain buildings) and food which determines how long they can withstand sieges.

===Religion===
Religion plays an important role in Knights of Honor. There are 4 different types of religion: The Catholic Church, The Orthodox Church, Islam, and Paganism. The catholic Pope has much influence in medieval Europe. He can excommunicate catholic kingdoms and call for crusades against non-catholic kingdoms. When a player chooses to go on a crusade they are granted powerful Crusader units. When the Pope dies, his successor is chosen among several clerics throughout Europe. If the player happens to have a very experienced cleric, there is a chance he will be chosen as Pope. From then on, the player controls the Pope and can choose to excommunicate kingdoms and call for crusades, a successful crusade can result in a puppet state that is unquestionably loyal to the leader of the crusade or plunder the town for a huge sum of gold. The Catholic Church is located in Western Europe and the Mediterranean.  Orthodox factions are located in south east Europe and answer to Byzantium. These factions can declare independence and form their own churches which grants them a greater sum of gold while lacking the disadvantage of being excommunicated which results in a gold penalty. Islamic empires have the ability to call a Jihad which is similar to a Crusade and will cause armies to spawn at their borders and attack any invaders or rebels. This is a powerful ability but it has a long cool down period . Islam is found in north Africa and the middle east. Paganism is the smallest religion being found only in Scandinavia and some parts of eastern Europe. Pagans do not collect piety (a religious resource used to build certain units and buildings and perform some diplomatic options) so are free to focus on gold and are not troubled by religious problems such as religious tension but they have a penalty on their income and have bad relations with all other religions. Paganism is the only religion the player or other kingdoms cannot convert to, the only way to play as a pagan nation is to start the game as one. The player can renounce his faith and adopt another official religion (except paganism) but such religious conflict will often split the kingdom up and one must reunify the nations as a result.

===Trade and exotic goods===
Provinces can have up to three attributes called "''province features''" which allow the construction of certain buildings. For instance if a province contains fertile soil, an [[apiary]] can be built in that province. These buildings give access to "''trade goods''" which have a number of positive effects on the kingdom. For example, horses allows mounted units, wine makes a population happier and silver brings in extra money. Controlling such provinces is the key to success in ''Knights of Honor''.
Besides trade goods, which can be obtained in provinces where the right province features are present or by importing them from other kingdoms, there is another type of goods called "''exotic goods''". These goods can't be produced within a province but have to be imported by means of an [[admiralty]], the upgraded version of a [[harbour]]. Examples are [[ivory]], [[Gemstone|gems]] and [[spice]]s.
Exotic goods, together with trade goods, are needed to activate so called "''kingdom advantages''". There are ten different kingdom advantages each requiring a different set of trade and exotic goods and each giving a different advantage. For instance, the kingdom advantage "''Secret Order''", which gives a bonus to spies, requires the following trade goods: [[column]]s, statues, silver and [[dye]]s and the following exotic goods: [[ebony]] and [[ivory]].

Controlling many provinces certainly gives an advantage over other kingdoms not only because of more income but also because of the goods and eventually the kingdom advantages. However, larger kingdoms are harder to maintain and defend.

==Modding==

A large community of modders created a lot of content for the game, though nowadays almost all has been lost in the closure of Sunflowers/Black Sea Studios Website. But some mods have been restored and have been recently developed thanks to the nostalgia of some players. One of them has created a mod which allow to play on new monitor resolution such as Full HD - 1920x1080 and 1366x768p. It adds many new content and tweaks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=en |title= Ultimate Edition - HD Patch &amp; Overhaul (EN/FR/DE) mod for Knights of Honor |url= http://www.moddb.com/mods/knights-of-honor-ultimate-mod |website=Mod DB |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2011, Stephen Ferg restructured the entire page into sortable columns, after considerable discussion on the Talk page.
--&gt;
This is a '''list of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction''' works as portrayed in literature, film, television, and, comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brians|first=Paul|title=Nuclear holocausts : atomic war in fiction, 1895-1984|year=1987|publisher=Kent State University Press|location=Kent, Ohio|isbn=978-0-87338-335-6 |chapter=Nuclear Holocausts Bibliography}} ([http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/nuclear/a.htm Also online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227012854/http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/nuclear/a.htm |date=2011-12-27 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker|first=M. Keith|last2=Thoma |first2=Anne-Marie|title=The science fiction handbook|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell Pub.|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=978-1-4051-6205-0|pages=53&amp;ndash;64}} Includes a list of notable works.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Apocalyptic fiction]] is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]] that is concerned with the [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|end of civilization]] due to a potentially [[existential risk|existential catastrophe]] such as [[nuclear warfare]], [[pandemic]], [[alien invasion|extraterrestrial attack]], [[impact event]], [[cybernetic revolt]], [[technological singularity]], [[dysgenics]], [[supernatural phenomena]], [[Eschatology|divine judgment]], [[climate change]], [[resource depletion]] or some other [[disaster|general disaster]]. [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Post-apocalyptic fiction]] is set in a world or civilization after such a disaster. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized).
 
''[[Apocalypse]]'' is a Greek word referring to the end of the world. [[Apocalypticism]] is the religious belief that there will be an apocalypse, a term which originally referred to a revelation of God's will, but now usually refers to belief that the world will come to an end very soon, even within one's own lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Apocalypticism |title=Dictionary-Apocalypticism |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalyptic fiction does not portray catastrophes, or disasters, or near-disasters that do not result in apocalypse.  A ''threat'' of an apocalypse does not make a piece of fiction apocalyptic. For example, ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' are considered [[disaster film]]s and not apocalyptic fiction because, although earth and/or human-kind are terribly threatened, in the end they manage to avoid destruction. Apocalyptic fiction is not the same as fiction that provides visions of a [[dystopian]] future.  George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', for example, is [[dystopian fiction]], not apocalyptic fiction.

"'''LoveGame'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] from her debut studio album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008). Produced by [[RedOne]], the track was released as the album's third single in North America and Europe and the fourth single in Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden after "[[Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)]]". "LoveGame" was also released as the fourth single in the United Kingdom, after "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]".

Critics appreciated the song's rhythm and the "I wanna take a ride on your disco stick" [[Hook (music)|hook]]. Gaga had explained that the term "disco stick" is a euphemism for a [[penis]] and was inspired by her sexual attraction to a stranger at a night club. Musically carrying the vibe of underground New York discos, "LoveGame" talks about love, fame, and sexuality which was the central theme of the album. The song received a number of remixes, one of them featuring rocker [[Marilyn Manson]]. "LoveGame" was a commercial success, charting within the top ten in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France, Germany, and other European countries. It became Gaga's third consecutive number-one song on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart and achieved triple platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].

The New York underground-inspired music video for the song was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], and portrayed Gaga dancing at an underground subway station and in a parking lot. The music video was a tribute from the singer to the New York lifestyle including its glamour, fans and fashion. It was influenced by the music video for [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]", which also took place in a subway station, and features Gaga wearing [[Nazi chic]] fashion. The music video was banned from broadcast at the PG-rated time slots in Australian television channels because of its sexual content. "LoveGame" has been performed live a number of times by Gaga, including [[The Fame Ball Tour|The Fame Ball]] and [[The Monster Ball Tour|The Monster Ball]] tours, where she performed it while holding her characteristic disco stick in one hand.

==Background and release==
[[File:Marilyn Manson Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|A remix of "LoveGame" features vocals by [[Marilyn Manson]].]]
Towards the end of 2007, Lady Gaga's management company introduced her to songwriter and producer [[RedOne]], whom they also managed.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_RedOne_Interview.html |title=Interview With RedOne |date=March 23, 2009 |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |accessdate=December 19, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113171226/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_RedOne_Interview.html |archivedate=January 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Gaga relocated to Los Angeles in order to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'', and set up her own creative team called the [[Haus of Gaga]]. "LoveGame" was one of the songs written by Gaga and RedOne who also produced the track.&lt;ref name="ehqueenofpop"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Emily|year=2010|title=[[Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop]]|publisher=[[John Blake Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-84454-963-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gaga explained that she was at a nightclub and had a "sexual crush" on somebody. She went up to the person and uttered the line, "I wanna ride on your disco stick". Thinking it to be a thoughtful metaphor for [[penis]], Gaga went to the recording studio the next day and wrote the song in roughly four minutes. Gaga also had ideas for the live performance of the song where she used "an actual stick—it looks like a giant rock-candy pleasuring tool—that lights up".&lt;ref name="inspiration"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 'Just Dance' singer on leotards, the first lady and raunchy lyrics|last=Scaggs|first=Austin|date=February 19, 2009|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While commenting in regards to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove]]'', Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her "disco stick" metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on [[Network Ten]] in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics constituted off. "If anything, I happen to think people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate "lot of youth-oriented pop music" as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring," she concluded.&lt;ref name="heraldsun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/this-decades-biggest-thing/story-fna7dq6e-1225713905455|title=The world goes crazy for Lady Gaga|date=May 21, 2009|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|accessdate=May 27, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506152250/http://www.news.com.au/news/this-decades-biggest-thing/story-fna7dq6e-1225713905455|archivedate=May 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"LoveGame" was recorded at [[Record Plant Studios]] in [[Hollywood]] and at [[Chalice Recording Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Along with the production work of the track, RedOne also contributed to its background vocals, [[Musical instrument|instrumentation]], [[music programming|programming]], [[audio engineering]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]. Other personnel involved in creating the final version of the song included Robert Orton who did the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]], and Gene Grimaldi who [[audio mastering|mastered]] the song at Oasis Mastering, [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="liner"/&gt;

Musically, "LoveGame" is an uptempo [[synth-pop]] and [[electro (music)|electro]]-[[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Martens |first=Todd |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/10/lady-gaga-gets-a-dventurously-intimate-wrassles-with-madonna-on-snl-1.html?cid=6a00d8341c630a53ef0120a5bc73ff970b |title=Lady Gaga gets adventurously intimate, wrastles with Madonna on 'SNL' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 4, 2009 |accessdate=July 21, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008215459/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/10/lady-gaga-gets-a-dventurously-intimate-wrassles-with-madonna-on-snl-1.html?cid=6a00d8341c630a53ef0120a5bc73ff970b |archivedate=October 8, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a141079/lady-gaga-the-fame.html|title=Lady GaGa: 'The Fame'|last=Levine|first=Nick|date=January 9, 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714154812/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a141079/lady-gaga-the-fame.html|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kerri Mason of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the composition has a vibe of the New York downtown musical scene, but has a more mainstream appeal to it, making it perfect for radio, "without losing its smut and sass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/album/lady-gaga/the-fame/1172154/review|title=Lady Gaga: The Fame review|last=Mason|first=Kerri|date=November 10, 2008|accessdate=March 17, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021075324/http://www.billboard.com/album/lady-gaga/the-fame/1172154/review|archivedate=October 21, 2009|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song does not have a massive sound like previous single "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", nor has a big melody like subsequent single, "Paparazzi". Instead the composition of the song is electro-R&amp;B, consisting of big beats and a number of [[hook (music)|hooks]], with Gaga repeating the word "huh!" from time to time.&lt;ref name="spy"/&gt;

Gaga explained that the lyrics of "LoveGame" were clear about what the song is all about. She thought that the lyrics portrayed a powerful message about love, fame, and sexuality which was the central theme of ''The Fame''.&lt;ref name="heraldsun"/&gt; According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], "LoveGame" is set in the time signature of [[time signature|common time]] and is composed in the key of [[B minor]] with a moderate tempo of 104 [[beats per minute]]. Gaga's vocal range spans from B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to G&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Critical reception==

The song received mostly positive reviews from critics. ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]'' music editor Daniel Brockman said that "Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy song writing and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." He also commented on the lyrics saying that "'Let's have some fun, this beat is sick / I wanna take a ride on your disco stick' might be the trashiest-yet-awesomest refrain I've heard on a major-label record this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/70309-LADY-GAGA-THE-FAME/|title=Lady GaGa:The Fame|first=Daniel|last=Brockman|date=October 22, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2009|work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304003127/http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/70309-LADY-GAGA-THE-FAME|archivedate=March 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] criticized the song for "cheap" lyrics and "painfully enunciat[ing] without any resemblance of actual sex appeal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/lady-gaga-the-fame|title=Lady Gaga: The Fame review|first=Sal|last=Cinquemani|date=October 25, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2009|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814220440/http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/lady-gaga-the-fame|archivedate=August 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While reviewing ''The Fame'', [[BBC]] said that the song sounded robotic in the line "I wanna take a ride on your disco stick", though deemed it a brilliant track which "leaves us awarding Gaga the yearbook title of 'pop star most likely to kill'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/f6bd|title=Lady GaGa The Fame Review|first=Talia|last=Kraines|date=January 9, 2009|accessdate=April 6, 2009|publisher=BBC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405210433/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/f6bd|archivedate=April 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Levine from [[Digital Spy]] believed that lines like "I wanna take a ride on your disco stick" was a direct reason of Gaga's commercial success. Although he felt that the song was "attention-seeking", he knew that it would provoke reaction from the masses, be it good or bad.&lt;ref name="spy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a177512/lady-gaga-lovegame.html#~oIMQ850WpcktGG|title=Lady GaGa: 'LoveGame'|last=Levine|first=Nick|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2014|publisher=Digital Spy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001935/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a177512/lady-gaga-lovegame.html#~oIMQ850WpcktGG|archivedate=July 15, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genevieve Koski from ''[[The A.V.

She described it aurally as "a dizzying sonic trip that approximates the high point of a chemically enhanced night of club-hopping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koski|first=Genevieve|date=November 10, 2008|accessdate=July 1, 2014|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/lady-gaga-emthe-fameem-6744|title=Lady Gaga: ''The Fame''|work=[[The A.V.

Ben Hogwood from [[musicOMH]] declared the song as "top notch, diamond-encrusted pop" along with other tracks like "Starstruck" and "Paparazzi". He found the lyrics to be sometimes odd, especially the statement, "I'm on a mission, and it involves some heavy touchin'."&lt;ref name="musicomh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/lady-gaga_0109.htm|title=Lady Gaga – The Fame|last=Hogwood|first=Ben|date=January 12, 2009|work=[[musicOMH]]|accessdate=April 21, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122200052/http://www.musicomh.com/albums/lady-gaga_0109.htm|archivedate=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Rodman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said that the song "has a gutter level quippage with sinuous moves".&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/cd_reviews/articles/2008/10/27/lady_gaga/|title=Lady Gaga The Fame|last=Rodman|first=Sarah|date=October 27, 2008|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=April 21, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417151514/http://www.boston.com/ae/music/cd_reviews/articles/2008/10/27/lady_gaga/|archivedate=April 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priya Elan from ''[[The Times]]'' was not impressed with the song and called it calculated.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article5465929.ece|title=The Big CD: Lady GaGa – The Fame|last=Elan|first=Priya|date=January 10, 2009|newspaper=[[The Times]]|accessdate=April 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Billboard'' music editor Chris Williams gave the song a positive review, commenting that "It has all the winning ingredients of its predecessors: a radio-friendly, club/electropop feel; a provocative, yet silly enough catchphrase and hook; and a dash of '80s synth magic, so the adults can play along. On 'LoveGame' Gaga is in it to win it."&lt;ref name="BlBrd"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://login.vnuemedia.com/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003975917|title=LoveGame Single review|last=Williams|first=Chris|date=May 30, 2009|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While reviewing ''The Fame'' on its fifth anniversary, Bradley Stern from [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] noted that "LoveGame" could "easily be erased from Gaga's back catalog with little consequence" since he felt it to be nothing more than an "electro-dance" track. But Stern believed that "LoveGame" was an important component of Gaga's career trajectory, since it was the last testament of her image as "that of the disco-stick wielding pop star from out of space"—the image was later deconstructed as the doomed starlet in the music video of "Paparazzi". He concluded by saying that the song "is a wonderful moment of pop frivolity which served to keep the upstart Lady Gaga machine chugging along at the beginning of her career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7478449/lady-gaga-the-fame-stan-and-deliver/2|title=Lady Gaga's 'The Fame' Turns 5: Stan &amp; Deliver|last=Stern|first=Bradley|date=August 19, 2013|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|accessdate=July 1, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228171844/http://www.idolator.com/7478449/lady-gaga-the-fame-stan-and-deliver/2|archivedate=February 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background and development===
{{Quote box|width=300px|align=right|quote="'LoveGame' is a genuine New York lifestyle video.

I worked with Joseph Kahn, and he did an amazing job. He didn't just capture the fashion; he captured the artist."|source=—Gaga talking about the inspiration behind the video&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt;}}

The music video of "LoveGame" was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] and premiered on March 23, 2009, in Australia, and on August 13, 2009, in the UK on [[4Music]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.promonews.tv/2009/03/23/lady-gaga%E2%80%99s-love-games-by-joseph-kahn/|title=Lady Gaga's Love Games by Joseph Kahn|last=Knight|first=David|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=Promo News|accessdate=November 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329103440/http://www.promonews.tv/2009/03/23/lady-gaga%E2%80%99s-love-games-by-joseph-kahn/|archivedate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kissfmuk.com/2009/08/14/lady-gaga-love-game/|title=Lady Gaga: LoveGame UK video premiere|accessdate=August 13, 2009|publisher=[[KISS-FM]]|location=United Kingdom|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208091907/http://www.kissfmuk.com/2009/08/14/lady-gaga-love-game/|archivedate=December 8, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video mainly takes place in a subway station, hence several scenes are reminiscent to [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" music video, which was also shot in a similar location.

Gaga spoke to Whitney Pastorek of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' during a "Behind the Scenes" episode of the shoot, about her inspirations for the video. She wanted to have a "giant" dance video with "LoveGame", describing it as "plastic, beautiful, gorgeous, sweaty, tar on the floor". There would be scary and dangerous looking men also in the video. Gaga had the idea of portraying herself and her co-actors as New York inhabitants taking on the role of designers, performance artists, dancers etc. She enlisted people from downtown New York as dancers, who normally would not get cast in a video.&lt;ref name="QualityofBad"/&gt;

One of the props developed for the video was a pair of sunglasses made of wire. According to Gaga, she imagined "a downtown, bad-ass kid walking down the street with his buddies, grabbing a pair of pliers, and making a pair of sunglasses out of a fence on the street". She wore them on the opening shot of the music video along with a chain link [[Hood (headgear)|hood garment]], saying that "they look so hard. It looks like I plied them right out of the fence and put them on my face".&lt;ref name="QualityofBad"/&gt;

===Synopsis and reception===
[[File:LoveGame - Music Video by Lady Gaga.JPG|left|thumb|Gaga intimidating a circle of men with her disco stick while wearing [[chain-link fencing|chain-linked]] glasses in the music video for "LoveGame".|alt=A blond woman in a mauve leotard holds out a stick with a light atop it in her left hand. She is surrounded by men in black jackets and caps who seem to be looking at the stick.]]
The video starts with the heading "Streamline presents" and three men moving through [[Times Square]]. They open a manhole cover on which "[[Haus of Gaga]]" is written. Gaga is then shown naked with blue and purple paint and glitter on her body, frolicking with two men who have the words "Love" and "Fame" shaved into their heads. The scene shifts to a subway where Gaga starts singing in a grey-white [[leotard]] with a hood. She carries her characteristic disco stick and wears chain-linked glasses. The chorus starts with Gaga and her dancers progressing through the subway and dancing down a staircase. Two [[harlequin]] [[Great Dane]]s, are also shown on top of the staircase.&lt;ref name="revolution"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1606964/lady-gagas-pop-revolution-continues-with-lovegame/| title=Lady Gaga's pop revolution continues with 'LoveGame'| accessdate=March 29, 2009| last=Montgomery| first=James| date=March 13, 2009| publisher=MTV News| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202223648/http://www.mtv.com/news/1606964/lady-gagas-pop-revolution-continues-with-lovegame/| archivedate=December 2, 2014| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The video shifts to a train where the second verse takes place with choreographed dance routines and Gaga wearing a black jacket.&lt;ref name="QualityofBad"/&gt; During the intermediate music, Gaga is shown entering a ticket booth with an inspector while kissing and caressing.&lt;ref name="videovcensor"/&gt; As the camera pans from right to left the inspector changes from a man to woman in each frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/lady-gaga-romps-with-girl-and-boy-in-new-music-video_100156115.html|title=Lady Gaga romps with girl and boy in new music video|work=Thaindian News|date=February 19, 2009|accessdate=June 19, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421091939/http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/lady-gaga-romps-with-girl-and-boy-in-new-music-video_100156115.html|archivedate=April 21, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emma Hope Allwood of ''[[Dazed]]'', in the clip Gaga wears [[Nazi chic]] fashion based on an outfit [[Charlotte Rampling]] wore in ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974); Allwood noted that the outfit had previously been appropriated in the videos for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Justify My Love]]" (1990) and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s "[[The Fight Song (Marilyn Manson song)|The Fight Song]]" (2001).&lt;ref name=dazed&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/33523/1/nazi-chic-the-stylistic-legacy-of-the-night-porter| last=Hope Allwood| first=Emma| title=Nazi Chic: the stylistic legacy of ''The Night Porter''| publisher=''[[Dazed]]''| date=October 31, 2016| accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final scene shows Gaga doing a [[Choreography (dance)|choreographed]] dance routine with her crew of backup dancers. The video comes to an end as Gaga and her dancers hold their [[groin]]s, gesturing towards the camera.

The music video was censored in many countries after its release in 2009. The video faced censorship troubles in Australia where it was rated AV18+ by [[Network Ten]] for the "suggestive video footage involving [[bondage (sexual)|bondage]] and [[human sexual behavior|sexual acts]]". The channel demanded an edited version of the video which would not violate censorship rules.&lt;ref name="videovcensor"/&gt; ''Video Hits'' refused to air the video in its [[Motion picture rating system#Australia|G]]- and [[Motion picture rating system#Australia|PG]]-rated time slots. They cited "numerous sexual references both visually and lyrically" as the reason they could not create a child-friendly edit without bleeping the repeated hook "I wanna take a ride on your disco stick".&lt;ref name="heraldsun"/&gt; However, Australian programs like ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]'' and cable networks [[Channel V Australia|Channel V]] and [[MTV Australia|MTV]] aired the video in its original form.&lt;ref name="videovcensor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/lady-gaga-love-game-video-banned-from-australian-tv/story-e6frewyr-1225696971822|title=Lady GaGa Love Game video banned from Australian TV|last=Adams|first=Cameron|date=April 7, 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Australian Daily Telegraph]]|page=1|accessdate=April 7, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922131831/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/lady-gaga-love-game-video-banned-from-australian-tv/story-e6frewyr-1225696971822|archivedate=September 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video also faced a ban from [[MTV Arabia]] citing the same reason as Australia. Since it was very rare to ban videos on MTV, head of MTV Arabia Samer al Marzouki commented, "We represent the young generation's mentality and culture so we can't play something that conflicts with that. If they can't watch something comfortably with their brother, sisters or friends then we will not play it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090608/NATIONAL/706079810/-1/OPINION|title=MTV Arabia bans Lady Gaga video|last=Swan|first=Melanie|date=June 7, 2009|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|accessdate=June 8, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611201821/http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090608/NATIONAL/706079810/-1/OPINION|archivedate=June 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[VH1]] and [[MTV]] played an edited version that removed the scenes showing Gaga naked, and blurred the label on a bottle of alcohol held by a dancer, but they did not change the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/play.jhtml?id=1613655&amp;vid=392357|title=See LoveGame Online|accessdate=June 19, 2009|publisher=[[VH1]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620222135/http://www.vh1.com/video/play.jhtml?id=1613655&amp;vid=392357|archivedate=June 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was a major part of Gaga's [[The Fame Ball Tour]] as the second number of the set list, and was performed alongside album track, "Starstruck". Gaga wore a silver and black short skirt looking like a [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] and shaped like a [[Peplos|peplum]].

'''''Mark Twain Tonight!''''' is a one-man play devised by [[Hal Holbrook]], in which he depicts [[Mark Twain]] giving a dramatic recitation selected from several of Twain's writings, with an emphasis on the comic ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/10/nyregion/the-view-from-hartford-mark-twain-tonight-try-1950-nights.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/2005/06/10/theater/reviews/10twai.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mayoarts.org/indiv/indiv_HalHolbrookMarkTwainTonight.html#.UdhYg-Cf_ww Mayoarts.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The recitation's genesis was a show that Holbrook performed with his first wife Ruby in which she would interview him portraying famous people in history, including Twain.&lt;ref name="Hal Holbrook on PBS.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/now/arts/holbrook.html Hal Holbrook on PBS.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrook revised the concept into a one-man show in the 1950s, first performing it at the [[Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania|Lock Haven State Teachers College]] in Pennsylvania in 1954.&lt;ref name="Hal Holbrook on PBS.org"/&gt; He made his first [[New York City]] appearance as Twain in the [[Off-Broadway]] engagement in 1959 and premiered it on [[Broadway theatres|Broadway]] in 1966. Holbrook's performance was first noticed by New York [[Theatrical producer|producer]] [[John Lotas]] at The [[Lambs Club]] in [[Manhattan]]. Lotas presented the show at the Forty-First Street Theatre, where it ran for 174 performances. He won a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]] for that appearance and an [[Emmy Award]] nomination for the 1967 television broadcast (which was produced by [[David Susskind]]) on [[CBS]].

The last performance on [[Broadway theatres|Broadway]] was in 2006. Holbrook was known to alternate the material that he performed. The original program from the 1959 Off-Broadway engagement included the note “While Mr. Twain’s selections will come from the list below, we have been unable to pin him down as to which of them he will do. He claims this would cripple his inspiration. However, he has generously conceded to a printed program for those who are in distress and wish to fan themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;On Stage, The New York Times Book Co. (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; This appeared on programs for the show until Holbrook abruptly announced his retirement from the show in September 2017.&lt;ref name=holbrookretires&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsok.com/article/5563884|title=Hal Holbrook retires his award-winning one-man show 'Mark Twain Tonight!' after 63 years, cancels Oklahoma City performance|date=2017-09-13|work=NewsOK.com|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his retirement, Holbrook noted that he had been performing under the name "Mark Twain" 13 years longer than its originator: Samuel Clemens had adopted the [[pseudonym]] at age 24 and died at the age of 74.

==The performance==
[[File:Hal Holbrook as Mark Twain.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Holbrook performing as Twain at the [[University of Houston]]]]
In an interview with [[William Goldman]], Holbrook explained how he structured the show. "Who wants to see an evening about a literary figure? I knew that in the first act I had to overcome that natural reluctance, so my biggest desire was to make them laugh their asses off at the start, so they'd go out at intermission and say, 'Hey, this guy's funny.' The second act became the social-comment act. I'd start with some funny material to get them again (but not too much of it, or they'd never stop laughing and take the show right away from you). In the last act I gave them the Twain they'd been expecting all along: warm, whimsical, memories of childhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldman |first1=William |title=The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway |date=1969 |publisher=Limelight Editions |location=New York |isbn=0879100230 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbrook adapted to concerns that presenting Mark Twain as on an 1890s lecture circuit would use racial slurs acceptable in that era, but unacceptable to modern audiences.  Challenging the critics, Holbrook often chose to read a passage from "Huckleberry Finn" where the orphaned, pipe-smoking, uneducated youngster, Huck, faces a poignant moral dilemma. Holbrook altered the narration to use the dialectally milder "Nigra" as the young boy wrestles with his conscience over following the law or his heart concerning "the widow's Nigra, Jim," a runaway slave. Audiences have embraced this presentation as the boy ultimately rejects the legal, societal and even religious ramifications in favor of helping the runaway on his quest for freedom. It is one of the more somber segments of a usually humorous presentation, which Holbrook has felt important to continue in the spirit of Twain's own message.

==Specials==
On the occasion of Mr. Clemens's 175th birthday (November 30, 2010), Holbrook performed ''Mark Twain Tonight!'' in [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], New York, at the [[Clemens Center]] in front of a sell-out crowd. April 21, 2010 was the 100th anniversary of his death. The evening began with the singing of happy birthday to Mr. Clemens followed by Holbrook's appearance on stage. 2014 marked the 60th consecutive year that Holbrook has performed ''Mark Twain Tonight!''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/holbrooks-mark-twain-show-reaches-60th-year AP The Big Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

They viewed these musical styles as [[Degenerate art|inferior works]]&lt;ref name="hate and love"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chronicleworld.org/archive/lovehate.htm |title=Blacks: forgotten target of Europe's hate and love |accessdate=19 September 2011 |work=Chronicle World}}&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to an "inferior race" and therefore prohibited. The term, at that same time, was also applied to indigenous music styles of [[Music of Africa#Sub-Saharan music|black Africans]].

== Nazi Germany ==
At the time of the [[Weimar Republic]] during 1927, [[Ernst Krenek]]'s opera of ''[[Jonny spielt auf]]'' (''Jonny Plays'') contained jazz musical performances that caused protests among some right-wing [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic-nationalist]] groups in Germany at the time. In 1930, the American musician [[Henry Cowell]] wrote in the ''Melos'' journal that jazz interpreted a mixture of African-American and Jewish elements, stating that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fundamentals of jazz are the syncopation and rhythmic accents of the [[Negro]]. Their modernization is the work of New York Jews [...] So jazz is Negro music seen through the eyes of the Jews." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Swing Heil – Jazz im Nationalsozialismus |last=[[Bernd Polster|Polster]] |first=[[Bernd Polster|Bernd]] |origyear=1989 |year=1998 |language=German |location=[[Berlin]] |publisher=Transit Buchverlag |page=9 |isbn=978-3-88747-050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such views were readily picked up by the Nazis. Their criticisms have included "gratuitous use of syncopation" and "orgies of drums".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Musik im Dritten Reich – Eine Dokumentation |last=[[Joseph Wulf|Wulf]] |first=[[Joseph Wulf|Joseph]] |origyear=1963 |year=1983 |language=German |location=[[Gütersloh]] |publisher=Ullstein |page=350 |isbn=978-3-548-33032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; More statements from the Nazis included such things as "artistic licentiousness" and "corruption seed in the musical expression" with "indecent dance forms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Funktion der Musik im deutschen Rundfunk, 1933-1945 (Musikwissenschaftliche Studien) |others=Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht (Hrsg.)

In 1932 the national government under [[Franz von Papen]] pandered to the Nazis by banning all public performances by black musicians. After [[Adolf Hitler]] gained [[Machtergreifung|power]] in 1933, the [[Reichsmusikkammer|Reich's Music Chamber]]&lt;ref name="music reich"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/politics-and-propaganda/third-reich/reichskulturkammer/ |title=Music and the Holocaust: Reichskulturkammer &amp; Reichsmusikkammer |accessdate=19 September 2011 |work=Music and the Holocaust: Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also created in that same year. This was then followed by a full legal ban on this music on October 12, 1935 across all German national radio.&lt;ref name="Politik &amp; Geschichte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs-bergedorf.net/10e-projects/ns_swing.html |title=GSB-Hamburg: World in Touch 10e (1999-2001), Politik &amp; Geschichte |date=19 September 2011 |work=Chronicle World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817132319/http://gs-bergedorf.net/10e-projects/ns_swing.html |archivedate=August 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban was spearheaded by the German Reich's radio conductor, [[Eugen Hadamovsky]], who purportedly stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Mit dem heutigen Tag spreche ich ein endgültiges Verbot des Negerjazz für den gesamten Deutschen Rundfunk aus.''"
(in English- "As of today, I am speaking on a definitive ban on the negro jazz for the entire German Radio.").&lt;ref name="Heribert Schröder 1988, p. 176"/&gt;&lt;ref name="der spiegel jazz88"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13528677.html |title=DER SPIEGEL 16/1988 - Wir haben damals die beste Musik gemacht |date=18 August 1988 |work=Der Spiegel online |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1938, the Nazis organized the '[[Degenerate music|''Entartete Musik'']]' public exhibition in Germany, mainly held in [[Düsseldorf]]. This exhibition included a poster displaying a [[cartoon]] [[caricature]] of an African-American male playing on a saxophone with the [[Star of David]] on his tuxedo lapel. The overall theme of the exhibition was defamation of contemporary American music as "Negro music" and as another Jewish 'plot' upon German culture.&lt;ref name="musDegen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/arts/musDegen.htm |title=Degenerate Music |accessdate=19 September 2011 |work=Florida Center for Instructional Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reich verboten"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemusic.de/rezension.htm?rid=5044 |title=Cinemusic.de - Im Dritten Reich verboten – Entartete Musik, Folge 1 (Rezension) |accessdate=19 September 2011 |work=Filmmusik auf Cinemusic.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swing kids ==
The "[[Swing Kids]]" (German: Swingjugend) were a group of jazz and swing lovers in Germany in the 1930s, mainly in [[Hamburg]] ([[St. Pauli]]) and [[Berlin]]. They were mainly composed of 14- to 18-year-old boys and girls. They defied National Socialism (Nazism) by listening and dancing to this same banned music in private quarters, clubs, rented halls and vacant cafés.&lt;ref name="case swing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmd.org.uk/resources/education/case-study-swing-kids |title=Case Study: Swing Kids |accessdate=19 September 2011 |work=HMD Trust |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817231332/http://hmd.org.uk/resources/education/case-study-swing-kids |archivedate=August 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz music was offensive to [[Nazi ideology]], because it was often performed by blacks and a number of Jewish musicians. The Swing Kids gave the impression of being [[apolitical]], similar to their [[zoot suit]]er counterparts in North America.

On 18 August 1941, in a brutal police operation, over 300 Swing kids were arrested. The measures against them ranged from cutting their hair and sending them back to school under close monitoring, to the deportation of their leaders to [[Nazi concentration camp]]s.

The 1993 movie [[Swing Kids (1993 film)|''Swing Kids'']] gives a fictional portrayal of these same youths in that period in Germany.

== World War II ==
Prior to the [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] landings, during the German occupation of the [[Netherlands]], [[Joseph Goebbels]]'s [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|propaganda ministry]] published pamphlets written in Dutch named "Greetings from England - The Coming Invasion". These pamphlets contained in-between statements, such as "old jazz-records" and a further full statement declaring "at the celebration of liberation your daughters and wives will be dancing in the arms of real Negroes".&lt;ref name="hate and love"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chronicleworld.org/archive/lovehate.htm |title=Blacks: forgotten target of Europe's hate and love |accessdate=19 September 2011 |work=Chronicle World}}&lt;/ref&gt; This further equated jazz music with '[[African American|blackness]]' during this time to stir up [[racism]] and anti-[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] propaganda within occupied Europe.
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Goldchat1.jpg|thumb|First gold record award for "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]" is presented to [[Glenn Miller]] by W. Wallace Early of RCA Victor with announcer Paul Douglas on far left, February 10, 1942.]] --&gt;
However, Goebbels managed to create a Nazi-sponsored German swing band named [[Charlie and his Orchestra]] whose [[propaganda|propagandistic]] purpose was to win over Nazi support and sympathy from British and American listeners through [[Shortwave]] radio.&lt;ref name="der spiegel jazz88"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13528677.html |title=DER SPIEGEL 16/1988 - Wir haben damals die beste Musik gemacht |date=18 August 1988 |work=Der Spiegel online |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally counter-propaganda was used by Allied forces which played upon the fears of the Nazi's banned music. One such example is [[Glenn Miller]],&lt;ref name="hate and love"/&gt; who was a [[White American]] jazz musician, that initially provided jazz music, through radio, to Allied combat soldiers for the purposes of entertainment and morale. His same music was used as counter-propaganda by [[American Forces Network#World War II|AFN]] radio broadcasting to denounce [[Fascism|fascist]] oppression in Europe with even Miller once stating himself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"America means freedom, and there's no expression of freedom quite so sincere as music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Different Drummers: Jazz in the Culture of Nazi Germany |last=[[Michael H.

== Post-War period ==
Even in the Post–World War II years in 1950's Germany, there were some protests from churches, school authorities and politicians against the "obscene Negro music" of the newly emerging [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] genre with such acts like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and [[Chuck Berry]] gaining new popularity amongst youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ssm-site.ch/gazette/MillionenElvis.pdf |title= Martin Schäfer - Millionen von Elvis-Fans können sich nicht irren |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708184944/http://www.ssm-site.ch/gazette/MillionenElvis.pdf |archivedate= July 8, 2011 |df=  }}  ('''''English:''''' Millions of Elvis-fans cannot be wrong) Retrieved 19 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude also continued right up into the 1960s carrying the same derogatory term that not only maintained its resentment by older generations and conservatives but also was an aggressive defense against a then new contemporary American culture.&lt;ref name="bpd1968"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bpb.de/themen/O9ARYO,1,0,Mythos_1968.html |title=Mythos 1968 - 1968 heute |work=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung}} ('''''English:''''' Federal Agency for Civic Education) Retrieved 19 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Dance halls in [[East-Germany]] often displayed "Affentanzen verboten" notices (lit.: ''monkey dancing forbidden'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

'''Neolttwigi''' or '''nol-ttwigi''' ({{lang-ko|널뛰기}}) is a traditional outdoor game of Korean women and girls that is typically enjoyed on traditional holidays such as [[Korean New Year]], [[Chuseok]], and [[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano]].

Neolttwigi is similar to [[seesaw]], except that participants stand on each end of the ''Neol'' (board) and jump, propelling the person opposite into the air.  When performed as a spectacle, [[acrobatic]] tricks such as flips or skipping rope while in the air are often included.

It is thought that [[Yangban]] women developed ''Neolttwigi'' to see over the walls that surrounded their homes, as women in traditional Korea were rarely allowed out of their living compounds, except at night.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney P. Carlisle, ''Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society, Volume 1''  [[Sage Publications]] (14 April 2009) p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend, a wife who wants to see a husband trapped in a prison over a high wall could see the face of a husband through Neolttwigi with a wife of another sinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1076108&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=34708|title=Neolttwigi|last=|first=|date=2008|website=Doopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neolttwigi also helped to alleviate the lack of exercise.

The '''Office of Film and Literature Classification''' (OFLC, {{lang-mi|Te Tari Whakarōpū Tukuata, Tuhituhinga}}) is the government agency in [[New Zealand]] that is responsible for [[censorship|classification]] of all [[films]], [[Videotape|videos]], [[publications]], and some [[video game]]s in New Zealand. It was established under Section 76 of the  [[Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993]] (FVPC Act), replacing various film classification acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/human_rights/Summer_Schools/bannedbooks.html |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/64Rw9X6GH?url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/human_rights/Summer_Schools/bannedbooks.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 January 2012 |title=Censored - a short history of censorship in New Zealand by Paul Christoffel (extract) |accessdate=12 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Indecent Publications Tribunal]]. It is an independent [[Crown entity]] in terms of the [[Crown Entities Act 2004]].  The head of the OFLC is called the Chief Censor, maintaining a title that has described the government officer in charge of [[censorship in New Zealand]] since 1916.

The FVPC Act gives the OFLC jurisdiction to classify "publications" which include films, videos, [[DVDs]], [[computer games]] with restricted content, [[books]], [[magazines]], [[comics]], [[manga]], [[sound recordings]], [[pictures]], [[newspapers]], [[photographs]], [[photographic slide]]s, "any print or writing", any "paper or other thing" that has images or words on it (including [[apparel]], [[playing cards]], [[greeting cards]], [[art]], store-fronts and [[billboards]]), and electronic [[Digital data|digital]] image, text and sound [[computer files]].  The OFLC also approves film [[posters]] and slicks.  Only computer games with restricted content, and all films, videos, and DVDs, must carry a label before being offered for supply or exhibited to the public.

Any person may submit any of the "publications" listed above for classification by the OFLC, with the permission of the Chief Censor. The Secretary for Internal Affairs, Comptroller of Customs, Commissioner of Police and the Film and Video Labelling Body may submit publications for classification without the Chief Censor's permission.  The Courts have no jurisdiction to classify publications.  If the classification of a publication becomes an issue in any civil or criminal proceeding, the Court must submit the publication to the OFLC.  Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision of the OFLC may have the relevant publication, but not the OFLC decision, reviewed by the [[Film and Literature Board of Review]].

==Labels==
The FVPC Act gives the OFLC the power to classify publications into three categories: unrestricted, restricted, and "objectionable" or [[ban (law)|banned]]. Unrestricted films are assigned a green or yellow rating label. Restricted films are assigned a red classification label.

In early 2013, some DVDs and Blu-rays released in New Zealand have had the rating label printed on the cover to prevent the removal of the labels, which is illegal.

New Zealand has used a colour-coded labelling system since 1987. The colors are intended to convey the messages conveyed by a [[traffic light]]:  a green label means that nothing in the film, video or DVD should inhibit anyone viewing it; a yellow label means proceed with caution because the film, video or DVD may have content younger viewers should not see; and a red label means stop and ensure that no one outside of the restriction views the film, video, DVD or computer game. It is an offence to supply age-restricted material to anyone under the age shown on the label.

The New Zealand classification system currently uses the following labels:

{| class="wikitable" style="font-size:85%;"
|-
! Label
! Name
! Definition
|-
| [[File:General.png|145px|G]]

|-
| [[File:R label (Office of Film and Literature Classification, New Zealand).jpg|R]]
| '''Restricted'''
| Restricted to a particular class of persons, or for particular purposes, or both, specified by the Office of Film and Literature Classification
|}
The RP18 rating is the newest rating, having been created in April 2017 specifically for the drama series ''[[13 Reasons Why]]''.

The Film and Video Labelling Body may award films, videos and DVDs an unrestricted classification of (G, PG or M) based on their [[Australian Classification Board|Australian classification]], or [[British Board of Film Classification|British classification]] if no Australian classification exists. The OLFC is the only body who may award restricted ratings.

Red labels have been available for non-film publications such as magazines and [[video game]]s since 2005.

==Classification law==
The OFLC classifies material based on whether it is likely to be "harmful" or "injurious to the [[public good]]". Specifically (from the FVPC Act): "a publication is objectionable if it describes, depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with matters such as [[sex]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[crime]], [[cruelty]], or [[violence]] in such a manner that the availability of the publication is likely to be injurious to the public good."  In 2000, the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand]] decided in ''Living Word Distributors Limited v Human Rights Action Group (Wellington)''  [2000] NZCA 179 (a case involving two videos produced by [[Jeremiah Films]]) that the collocation of the words "sex, horror, crime, cruelty or violence" tends to point to activity rather than to the expression of [[opinion]] or [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. On this interpretation, the OFLC had jurisdiction to restrict or ban publications describing or depicting sexual activities, but not those describing only an attitude or opinion about sex. The same interpretation required publications to describe or depict horror activities, criminal activities, cruel activities and violent activities, rather than just an opinion or attitude about those things, for the OFLC to be able to classify them.

The Court of Appeal explicitly ruled that the phrase "matters such as sex" is strongly indicative of sexual activities and does not include [[sexual orientation]]. This made it more difficult for the OFLC to restrict or ban, for example, publications that simply exploited the [[Child nudity|nudity of children]] or that portrayed classes of people as [[Inherent inferiority|inherently inferior]] but that did not show any of the specified types of activity, notwithstanding the fact the FVPC Act directs the censors to give "particular weight" to these things when deciding whether or not to restrict or ban a publication.  It also made it difficult for the OFLC to restrict publications simply containing offensive language or to ban videos of persons taken without their knowledge or consent, such as "[[upskirt]]" videos, on the ground of [[invasion of privacy]], again because neither type of publication shows any of the specified types of activity.  In 2005, Parliament amended the FVPC Act, and commenced amendment of the Crimes Act, to restore the OFLC's jurisdiction over all of these matters except for publications that simply portray classes of people as inherently inferior.

Under the FVPC Act, material that promotes, supports, or tends to promote or support the following is, by its nature, deemed objectionable (banned):
* The [[child pornography|sexual exploitation of children]]
* [[Coercion]]
* Extreme [[violence]], [[torture]], and/or [[cruelty]]
* [[Bestiality]]
* [[Necrophilia]]
* [[Urophilia]]
* [[Coprophilia]]

The Censorship Compliance Unit of the [[New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs|Department of Internal Affairs]] is responsible for the enforcement of the FVPC Act.

The OFLC also regularly convenes panels that are demographically representative of New Zealand as a whole to assist it with the classification of particular publications.  It has convened public panels to assist it with the classification of films such as ''[[Baise-moi]]'', ''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom|Salo]]'', ''[[Monster's Ball]]'', ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Du er ikke alene]]'', ''[[Lolita]]'', ''[[8mm (film)|8MM]]'' and ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]''.  More frequently, the OFLC consults experts to assist it with the classification of various publications.  For example, religious experts were consulted to assist with the classification of ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', experts in road safety were consulted on ''[[Mischief Destroy]]'', the [[Children's Commissioner (New Zealand)|Children's Commissioner]] on ''[[Ken Park]]'' and ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'', [[homeopathic]] practitioners on drug manufacturing books written by [[Uncle Fester (author)|Steve Preisler]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}, various human rights organisations and the Vicar of [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] on a publication entitled ''Against Homosexuality''[http://tencommandments.org/],  and [[Rape Crisis Centers|rape crisis centres]] and psychologists on ''[[Irréversible]]'' and an edition of the [[University of Otago]] student magazine ''[[The Critic (magazine)|Critic]]''.

Each year, the OFLC consults media studies students in its high school programme called ''Censor for a Day'' during which an unreleased film is shown to high school students who are then asked to classify it applying the criteria in the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993.  The students' classification is compared with, and usually identical to, the film's actual classification.  Films used for ''Censor for a Day'' have included ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', ''[[Final Destination 3]]'', ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'', ''[[Thirteen (2003 film)|Thirteen]]'', ''[[Crazy/Beautiful]]'', ''[[Garage Days]]'', ''[[The Notorious Bettie Page]]'', ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]'', ''[[Charlie Bartlett]]'', ''[[Defiance (2008 film)|Defiance]]'', ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'', ''[[Daybreakers]]'', ''[[Animal Kingdom (film)|Animal Kingdom]]'', ''[[Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil]]'', ''[[Attack the Block]]'', ''[[Trance (2013 film)|Trance]]'', ''[[The East (film)|The East]]'', ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' and ''[[Housebound]]''.

==Criticism==

=== Of restrictions ===
In June 2007, [[Exit International]] Director Dr [[Philip Nitschke]] described the decision by the Classification Office banning ''[[The Peaceful Pill Handbook]]'' as "very disappointing" while recognising "that the Censor was under intense political pressure over this decision".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exitinternational.net/deliverance/NZcensorpr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The book was banned because it promotes and encourages criminal activity by offering instruction in how to smuggle and manufacture controlled drugs in violation of a number of statutes, not because it advocates reform of the law to permit the seriously ill and elderly access to [[pentobarbital]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/64Rw9X6GHnews_2007_6%20peaceful%20pill.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of non-restrictions ===

The [[Society for the Promotion of Community Standards]] (SPCS) has repeatedly criticised the OFLC for not banning films such as ''[[Baise-moi]]'', ''[[Irréversible]]'', [[Takashi Miike]]'s ''[[Visitor Q]]'' and ''[[Gojitmal|Lies]]'' which it as described as highly [[pornography|pornographic]] and [[violent]]. The SPCS has also targeted films scheduled for exhibition in the Beck's Incredible Film Festival and the New Zealand International Film Festivals.

=== Other ===

In 2006 the SPCS criticised the financial management of the OFLC, complaining to the Auditor General that the OFLC was inefficient and mismanaged taxpayer funds. The Auditor General conducted an audit of the OFLC and stated that "no evidence of waste was found during the course of the audit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spcs.org.nz/content/view/132/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008032854/http://spcs.org.nz/content/view/132/ |archivedate=8 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rhoda''''' is an American [[sitcom]] starring [[Valerie Harper]] which aired a total of 109 half-hour episodes and one hour-long episode over five seasons from September 9, 1974 to December 9, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Tom. ''TV Land To Go: The Big Book of TV Lists, TV Lore, and TV Bests''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001. pg. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The series was a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', in which Harper between the years 1970 and 1974 had played the role of [[Rhoda Morgenstern]], a spunky, weight-conscious, flamboyantly fashioned [[Jewish]] neighbor and native New Yorker in the role of [[Mary Richards]]' best friend. After four seasons, Rhoda left [[Minneapolis]] and returned to her original hometown of [[New York City]]. The series was the winner of two [[Golden Globe Award]]s and two [[Emmy Award]]s.

''Rhoda'' was filmed Friday evenings in front of a [[live studio audience]] at [[CBS Studio Center|CBS Studio Center, Stage 14]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:Valerie Harper Julie Kavner Nancy Walker Rhoda 1974.JPG|thumb|220px|left|Rhoda is staying with Brenda for a vacation; Brenda and Ida think it will be for longer than that.]]
The series opens with the [[television pilot|pilot episode]] featuring Rhoda Morgenstern traveling from her home in [[Minneapolis]] to [[New York City]], where she was born and raised, for a two-week vacation, staying with her younger sister, Brenda ([[Julie Kavner]]). While there, she meets [[Joe Gerard]] ([[David Groh]]), a handsome divorcé who owns a wrecking company and has a ten-year-old son, Donny, whom Brenda babysits. Following Brenda's prompting, Rhoda and Joe meet and develop an instant attraction to each other which leads to their [[dating]] nightly for the duration of her vacation. After an argument about their feelings for each other, Joe asks Rhoda to stay in New York City, which she does, initially moving in with Brenda at 332 E. 64th Street (however, actual exterior shots are of [https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=332+East+84th+Street&amp;data=!1m8!1m3!1d3!2d-73.951282!3d40.77596!2m2!1f209.23!2f90!4f75!2m4!1e1!2m2!1sypW0fonzQVmmZxyKgHySyw!2e0!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d7223!2d-73.958814!3d40.778458!3m2!1i1920!2i918!4f13.1&amp;fid=5 332 East 84th Street], between 1st and 2nd Avenues on the southeast end of the block). Brenda, a bank teller, is an insecure person with low self-esteem with dating problems, similar to how Rhoda herself had experienced difficulty in dating in Minneapolis in the early years of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''.

The first episode of Season 1, entitled "Joe", aired on [[CBS]] on Monday, September 9, 1974 at 9:30 PM. and immediately set a record by being the first and only television series ever to achieve a number-one [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] for its premiere pilot episode, defeating the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] ratings juggernaut, ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' in the process. This record continues to stand after over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mitz, Rick. ''The Great TV Sitcom Book''. New York: Perigee Books, 1988. page 292&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moritz, Charles. ''Current Biography Yearbook'' vol. 36. New York: H.W. Wilson Company, 1975. pages 183–84:&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt; "When Rhoda premiered on CBS-TV on Monday, September 9, 1974 at 9:30 PM, it became the first program ever to capture first place in the Nielsen ratings with its first exposure ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Bonnie. ''Fifty on Fifty: Wisdom, Inspiration, and Reflections on Women's Lives Well Lived''.  New York: Warner Books, 1998. entry ''"Valerie Harper"'': "When Rhoda premiered on September 9, 1974, it captured the top spot in the Nielsen ratings with its very first broadcast, a feat that had never been accomplished before or duplicated since."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Valerie Harper David Groh Rhoda 1974.JPG|thumb|Joe asks Rhoda to move in with him.]]
Rhoda and Brenda soon realize that the small [[studio apartment]] can't hold them both, so Rhoda moves in with their parents [[List of other characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Ida]] ([[Nancy Walker]]) and [[List of other characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Martin]] ([[Harold Gould]]) at their apartment in the [[The Bronx, New York|Bronx]]. Ida and Martin are the stereotypical [[Jewish]] parents. Ida is overbearing, overprotective, benevolently manipulative, and desperate to ensure her daughters find a good husband. Martin is her dutiful, mild-mannered husband. Ida initially goes to great lengths to baby her daughter. When it becomes apparent Rhoda is sliding into a rut by occupying her childhood bedroom, Ida forces her to move out for her own good.

As the weeks go by, the relationship between Joe and Rhoda quickly blossoms. By the sixth episode, "Pop Goes the Question", an insecure Rhoda asks Joe where their relationship is heading. His response is to invite Rhoda to move in with him. After some careful thought, and consultation with her sister and father, Rhoda accepts Joe's invitation, but within minutes of moving in decides that rather than living together out of wedlock she prefers to be married. Rhoda attempts to convince Joe that they are very compatible and would be a happily married couple. After some hesitation, Joe agrees and a wedding is planned.

==Rhoda's wedding==
[[File:Valerie Harper David Groh Rhoda wedding 1974.JPG|thumb|Rhoda and Joe.]]
Eight weeks into the series on Monday, October 28, 1974, Rhoda and Joe were married in a special hour-long episode which broke several television records. Heavily publicized, it became the highest-rated television episode of the 1970s, a record it held until the miniseries ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' claimed that title in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Fireman, Judy. ''TV Book: The Ultimate Television Book''. New York: Workman Pub. Co., 1977. page 232&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, on the night of its airing it had become the second most-watched television episode of all time, surpassed only by the birth of Little Ricky on ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;''TV Guide'', May 2–8, 1992, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitz, Rick. ''The Great TV Sitcom Book''. R. Marek Publishers, 1980. pg. 350:&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt; "The episode is still a classic. Fifty million people stayed home — and some actually threw parties for Rhoda's wedding. It was a TV phenomenon, unlike anything since Lucy had her baby on television."&lt;/ref&gt;

It was watched by more than 52 million Americans, over half of the US viewing audience. At the conclusion of the episode, Monday Night Football host [[Howard Cosell]] joked on the air that he had not been invited to the wedding, and welcomed viewers back to the game.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther, Marc and Bill Carter.

''Tube of Plenty: The Evolution of American Television''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1975. page 434&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of "wedding parties" were held by fans across the United States on the night of the episode to celebrate the television wedding, and within days the CBS-TV studios were inundated with wedding gifts sent in by fans for the fictional Joe and Rhoda Gerard.&lt;ref&gt;''Good Housekeeping Magazine'', vol. 180, March, 1975, page 163&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was overwhelmingly praised by critics, widely touted as a "television phenomenon",&lt;ref&gt;Mitz, pg. 350&lt;/ref&gt; "unlike anything that had happened on television for nearly twenty years",&lt;ref&gt;Zanderbergen, George. ''Stay Tuned''. Crestwood House, 1976. pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and garnered Harper her fourth Emmy award in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Zanderbergen, pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vogue'' magazine reported that people across the country had pulled off the road checking into motels, and friends canceled out on dinner invitations (feigning illness), just to watch Rhoda's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;''Vogue'', vol. 167, February, 1976, pg. 176, column 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedding episode featured guest appearances by many of the main characters from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', including [[Mary Richards]] ([[Mary Tyler Moore]]), [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]] ([[Edward Asner]]), [[Murray Slaughter]] ([[Gavin MacLeod]]), [[List of other characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Georgette Franklin]] ([[Georgia Engel]]), and [[Phyllis Lindstrom]] ([[Cloris Leachman]]). The only major characters who didn't attend were [[Ted Baxter]] ([[Ted Knight]]) and [[Sue Ann Nivens]] ([[Betty White]]).{{Why|date=May 2017}}

In ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' episode "The New Sue Ann", airing Saturday, October 26, 1974, two days before ''Rhoda's Wedding'', the characters frequently discuss the upcoming event and buy wedding gifts. At the end of the episode Murray and Lou leave the TV station to drive Mary to the airport. During ''Rhoda's Wedding'' it is revealed that on a lark Lou and Murray decided to fly to New York with Mary to surprise Rhoda; her frequent nemesis, Phyllis, who intentionally not been invited, nonetheless flew in for the wedding, and Mary and Rhoda's friend, Georgette, who drove from Minneapolis.

During the episode, Phyllis asks for the opportunity to participate in the wedding and is appointed the responsibility to pick up Rhoda at Brenda's Manhattan apartment and drive her to her parents' apartment in the Bronx where the ceremony is being held. The self-absorbed and forgetful Phyllis neglects to keep her promise. This forces Rhoda to take the subway, running through the streets of Manhattan and the Bronx fully regaled in her wedding dress and veil and dashing into her parents' apartment building in one of the most memorable moments in the history of series television.&lt;ref&gt;Bedell, Sally. ''Up the Tube: Prime-Time TV and the Silverman Years''. Viking Press, 1981. pg. 85&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zurawik, David. ''The Jews of Primetime''. Brandeis University Press, 2003. pg. 181&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a state of shock, Ida refuses Phyllis's profuse apologies saying "I'll kill you". Phyllis begs everyone in the room to forgive her, but the only one who does is Georgette, who then suggests to Phyllis that she leave before Rhoda arrives. The episode also features special closing credits, showing additional footage of Rhoda (Harper) running down a Manhattan street in her wedding dress and veil accompanied by an alternative version of the theme song played to the tune of Mendelssohn's ''[[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Seasons 1 and 2 (1974–76)===
[[File:Valerie Harper Vivian Vance Rhoda 1976.JPG|thumb|[[Vivian Vance]] guest stars in the episode "Friends and Mothers" (1975) ]]
For the remainder of the first and second seasons, the show focuses on Rhoda and Joe's new married life. The two move into a penthouse suite in the same building as Brenda. Rhoda advances in her career as a [[window dresser]] by opening up a small window dressing business called "Windows by Rhoda" with her old high school friend Myrna Morgenstein ([[Barbara Sharma]]). Rhoda uses her own maiden surname "Morgenstern" in her professional dealings as a window dresser and her married surname "Gerard" in her personal life.

During this period, the show was a massive ratings hit on Monday nights, staying near the top of the ratings in both seasons, even faring better than its parent, ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''. In early seasons, the closing credits of the series featured Rhoda on a New York street trying to imitate [[Mary Tyler Moore]]'s trademark hat toss, but the cap slips from Rhoda's hand before she can throw it. Upon moving from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' to her own eponymous series, Rhoda's Jewish religious and ethnic background seemed to fade as she was no longer unique and would be surrounded by a host of New York ethnics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brook|first=Vincent|title=Something Aint Kosher Here: The Rise of the "Jewish" Sitcom|year=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3211-6|pages=237–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the tenure of Rhoda Morgenstern's character being featured on ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', her “Jewish-ness” was discussed on several episodes. Such episodes included: "Some of My Best Friends are Rhoda" from which the subject of anti-Semitism was covered; “Enter Rhoda’s Parents” from which Rhoda’s parents renewed their wedding vows by a rabbi; and "A Girl's Best Mother Is Not Her Friend", in which Ida wanted to fix Mary up with an eligible bachelor, a man whom she'd deemed inappropriate for Rhoda, as he wasn't Jewish. This candid expression of “Jewish-ness” changed however when ''Rhoda'' was spun off in 1974. During the first season of ''Rhoda'', the representation of Rhoda Morgenstern altered from her parent show to fit a more mainstream audience: she was trimmer, more confident, and less “Jewish”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhoda and Mary—Love and Laughs|url=http://www.rhodaonline.com/articles_1974_time.htm|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=December 15, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051808/http://www.rhodaonline.com/articles_1974_time.htm|archivedate=April 26, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the first season, there were scant references about Rhoda's “Jewish-ness”.

Moreover, there was even a Christmas episode with no mention of the character’s Jewish background entitled, "Guess What I Got You for the Holidays". Thus, the creation of Rhoda’s own series stifled the representation of “Jewish-ness” – as Charlotte Brown, the executive producer of ''Rhoda'', conveyed in an interview the display of “Jewish-ness”, “was just ‘set dressing’ – Ida’s brisket, her plastic on the furniture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brook|first=Vincent|title=Something Aint Kosher Here: The Rise of the "Jewish" Sitcom|year=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3211-6|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, although Harper and Walker achieved great popularity playing characters of the Jewish faith, in real life, neither actress was Jewish.

===Season 3 (1976–77)===
[[File:Rhoda photo4.JPG|thumb|170px|When Ida gets depressed, Brenda and Rhoda try to help.]]
In the first episode of the third season during a particularly dramatic scene Joe leaves Rhoda and the two remain separated for the entire season, with Groh appearing in only nine of the season's episodes. A few weeks later, they mutually agree to see a marriage counselor where Joe reveals to a stunned Rhoda that he had never wanted to be married, and that he married her only because she had pressured him into it after he had invited her to live with him.

Audiences were equally stunned and deserted the program in droves. Although the producers believed the plot development was essential, the fan response to Rhoda and Joe's separation was overwhelmingly negative and hostile. CBS was inundated with thousands of angry letters protesting the plot development, "Rhoda" and "Joe" received sympathy cards and letters of condolence, with Groh later reporting that he had received [[hate mail]] for as much as a year after the season had ended.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' February 15, 2008 "David Groh of 'Rhoda' Dies at 68"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sally Jesse Raphael Show'', Rhoda reunion episode, May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment would translate into a steep ratings decline during the course of the season and the show ranked #32 for the 1976–77 season (falling from #7 the year before). Though Ida appears in the opening episode ("The Separation"), both she and Martin are absent for the remainder of the season, explained as traveling across the country in an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]]. (At this time, Nancy Walker departed the program to headline two short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series: ''[[The Nancy Walker Show]]'',  and ''[[Blansky's Beauties]]''; and Harold Gould left to star in his own show, ''[[The Feather and Father Gang]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].) To help fill in the void left by Walker and Gould, the producers hired comedian [[Anne Meara]] as Rhoda's new friend, Sally Gallagher, a middle-aged divorcee who makes her living as an airline stewardess. Meara did not catch on with viewers and her character lasted only one season.

With Rhoda and Joe now separated, they soon move out of their apartment. Joe moves to another building while Rhoda trades apartments with downstairs neighbor Gary Levy ([[Ron Silver]]), a jean-store owner who soon strikes up a platonic friendship with Rhoda. Stories initially center on Rhoda and Joe's attempts to work through their differences. As the season progresses, however, Joe is seen less frequently and Rhoda begins dating other people. Ultimately, they never reconcile and Joe is never seen again after this season. Johnny Venture ([[Michael Delano|Michael DeLano]]), a lounge singer, becomes a frequent suitor that Rhoda only barely tolerates. Meanwhile, Brenda, no longer overweight but still with self-esteem problems, finally finds a boyfriend in professional roller-skater and toll-booth worker Benny Goodwin ([[Ray Buktenica]]), whose principal claim to fame is the similarity of his name to the famous musician [[Benny Goodman]]. She also occasionally dates neighbor Gary Levy as well as continuing her casual relationship with immature accordion player Nick Lobo.

===Season 4 (1977–78)===
[[File:Valerie Harper Kenneth McMillan Nancy Walker Rhoda 1977.JPG|thumb|180px|Ida takes a job at the costume store where Rhoda works.]]
For the fourth season, Rhoda's divorce is finalized and she resumes use of her maiden name "Morgenstern" full-time (from this point on, her ex-husband, Joe Gerard, as well as Rhoda's friend from the previous season, Sally Gallagher, are never referred to nor are their names ever mentioned again). The show then centers on her role as a thirty-something divorcée, dating from time to time. Ida and Martin come home after a year's absence from their lengthy cross-country trip (in reality, both Nancy Walker's and Harold Gould's attempts at a new series the previous year had failed&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Les. ''The New York Times Encyclopedia of Television''. Times Books, 1977. pg. 364&lt;/ref&gt;).

Brenda continues to date Gary Levy and Benny Goodwin, one more than the other. Meanwhile, Rhoda's career is undergoing a transition. Seeking a career change, she finds a job at the Doyle Costume Company. There she works for the gruff Jack Doyle ([[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]]), a man with similarities to [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]]. Season 4 ranked higher than season 3 in the ratings (finishing at #25 for the year), but ''Rhoda'' never regained the popularity it had achieved during its first two seasons on television.

===Season 5 (September–December 1978)===
In September, 1978, the show underwent additional changes for the fifth and final season. Rhoda sported a new longer frizzy-permed hairstyle, which she kept pulled back in a small ponytail for most of the season. Ida and Martin go through a separation of their own; Martin then goes to [[Florida]] to find himself. He returns after several episodes but Ida wants to be wooed back, leading to dating and other romantic rituals between the two. Brenda and Benny get engaged to be married, with their wedding planned for later in the season (though this would ultimately not happen, due to ''Rhoda'''s abrupt mid-season cancellation). Gary Levy does not return for this season; it is mentioned near the season's start episode 3 that he has moved to [[Chicago]]. A new co-worker, Tina Molinari (Nancy Lane), joins Rhoda and Jack at the costume shop, having appeared in several season 4 episodes as an employee at Gary's jeans store.

At this time, the series, along with the [[Norman Lear]] sitcom ''[[Good Times]]'', was moved to Saturday nights, with ''Rhoda'' airing at 8:00 P.M. and ''Good Times'' being shown at 8:30 P.M. Competing against NBC's popular police series ''[[CHiPs]]'', the ratings for both programs declined drastically. ''Rhoda'' was canceled by [[CBS]] in December 1978—midway through its fifth season—with four episodes remaining unaired, though these episodes later aired in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. It ended its final year ranking at #95&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvratingsguide.com/2017/07/1978-79-top-30-ratings-abc-enjoys.html&lt;/ref&gt; out of 114 shows. ''Good Times'' was pulled from the CBS schedule in December and returned in the spring of 1979 on Wednesday nights at 8:30 P.M. It finished out its sixth season, but its ratings did not improve, with the show ranked at #94. Within a few months, it, too, was canceled by CBS.

==''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' tie-ins==
* Nancy Walker and Harold Gould originated their roles as Rhoda's parents on ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''. In the second-season episode ("A Girl's Best Mother Is Not Her Friend"), Ida visits Rhoda in Minneapolis. Rhoda's sister and brother, Brenda and Arnold, are casually referred to in this installment. It is also mentioned that Brenda lives in Chicago. In the fourth season (1973–74), Mary and Rhoda travel to New York City for the wedding of Rhoda's sister Debbie (played by [[Liberty Williams]] — a role that Julie Kavner originally auditioned for). Comedienne [[Brett Somers]] also makes an appearance in this episode as Rhoda's Aunt Rose. Brenda and Arnold are not seen or referred to.
* During the first three seasons of ''Rhoda'', the closing credits show Rhoda crossing Broadway and Seventh Avenue in Times Square and attempting to emulate her friend Mary Richards by tossing her hat in the air, only to drop it. She then picks up the hat, pulls it down onto her head, and walks away slightly embarrassed.
* Mary Richards is featured in or referred to in seven episodes of ''Rhoda'':
# Mary accompanies Rhoda to the airport for her flight to New York City in the series premiere episode "Joe" (September 9, 1974). This scene is shown prior to the opening credits, and was removed from U.S. syndication, as well as the Season One DVD release. However, it was shown when [[MeTV]] broadcast the episode in 2013.
# Mary is mentioned in the second episode of the first season when Rhoda first moves into Brenda's apartment, and again when Rhoda is talking to her on the phone when in her old bedroom at Ida and Martin's apartment in the Bronx. (September 16, 1974)
# Rhoda phones Mary to announce she and Joe are getting married at the end of the Season 1 episode "Pop Goes the Question" (October 14, 1974).
# Mary (along with Lou Grant, Murray Slaughter, Georgette Franklin and Phyllis Lindstrom) appear in the hour-long episode "Rhoda's Wedding" (October 28, 1974).
# A letter from Mary is referenced in the Season 1 episode "Everything I Have is Yours, Almost" (January 27, 1975).
# Mary surprises Rhoda and Joe with an unannounced visit in the last episode of Season 1, "Along Comes Mary" (March 10, 1975).
# Rhoda phones Mary seeking advice and comfort when it finally becomes clear to her that her marriage to Joe is coming to an end in "The Ultimatum" (January 30, 1977).

* Rhoda and Joe are featured together on ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' episode "Mary Richards Falls in Love" (November 22, 1975).
* In episode 165 ("Mary's Three Husbands") of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', in a future fantasy sequence, an elderly Mary receives a postcard from Rhoda, which states she is "still waiting for Joe to come back." (February 26, 1977)
* Rhoda appeared in the series finale of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', "[[The Last Show (The Mary Tyler Moore Show)|The Last Show]]" (March 19, 1977).
* A recently divorced Rhoda Morgenstern-Rousseau, along with her adult daughter, Meredith, is reunited with the recently widowed Mary Richards-Cronin, along with her adult daughter, Rose, after many years of estrangement in the made-for-TV movie ''[[Mary and Rhoda]]'' (February 7, 2000).

==Animated spin-off and cast reunions==
An animated TV pilot titled ''[[Carlton Your Doorman]]'', a proposed spin-off of the Carlton, the doorman character (voiced by Lorenzo Music), was broadcast May 21, 1980 on [[CBS]]. Although the episode won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]], it was never picked up by the network as a series.

Despite never having reunited in-character on a TV special or movie, some of the cast members of ''Rhoda'' have gotten together over the years on the following daytime talk-shows:

* On November 21, 1984, Valerie Harper, Julie Kavner and Nancy Walker reunited to reminisce about the series on the syndicated ''[[Hour Magazine (TV series)|Hour Magazine]]'' (with [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]]) in which they hosted a week-long series dedicated to TV reunion shows.
* In May 1996, Valerie Harper, David Groh and Harold Gould (with a voice-over cameo from Lorenzo Music as Carlton, the Doorman) reunited on ''[[Sally (1983 TV series)|Sally Jessy Raphael]]'' to talk about the show's best moments as reruns of ''Rhoda'' began airing on ''[[Nick at Nite]]''. Author Julius C. Burnett (author of "Rhoda Revisited"; see below) also appeared briefly in the segment. Interesting episodic facts from Burnett's book were used during a voiceover at the beginning of each episode of ''Nick at Nite''{{'}}s reruns of the series.

===DVD releases===
On April 21, 2009, [[Shout! Factory]] released the first season of ''Rhoda'' on DVD in Region 1, which was the year of the show's 35th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rhoda-Season-2/12962 |title=Rhoda DVD news: Date Change for Rhoda—Season 2 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226123304/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Rhoda-Season-2/12962 |archivedate=2012-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The release also includes a "Remembering Rhoda" featurette, as well as the original one-hour version of "Rhoda's Wedding", as opposed to the two-part edited version that aired in syndication. 15 of the season's 24 episodes are the edited-for-syndication versions taken from poor quality masters, while the other 9 episodes (including the Wedding episode) are the unedited network versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/rhodaseason1dvdreview.html |title=Sitcoms Online—Rhoda—Season One—35th Anniversary Edition DVD Review |publisher=Sitcomsonline.com |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review on DVDTalk also states some of the edited episodes being time compressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/36977/rhoda-season-one-35th-anniversary-edition/ |title=Rhoda—Season One—35th Anniversary Edition : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the series premiere in the DVD set is the syndicated version, Mary Tyler Moore's appearance at the beginning of the episode is not included.

[[File:RingmasterAtaydeFeria09.JPG|thumb|A Ringmaster of the Circus Atayde at the Feria de Hidalgo 2009 in Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico]]
A '''ringmaster''' or '''ringmistress''', or sometimes a '''ringleader''', is a significant performer in the many [[circus|circuses]]. Most often seen in traditional circuses, the ringmaster is a [[master of ceremonies]] that introduces the circus acts to the audience.

==Duties and functions==
A ringmaster introduces the various [[Circus skills|acts]] in a circus show and guides the audience through the experience, directing their attention to the various areas of the circus arena and helping to link the acts together while equipment is brought into and removed from the circus ring. A ringmaster may interact with some acts, especially the clown acts, to make the various acts part of a seamless circus performance. Ringmasters have become an integral part of the many circus shows and sometimes will be involved in elements of some of the acts performances. 

It is traditionally the ringmaster's job to use [[hyperbole]] whenever possible while introducing the acts to enhance the expectations of the audience. Declarations of the "biggest", "most dangerous", "amazing", "spectacular" and similar expressions are common.

A ringmaster is traditionally attired in a bright tailcoat, often red with gold trim and with a top hat. The outfit is designed to look like an 18th-century gentleman's riding habit, and often includes a whip, a relic of when the ringmaster directed the performance, not as an announcer and host but as director of the many equestrian acts. It is generally accepted that this costume was first adopted by [[George Claude Lockhart]] on the orders of [[Bertram Mills]] in 1928, when Lockhart worked as ringmaster for his circus at [[Olympia (London)|Olympia, London]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Doyen of Ringmasters," Don Stacey, "World's Fair," 1979&lt;/ref&gt;  A female circus leader is known as a ringmistress, and often wears a red skirt and knee-high black boots, and either the same topcoat and tails as a ringmaster or a blouse.&lt;ref name="Ringmistress"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/search?q=ringmistress&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N5q1U-jxEtS2yASyxIHwBA&amp;ved=0CBwQsAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=962|title=Google Image Search|accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-English speaking countries the ring master is known by different titles. In France he is called "Monsieur Loyal" after the Anselme-Pierre Loyal (1753-1826), one of the first renowned circus personalities.

In 2008, Koyamada and Lyte started developing a [[comic book]] story with an comic book illustrator and writer Travis Moore, who later illustrated for [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]]'', ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[Titan (DC Comics)|Titan]]'', ''[[The Green Team (comics)|The Green Team]]'', ''[[Sword of Sorcery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Travis |url=http://www.comics.org/issue/930802/ |title=Laizen Comics:  The Dreamhoppers #1 |publisher=[[Laizen Comics]] |date=2009 |accessdate=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Travis |url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/sword-of-sorcery-2012/sword-of-sorcery-4 |title=DC Comics: SWORD OF SORCERY #4 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |date=January 23, 2013 |accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Travis |url=http://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/wonder-woman-odyssey-vol-2-0 |title=DC Comics: WONDER WOMAN: ODYSSEY VOL. 2  |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |date=February 6, 2013 |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Travis |url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/freedom-fighters-2010/freedom-fighters-2 |title=DC Comics:  FREEDOM FIGHTERS #2 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, they established a comic book company called [[Laizen Comics]] to produce and publish its first American comic book titled ''[[The Dreamhoppers]]'' (2009), an action adventure about the supernatural powers given to certain people known as Dreamhoppers.

In [[folklore]], a '''simpleton''' is a person whose foolish actions are the subject of often-repeated stories. Simpletons are also known as '''noodles''', '''fools''', and '''gothamites'''.  Folklore often holds, with no basis in fact, that certain towns or countries are thought to be home to large numbers of simpletons. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] told tales of stupid populations in [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] and other cities; in [[Germany]], men of [[Schilda]] are conspicuous in these stories; in [[Spain]] hundreds of jokes exist about the supposed foolishness of the people from [[Lepe]]; and in [[England]], the village of [[Gotham, Nottinghamshire|Gotham]] in Nottinghamshire is reputed to be populated by simpletons. In [[Sri Lanka]] whole districts in the central, southern, and western provinces are credited with being the abode of foolish people.&lt;ref name='Noodles'&gt;{{cite book | last = Clouston | first = W. A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Book of Noodles: Stories of Simpletons; or, Fools and Their Follies | publisher = Elliot Stock | date = 1888 | location = London | pages = | url = http://sacred-texts.com/etc/bon/index.htm | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tales of simpleton behavior have often been collected into books, and early joke books include many simpleton jokes. In ancient Greece, [[Philogelos|Hierokles]] created such a collection. In England, the famous ''[[Joe Miller (actor)|Joe Miller's Jests]]'' is highly inclusive of simpleton jokes. In Britain the Irish are often stereotyped as stupid&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Miller's Jests|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40127/40127-h/40127-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worstall|first=Tim|title=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/01/03/it-would-have-to-be-the-irish-newspapers-trying-something-insanely-stupid-like-charging-for-links-to-websites/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cantwell|first=Billy|title=Irish Echo|url=http://www.irishecho.com.au/2011/07/17/comment-time-for-the-stupid-irish-joke-to-be-laid-to-rest/11036}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and are the butt of [[An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]] jokes. Books of simpleton tales exist in [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Ireland]], [[Turkey]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Sicily]], and [[India]].&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt; 

Simpleton tales are huge in number, but many of them share the same notions of simple-minded behavior. Many are repeated, with altered names, settings, characters, etc., in language after language and collection after collection. 

A very old such tale from England is&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a man of Gotham that rode to the market with two bushels of wheat, and because his horse should not be damaged by carrying too great a burden, he was determined to carry the corn himself upon his own neck, and still kept riding upon his horse till he arrived at the end of his journey. Now I will leave you to judge which was the wisest, his horse or himself.&lt;ref name='Gotham'&gt;{{cite book | last = Halliwell | first = James Orchard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Merry Tales of the Wise Men of Gotham | publisher = John Russell Smith | date = 1840 | location = London | pages = | url = http://www.presscom.co.uk/gotham.html | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A famous one from ancient Greece is&lt;blockquote&gt;A man's father having died, the son dutifully took the body to the embalmers. When he returned at the appointed time to take it, there happened to be a number of bodies in the same place, so he was asked if his father had any peculiarity by which his body might be recognised, and the simpleton replied, "He had a cough."&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was a commercial hit in the [[UK]] in winter/spring 1995, reaching No. 5 on the singles chart, while it peaked in the US at No. 49 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].

==Background and release==
Produced by [[Masters at Work]] member Kenny "Dope" Gonzalez, and featuring samples from [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s "Street Player" from their 1979 album ''[[Chicago 13]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whosampled.com/sample/67/The-Bucketheads-The-Bomb!-(These-Sounds-Fall-Into-My-Mind)-Chicago-Street-Player/&lt;/ref&gt; the subtitle of the song is a [[mondegreen]]; the actual lyrics taken from the sample are ''"Street sounds swirling through my mind..."''

==Critical reception==
Charles Aaron from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' described the song as "More than a Box novelty, "The Bomb!" is essential '90s funk, a house party on the last car of the D to the A train winding its way from Brooklyn up to Manhattan's disco meat-packing district with conductor Kenny "Dope" Gonzalez mixing electro, hip-hop, house, and Chicago (the group)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=XBPGqtlp_kUC&amp;pg=PA116|title=Singles Review|last=Aaron|first=Charles|date=March 1996|accessdate=March 15, 2018|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The music video for "The Bomb!" was directed by [[Guy Ritchie]] and [[Alex De Rakoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mvdbase.com/video.php?id=4650|title=the Bucketheads: The bomb!

==Impact and legacy==
''[[Mixmag]]'' ranked the song number 60 in its '''100 Greatest Dance Singles Of All Time''' list in 1996, adding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A quarter of an hour's worth of mirrorball mayhem, Kenny 'Dope' Gonzales' The Bomb is the ultimate disco cutup track. Shatteringly simple, the genius of The Bomb lies in the way it builds up your anticipation with a protracted burst of hard jacking drums and atonal honking before the perfect disco sample soars away into the distance. A massive hit when Positiva licensed it in early 1995, The Bomb kick-started the trend for raiding old disco 12s. Dozens of producers followed its lead, but none of them ever equalled the definitive original article."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ravehistory.homestead.com/100greatest.html|title=The 100 Greatest Dance Singles of All Time|publisher=ravehistory.homestead.com|date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Worst of Hollywood''''' was a [[1983 in television|1983]] television series presented by [[Michael Medved]] and screened on [[Channel 4]].

==Overview==
Following the success of his ''Golden Turkey Awards'' books Medved had become a popular guest on British TV chat shows. The series screened late on a Friday night in what became established as Channel 4's slot for 'post pub television'. In each programme, Medved would introduce that week's [[B movie]] with a comedic lecture to a studio audience pointing out flaws in the film and relating funny stories about the production. This format contrasted with the established 'high art' approach to presenting cinema of the [[BBC]] channels. Following a commercial break, the film would be shown with humorous subtitles and captions pointing up poor special effects and dialogue.

===Films featured===
The featured films were:

*''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''
*''[[The Creeping Terror]]''
*''[[The Wild Women of Wongo]]''
*''[[They Saved Hitler's Brain]]'' 
*''[[Mars Needs Women]]'' 
*''[[Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster]]''
*''[[The Thing With Two Heads]]''
*''[[Eegah]]'' 
*''[[Robot Monster]]''
*''[[Santa Claus Conquers the Martians]]'' - the Christmas edition

After the film, Medved would return with a short summary concluding each week with ''..the worst is yet to come''.

Medved's opening lectures usually followed the line that there was only a narrow distinction between critically panned films such as these and the types of films Hollywood continued to produce.

==Production==
The series was produced by [[Stephen Woolley]], with the opening lectures being filmed at the Scala Cinema he owned and managed. The commercial breaks usually featured adverts for cult films being distributed by Woolley's Palace Video.

==Clive James' documentary==
The ten-week run was preceded by a one-hour documentary presented by [[Clive James]], who was already established as Channel 4's critic in residence and featuring Medved as an expert. The documentary included clips from more cult and underground films that UK television could not screen at that time.

==Legacy==
The popularity of the series encouraged the Channel to embrace programming more [[Cult film]] and commission similar late night strands presented by [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]].

[[Image:春日神社ー篠山ー翁奉納P1011774.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Noh]] is one of the four major types of Japanese theatre.]]

Traditional [[Japan]]ese [[theatre]] includes [[Kabuki]], [[Noh]] (and its comic accompaniment, [[Kyōgen]]) and the puppet theatre, [[Bunraku]].

==Traditional forms of Theatre==

===Noh and Kyogen===
The early existing [[Kyogen]] scripts date from the 15th century. Kyogen was used as an intermission between [[Noh]] acts—it linked the theme of the Noh play with the modern world by means of farce and slapstick. Noh played to the high level class, but there were occasions where Noh was performed for common audiences. Unlike Noh, the performers of Kyogen do not wear [[mask]]s, unless their role calls for physical transformation. Although they were both very popular forms of theatre, commoners were often in higher attendance for Kyogen performances.

Both men and women were allowed to perform Kyogen until 1430.

===Kabuki===
The best known form of Japanese theatre is [[Kabuki]]. It combines music, drama, and dance. Its fame comes from the wild costumes and sword fights employed in this form (until the 1680s, real swords were used). Kabuki grew out of opposition to Noh — dramatists wanted to shock the audience with more lively and timely stories. It is told to have been first performed by Okunis in 1603. Like Noh, however, Kabuki also became a stylized, regimented art form and is still performed in the same fashion.

As a matter of interest, the popular Gekidan Shinkansen, a theatrical troupe based in [[Tokyo]] today, insists it follows pure kabuki tradition by performing historical roles in a modern, noisy, and outlandish way characteristic of this theatrical method. Whether or not they represent traditional kabuki, however, remains a matter of debate and personal opinion.

===Bunraku===
Puppets and [[Bunraku]] were used in Japanese theatre as early as the Noh plays. [[History of Japan|Medieval]] records prove the use of puppets actually in Noh plays. The puppets were 3- to 4-foot-tall ({{convert|3|to|5|ft|disp=output only}}) dolls manipulated by puppeteers in full view of the audience. The puppeteers controlling the legs and hands are dressed entirely in black, while the head puppeteer is wearing colorful clothing. Music and chanting is a popular convention of bunraku, and the [[shamisen]] player is usually considered to be the leader of the production as well as the one with the shortest hair.

==Modern Theatre==
Japanese modern drama in the early 20th century, the 1900s, consisted of [[Shingeki]] (experimental Western-style theatre), which employed naturalistic acting and contemporary themes in contrast to the stylized conventions of Kabuki and Noh. [[Hōgetsu Shimamura]] and [[Kaoru Osanai]] were two figures influential in the development of shingeki.

In the postwar period, there was a phenomenal growth in creative new dramatic works, which introduced fresh aesthetic concepts that revolutionized the orthodox modern theatre. Challenging the realistic, psychological drama focused on "tragic historical progress" of the Western-derived shingeki, young playwrights broke with such accepted tenets as conventional stage space, placing their action in tents, streets, and open areas and, at the extreme, in scenes played out all over Tokyo.

Plots became increasingly complex, with play-within-a-play sequences, moving rapidly back and forth in time, and intermingling reality with fantasy. Dramatic structure was fragmented, with the focus on the performer, who often used a variety of masks to reflect different personae.

Playwrights returned to common stage devices perfected in Noh and Kabuki to project their ideas, such as employing a [[narrator]], who could also use [[English language|English]] for international audiences. Major playwrights in the 1980s were [[Kara Juro]], [[Shimizu Kunio]], and [[Betsuyaku Minoru]], all closely connected to specific [[wiktionary:troupe|companies]]. In contrast, the fiercely independent [[Murai Shimako]] won awards throughout the world for her numerous works focusing on the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|Hiroshima bombing]], which were frequently performed by only one or two actresses. In the 1980s, [[stagecraft]] was refined into a more sophisticated, complex format than in the earlier postwar experiments but lacked their bold critical spirit.

[[Tadashi Suzuki]] developed a unique method of performer training which integrated [[avant-garde]] concepts with classical Noh and Kabuki devices, an approach that became a major creative force in Japanese and international theatre in the 1980s. Another highly original East-West fusion occurred in the inspired production [[Nastasya]], taken from [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky's]] ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'', in which [[Bando Tamasaburo]], a famed Kabuki [[onnagata]] (female impersonator), played the roles of both the prince and his fiancée.

===Sho-Gekijo===
The 1980s also encouraged the creation of the Sho-Gekijo, literally ''little theatre''. This usually meant amateur theatrical troupes making plays designed to be seen by anyone and everyone&amp;nbsp;— not necessarily as meaningful in nature as they were simply entertaining. Some of the more philosophical playwrights and directors of that time are [[Hideki Noda|Noda Hideki]] and [[Shōji Kōkami]].

Popular sho-gekijo theatrical troupes include Nylon 100, Gekidan Shinkansen, [[Tokyo Sunshine Boys]], and Halaholo Shangrila.

Recently, new generation of Sho-Gekijo artists who are labeled as the "Generation of the Lost Decade" or the "Generation of 2000s" are emerging. Principal artists among this generation are: Toshiki Okada, Shiro Maeda, Kuro Tanino, Daisuke Miura, Tomohiro Maekawa and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facts-about-japan.com/theater.html Facts about Japan: Japanese Theater]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western plays in Japan===
Many Western plays, from those of the [[Ancient Greek theatre]] to [[William Shakespeare]] and from those of Fyodor Dostoevsky to [[Samuel Beckett]], are performed in Tokyo. A large number of performances, perhaps as many as 3,000, are given each year, making Tokyo one of the world's leading theatrical centers.

The opening of the replica of the [[Globe Theatre]] was celebrated by importing an entire British company to perform all of Shakespeare's historical plays, while other Tokyo theatres produced other Shakespearean plays including various new interpretations of ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]''. The Globe Theatre, located in [[Shin-Ōkubo Station|Shin-Ōkubo]] in Tokyo, now belongs mostly to [[Johnny's Entertainment]] and the promotion of [[Japanese idol|pop idols]] in the acting field.

[[Yukio Ninagawa]] is an internationally known Japanese director and playwright who often turns to elements of Shakespeare for inspiration. In 1995 he performed the "Shakespeare Tenpo 12Nen", an interpretation of the wildly popular British theatre ''Shakespeare Condensed'': all of Shakespeare's plays in two hours. Famous actors such as [[Natsuki Mari]] and [[Karawa Toshiaki]] were involved.

'''''Thrillville: Off the Rails''''' is a [[theme park]] [[simulation video game]] developed by [[Frontier Developments]] and published by [[LucasArts]]. It is the sequel to the 2006 game ''[[Thrillville]]''. It was released in North America in October 2007.

==Gameplay==
Like the original game, ''Thrillville: Off The Rails'' is a strategy and simulation game about being the park manager of all of the Thrillville theme parks. The game allows the placing and deletion of attractions and buildings such as flat rides, food and drink stalls, bathrooms, games, and also contains various minigames to play both in the park and in the game's "Party Play" mode, along with editing and allowing the players to ride their own roller coasters inside each of the Thrillville theme parks.

''Thrillville: Off The Rails'' introduces whoa coaster elements that can be added to coasters while building. They are various tricks and effects that can add to the Thrill level of a coaster.

While the Nintendo DS version of ''Thrillville: Off The Rails'' contains only 7 minigames, the versions for all other consoles contain over 40 minigames. The roller coaster editor is similar to that of the ''[[Roller Coaster Tycoon]]'' series, but all coasters have to start in assigned areas in each of the park's various zones. If the assigned missions are completed in each park, then the player receives thrill points. If enough thrill points are gained, the player can move to the next park manager level.

The {{Nihongo|'''Tokyo Disney Resort'''|東京ディズニーリゾート|Tōkyō Dizunī Rizōto}} is a [[theme park]] and vacation resort located in [[Urayasu]], [[Chiba prefecture|Chiba]], Japan, just east of [[Tokyo]]. It is owned and operated by [[the Oriental Land Company]] with a license from [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The resort opened on April 15, 1983, as a single theme park ([[Tokyo Disneyland]]), but developed into a resort with two theme parks, four Disney hotels, six non-Disney hotels, and a shopping complex. Tokyo Disneyland was the first Disney theme park opened outside the United States.

==Attractions==
[[Image:The Map of Tokyo Disney Resort (English).jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Tokyo Disney Resort]]
Tokyo Disney Resort has three main entertainment sections: [[Tokyo Disneyland]], [[Tokyo DisneySea]], and [[Ikspiari]], which is a variation of the [[Downtown Disney]] and [[Disney Springs]] shopping, dining, and entertainment areas found at the Disney resorts in [[Disneyland Resort|Anaheim]] and [[Walt Disney World Resort|Lake Buena Vista]] respectively. It also contains [[Bon Voyage! (shop)|Bon Voyage!]], which is the official Disney goods specialty shop of Tokyo Disney Resort.

Like the other Disney resorts, the Tokyo Disney Resort has several Disney-branded hotels; the resort's Deluxe Hotels are the Disney Ambassador Hotel, the Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta (the building in which the entrance to Tokyo DisneySea is located), and the Tokyo Disneyland Hotel. There are six other hotels located on the Tokyo Disney Resort property. These, however, are not Disney-branded hotels and are owned by other companies, similar to the Hotel Plaza Boulevard hotels at [[Walt Disney World]].

All facilities are linked by [[Disney Resort Line]] monorail. Two Disney branded Value Hotels, Tokyo Disney Celebration Hotel - Wish and Tokyo Disney Celebration Hotel - Discover, opened in 2016 a short distance away from the resort and are linked by Disney shuttles. The Tokyo Disney Resort is headed by [[Toshio Kagami]], who is the secretary general (CEO) of the Oriental Land Company.

==Theme parks==
* '''[[Tokyo Disneyland]]''', first theme park built at the resort. Tokyo Disneyland opened on April 15, 1983 and is based on its sister parks in [[Disneyland|Anaheim, California]], and [[Walt Disney World|Bay Lake, Florida]].
* '''[[Tokyo DisneySea]]''', second theme park to open at the resort.  Tokyo DisneySea opened on September 4, 2001.  The park has a theme of nautical exploration, adventure, and different lands.

}}
'''''Twenty-One''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[game show]] originally hosted by [[Jack Barry (game show host)|Jack Barry]] which aired on [[NBC]] from 1956 to 1958. Produced by [[Barry &amp; Enright Productions|Jack Barry-Dan Enright Productions]], the program became notorious for being a [[1950s quiz show scandals|rigged quiz show]] which nearly caused the demise of the entire genre in the wake of [[United States Senate]] investigations. The 1994 movie ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' is based on these events. A new version aired in 2000 with [[Maury Povich]] hosting, lasting about four months, again on NBC.

==Gameplay==
Two contestants, typically a returning champion and a challenger, entered separate isolation booths and donned pairs of headphones. Due to the arrangement of the booths and the studio lighting, the contestants could not see or hear each other or the audience. At any given moment during the game, one booth would be "open," meaning that the occupant could hear the host in the headphones and be heard by him through the booth's microphone. The other booth would be "closed," with its microphone disabled and the headphones playing music so that the occupant could not hear the game.

The game was played in rounds, with Barry announcing the category for each round as it was dispensed from a machine on his podium; there were over 100 possible categories. The challenger played first in each round, with their booth open and the champion's closed, and selected the point value (1 to 11) they wanted to attempt. Higher-value questions were more difficult, and questions often had several parts. If the challenger answered correctly, the points were added to their score; a miss subtracted the points, but the score could never go below zero. The challenger's booth was then closed and the champion's opened so they could take a turn. Barry did not tell either contestant about the other's score or performance.

The goal was to earn a total of 21 points. If the challenger reached this score first, their booth was left open to hear the champion's turn, but they were cautioned not to speak or give away any information. Barry did not tell the champion that the challenger had already reached 21 unless the champion asked for a question that would give him or her 21 points if answered correctly. If the champion failed to match that score, the challenger won. The champion won by reaching 21 first on their own turn. If a round ended in a 21–21 tie, the scores were erased and a new game was played. Contestants were given extra time to think on any question that would bring them up to 21.

After two rounds, both booths were opened and the contestants were given a chance to stop the game. If either of them asked to do so, the contestant in the lead was declared the winner. The game was automatically stopped after five rounds.

The winner of the game received $500 per point in the margin of victory (e.g., a 21–15 win paid $3,000). Whenever a game ended in a tie, the stakes were raised by $500 per point and a new game was played. If the champion won, they could choose to leave the show with all winnings intact or play again, basing this decision on a small amount of information about the next challenger. However, if the challenger won, their winnings for that game were paid out of the defeated champion's total.

===2000 version===
Questions were still worth 1 to 11 points, but all main-game questions were multiple-choice, with no "multiple-part" questions. Questions worth 6 or fewer points had one correct answer out of three choices. Questions worth 7 to 10 points had one correct answer out of four choices; for 10-point questions, "None of the above" was an option. Questions worth 11 points had ''two'' correct answers out of five, and both were required.

Incorrect answers no longer deducted points from a contestant's score. Instead, contestants received a strike for each incorrect response; accumulating three strikes resulted in an automatic loss. This rule change meant that games could end without a winner, as the rounds again were played to completion. If one contestant had struck out on their turn and the second contestant had two strikes, they could also lose the game on an incorrect answer. However, a contestant did not know how their opponent had struck out unless explicitly told by the host.&lt;ref name="note"&gt;A mistake occurred during an early episode wherein Povich informed the second contestant that his opponent had lost and that all he had to do now was answer a single question to win the game. The contestant promptly requested and successfully answered a 1-point question (the easiest question possible), accompanied by the applause of the audience and a clear expression of chagrin and horror on Povich's face as he realized the mistake he had made (as he was not supposed to say anything until after the question choice was made). Immediately after a commercial break, Povich acknowledged his mistake in revealing to the contestant that his opponent had already lost, but explained that the only effect had been essentially to give a "gift" to that contestant since his opponent had already lost the game and was not affected by the mistake.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each contestant could call for a "Second Chance" once per game, allowing an opportunity to receive help from a friend or family member before answering. An incorrect response on a Second Chance penalized the contestant with two strikes instead of one. If the challenger struck out, and the champion had either one or two strikes and had not yet used their Second Chance, the round was played to completion since they could still strike out.

Games were still played to a maximum of five rounds, and beginning with the second episode, contestants had the option to stop the game after the second round if neither had reached 21. If time ran out during a game and at least two complete rounds had been played, the contestant in the lead was declared the winner and advanced to the Perfect 21 bonus round at the beginning of the next episode.

Unlike the 1950s version, if the game ended in a tie, no new game was played. Instead, the contestants would be asked one question, and the first contestant to ring-in got to answer. If right, he or she won the game and went on to play the bonus round; an incorrect answer gave the opponent a chance to respond. If both contestants missed the question, a new one was asked.

====Payoff====
Losing challengers received $1,000 as a consolation prize. Rather than receiving a dollar value multiplied by the point difference after winning each game, champions received progressively larger amounts for each opponent defeated. Originally, the payoff structure was as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!style="width:94px"|Game number
!style="width:65px"|Prize
|-
| 1
| $100,000
|-
| 2
| $200,000
|-
| 3
| $300,000
|-
| 4
| $400,000
|}

These amounts accumulated, so winning four games would be worth $1,000,000. After winning a fourth game, the contestant started the chain again at $100,000 for defeating a fifth opponent, $200,000 for defeating a sixth, and so on.

After a few early episodes, the prize ladder changed to the following:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!style="width:94px"|Game number
!style="width:65px"|Prize
|-
| 1
| $25,000
|-
| 2
| $50,000
|-
| 3
| $100,000
|-
| 4
| $250,000
|-
| 5
| $500,000
|-
| 6
| $750,000
|-
| 7
| $1,000,000
|}

These amounts accumulated, so winning seven games would be worth at least $2,675,000. As before, any contestant who defeated a seventh opponent started from the beginning of the chain.

When the rules changed, the returning champion had won one game and $100,000 in his appearance on the final show under the old prize structure. Instead of being "grandfathered" under the old prize structure, he played and won his second game for $250,000 (the next amount after $100,000), and played but lost his third game for $500,000.

Under both prize structures, champions remained on the show until being defeated, and new champions' winnings were not deducted from the totals of dethroned ones.

====Contestant selection====
During the first six episodes, the audience chose the winner's next opponent. The audience would be presented with two potential challengers to face the current champion, and the audience would vote for an opponent using keypads. The person who received the higher vote played against the champion; the other person would be one of the two potential challengers to be voted on for the next game. In the first episode, there were three potential opponents to face the champion. After the sixth episode, the process was changed to a random selection. At the beginning of the show, six potential challengers would be introduced, and would be selected randomly from that group for each new game. People who had not been selected by the end of the show were not guaranteed to return on the following show, although some people did appear on the show multiple times before being selected to play.

====Bonus round: Perfect 21====
The champion was asked a maximum of six true/false questions in a single category, starting at one point and increasing by one per question to a maximum value of six. After any correct answer, the champion could stop playing and receive $10,000 per point; an incorrect answer ended the round and forfeited this money. Correctly answering all six questions won the top prize of $210,000.

===Big winners===
Under the first payoff structure, Rahim Oberholtzer was the biggest winner, collecting $1,120,000 (at the time, the all-time game show winnings record) over four victories, three of which were due to his opponents striking out.

David Legler won $1,765,000 over six wins with the new payout structure. Legler was the top winner of American game shows until 2001 and is now the [[American game show winnings records|seventh-highest winner from an American television game show]].

==Broadcast history==
''Twenty-One'' was originally conceived by host [[Jack Barry (game show host)|Jack Barry]] and producing partner [[Dan Enright]] as a weekly half-hour program for [[CBS]]' 1956–1957 schedule. The show was ultimately picked up by [[NBC]], and ran from September 12, 1956 to October 17, 1958, under the sponsorship of Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the makers of [[Geritol]]. The series finished at #21 in the [[Nielsen ratings]] for the 1957–1958 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Lange]] hosted a pilot for an abandoned syndicated revival of the show in 1982.

NBC revived the show in 2000 with [[Maury Povich]] as host, after ABC's ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', FOX's ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', and CBS' ''[[Winning Lines (U.S. game show)|Winning Lines]]'' proved big-money game shows had once again become viable prime-time network fare. NBC aired first-run episodes through the end of May sweeps, after which the network declined to renew the series. Several unaired episodes aired on [[ion Television|PAX TV]] in the summer of 2000.

===Scandal===
{{See also|1950s quiz show scandals}}

The initial broadcast of ''Twenty-One'' was played honestly, with no manipulation of the game by the producers. That broadcast was, in the words of producer [[Dan Enright]], "a dismal failure"; the first two contestants succeeded only in making a mockery of the format by showing how little they really knew. Show sponsor [[Geritol]], upon seeing this opening-night performance, reportedly became furious with the results, and said in no uncertain terms that they did not want to see a repeat performance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The end result: ''Twenty-One'' was not merely "fixed", it was almost completely choreographed. Contestants were cast almost as if they were actors, and in fact were active and (usually) willing partners in the deception.  They were given instruction as to how to dress, what to say to the host, when to say it, what questions to answer, what questions to miss, even when to mop their brows in their isolation booths (which had air conditioning that could be cut off at will, to make them sweat more).

====Charles Van Doren====
[[File:Twenty-One-Barry-Van-Doren-1957.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Charles Van Doren]] in the isolation booth on the quiz show ''Twenty-One'', with host [[Jack Barry (game show host)|Jack Barry]] (1957)]]
[[Charles Van Doren]], a college professor, was introduced as a contestant on ''Twenty-One'' on November 28, 1956, as a challenger to then-champion [[Herbert Stempel]], a dominant contestant, though somewhat unpopular with viewers and eventually the sponsor. Van Doren and Stempel ultimately played to a series of four 21–21 games, with audience interest building with each passing week and each new game, until finally the clean-cut, "[[All-America|All American]] Boy" newcomer was able to outlast his bookish, quasi-intellectual opponent, who at one point after the game was referred to backstage as a "freak with a sponge memory". The film ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' depicts the turning point as coming on a question directed to Stempel: "What motion picture won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] [for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Motion Picture]]]&lt;!--Award was called Best Motion Picture in 1955, not Best Picture.--&gt; for [[27th Academy Awards|1955]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMkL4LKb8AU#t=10m36s|title=Twenty-One - Stemple [sic] - Van Doren Episode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stempel legitimately knew the answer to that question was ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', as it was one of his favorite films. The producers ordered him to answer the question with [[26th Academy Awards|1954]]'s Best Motion Picture winner, ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.
Stempel later recalled that there was a moment in the booth when his conscience and sense of fair play warred with his sense of obligation and that he almost disrupted the scripted outcome by giving the correct answer. Stempel answered incorrectly as he was instructed, but redeemed himself by staying in the game and earning enough points to tie Van Doren's score, unlike the depiction of events in ''Quiz Show''. Stempel was finally defeated in the next game, with Van Doren leading: the surviving [[kinescope]] of the broadcast shows Stempel failing to come up with the title of [[William Allen White]]'s August 15, 1896, editorial in the ''[[Emporia Gazette]]'', "What's the Matter with Kansas?" After the missed question, Van Doren quit with 18 points, which was enough to win. Van Doren's victory began one of the longest and most storied runs of any champion in the history of television game shows. Van Doren's popularity soared as a result of his success on ''Twenty-One'', earning him a place on the cover of [[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]] and even a regular feature spot on NBC's [[Today (NBC program)|''Today'']] show; at one point, the program even surpassed [[CBS]]' ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' in the ratings. He was finally unseated as champion by Vivienne Wax Nearing (1926–2007) on March 11, 1957, after winning a total of $129,000 (the equivalent of ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|129,000|1957}}}} today).

In the meantime Stempel, disgruntled over being ordered to "take a dive", attempted to blow the whistle on what exactly was going on behind the scenes at ''Twenty-One'', even going so far as to have a federal investigator look into the show. Initially, little came of these investigations and Stempel's accusations were dismissed as jealousy because there was no hard evidence to back up his claims. While a congressional investigation did affect ''Twenty-One'' during this period, the investigation in question was the [[HUAC]] hearings into possible Communists in entertainment; the show's director, [[Charles S. Dubin]], was fired by NBC in June 1958, after he refused to answer whether he ever had been part of the Communist party.&lt;ref name="ousted"&gt;Associated Press. "Director of '21' ousted after Un-American probe," ''Abilene Reporter-News'', June 19, 1958, page 7A.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1958 ''[[Dotto]]'', a popular [[CBS]] daytime game show, was abruptly canceled after a contestant found a notebook containing the answers to every question that was to be asked to the show's current champion, future journalist [[Marie Winn]]. Stempel's allegations about ''Twenty-One'' began to gain credibility. A grand jury was convened in Autumn 1958 to investigate ''Dotto'' and other possible game show fixing, investigated by Joseph Stone, assistant New York district attorney. Stone says in his book ''Prime Time and Misdemeanors'' that question writer Glorianne Rader was instructed by Dan Enright and associate producer Al Freedman, who had chosen the categories for the next broadcast earlier in the week, to place them in Barry's dispensing machine a few minutes before airtime; this was done to avoid any slipups in the planned outcome. Stone reached out to former contestants of ''Twenty-One'', including one Richard Jackman. Jackman, asked by Enright if he would tell the truth if approached by Stone, said that he would confess to the fixing of ''Twenty-One''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande04.html|title=The American Experience {{!}} Quiz Show Scandal {{!}} People &amp; Events {{!}} Dan Enright|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after Jackman confessed to Stone,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and without advance public warning, ''Twenty-One'' was canceled after its broadcast of October 17, 1958, amid plummeting ratings. A nighttime version of ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]]'' took over its time slot the following week.

Further eroding Barry and Enright's claims of honesty, another former contestant, James Snodgrass, came forward with corroborating proof the show was rigged: in a series of registered letters he had mailed to himself, Snodgrass documented each and every answer he was coached on prior to air time and testified to the fact in front of Congress in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6555|title="A Make-Believe World": Contestants Testify to Deceptive Quiz Show Practices|date=|publisher=Historymatters.gmu.edu|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal forced producers Barry and Enright into virtual exile.  Barry would not host another national TV show for more than a decade, and Enright moved to [[Canada]] to continue his production career.

====Aftermath====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].--&gt;
The scandal also caused the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to mandate the sale of Barry-Enright's [[radio]] station in [[Hollywood, Florida]], [[WLQY|WGMA]] (now WLQY). The station was purchased by its general manager, C. Edward Little, who promptly affiliated the station with the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]. After serving for a time as the head of Mutual's affiliates association, Little became the president of Mutual from 1972–79. During this time Little created the [[Mutual Black Network]], the first U.S. broadcast network catering exclusively to African-Americans, in addition to the Mutual Spanish Network and the Mutual Southwest Network. Under Little's administration, Mutual became the first commercial broadcasting entity to use [[satellite]] technology for program delivery. During his tenure as head of Mutual, Little hired [[Larry King]] to host an all-night phone-in talk show Little had created. King was a one-time announcer for Little at WGMA. King, who had previously hosted a similar morning show on Miami radio station WIOD, went on to national fame on both radio and television, winning a coveted [[Peabody Award]] along the way.

Jack Barry finally returned to game show hosting in 1969, succeeding [[Dennis Wholey]] on ABC's ''[[The Generation Gap]]'' for which he publicly thanked the producers and ABC-TV for giving him a chance for a comeback. In 1971, he sold ABC his first new game show ''[[The Reel Game]]'' which he also hosted. It ran for 13 weeks. He became a success again as a producer-host with ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', which ran on CBS from 1972–1975 and in syndication from 1977–1986 (Barry died in May 1984 and was replaced by [[Bill Cullen]] for the final two years). Enright would work as ''Joker''{{'}}s executive producer in the final year on CBS, and the two revived their partnership full-time in 1976, reviving ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]]'' which also ran until 1986. It was revived once more in 1990, but was cancelled after a few months. Enright died in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/24/us/dan-enright-74-tv-producer-was-figure-in-quiz-show-scandal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982 Pilot===
A pilot was made in 1982 with [[Jim Lange]] as host and [[Charlie O'Donnell]] announcing, but was not picked up.  In this pilot, a bonus round was introduced; the bonus round consisted of a flashing randomizer showing numbers from 1 to 11.  The contestant would decided whether he/she wanted the number, or wanted the computer to take it, with the object of the game to either score 21 exactly first (or be closest to 21 without going over), or get the computer to bust by going over 21.  Doing so won $2,000 and a trip.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdzmDa3VWDc&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the computer hit 17 or more, its score froze for the rest of the game; this rule did not apply to the contestant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdzmDa3VWDc&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000===
A second attempt actually made it to air when NBC, in the wake of the success of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', revived the tainted quiz show on January 9, 2000. The new version was produced by Phil Gurin and [[Fred Silverman]]. The rules of this version, hosted by [[Maury Povich]] (and announced by [[John Cramer (announcer)|John Cramer]]), were somewhat different from those of the 1950s version. It was taped at NBC Studios, stage 1 in Burbank, the longtime studio of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Licensed merchandise==
A board game based on the original 1956–58 version was released by Lowell in 1957.

A paperback quiz book featuring 1–11 point questions in each of the 45 categories was released by Pyramid in 1958.

==International versions==
''Twenty-One'' is one of only three Barry–Enright game shows known to have foreign adaptations, the others being ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]]'' and ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]]''.

'''Valentine Augustus Walker''' (15 February 1890 – 17 March 1969) (also known as Val A Walker and Val Enson&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Valentine_Augustus_Walker MagicPedia&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[England|English]] [[Magician (illusion)|magician]], [[Escapology|escape artist]] and illusion designer. He was born in Moseley, [[Birmingham]] to Joseph Walker, a landscape gardener, and his wife Emma. Val Walker worked as an electrical apparatus maker,&lt;ref&gt;1911 Census - 64 Grantham Road, Sparkbrook, Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt; later serving in the [[Royal Navy]] and was billed as the "Wizard of the Navy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{VG Industry}}
'''Video game preservation''' is a form of [[digital preservation]] applied to the [[video game industry]]. Such preservation efforts include archiving development [[source code]] and art assets, digital copies of video games, [[Video game console emulator|emulation of video game hardware]], maintenance and preservation of specialized video game hardware such as [[arcade game]]s and [[video game console]]s, and digitization of print video game magazines and books prior to the [[Digital Revolution]].

==Importance of preservation==
Unlike most other forms of media like books, art and photography, and film which can preserved in a variety of formats that are not ladened with intellectual property (IP) issue, video games typically require specialized and/or proprietary computer hardware and software to read and execute game software. However, as technology advances, these older game systems become [[obsolescence|obsolete]], no longer produced nor maintained to use for executing games.&lt;ref name="pvw fr"/&gt; The media formats of the early days of computer gaming, relying on [[floppy discs]] and [[CD-ROM]]s, sufferes from [[disc rot]] and degrade over time, making it difficult to recover information.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/video-game-preservation-movement-1.3937421 | title = Preserving video game history is about more than nostalgia | first = Jonathan | last = Ore | date = January 17, 2017 | accessdate = August 15, 2018 | work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, video games tend to rely on other resources like operating systems, network connectivity, and external servers outside control of users, and making sure these boundary aspects to a video game are preserved along with the game are also essential.&lt;ref name="pvw fr"/&gt;

One period of the video game industry that has received a great deal of attention is up through the 1980's. As a result of the [[video game crash of 1983]], many companies involved in developing games folded or were acquired by other companies. In this process, the source code for many games prior to the crash were lost or destroyed, leaving only previously-sold copies of games on their original format as evidence of their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://globalnews.ca/news/4383441/retro-game-preservation-in-limbo-after-nintendo-files-lawsuit/ | title = Retro game preservation in limbo after Nintendo files lawsuit | first=  Christopher | last = Whan | date = August 12, 2018 | accessdate = August 14, 2018 | work = [[Global News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Most issues related to video game preservation are based on the United States, one of the largest markets for video games, and as such, issues related to preservation are limited by laws of the country.

In general, the copying and distribution of video games that are under copyright without authorization is considered a copyright violation (often called as software piracy). However, it has generally been allowed that users make may archival copies of software (including video games) as long as they own the original software; if the user sells or destroys the original software, they are expected to destroy the archival copies. This is also justification for a person being able to make [[ROM image]]s from game cartridges that they own.

In 1998, the United Congress passed the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), designed to bring copyright within the United States to align with two doctrines published by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] in 1996. The DMCA make it a criminal offense to develop, sell, or use technologies that are designed to bypass [[digital rights management]] (DRM) used in various forms of media. This subsequently made it illegal to backup up one's software for many games distributed via either game cartridge or optical disc, if some form of DRM was used to limit access to the software on the media.

The [[Library of Congress]] is responsible to open submissions for specific and narrow exemptions from interested parties every three years, and determine which of those, if any, to grant. Through the Library of Congress, some key exceptions to the DMCA have been granted to allow for video game preservation.
* In the 2003 set of exemptions, the Library disallowed enforcement of the DMCA for "computer programs protected by dongles that prevent access due to malfunction or damage and which are obsolete" and for "computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and which require the original media or hardware as a condition of access".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2003/index.html | title = Rulemaking on Exemptions from Prohibition on Circumvention of Technological Measures that Control Access to Copyrighted Works | publisher = [[United States Library of Congress]] | date = October 28, 2003 | accessdate = March 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 2015 exemptions, the Library granted permission for preservationists to work around copy-protection in games which required an authentication step with an external server that was no longer online prior to playing the game which otherwise did not require online connectivity; this specifically did not cover games that were based on a server-client mode like most [[massively-multiplayer online games]] (MMOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/27/9622066/jailbreak-unlocked-tablet-smart-tvs-dmca-exemption-library-of-congress | title = US government says it's now okay to jailbreak your tablet and smart TV | first = Nick | last = Statt | date = October 27, 2015 | accessdate = October 26, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 2018 exemptions, the Library allowed for preservation and fair use of server-based games like MMos, permitting preservationists to offer such games where they have legally obtained the game's code within museums and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/329440/The_Library_of_Congress_just_made_game_preservation_a_little_bit_easier.php  | title = The Library of Congress just made game preservation a little bit easier | first=  Chris | last = Kerr | date = October 26, 2018 | accessdate = October 26, 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DMCA exemptions do not mean all ROM images are legal, and concern about continuing video game preservation was raised in mid-2018, after Nintendo initiated a lawsuit against two website that distributed ROMs for games from their older platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/in-defense-of-roms-a-solution-to-dying-games-and-broke-1828340811|title=In Defense of ROMs, A Solution To Dying Games And Broken Copyright Laws|first=Chris|last=Kohler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation of video game software==

===Emulation===
[[Video game console emulator]]s use software that replicates the hardware of a video game console or arcade machine. Generally these create a [[virtual machine]] on newer computer systems that simulate the key processing units of the original hardware. The emulators then can read in software, such as a [[ROM image]] for arcade games or cartridge-based systems, or the game's optical media disc or an [[ISO image]] of that disc, to play the game in full.  

Emulation has been used in some official capacity on newer consoles. Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] allows games from its earlier consoles and other third-parties to be played on its newer ones. Sony had originally released the [[PlayStation 3]] with backwards compatibility with [[PlayStation 1]] and [[PlayStation 2]] games if players had the original media, but have transitions to both selling emulated games in its [[PlayStation Store]], as well as offering the [[PlayStation Now]] [[cloud gaming]] service that allows PlayStation 3 games to be played on other devices including the [[PlayStation 4]] and compatible personal computers. Microsoft has created a [[List of Xbox 360 games compatible with Xbox One|backwards compatibility program]] through emulation to allow selected [[Xbox 360]] titles to be played on the [[Xbox One]] if they own the original game and have made some of these titles available for purchase through [[Xbox Live]]. Former console hardware companies like [[Sega]] and [[Atari]] have released emulation-based collections of their games for multiple systems.

In personal computer space, there are also emulators that emulate either a game engine or a full operating system.  In these cases, players are expected to own copies of the game to use the content files to support emulation. [[DOSBox]] emulates a complete [[IBM PC compatible]] operating system within modern operating systems, allowing most games for older computers to be run on modern systems. Emulators also exist for older [[arcade game]]s, such as [[MAME]].

There are legalities related to emulation that can make it difficult to preserve video games in this manner. First, the legalities of creating an emulator itself are unclear. Several United States case laws have shown that developing emulations is a legal activity, if done in a [[Clean room design|clean room]] fashion so that no proprietary information or copyrighted code is incorporated into the emulation. 

===Migration===
Migration refers to rereleasing software from one platform to a newer platform, otherwise keeping all the gameplay, narrative, and art assets the same. This can be done through a few routes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/147/209 | title = Keeping the Game Alive: Evaluating Strategies for the Preservation of Console Video Games | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year =2010 | first1 = Mark  | last1 = Guttenbrunner | first2 =  Christoph | last2=  Becker | first3 = Andreas | last3  = Rauber | journal = The International Journal of Digital Curation | doi = 10.2218/ijdc.v5i1.144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Game engine recreation: A new universal game engine can be developed that uses the original game assets but otherwise runs on any future hardware platform.  Such examples include the [[Z-machine]] for many of the [[Infocom]] text adventure games, and the [[ScummVM]] allows players to run nearly every [[LucasArts adventure games|LucasArts adventure game]].
* Software re-compilation or porting: The original source code for the game is re-compiled for a newer platform, making necessary changes to work on the newer hardware. This requires that the source code for the original game is available for this purpose.

===Abandonware===
[[Abandonware]] refers to software that may still be capable of running on modern computers or consoles, but the developer or publisher has either disappeared, no longer sell the product, or no longer operate servers necessary for running the software, among other cases. 

Legally, such software still falls under normal copyright laws. Under the DMCA, the Copyright Office has made exceptions since 2015 for allowing museums and other archivists to bypass copyright issues to get such software into a playable state, a new exception seeks to allow this specifically for multiplayer games requiring servers, specifically [[massively-multiplayer online game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/308428/US_govt_stands_by_DMCA_exemption_for_museums_preserving_online_games.php|title=U.S. gov't stands by DMCA exemption for museums preserving online games|first=Alex|last=Wawro|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fan-driven efforts===
In some cases, fans of a video game have helped to preserve the game to the best of their abilities without access to source code, even through the copyright nature of these fan projects are highly contentious, and moreos when monetary issues are involved. Games like ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II]]'' and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines]]'', which had difficult production issues before release, may leave unused assets to be found by players, and in the case of both these games, players have developed unofficial patches that work to complete the content, in some cases, exceeding expectations of the original content creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/14/how-fan-based-projects-are-helping-preserve-video-games-history | title = How Fan-Based Projegts Are Helping Preserve Video Game History | date = October 14, 2018 | accessdate = October 17, 2018 | first =Leah | last = Williams | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation efforts==
===Library of Congress===
The [[United States Library of Congress]] (LoC) launched the [[National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program]] (NDIIPP) in 2000 to preserve non-traditional media. Around 2007, the LoC started reaching out to partners in various industries to help explore how they archive such content. The LoC had funded the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] (UIUC) from 2004 to 2010 to develop the ECHO DEPository ("Exploring Collaborations to Harvest Objects in a Digital Environment for Preservation") program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/13595|title=The Web Archives Workbench (WAW) Tool Suite: Taking an Archival Approach to the Preservation of Web Content|first1=Hswe,|last1=Patricia|first2=Kaczmarek, Joanne|last2=S.|first3=Houser,|last3=Leah|first4=Eke,|last4=Janet|date=7 October 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preserving Virtual Worlds ====
Preserving Virtual Worlds was one project funded by the LoC and conducted by the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Maryland]], and the
[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], along with support from [[Linden Lab]], running from 2008 to 2010. The study explored a range of games, from ''[[Spacewar!]]'' (1962) through ''[[Second Life]]'' (2003, which was developed by Linden Labs), to determine what methods could be used for preserving this titles. The project concluded while there are technical solutions for preservation of game software, such as identify common formats for digital storage and developing database architectures to track ownership, many issues related to preservation remain legal in nature relating to copyright laws.&lt;ref name="pvw fr"&gt;{{cite report | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2142/17097 | title = Preserving Virtual Worlds Final Report | authors = McDonough, Jerome P.; Olendorf, Robert; Kirschenbaum, Matthew; Kraus, Kari; Reside, Doug; Donahue, Rachel; Phelps, Andrew; Egert, Christopher; Lowood, Henry; Rojo, Susan | date = August 31, 2010 | accessdate =August 23, 2018 | publisher = [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet Archive===
The [[Internet Archive]] started adding emulation of video games from older systems for play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/microcomputer-software-lives-again-this-time-in-your-browser/|title=Microcomputer Software Lives Again, This Time in Your Browser - Internet Archive Blogs|website=blog.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archive developed Emularity, a web-browser based emulator to run a number of out-of-production arcade, console and computer emulations, and offer numerous titles to be played through the Archive. The project's maintainer, Jason Scott, said that most companies do not take issue with their ROM images being offered in this manner, but did note that Nintendo has put pressure on them to not include any Nintendo consoles within the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/can-a-digital-lending-library-solve-classic-gamings-piracy-problem/ | title = ROM sites are falling, but a legal loophole could save game emulation | first= Kyle | last = Orland | date = August 21, 2018 | accessdate = August 21, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.archive.org/2018/09/21/over-1100-new-arcade-machines-added-to-the-internet-arcade/ | title = Over 1,100 New Arcade Machines Added to the Internet Arcade | first = Jason | last =Scott | date = September 24, 2018 | accessdate = September 24, 2018 | work = [[The Internet Archive]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video Game History Foundation===
{{main|Video Game History Foundation}}
[[Frank Cifaldi]] is one of the leading historians in the video game industry trying to encourage more video game preservation and to help recover games once thought lost. By 2017, he had spent about twenty years trying to encourage preservation as to track video game history, and established the non-profit Video Game History Foundation in 2017. The Foundation not only seeks to preserve games, but box art, manuals, and promotional material from video games, believing that these combined can help future historians understand the culture of games in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/27/14752708/inside-the-video-game-history-foundation | title = Inside The Video Game History Foundation | first = Mitch | last = Bowman | date =February 27, 2017 | accessdate = August 14, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/new-non-profit-has-plans-to-save-gamings-past-1792795768 | title = New Non-Profit Has Plans To Save Gaming's Past | first= Heather | last=  Alexander | date = February 27, 2017 | accessdate = August 14, 2018 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Strong Institute===
Among other educational aspects [[The Strong]] institute in [[Rochester, New York]] operates the [[International Center for the History of Electronic Games]].&lt;ref name="cbc"/&gt;

=== Game Preservation Society ===
Founded in 2011 in [[Tokyo]], the Game Preservation Society preserves the history of [[Video gaming in Japan|Japanese video games]]. The organization's focus is the preservation of 1980s Japanese computer games for platforms like the [[PC-8800 series|PC-88]] and [[Sharp X1]]. The society's president, French national Joseph Redon, estimates that they will only be able to preserve about 80% of Japanese computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/saving-japans-games-1819339226|title=Saving Japan's Games|last=Kohler|first=Chris|date=December 28, 2017|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Software Reference Library ===
While strictly not set up for preservation, the [[National Software Reference Library]], created and maintained by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has included a number of popular game software among other software principally used for help in digital forensics, storing electronic copies of these games and other programs. The initial games collection was added in 2016 with numerous titles collected by Stephen Cabrinety, who had died in 1995;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2016/09/digital-forensics-rescues-retro-video-games-and-software | title = Digital Forensics Rescues Retro Video Games and Software | date = September 12, 2016 | accessdate = September 10, 2018 | publisher =[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2018, Valve, Activision-Blizzard, and Electronic Arts all donated additional titles to be added to the collection, while NIST itself purchased other popular titles to include.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-09-11-nist-adds-gaming-software-to-national-software-reference-library | title = NIST adds gaming software to National Software Reference Library | first = Rebekah | last = Valentine | date = September 10, 2018 | accessdate = September 10, 2018 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rereleases===
Companies like [[GOG.com]] and [[Night Dive Studios]] are recognized for helping to migrate older games to modern systems. Among their efforts include doing the research to track down all legal rights that are associated with a game, including those that have changed hands several times, as to get clearance or rights to republish the title, locate as much of the game's original source code and adapt that to work on modern systems, or when source code is not available, reverse engine the game to either work natively or through emulation (like [[DOSBox]]) with modern hardware. GOG.com and Night Dive have successfully freed some games from IP limbo, such as ''[[System Shock 2]]'', while identifying titles that remain difficult to republish and preserve legally due to conflicts on IP rights holders, such as ''[[No One Lives Forever]]''.
