'''A-004''' was the sixth and final test of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] launch escape vehicle and the first flight of a Block I production-type [[Apollo Command/Service Module]].

==Objectives==

'''Mission A-004''' was unmanned and was conducted to demonstrate that 
# The launch escape vehicle would satisfactorily orient and stabilize itself in the proper attitude after being subjected to a high rate of tumbling during the powered phase of an abort
# The escape vehicle would maintain its structural integrity under test conditions in which the command module structure was loaded to the design limit.

The launch vehicle was the fifth and final [[Little Joe II]] flown. The propulsion system consisted of four Algol and five Recruit rocket motors. The attitude control system was similar to the one used on mission A-003 except that the reaction control system was deleted and the vehicle was provided with the capability of responding to a radio-transmitted pitch up command. The 
pitch up maneuver was required to help initiate tumbling of the launch vehicle. The spacecraft for this mission consisted of a modified Block I command and service module [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]], BP-2, and a modified Block I [[launch escape system]] (airframe 002). The center of gravity and thrust vector were changed to assure that power-on tumbling would be attained after abort initiation. The earth landing system was essentially the same as that used during Pad Abort Test 2.

==Flight==

The vehicle was launched on January 20, 1966, at 08:17:01 a.m. MST (15:17:01 UTC) after several postponements due to technical difficulties and adverse weather conditions. The pitch up maneuver was commanded from the ground when telemetry showed that the desired altitude and velocity conditions had been reached. The planned abort was automatically initiated 2.9 seconds later. The launch escape vehicle tumbled immediately after abort initiation. Pitch and yaw rates reached peak values of 160 degrees per second, and roll rates reached a peak of minus 70 degrees per second. The launch escape system canard surfaces deployed at the proper time and stabilized the command module with the aft heat shield forward after the escape vehicle had tumbled about four times. Tower jettison and operation of the earth landing systems were normal, and the command module landed about 113,620 feet (34.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the launch pad after having reached a maximum altitude of 78,180 feet (23.8&amp;nbsp;km) above mean sea level.

All systems performed satisfactorily, and the dynamic loads and structural response values were within the design limits and predicted values. Although a structural loading value of primary interest was not achieved (local differential pressure between the interior and exterior of the command module wall), all test objectives were satisfied.

== Boilerplate location==
The boilerplate spacecraft is currently on display at the [[Cradle of Aviation Museum|Cradle of Aviation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cradleofaviation.org/history/permanent_exhibits/exploring_space/rockwell_command_module_002.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106070723/http://www.cradleofaviation.org/history/permanent_exhibits/exploring_space/rockwell_command_module_002.html |archivedate=2014-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antevs Glacier''' ({{Coord|67|19|S|66|49|W|display=inline,title}}), also known as '''North Heim Glacier''', is a [[glacier]] on [[Arrowsmith Peninsula]], [[Graham Land]], flowing north between [[Seue Peaks]] and [[Boyle Mountains]] into [[Muller Ice Shelf]], [[Lallemand Fjord]]. It was named by the [[United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] in 1960 after [[Ernst Antevs|Ernst V. Antevs]], American glacial geologist.

The '''Association for Behavior Analysis International''' ('''ABAI''') is a nonprofit organization dedicated to contributing to the well being of society by developing, enhancing, and supporting the growth of the science of [[applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]] through research, education, and practice. ABAI has over 7,000 members. It is committed to promoting the experimental, theoretical, and applied analysis of behavior.

==History==

The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) was founded in 1974 as the MidWestern Association for Behavior Analysis (MABA) to serve as an interdisciplinary group of professionals, paraprofessionals, and students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;(1978) ''The Behavior Analyst, 1''(1)&lt;/ref&gt; MABA was organized to establish a separate identity for the behavior analysis group of the larger psychological community and to provide a forum for the discussion of issues and the dissemination of information pertinent to the interests of its membership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first annual conference was a response by a group of behavior analysts who were having problems presenting their work at psychology conferences and other related events.&lt;ref name= "Trends In Presentations"&gt;Kangas, B.D. &amp; Vaidya, M. (2007). Trends in presentations at the annual conference of the association for behavior analysis. Behavioral Analysis, 30, 2, 117-131&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the members included [[Sidney Bijou]], James Dinsmoor, Bill Hopkins, and Roger Ulrich. The first headquarters were located on the campus of Western Michigan University (WMU) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The association changed its name to the Association for Behavior Analysis in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;(1979) ''The Behavior Analyst, 2''(2)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the headquarters were moved off WMU's campus. In 2008, the association relocated to nearby Portage, Michigan (where it is today), and added "International" to its name.&lt;ref name= "The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science"&gt;Craighead, W.E. &amp; Nemeroff, C.B. (2004). Association for Behavior Analysis. In The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science. (3rd ed., pp. 87-88) Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Today ABAI has more than 7,000 active members worldwide.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Membership"&gt;http://www.abainternational.org/membership.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One can obtain an ABAI membership if they want to further education, practice, and research goals in [[behavior analysis]].

==Membership==

ABAI offers different membership levels. A full membership is available for those who have a master's degree in experiential or applied behavior analysis or have contributed to the field of behavior analysis. An affiliate membership is feasible for those with undergraduate degrees, have an interest in behavior analysis, and do not meet the criteria for a full membership. A student membership is offered to anyone who is a full-time undergraduate or graduate student, resident, or intern.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Membership" /&gt;

==Impact==

ABAI is the leading advocate in the United States for advances in behavior analysis and behavioral psychology in applied settings. The association provides support to the Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis (SABA), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that grants funding for continuing research. ABAI is a member of the Federation of Behavioral, Psychological, and Cognitive Sciences (FABBS)—a group of scientific organizations that are interested in advancing science in areas of the brain, mind, and behavior.

ABAI organizes an annual convention dedicated to the advancements in the science of behavior analysis. More than 5,100 behavior analysts come to participate in workshops, poster sessions, “round-table” discussions, symposia, and listen to speakers. In 2017, ABAI will be hosting their 43rd Annual Convention in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Annual Convention" &gt;https://www.abainternational.org/events/annual-2017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Past host cities for the convention have included Chicago, San Antonio, Seattle, and other. Every two years, ABAI hosts an international conference; the last one took place in 2017 in Paris, France.&lt;ref name= "ABAI International Conference" &gt;https://www.abainternational.org/events/international-2017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The ABAI international conference has also been held in Japan, Spain, China, Australia, as well as many other places. The association also holds an annual autism conference; the 11th Annual Autism Conference will take place in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in January 2017.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Annual Conference" &gt;http://www.abainternational.org/events/autism-2017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ABAI has hosted many single-track conferences on topics of special interest to behavior analysts, such as theory and philosophy, climate change, behavioral economics, and education.&lt;ref name= "Past ABAI conferences" &gt;https://www.abainternational.org/events/archives.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ayurvedic acupressure''' (also known as '''Marma therapy''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=devQ27EpKTYC&amp;pg=PT449 | title=Principles and Practice of Manual Therapeutics | publisher=Elsevier | author=Coughlin, Patrick | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a particular kind of [[massage]] or an [[Alternative medical system|alternative medical treatment]], which integrates the knowledge of ancient [[Ayurveda]] and the principles of [[acupressure]], allegedly to completely heal and cure physical, mental, emotional and spiritual illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vF7OKOlH9vsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=marma+therapy+ayurveda&amp;ots=z3UZ97l9f9&amp;sig=0OGF0JxCBd-Hr4L3xP_wWrHhqzY#v=onepage&amp;q=marma%20therapy%20ayurveda&amp;f=false|title=Ayurveda and Marma Therapy: Energy Points in Yogic Healing|last=Frawley|first=David|last2=Ranade|first2=Subhash|last3=Lele|first3=Avinash|date=2003|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=9780940985599|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charaka Samhitā]], an early text on Ayurveda (Indian traditional medicine),  the cosmos and its correspondence – the human body, are composed of both physical (Visible) and metaphysical (Invisible) forces.

Ayurvedic acupressure talks about 10 elements – 5 physical and 5 metaphysical.

* 5 elements(not exactly elements but like forms of matter exists in our body and environment) or Panch Tatva: – Electricity or flow of charges(Not Space as it does not exist in our body and environment) , Air, Fire, Water and Earth.
* 5 metaphysical elements: – Time, Direction, Mind, Soul and Tam (Origin).

In Ayurveda the pressure points or the meridians are called Marma points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AJkWAQAACAAJ&amp;dq | title=Marma Points of Ayurveda | publisher=Ayurvedic Press | author=Vasant Lad, Anisha Durve}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are considered as energy points, just as Chinese refer them as pressure points, and they help in stimulating not only circulation, but also improve mental and emotional outlook. The Marma points are located throughout the body.

Treatment in Ayurvedic Acupressure can be easily done without needles by:
* Applying pressure with finger
* Seeds
* Magnets
* Colours 
The Acupressure shodh prashikshan evam upchar blakpipol sukh sansthan Allahabad is a non government organization working for the last 20 years in popularizing the Ayurvedic Acupressure

There are many branches of acupressure/acupuncture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3ewM81mmAngC&amp;dq | title=The Lost Secrets of Ayurvedic Acupuncture | publisher=Lotus Press, 1994 | author=Frank Ros}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as we know it today. They are

* [[Reflexology]] 
These are just some of the forms. The scope and theories of each are a bit different.

'''Bartrum Glacier''' ({{Coord|79|44|S|158|44|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a small steeply crevassed [[glacier]] in the [[Brown Hills]], flowing west between [[Bowling Green Plateau]] and [[Blank Peaks]]. It was mapped by the [[Victoria University of Wellington Antarctic Expedition]] (1962–63), and named after [[J.A. Bartrum]] (1885–1949), Professor of Geology at the [[University of Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].

'''Bergmann's rule''' is an [[ecogeographical rule]] that states that within a broadly distributed taxonomic [[clade]], populations and species of larger size are found in colder environments, and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions. Although originally formulated in terms of species within a genus, it has often been recast in terms of populations within a species. It is also often cast in terms of latitude. It is possible that the rule also applies to some plants, such as ''[[Rapicactus]]''.

The rule is named after nineteenth century [[Germany|German]] biologist [[Carl Bergmann (anatomist)|Carl Bergmann]], who described the pattern in 1847, although he was not the first to notice it. Bergmann's rule is most often applied to mammals and birds which are [[endotherm]]s, but some researchers have also found evidence for the rule in studies of [[ectothermic]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Miguel Á.  |last1=Olalla-Tárraga  |first2=Miguel Á.  |last2=Rodríguez  |first3=Bradford A.  |last3=Hawkins |year=2006 |title=Broad-scale patterns of body size in squamate reptiles of Europe and North America |journal=[[Journal of Biogeography]] |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=781–793 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01435.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01435.x/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timofeev2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Timofeev | first=S.

Larger-bodied animals tend to conform more closely to Bergmann's rule than smaller-bodied animals, at least up to certain latitudes. This perhaps reflects a reduced ability to avoid stressful environments, such as by burrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Freckleton | first1=Robert P. | last2=Harvey | first2=Paul H. | last3=Pagel | first3=Mark | year=2003 | title=Bergmann's rule and body size in mammals | jstor=10.1086/374346 | journal=The American Naturalist | volume=161 | issue=5| pages=821–825 | doi=10.1086/374346 | pmid=12858287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being a general pattern across space, Bergmann's rule has been reported in populations over historical and evolutionary time when exposed to varying thermal regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Smith | first1=Felia A. | last2=Betancourt | first2=Julio L. | last3=Brown | first3=James H. | date=December 22, 1995 | title=Evolution of Body Size in the Woodrat over the Past 25,000 Years of Climate Change | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/270/5244/2012 | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=270 | issue=5244| pages=2012–2014 | doi=10.1126/science.270.5244.2012 |bibcode=1995Sci...270.2012S |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Huey | first1=Raymond B. | last2=Gilchrist | first2=George W. | last3=Carlson | first3=Margen L. | last4=Berrigan | first4=David | last5=Serra | first5=Luı́s | date=January 14, 2000 | title=Rapid Evolution of a Geographic Cline in Size in an Introduced Fly | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/287/5451/308 | journal=Science | volume=287 | issue=5451| pages=308–309 | doi=10.1126/science.287.5451.308 | pmid=10634786 |bibcode=2000Sci...287..308H |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunt |first1=Gene | last2=Roy | first2=Kaustuv | date=January 31, 2006 | title=Climate change, body size evolution, and Cope's rule in deep-sea ostracodes |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/5/1347.full.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=1347–1352 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510550103 |pmid=16432187 |pmc=1360587 |bibcode=2006PNAS..103.1347H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, reversible dwarfing of mammals has been noted during two relatively brief upward excursions in temperature during the Paleogene: the [[Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum]]&lt;ref name="Secord2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Secord | first1=Ross | last2=Bloch | first2=Jonathan I. | last3=Chester | first3=Stephen G.

==Humans==
Human populations near the poles, including the [[Inuit]], [[Aleut people|Aleut]], and [[Sami people]], are on average heavier than populations from mid-latitudes, consistent with Bergmann's rule.&lt;ref name=humans&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Holliday | first1=Trenton  W. | last2=Hilton | first2=Charles E. | doi=10.1002/ajpa.21226 | title=Body proportions of circumpolar peoples as evidenced from skeletal data: Ipiutak and Tigara (Point Hope) versus Kodiak Island Inuit | journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume=142| pages=287–302 | date=June 2010 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21226/abstract |subscription=yes | pmid=19927367}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to have shorter limbs and broader trunks, consistent with [[Allen's rule]].&lt;ref name=humans/&gt; According to Marshall T. Newman in 1953, Native American populations are generally consistent with Bergmann's rule although the cold climate and small body size combination of the Eastern Eskimo, Canoe Indians, [[Yuki people]], [[Andes]] natives and [[Harrison Lake]] Lillouet runs contrary to the expectations of Bergmann's rule.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; Newman contends that Bergmann's rule holds for the populations of [[Eurasia]], but it does not hold for those of [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newman |first=Marshall T. |date=August 1953 |title=The Application of Ecological Rules to the Racial Anthropology of the Aboriginal New World |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |volume=55 |issue=3 |pp=311–327 |doi=10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020/abstract |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
[[File:Northern red fox &amp; southern desert red fox.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Bergmann's rule illustrated by [[red fox]]es from northern and southern populations]]

The earliest explanation, given by Bergmann when originally formulating the rule, is that larger animals have a lower [[Surface area to volume ratio#Biology|surface area to volume ratio]] than smaller animals, so they radiate less body heat per unit of mass, and therefore stay warmer in cold [[climate]]s. Warmer climates impose the opposite problem: body heat generated by metabolism needs to be dissipated quickly rather than stored within.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=James H. |first2=Anthony K. |last2=Lee |title=Bergmann's Rule and Climatic Adaptation in Woodrats (Neotoma) |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |date=January 1969 |pp=329–338 |jstor=2406795 |doi=10.2307/2406795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the higher surface area-to-volume ratio of smaller animals in hot and dry climates facilitates heat loss through the skin and helps cool the body. It is important to note that when analyzing Bergmann's Rule in the field that groups of populations being studied are of different thermal environments, and also have been separated long enough to genetically differentiate in response to these thermal conditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In marine [[crustacean]]s, it has been proposed that an increase in size with latitude is observed because decreasing temperature results in increased [[Cell (biology)|cell]] size and increased [[Longevity|life span]], both of which lead to an increase in maximum body size (continued growth throughout life is characteristic of crustaceans).&lt;ref name="Timofeev2001"/&gt; The size trend has been observed in [[Hyperiidae|hyperiid]] and [[gammarid]] [[amphipod]]s, [[copepod]]s, [[stomatopod]]s, [[mysid]]s, and planktonic [[euphausiid]]s, both in comparisons of related species as well as within widely distributed species.&lt;ref name="Timofeev2001"/&gt; [[Deep-sea gigantism]] is observed in some of the same groups, probably for the same reasons.&lt;ref name="Timofeev2001"/&gt;

== Hesse's rule==
In 1937 German zoologist and ecologist [[Richard Hesse]] proposed an extension of Bergmann's rule. Hesse's rule, also known as the heart–weight rule, states that species inhabiting colder climates have a larger heart in relation to body weight than closely related species inhabiting warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Criticism==
According to a study by [[Valerius Geist]] in 1986, Bergmann's rule is false: the correlation with temperature is spurious; instead, Geist found that body size is proportional to the duration of the annual productivity pulse, or food availability per animal during the growing season.&lt;ref name="Geist1987"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1139/z87-164| title=Bergmann's rule is invalid| journal=[[Canadian Journal of Zoology]]| volume=65| issue=4| pages=1035–1038| date=April 1987| last1=Geist | first1=Valerius |url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z87-164#.VjzRVLerRhE |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because many factors can affect body size, there are many critics of Bergmann's Rule. Some believe that latitude itself is a poor predictor of body mass. Examples of other selective factors that may contribute to body mass changes are the size of food items available, effects of body size on success as a [[predator]], effects of body size on vulnerability to predation, and resource availability. For example, if an organism is adapted to tolerate cold temperatures, it may also tolerate periods of food shortage, due to correlation between cold temperature and food scarcity.&lt;ref name="Ashton2000"/&gt; A larger organism can rely on its greater fat stores to provide the energy needed for survival as well being able to procreate for longer periods.

Resource availability is a major constraint on the overall success of many organisms. Resource scarcity can limit the total number of organisms in a habitat, and over time can also cause organisms to adapt by becoming smaller in body size. Resource availability thus becomes a modifying restraint on Bergmann’s Rule.&lt;ref name="Clauss2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00463.x| title=Bergmann′s rule in mammals: A cross-species interspecific pattern| journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=122| issue=10| pages=1465–1472| date=October 2013 | last1=Clauss | first1=Marcus | last2=Dittmann | first2=Marei T. | last3=Müller | first3=Dennis W.

==Plants==
Bergmann's rule cannot generally be applied to plants, above all for latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moles|first=Angela T.|last2=Warton|first2=David I.|last3=Warman|first3=Laura|last4=Swenson|first4=Nathan G.|last5=Laffan|first5=Shawn W.|last6=Zanne|first6=Amy E.|last7=Pitman|first7=Andy|last8=Hemmings|first8=Frank A.|last9=Leishman|first9=Michelle R.|date=2009-09-01|title=Global patterns in plant height|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01526.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Ecology|language=en|volume=97|issue=5|pages=923–932|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01526.x|issn=1365-2745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding [[Cactaceae]], the case of ''[[Carnegiea gigantea]]'', described as "a botanical Bergmann trend" by Niering, Whittaker, &amp; Lowe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Niering, W.A., Whittaker, R.H. &amp; Lowe, C.H.|first=|year=1963 |title=The saguaro: a population in relation to environment |journal=Science |volume=142 |pages=15–23 |doi=10.1126/science.142.3588.15|bibcode = 1963Sci...142...15N }}&lt;/ref&gt; has instead been shown to depend on rainfall, particularly winter precipitation, and not temperature, so Bergmann's rule is not applicable to ''Carnegiea'' populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drezner|first=Taly Dawn|date=2003-03-01|title=Revisiting Bergmann's rule for saguaros (Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.)

Since ''Rapicactus'' grow in a distributional area in which average precipitation tends to diminish at higher latitudes, and their body size is not conditioned by climatic variables, this could suggest a possible Bergmann trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donati|first=Davide |last2=Bianchi |first2=Claudia |last3=Pezz i|first3=Giovanna |last4=Conte |first4=Lucia|last5=Hofer|first5=Anton|last6=Chiarucci|first6=Alessandro |date=2016 |title=Biogeography and ecology of the genus Turbinicarpus (Cactaceae): environmental controls of taxa richness and morphology|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2016.1251504 |journal=Systematics and Biodiversity |volume= 15|issue=4 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1080/14772000.2016.1251504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5325">'''BioPAX''' (Biological Pathway Exchange) is a [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]-based
standard language to represent [[biological pathway]]s
at the molecular and cellular level. Its major use is to facilitate the exchange of pathway data.
Pathway data captures our understanding of biological processes, but
its rapid growth necessitates development of databases and computational tools to aid
interpretation. However, the current fragmentation of pathway information across many
databases with incompatible formats presents barriers to its effective use. BioPAX solves this
problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share.
BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and
gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX,
millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from a
growing number of sources, are available. Thus, large amounts of pathway data are available in a
computable form to support visualization, analysis and biological discovery.

It is supported by a variety of online databases (e.g. [[Reactome]]) and tools. The latest released version is BioPAX Level 3. There is also an effort to create a version of BioPAX as part of [[Open Biomedical Ontologies|OBO]].

==Governance and development==

The next version of BioPAX, Level 4, is being developed by a community of researchers. Development is coordinated by board of editors and facilitated by various BioPAX work groups.

[[SBPAX|Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX)]] is an extension for Level 3 and proposal for Level 4 to add quantitative data and [[systems biology]] terms (such as [[Systems Biology Ontology]]). SBPAX export has been implemented by the [[biological pathway|pathway]] databases [[Signaling Gateway (website)#Molecule Pages Database|Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages]]&lt;ref name="pmid21505029"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SABIO-Reaction Kinetics Database]]. SBPAX import has been implemented by the cellular modeling framework [[Virtual Cell]].

Other proposals for Level 4 include improved support for [[Semantic Web]], validation and visualization.

[[Image:Cauchy-equation-1.svg|thumb|Refractive index vs. wavelength for [[BK7 glass]]. Red crosses show measured values. Over the visible region (red shading), Cauchy's equation (blue line) agrees well with the measured refractive indices and the Sellmeier plot (green dashed line). It deviates in the ultraviolet and infrared regions.]]

'''Cauchy's equation''' is an [[empirical relationship]] between the [[refractive index]] and [[wavelength]] of light for a particular [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] material. It is named for the mathematician [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], who defined it in 1836.

==The equation==
The most general form of Cauchy's equation is

:&lt;math&gt; n(\lambda) = B + \frac {C}{\lambda^2} + \frac{D}{\lambda^4} + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the refractive index, λ is the wavelength, ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', etc.,  are [[coefficient]]s that can be determined for a material by fitting the equation to measured refractive indices at known wavelengths. The coefficients are usually quoted for λ as the [[vacuum wavelength]] in [[micrometre]]s.

Usually, it is sufficient to use a two-term form of the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; n(\lambda) = B + \frac{C}{\lambda^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients ''B'' and ''C'' are determined specifically for this form of the equation.

A table of coefficients for common optical materials is shown below:

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"
|'''Material''' || '''B''' || '''C''' (μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
|Fused silica || 1.4580 || 0.00354
|-
|Borosilicate glass BK7 || 1.5046 || 0.00420
|-
|Hard crown glass K5 || 1.5220 || 0.00459
|-
|Barium crown glass BaK4 || 1.5690 || 0.00531
|-
|Barium flint glass BaF10 || 1.6700 || 0.00743
|-
|Dense flint glass SF10 || 1.7280 || 0.01342
|}

The theory of light-matter interaction on which Cauchy based this equation was later found to be incorrect. In particular, the equation is only valid for regions of normal [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] in the [[Visible spectrum|visible wavelength]] region. In the [[infrared]], the equation becomes inaccurate, and it cannot represent regions of anomalous dispersion. Despite this, its mathematical simplicity makes it useful in some applications.

The [[Sellmeier equation]] is a later development of Cauchy's work that handles anomalously dispersive regions, and more accurately models a material's refractive index across the [[ultraviolet]], visible, and infrared spectrum.

'''Circular flow land use management''', or ''CircUse'', is a name for a particular process in which neglected land in [[urban area]]s is put to better uses. ''CircUse'' as a concept aims to be integrated with existing structures and uses, and is put into practice on a broad scale. The concept also looks to reduce the [[land consumption|consumption of un-built land]] through prioritizing inner development over outer development. In Germany the approach of circular flow land use management has been developed and tested by the German Institute for Urban Affairs (Deutsches Institut für Urbanistik) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs (BMVBS) and German Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR).

== Concept of Land Use ==
The concept of circular flow land use management can be described with the slogan “reduce - recycle – avoid”. To create [[sustainable]] [[land use]]s, actions have to be supported to find new innovative ways to “reduce” the consumption of land by new development “recycle” or put back into use abandoned and derelict sites, and “avoid” future land use decisions that are not sustainable. The concept puts a high value upon the development of inner districts through infill measures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circuse.eu/images/NaszePliki/Downloads/review_2.4.3_CircUse_Strategy_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
This approach takes into consideration issues related to [[urban sprawl]], [[urban planning]], [[brownfield land]], and [[land use planning]]. The concept was developed by the German Institute for Urban Affairs (Difu) and the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR) between 2003 and 2007 during the ExWoSt research field “circular land use management in cities and urban regions” (Kreislaufwirtschaft in der städtischen/stadtregionalen Flächennuntzung -. Fläche im Kreis)

== Practical Application ==
To incorporate the circular flow land use management concept into the practice of city planning in Central Europe, the project “Circular Flow Land Use Management (CircUse)” was initiated by the European Union Central Europe organization &lt;ref&gt;http://www.central2013.eu&lt;/ref&gt; as well as co-financed by the [[European Regional Development Fund]]. The CircUse project involves 12 partner organizations and 3 associated organizations in the six countries of Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland and Slovakia. The lead organization is the [[Institute for the Ecology of Urban Areas]] (IETU), located in [[Katowice]], Poland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circuse.eu&lt;/ref&gt;
The main core outputs of the CircUse project will be:
* A Circular Flow Land Use Management Strategy
* Position paper on existing and new instruments
* Separate training materials for professionals and school children
* Management structures (one newly formed and another modified from its previous form) that incorporate the CircUse principles
* Developed action plans for six pilot regions
* A [[land management]] data tool available as a software package
* A compendium summarizing the entire project

== Timeframe ==
The CircUse project was initiated in March 2010 and is scheduled to run until the end of February 2013.

== Similar Projects ==
CircUse also builds on the experiences the German "ExWoSt Research Field: Circular land use management in cities and urban regions” (ExWoSt Themafeld: Kreislaufwirtschaft in der städtischen/stadtregionalen Flächennutzung) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.flaeche-im-kreis.de/&lt;/ref&gt; and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) Research Programme "Research for the Reduction of Land Consumption and for Sustainable Land Management" (Forschung für die Reduzierung der Flächeninanspruchnahme und ein nachhaltiges Flächenmanagement). Similar projects carried out by other organizations include the European Union PLUREL project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plurel.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26289">In [[cognitive linguistics]], '''conceptual metaphor''', or '''cognitive metaphor''', refers to the understanding of one idea, or [[Conceptual framework|conceptual domain]], in terms of another. An example of this is the understanding of [[quantity]] in terms of [[Direction (geometry)|directionality]] (e.g. "the price of peace is ''rising''") or the understanding of time in terms of money (e.g. "I ''spent'' time at work today").

A conceptual domain can be any coherent organization of human experience. The regularity with which different languages employ the same metaphors, which often appear to be perceptually based, has led to the hypothesis that the mapping between conceptual domains corresponds to neural mappings in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Feldman, J. and Narayanan, S. (2004). Embodied meaning in a neural theory of language. ''Brain and Language'', 89(2):385–392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=du Castel|first1=Bertrand|title=Pattern Activation/Recognition Theory of Mind|journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience|volume=9|issue=90|publisher=EPFL|location=Lausanne|date = 15 July 2015|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2015.00090/full|doi=10.3389/fncom.2015.00090|ref=neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has gained wide attention, although some researchers question its empirical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Madsen, M.W. (2016). Cognitive Metaphor Theory and the Metaphysics of Immediacy. ''Cognitive Science'', 40(4):881–908&lt;/ref&gt; 

This idea, and a detailed examination of the underlying processes, was first extensively explored by [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] in their work ''Metaphors We Live By'' in 1980. Since then, the field of metaphor studies within the larger discipline of [[Cognitive linguistics|Cognitive Linguistics]] has increasingly developed, with several, annual academic conferences, scholarly societies, and research labs contributing to the subject area. Some researchers, such as Gerard Steen, have worked to develop empirical investigative tools for metaphor research, including the [[Metaphor identification procedure|Metaphor Identification Procedure]], or MIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/650090590|title=A method for linguistic metaphor identification : from MIP to MIPVU|date=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Pub. Co|others=Steen, Gerard.|isbn=9789027288158|location=Amsterdam|oclc=650090590}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Psychology, [[Raymond W. Gibbs Jr.|Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr.]], has investigated conceptual metaphor and [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]] through a number of psychological experiments. Other [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]], for example [[Gilles Fauconnier]], study subjects similar to conceptual metaphor under the labels "[[analogy]]", "[[conceptual blending]]" and "[[ideasthesia]]".

Conceptual metaphors are seen in language in our everyday lives. Conceptual metaphors shape not just our communication, but also shape the way we think and act. In George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's work, ''Metaphors We Live By'' (1980), we see how everyday language is filled with metaphors we may not always notice. An example of one of the commonly used conceptual metaphors is "argument is war".&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff and Johnson, Ch.1-3&lt;/ref&gt;  This metaphor shapes our language in the way we view argument as war or as a battle to be won. It is not uncommon to hear someone say "He won that argument" or "I attacked every weak point in his argument". The very way argument is thought of is shaped by this metaphor of arguments being war and battles that must be won. Argument can be seen in other ways than a battle, but we use this concept to shape the way we think of argument and the way we go about arguing.

Conceptual metaphors are used very often to understand theories and models. A conceptual metaphor uses one idea and links it to another to better understand something. For example, the conceptual metaphor of viewing communication as a [[Conduit metaphor|conduit]] is one large theory explained with a metaphor. So not only is our everyday communication shaped by the language of conceptual metaphors, but so is the very way we understand scholarly theories. These metaphors are prevalent in communication and we do not just use them in language; we actually perceive and act in accordance with the metaphors.

== Historical accounts of metaphor ==

=== In antiquity ===
In the Western philosophical tradition, [[Aristotle]] is often situated as the first commentator on the nature of metaphor, writing in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', "A 'metaphorical term' involves the transferred use of a term that properly belongs to something else,"&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Poetics''.English text: D.A. Russell and M. Winterbottom (eds.), in ''Ancient Literary Criticism: The Principal Texts in New Translation.'' Oxford: Oxford UP, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' he says that metaphors make learning pleasant; "To learn easily is naturally pleasant to all people, and words signify something, so whatever words create knowledge in us are the pleasantest."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, W. Rhys Roberts, Ingram Bywater, and Friedrich Solmsen. Rhetoric. New York: Modern Library, 1954. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's writings on metaphor constitute a "substitution view" of metaphor, wherein a metaphor is simply a decorative word or phrase substituted for a more ordinary one. This has been sometimes called the "Traditional View of Metaphor"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Soskice, Janet. ''Metaphor and Religious Language''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and at other times the "Classical Theory of Metaphor".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lakoff, George and Mark Johnson. ''Metaphors We Live By''. Chicago: Chicago UP, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the first century A.D., the Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian]] builds upon Aristotle's earlier work  of metaphor by focusing more on the comparative function of metaphorical language. In his work ''[[Institutio Oratoria]],'' Quintilian states," In totum autem metaphora brevior est similitudo" or "on the whole, metaphor is a shorter form of simile".&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian. ''Institutio Oratoria''. Trans. H.E. Butler. London: William Heinemann, 1921. Vol. III.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern interpretations of these early theories have also been intensely debated. [[Janet Soskice]], Professor of [[Philosophical theology|Philosophical Theology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], writes in summary that "it is certain that we shall taste the freshness of their insights only if we free them from the obligation to answer questions that were never theirs to ask".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, although originally taking a hard-line interpretation of these early authors&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Matthew S. "Aristotle's Theory of Metaphor Revisited." ''Mouseion: Journal of the&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Classical Association of Canada'', 14.1 (2017): 63-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; later concede that Aristotle was working within a different philosophical framework from what we engage with today and that critical interpretations should take this in to account.&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George, and Mark Johnson. ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Philosophy''. New York: Basic Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mappings ==
There are two main roles for the conceptual domains posited in conceptual metaphors:
*'''Source domain''': the conceptual domain from which we draw metaphorical expressions (e.g., love is a ''journey'').
*'''Target domain''': the conceptual domain that we try to understand (e.g., ''love'' is a journey).

A '''mapping''' is the systematic set of correspondences that exist between constituent elements of the source and the target domain. Many elements of target concepts come from source domains and are not preexisting.  To know a conceptual metaphor is to know the set of mappings that applies to a given source-target pairing. The same idea of mapping between source and target is used to describe [[analogy|analogical]] reasoning and inferences.&lt;ref&gt;Kövecses, Zoltan (2010) ''Metaphor: A Practical Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary tenet of this theory is that metaphors are matter of thought and not merely of language: hence, the term ''conceptual metaphor''.  The metaphor may seem to consist of words or other linguistic expressions that come from the terminology of the more concrete conceptual domain, but conceptual metaphors underlie a system of related metaphorical expressions that appear on the linguistic surface.  Similarly, the mappings of a conceptual metaphor are themselves motivated by [[image schema]]s which are pre-linguistic schemas concerning space, time, moving, controlling, and other core elements of embodied human experience.

Conceptual metaphors typically employ a more abstract concept as target and a more concrete or physical concept as their source.  For instance, metaphors such as 'the days [the more abstract or target concept] ahead' or 'giving my time' rely on more concrete concepts, thus expressing time as a path into physical space, or as a substance that can be handled and offered as a gift.  Different conceptual metaphors tend to be invoked when the speaker is trying to make a case for a certain point of view or course of action.  For instance, one might associate "the days ahead" with leadership, whereas the phrase "giving my time" carries stronger connotations of bargaining.  Selection of such metaphors tends to be directed by a subconscious or implicit habit in the mind of the person employing them.

The principle of unidirectionality states that the metaphorical process typically goes from the more concrete to the more abstract, and not the other way around.  Accordingly, abstract concepts are understood in terms of prototype concrete processes.  The term "concrete," in this theory, has been further specified by Lakoff and Johnson as more closely related to the developmental, physical neural, and interactive body (see [[embodied philosophy]]).  One manifestation of this view is found in the [[cognitive science of mathematics]], where it is proposed that mathematics itself, the most widely accepted means of abstraction in the human community, is largely metaphorically constructed, and thereby reflects a [[cognitive bias]] unique to humans that uses embodied prototypical processes (e.g. counting, moving along a path) that are understood by all human beings through their experiences.

== Conduit metaphor ==
The [[conduit metaphor]] is a dominant class of figurative expressions used when discussing communication itself ([[metalanguage]]). It operates whenever people speak or write as if they "insert" their [[Mental content|mental contents]] (feelings, meanings, thoughts, concepts, etc.) into "containers" (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) whose contents are then "extracted" by listeners and readers. Thus, language is viewed as a "conduit" conveying mental content between people.

Defined and described by linguist Michael J. Reddy, PhD, his proposal of this conceptual metaphor refocused debate within and outside the linguistic community on the importance of metaphorical language.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, M. J. (1979). The conduit metaphor: A case of frame conflict in our language about language. In A. Ortony (Ed.), ''Metaphor and Thought''(pp. 284–310).

In their 1980 work, [[George Lakoff|Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Johnson]] closely examined a collection of basic conceptual metaphors, including:

*{{Smallcaps|{{lc:Love is a journey}}}}
*{{Smallcaps|{{lc:Life is a journey}}}}
*{{Smallcaps|{{lc:Social organizations are plants}}}}
*{{Smallcaps|{{lc:Love is war}}}}

The latter half of each of these phrases invokes certain assumptions about concrete experience and requires the reader or listener to apply them to the preceding abstract concepts of love or organizing in order to understand the sentence in which the conceptual metaphor is used.

There are numerous ways in which conceptual metaphors shape human perception and communication, especially in mass media and in public policy.

Lakoff and Johnson focus on English, and cognitive scholars writing in English have tended not to investigate the discourse of foreign languages in any great detail to determine the creative ways in which individuals negotiate, resist, and consolidate conceptual metaphors. [[Andrew Goatly]] in his book ''Washing the Brain'' (2007)&lt;ref name="washing the brain"&gt;{{cite book|title=Washing the Brain Metaphor and Hidden Ideology|last1=Goatly|first1=Andrew|date=January 17, 2007|publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]]|isbn=978-9027227133|authorlink1=Andrew Goatly}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-04 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; considers ideological conceptual metaphors as well as Chinese conceptual metaphors.

James W. Underhill, a modern Humboldtian scholar, attempts to reestablish [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s concern for the different ways languages frame reality, and the strategies individuals adopt in creatively resisting and modifying existing patterns of thought. Taking on board the Lakoff-Johnson paradigm of conceptual metaphor, he investigates the way in which Czech communists appropriated the concept of the people, the state and struggle, and the way German Communists harnessed concepts of eternity and purity. He also reminds us that, as Klemperer, the main critic of Hitlerdeutsch, demonstrates, resisting patterns of thought means engaging in conceptual metaphors and refusing the logic that ideologies impose upon them. In multilingual studies (based on Czech, German, French &amp; English), Underhill considers how different cultures reformulate key concepts such as truth, love, hate and war.&lt;ref&gt;'Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts', Cambridge University Press 2012, and 'Creating Worldviews', Edinburgh University Press 2011.  {{ISBN|978-0748643158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family roles and ethics ==

A less extreme, but similar, claim is made by [[George Lakoff]] in his book ''[[Moral Politics]]'' and his later book on [[framing (social sciences)|framing]], ''[[Don't Think of an Elephant!]].'' Lakoff claims that the public political arena in America reflects a basic conceptual metaphor of '[[family|the family]].'  Accordingly, people understand political leaders in terms of 'strict father' and 'nurturant mother' roles.  Two basic views of [[political economy]] arise from this desire to see the nation-state act 'more like a father' or 'more like a mother.'  He further amplified these views in his latest book, ''[[The Political Mind]].''

Urban theorist and ethicist [[Jane Jacobs]] made this distinction in less gender-driven if not wholly desexualizing terms by differentiating between a 'Guardian Ethic' and a 'Trader Ethic'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, J. 'Systems of Survival', Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1993. {{ISBN|0340591773}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  She states that guarding and trading are two concrete activities that human beings must learn to apply metaphorically to all choices in later life.  In a society where guarding children is the primary female duty and trading in a market economy is the primary male duty, Lakoff posits that children assign the 'guardian' and 'trader' roles to their mothers and fathers, respectively.

Both of these theories suggest that there may be a great deal of [[social conditioning]] and pressure to form specific [[cognitive bias]]. Anthropologists observe that all societies tend to have roles assigned by age and gender, which supports this view.

== Linguistics and politics ==

Lakoff and Jacobs both devote a significant amount of time to current events and political theory, suggesting that respected linguists and theorists of conceptual metaphor may tend to channel their theories into political activism.

Critics of this ethics-driven approach to language tend to accept that [[idiom]]s reflect underlying conceptual metaphors, but that actual grammar, and the more basic cross-cultural concepts of [[scientific method]] and [[mathematical practice]] tend to minimize the impact of metaphors.  Such critics tend to see Lakoff and Jacobs as 'left-wing figures,' and would not accept their politics as any kind of crusade against an [[ontology]] embedded in language and culture, but rather, as an idiosyncratic pastime, not part of the science of linguistics nor of much use.  And others further, such as [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]], [[Michel Foucault]] and, more recently, [[Manuel de Landa]] would criticize both of these two positions for mutually constituting the same old ontological ideology that would try to separate two parts of a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Lakoff's 1987 work, ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]],'' answered some of these criticisms before they were even made: he explores the effects of cognitive metaphors (both culturally specific and human-universal) on the grammar per se of several languages, and the evidence of the limitations of the classical logical-positivist or [[Analytic philosophy|Anglo-American School]] philosophical concept of the category usually used to explain or describe the scientific method. Lakoff's reliance on empirical scientific evidence, ''i.e.'' specifically [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] predictions, in the 1987 work and in ''[[Philosophy in the Flesh]]'' (1999) suggests that the cognitive-metaphor position has no objections to the scientific method, but instead considers the scientific method a finely developed reasoning system used to discover phenomena which are subsequently understood in terms of new conceptual metaphors (such as the metaphor of fluid motion for conducted electricity, which is described in terms of "current" "flowing" against "impedance," or the gravitational metaphor for static-electric phenomena, or the "planetary orbit" model of the atomic nucleus and electrons, as used by [[Niels Bohr]]).

Further, partly in response to such criticisms, Lakoff and [[Rafael E. Núñez]], in 2000, proposed a [[cognitive science of mathematics]] that would explain mathematics as a consequence of, not an alternative to, the human reliance on conceptual metaphor to understand abstraction in terms of basic experiential concretes.

==Literature==
The Linguistic Society of America has argued that "the most recent [[Linguistics|linguistic]] approach to [[literature]] is that of cognitive metaphor, which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language, but a mode of thought. Metaphors project structures from source domains of schematized bodily or enculturated experience into abstract target domains. We conceive the abstract idea of life in terms of our experiences of a journey, a year, or a day. We do not understand [[Robert Frost]]'s '[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]' to be about a horse-and-wagon journey but about life. We understand [[Emily Dickinson]]'s '[[Because I could not stop for Death]]' as a [[poem]] about the end of the human life span, not a trip in a carriage. This work is redefining the critical notion of [[imagery (literature)|imagery]]. Perhaps for this reason, cognitive metaphor has significant promise for some kind of rapprochement between [[linguistics]] and [[literary study]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsadc.org/info/ling-fields-lit.cfm |title=LSA: About Linguistics |publisher=Lsadc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Teaching thinking by analogy (metaphor) is one of the main themes of [[The Private Eye Project]].

The work of political scientist Rūta Kazlauskaitė examines metaphorical models in school-history knowledge of the controversial Polish-Lithuanian past. On the basis of Lakoff and Johnson's conceptual metaphor theory, she shows how the implicit metaphorical models of everyday experience, which inform the abstract conceptualization of the past, truth, objectivity, knowledge, and multiperspectivity in the school textbooks, obstruct an understanding of the divergent narratives of past experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-51-4181-1 |title="Towards an Embodied History: Metaphorical Models in Textbook Knowledge of the Controversial Polish-Lithuanian Past". Rūta Kazlauskaitė. Doctoral dissertation. University of Helsinki |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language learning==
There is some evidence that an understanding of underlying conceptual metaphors can aid the retention of vocabulary for people learning a [[foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Boers, F. 'Metaphor awareness and vocabulary retention', Applied Linguistics 21(4) 2000: 553-571&lt;/ref&gt; To improve learners' awareness of conceptual metaphor, one [[monolingual learner's dictionary]], the [[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]] has introduced 50 or so 'metaphor boxes'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/about/med/key-features-of-the-macmillan-english-dictionary-second-edition/#8 |title=MED Second Edition - Key features &amp;#124; Macmillan |publisher=Macmillandictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the most salient Lakoffian metaphors in English.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, R. 'On specifying metaphor: an idea and its implementation'. International Journal of Lexicography, 17(2) 2004: 195-222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bejoint, H. The Lexicography of English, Oxford University Press 2010: 189&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the dictionary entry for ''conversation'' includes a box with the heading: 'A conversation is like a '''journey''', with the speakers going from one place to another', followed by vocabulary items (words and phrases) which embody this metaphorical schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/conversation |title=conversation - definition of conversation by Macmillan Dictionary |publisher=Macmillandictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language teaching experts are beginning to explore the relevance of conceptual metaphor to how learners learn and what teachers do in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Holme, Randal, Mind, Metaphor and Language Teaching. London: Palgrave 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual metaphorical mapping in animals==
A current study showed a natural tendency to systematically map an abstract dimension, such as social status, in our closest and non-linguistic relatives, the chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, C. D. and Adachi, I. 'Conceptual metaphorical mapping in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)', eLife 2013;2:e00932. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.00932&lt;/ref&gt; In detail, discrimination performances between familiar conspecific faces were systematically modulated by the spatial location and the social status of the presented individuals, leading to discrimination facilitation or deterioration. High-ranked individuals presented at spatially higher position and low-ranked individuals presented at lower position led to discrimination facilitation, while high-ranked individuals at lower positions and low-ranked individuals at higher position led to discrimination deterioration. This suggests that this tendency had already evolved in the common ancestors of humans and chimpanzees and is not uniquely human, but describes a conceptual metaphorical mapping that predates language.

The '''Developmental Leadership Program''' (DLP, or DLPROG) is an international research and policy initiative. The Program looks at the political processes that underpin development goals such as sustainable economic growth, political stability and inclusive social development.  In particular, DLP explores the central role of leaders, elites and coalitions in developing countries and how they can help or hinder the positive reform of institutions and policies in the public, private and civil society sectors. DLP is funded primarily by [http://aid.dfat.gov.au/makediff/Pages/default.aspx the Australian Aid Program].

==Background==

===The core aims and activities of DLP===
The core aim of DLP is to develop a clearer understanding of the political processes that support developmental change and to embed that understanding in the thinking, policies and practices of the wider development community. DLP does this by:
* Undertaking, commissioning and publishing high quality, policy-relevant research. 
* Organising international seminars and workshop sessions. 
* Providing clear policy guidance, country-level operational guidance and political analysis tools for development practitioners and policy makers.

===Central argument: politics is the key===
* At the core of DLP’s work is the recognition that politics is central to the development process.   
* Development is not just a technical challenge or a question or transferring information, skills or resources. These are important but it is also crucial that development is supported and sustained by local political agents and processes.     
* Politics is understood by DLP in very broad terms, as all of the various activities of conflict, negotiation and co-operation that occur when people with different interests, ideas and degrees of influence have to make collective decisions about rules, resources and power.  
* Politics occurs at all levels and in all sectors and organisations in society. It unfolds through formal rules and institutions but also informal norms, customs and understandings.  Politics is the key to the peaceful management of differences and disagreements, from energy policy in China and India through to the informal networks that promote women’s rights in Egypt and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Harrison, T. and Kostka, G. (2012) “Manoeuvres for a Low Carbon State: The Local Politics of Climate Change in China and India”, DLP Research Paper 22; and Tadros, M. (2011) “Working Politically Behind Red Lines: Structure and agency in a comparative study of women’s coalitions in Egypt and Jordan”, DLP Research Paper 12. http://www.dlprog.org/ftp/&lt;/ref&gt;    
* Leadership is central to politics and DLP aims to improve understanding of the role of leaders, elites and coalitions in promoting (or frustrating) inclusive political settlements, stable polities, sustainable economic growth and inclusive social development – particularly in the context of weak and fragile states.

==Organisational structure==
DLP is run by a Program Management Team. While DLP's funding comes primarily from the Australian national government, the Program is independent and autonomous.  	
As of July 2014, DLP's management team consists of:

* ''[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/government-society/marquette-heather.aspx Heather Marquette]'', International Development Department, University of Birmingham - Director
* ''[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/people/david-hudson David Hudson]'', Department of Political Science, University College London - Deputy Director
* ''[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/about/staff/profile?uname=croche Chris Roche]'', Institute for Human Security and Social Change, La Trobe University, Melbourne - Senior Research Partner
* ''Heather Lyne de Ver'', International Development Department, University of Birmingham - Program Manager

===History===
DLP has its origins in the work of the Leaders, Elites and Coalitions Research Program (LECRP), which began in 2007.  It evolved into the Leadership Program: Developmental Leaders, Elites and Coalitions (LPDLEC) in 2009 before adopting its current form.

'''Dilly Crater''' is a crater in the [[Elysium quadrangle]] of Mars, located at

Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits.  As craters get larger (greater than 10&amp;nbsp;km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"&gt;http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/&lt;/ref&gt; The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact.&lt;ref name="Kieffer1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">'''Document classification''' or '''document categorization''' is a problem in [[library science]], [[information science]] and [[computer science]]. The task is to assign a [[document]] to one or more [[Class (philosophy)|classes]] or [[Categorization|categories]]. This may be done "manually" (or "intellectually") or [[algorithmically]]. The intellectual classification of documents has mostly been the province of library science, while the algorithmic classification of documents is mainly in information science and computer science. The problems are overlapping, however, and there is therefore interdisciplinary research on document classification.

The documents to be classified may be texts, images, music, etc. Each kind of document possesses its special classification problems. When not otherwise specified, text classification is implied.

Documents may be classified according to their [[Subject (documents)|subjects]] or according to other attributes (such as document type, author, printing year etc.). In the rest of this article only subject classification is considered. There are two main philosophies of subject classification of documents: the content-based approach and the request-based approach.

=="Content-based" versus "request-based" classification==
'''Content-based classification''' is classification in which the weight given to particular subjects in a document determines the class to which the document is assigned. It is, for example, a common rule for classification in libraries, that at least 20% of the content of a book should be about the class to which the book is assigned.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress (2008). The subject headings manual. Washington, DC.: Library of Congress, Policy and Standards Division. (Sheet H 180: "Assign headings only for topics that comprise at least 20% of the work.")&lt;/ref&gt; In automatic classification it could be the number of times given words appears in a document.

'''Request-oriented classification''' (or -indexing) is classification in which the anticipated request from users is influencing how documents are being classified. The classifier asks themself: “Under which descriptors should this entity be found?” and “think of all the possible queries and decide for which ones the entity at hand is relevant” (Soergel, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;230&lt;ref&gt;Soergel, Dagobert (1985). [https://books.google.com/books?id=cHbNCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Organizing information: Principles of data base and retrieval systems]. Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Request-oriented classification may be classification that is targeted towards a particular audience or user group. For example, a library or a database for feminist studies may classify/index documents differently when compared to a historical library.  It is probably better, however, to understand request-oriented classification as ''policy-based classification'': The classification is done according to some ideals and reflects the purpose of the library or database doing the classification. In this way it is not necessarily a kind of classification or indexing based on user studies. Only if empirical data about use or users are applied should request-oriented classification be regarded as a user-based approach.

==Classification versus indexing==
Sometimes a distinction is made between assigning documents to classes ("classification") versus assigning [[Subject (documents)|subjects]] to documents ("[[subject indexing]]") but as [[Frederick Wilfrid Lancaster]] has argued, this distinction is not fruitful. "These terminological distinctions,” he writes, “are quite meaningless and only serve to cause confusion” (Lancaster, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster, F. W. (2003). Indexing and abstracting in theory and practice. Library Association, London.&lt;/ref&gt;). The view that this distinction is purely superficial is also supported by the fact that a classification system may be transformed into a [[thesaurus]] and vice versa (cf., Aitchison, 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Aitchison, J. (1986). "A classification as a source for thesaurus: The Bibliographic Classification of H. E. Bliss as a source of thesaurus terms and structure."

==Automatic document classification (ADC)==
Automatic document classification tasks can be divided into three sorts: '''supervised document classification''' where some external mechanism (such as human feedback) provides information on the correct classification for documents, '''unsupervised document classification''' (also known as [[document clustering]]), where the classification must be done entirely without reference to external information, and '''semi-supervised document classification''',&lt;ref&gt;

In [[machine learning]], particularly in the creation of [[artificial neural networks]], '''ensemble averaging''' is the process of creating multiple models and combining them to produce a desired output, as opposed to creating just one model. Frequently an ensemble of models performs better than any individual model, because the various errors of the models "average out."

== Overview ==
Ensemble averaging is one of the simplest types of [[committee machine]]s. Along with [[Boosting (meta-algorithm)|boosting]], it is one of the two major types of static committee machines.&lt;ref name="haykin"&gt;Haykin, Simon. Neural networks : a comprehensive foundation. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River  N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to standard network design in which many networks are generated but only one is kept, ensemble averaging keeps the less satisfactory networks around, but with less weight.&lt;ref name="hashem"&gt;Hashem, S. "Optimal linear combinations of neural networks." Neural Networks 10, no. 4 (1997): 599&amp;ndash;614.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of ensemble averaging relies on two properties of artificial neural networks:&lt;ref name="naft"&gt;Naftaly, U., N. Intrator, and D. Horn. "Optimal ensemble averaging of neural networks." Network: Computation in Neural Systems 8, no. 3 (1997): 283&amp;ndash;296.&lt;/ref&gt;

# In any network, the bias can be reduced at the cost of increased variance
# In a group of networks, the variance can be reduced at no cost to bias

Ensemble averaging creates a group of networks, each with low bias and high variance, then combines them to a new network with (hopefully) low bias and low variance. It is thus a resolution of the [[bias-variance dilemma]].&lt;ref name="geman"&gt;Geman, S., E. Bienenstock, and R. Doursat. "Neural networks and the bias/variance dilemma." Neural computation 4, no. 1 (1992): 1&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of combining experts has been traced back to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].&lt;ref&gt;Clemen, R. T. "Combining forecasts: A review and annotated bibliography." International Journal of Forecasting 5, no. 4 (1989): 559&amp;ndash;583.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The theory mentioned above gives an obvious strategy: create a set of experts with low bias and high variance, and then average them. Generally, what this means is to create a set of experts with varying parameters; frequently, these are the initial synaptic weights, although other factors (such as the learning rate, momentum etc.) may be varied as well. Some authors recommend against varying weight decay and early stopping.&lt;ref name="naft" /&gt; The steps are therefore:
# Generate ''N'' experts, each with their own initial values. (Initial values are usually chosen randomly from a distribution.)
# Train each expert separately.
# Combine the experts and average their values.
Alternatively, [[domain knowledge]] may be used to generate several ''classes'' of experts. An expert from each class is trained, and then combined.

A more complex version of ensemble average views the final result not as a mere average of all the experts, but rather as a weighted sum. If each expert is &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;, then the overall result &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\alpha}) = \sum_{j=1}^{p} \alpha_j y_j(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of weights. The optimization problem of finding alpha is readily solved through neural networks, hence a "meta-network" where each "neuron" is in fact an entire neural network can be trained, and the synaptic weights of the final network is the weight applied to each expert. This is known as a ''linear combination of experts''.&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;

It can be seen that most forms of neural networks are some subset of a linear combination: the standard neural net (where only one expert is used) is simply a linear combination with all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j = 0&lt;/math&gt; and one &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k=1&lt;/math&gt;. A raw average is where all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt; are equal to some constant value, namely one over the total number of experts.&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;

A more recent ensemble averaging method is negative correlation learning,&lt;ref&gt;Y. Liu and X. Yao, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608099000738 Ensemble Learning via Negative Correlation] Neural Networks, Volume 12, Issue 10, December 1999, pp. 1399-1404. {{doi|10.1016/S0893-6080(99)00073-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by Y. Liu and X. Yao. Now this method has been widely used in [[evolutionary computing]].

== Benefits ==
* The resulting committee is almost always less complex than a single network which would achieve the same level of performance&lt;ref&gt;Pearlmutter, B. A., and R. Rosenfeld. "Chaitin&amp;ndash;Kolmogorov complexity and generalization in neural networks." In Proceedings of the 1990 conference on Advances in neural information processing systems 3, 931. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The resulting committee can be trained more easily on smaller input sets&lt;ref name="haykin" /&gt;
* The resulting committee often has improved performance over any single network&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;
* The risk of [[overfitting]] is lessened, as there are fewer parameters (weights) which need to be set&lt;ref name="haykin" /&gt;

The '''European Lunar Explorer''' ('''ELE''') or '''European Lunar Lander''' ('''ELL''') was a planned [[Romania]]n [[Exploration of the Moon|Lunar lander]]. It was being developed by [[ARCA (NGO)|ARCA]], as an entrant for the [[Google Lunar X Prize]], until it was cancelled in 2014.

It was intended to have a mass of 400 kilograms when fully fueled, including two [[upper stage]]s to propel it from [[low Earth orbit]] onto a trajectory towards the [[Moon]]. The lander itself had a [[monopropellant]] [[cold rocket engine]], fuelled by [[hydrogen peroxide]], which was to slow its descent towards the surface of the Moon. The target landing site was [[Montes Carpatus]]. The spacecraft was designed to travel 500 metres after landing, in order to explore its landing site.

ELL was the part of the spacecraft to land on the Moon, while ELE was the complete spacecraft, including the two stages intended to propel it from low Earth orbit to a [[trans-lunar injection|trans-lunar]] trajectory.

The '''excavatability''' of an earth (rock and [[regolith]]) material is a measure of the material to be excavated (dug) with conventional excavation equipment such as a [[bulldozer]] with [[Bulldozer#Ripper|ripper]]s, [[backhoe]], [[Wheel tractor-scraper|scraper]] and other grading equipment. Materials that cannot be excavated with conventional excavation equipment are said to be non-[[rippable]]. Such material typically requires pre-[[Rock blasting|blasting]] or use of percussion hammers or chisels to facilitate excavation. The excavatability or [[rippability]] of earth materials is evaluated typically by a [[geophysicist]], [[engineering geologist]], or [[geotechnical engineer]].

'''''Finger Prints''''' is a book published by [[Francis Galton#Fingerprints|Francis Galton]] through [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in 1892.  It was one of the first books to provide a scientific footing for matching [[fingerprint]]s and for later acceptance in courts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1033">In the theory of [[causal structure]] on [[Lorentzian manifold]]s, '''Geroch's theorem''' or '''Geroch's splitting theorem''' (first proved by [[Robert Geroch]]) gives a topological characterization of [[globally hyperbolic]] spacetimes.

==The theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt;(M, g_{ab})&lt;/math&gt; be a globally hyperbolic spacetime. Then &lt;math&gt;(M, g_{ab})&lt;/math&gt; is [[strongly causal]] and there exists a global "time function" on the manifold, i.e. a continuous, surjective map &lt;math&gt;f:M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that:
*For all &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy surface]], and
*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is strictly increasing on any [[causal curve]].
Moreover, all Cauchy surfaces are homeomorphic, and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[homeomorphic]] to &lt;math&gt;S \times \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is any Cauchy surface of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Grazing fire''' is a term used in [[military science]] and defined by NATO and the US Department Of Defense as “Fire approximately parallel to the ground where the center of the cone of fire does not rise above one meter from the ground.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html "DOD Dictionary of Military Terms"]&lt;/ref&gt; Grazing fire is often performed by [[machine guns]]. It is tactically advantageous when attempting to cut off an infantry ground assault or counter-attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/23-65/index.html Army Field Manual No. 23-65] "BROWNING MACHINE GUN CALIBER .50 HB, M2"&lt;/ref&gt;

Grazing fire is when the cone of fire does not exceed 1.8 meters (the average height of a man) above the ground. When each bullet is fired, it will leave the barrel of the weapon at the axis of bore set from the angle of sight desired to strike the target area. The trajectory of the round should be constant as well as maximum ordinate. Maximum ordinate is the highest point of the trajectory, which is usually 2/3 the distance to the target from the weapon. Depending on the caliber of the round being fired and the slope of the terrain, as well as the distance to the target, the bullet will maintain a semi-flat trajectory. With [[7.62×51mm NATO]] ammunition, which is most commonly used with, for example, the [[M240]] machine gun, the bullet will reach a distance of 600 meters traveling at 900 meters per second or 2,800 feet per second, before it begins a pronounced downward trajectory to the earth. Any distance beyond that range will be considered [[plunging fire]] due to the arc (axis of bore + angle of sight) needed to impact the target area.

Grazing fire is so named because it cuts the vegetation low as though a herd of cattle had been grazing there. The optimal height of fire should be at knee height. In addition to keeping the enemy pinned down, anybody wounded or going to cover will fall into the line of fire, not out of it.

'''Habis''' (from the [[Cynete]] language meaning [[fawn]]) is a legendary king of the Spanish region of [[Tartessos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hérnuñez|first1=Pollux|title=Mitos, héroes y monstruos de la España antigua|publisher=Amaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to legend, Habis's story began when his mother was stung by a bee. Her father, the king of Tartessos, hurried to heal her. As he knelt to soften her wound with his mouth, a passion came over both, thus procreating the baby. Due to the shame of having committed [[incest]], the king ordered the child to be abandoned on the prairies outside the kingdom. Eventually the boy was raised by the deer in there, acquiring deer features. He was later found and recognized as the true heir to the kingdom, and later accordingly named.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elfarodemalaga.es/index.php?id=portada&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[applied mathematics]], '''highly optimized tolerance (HOT)''' is a method of generating [[power law]] behavior in systems by including a [[global optimization]] principle.  For some systems that display a characteristic scale, a global optimization term could potentially be added that would then yield power law behavior.  It has been used to generate and describe internet-like graphs, [[forest fire]] models and may also apply to biological systems.

==Example==
The following is taken from Sornette's book.

Consider a [[random variable]], &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, that takes on values &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthmore, lets assume for another parameter &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_i = r_i^{ - \beta }&lt;/math&gt;
for some fixed &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.  We then want to minimize
:&lt;math&gt; L = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} p_i x_i &lt;/math&gt;
subject to the constraint
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r_i = \kappa &lt;/math&gt;
Using [[Lagrange multipliers]], this gives
:&lt;math&gt; p_i \propto x_i^{ - ( 1 + 1/ \beta) } &lt;/math&gt;
giving us a power law.  The global optimization of minimizing the energy along with the power law dependence between &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; gives us a power law distribution in probability.

'''''How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever''''' is a 2009 book by paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] and James Gorman. The book outlines Horner's theory for being able to resurrect a [[maniraptora]]n dinosaur by altering the genes of a chicken embryo. In 2010, a [[paperback]] version was published under the title '''''How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution'''''.

==Summary==
Paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] describes [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo) and outlines his theory for being able to resurrect a [[maniraptora]]n dinosaur from a chicken embryo, by activating and deactivating certain genes to restore dormant dinosaur characteristics such as a tail, claws, teeth, and a snout.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Booklist/&gt; Horner also discusses paleontology in the book.&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

==Background and publication==
Horner's idea for the [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)#Build a Dinosaur project|"Chickenosaurus" project]] came from "a pretty good script" that was written for ''[[Jurassic World|Jurassic Park IV]]'' early in its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Collins |title=The Jurassic Park scientist who plans to turn a chicken into T Rex |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/dinosaurs/8847499/The-Jurassic-Park-scientist-who-plans-to-turn-a-chicken-into-T-Rex.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's story, at that time, was expected to involve genetic engineering of dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; Horner was planning the book with co-author James Gorman in spring 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horner |first1=John R. |first2=James |last2=Gorman |title=How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution |edition=2010 Plume |year=2010 |publisher=[[Plume (publisher)|Plume]] |location=New York |isbn=0525951040 |oclc=233549535 |pages=193–194 |quote=Let's use the ivory-billed woodpecker as an example.

Horner and his publisher planned for the book to come out at the same time as ''Jurassic Park IV'', to serve as a scientific companion volume;&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw7fSAzv4EU|title= Interview with Dr. Jack Horner|date= April 13, 2017|website= Jurassic Outpost|access-date=May 3, 2017|at=24:50–26:44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Switek |title=Why Do We Keep Going Back to Jurassic Park? |url=http://beta.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-we-keep-going-back-to-jurassic-park-117247927/?no-ist |work=Smithsonian |date=October 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140924043612/http://beta.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-we-keep-going-back-to-jurassic-park-117247927/?no-ist |archivedate=September 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the film was delayed.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; Horner's book, in [[hardcover]] form, was ultimately published by [[Dutton Penguin]] on March 19, 2009,&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt; without the accompaniment of the film.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; The book was initially published with the title ''How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever''.&lt;ref name=Amazon&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Dinosaur-Extinction-Forever/dp/0525951040|title= How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever|publisher= [[Amazon.com]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[paperback]] version was published by [[Plume (publisher)|Plume]] on February 23, 2010, with the title ''How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Dinosaur-Science-Evolution/dp/0452296013/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=|title= How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution|publisher= Amazon.com|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the book "provocative but frustrating", writing that aside from the main concept, "Much of the rest of the book offers background, but often digresses, for example, into hunting for DNA from 68-million-year-old dinosaur bones or the surfing habit of the man who discovered the [[polymerase chain reaction]] or how genetically close humans and Neanderthals are—none of which advances the book's central argument."&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web |url= http://secure.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-95104-9|title= How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever|date= January 26, 2009|website= [[Publishers Weekly]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirkus Reviews]] wrote that the book "has a comfortable, intelligent flow," but noted that Horner first "wants to tell a story—and it's a good one, though at times meandering—about paleontology […]. Horner digresses about [[skinhead]]s, [[Ted Kaczynski]] and chicken carcasses, but his main idea is reverse evolutionary engineering."&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/Jack-Horner-75227/how-to-build-a-dinosaur/|title= How to Build a Dinosaur|date= January 1, 2009|website= [[Kirkus Reviews]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert Taylor of [[Booklist]] wrote, "Straight from the scientific frontier, Horner's work should excite anyone who's dreamed of walking with dinosaurs."&lt;ref name=Booklist&gt;{{cite web |url= http://staging.booklistonline.com/How-to-Build-a-Dinosaur-Extinction-Doesn-t-Have-to-Be-Forever-Jack-Horner/pid=3244338|title= Booklist Review: How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever|last= Taylor|first= Gilbert|date= February 15, 2009|website= [[Booklist]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Switek of ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' wrote, "The importance of ''How to Build a Dinosaur'' does not lie in Horner's wish to create a dinochicken. That makes up only a small part of the book. Instead the slim volume indicates how paleontology is becoming more of an interdisciplinary science where studies of development and genetics are just as important as fossilized bones."&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/book-review-how-to-build-a-dinosaur-40954950/|title= Book Review: How to Build a Dinosaur|last= Switek|first= Brian|date= March 19, 2009|website= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20170503141759/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/book-review-how-to-build-a-dinosaur-40954950/|archivedate= May 3, 2017|deadurl= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Hecht of ''[[New Scientist]]'' wrote that Horner "is at his best" in the book, which he called "provocative yet firmly grounded in science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126972-100-review-how-to-build-a-dinosaur-by-jack-horner-and-james-gorman/|title= Review: How to Build a Dinosaur by Jack Horner and James Gorman|last= Hecht|first= Jeff|date= February 25, 2009|website= [[New Scientist]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Charles Poore]] placed ''Lands Beyond'' on his annual list of books recommended for Christmas giving.&lt;ref&gt;"Books of The Times", ''The New York Times'', December 20, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kirkus Reviews]] recommended it as "a zestful geographical round-up which combines fact, legend and literature in equally interested parts".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/willy-de-camp-l-sprague-ley/lands-beyond/ Kirkus review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas|McComas]] praised the book, saying it was "written with scholarly authority, literary grace, and an amusedly tolerant exposition of error, to make one of the season's most enjoyable items."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading," ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', October 1952, pp. 98=99&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' reviewer [[Leslie Flood]] described it as "fascinating".&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews", ''New Worlds'', April 1954, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Weird Tales]]'' commended ''Lands Beyond'' to its audience, saying de Camp and Ley "ably treated" their subjects "for reader enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;''The Eyrie'', ''Weird Tales'', January 1953, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; [[George O. Smith]] wrote that it was "a book good for the younger and more impressionable to read, because it reduces to the realm of practicality many of the fabulous mysteries of the past, thus stripping the glamorous Long-Ago of its false superiority".&lt;ref&gt;"Science: Fact and Fiction", ''[[Space Science Fiction]]'', November 1952, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10006">'''[[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] [[Server (computing)|server]] return codes''' always have three digits, and each digit has a special meaning.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 959&lt;/ref&gt; The first digit denotes whether the response is good, bad or incomplete:

{| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%"
|-
! style="width:50px" | Range
! Purpose
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;1xx&lt;/code&gt;
| Positive Preliminary reply
The requested action is being initiated; expect another reply before proceeding with a new command.  (The user-process sending another command before the completion reply would be in violation of protocol; but server-FTP processes should queue any commands that arrive while a preceding command is in progress.)  This type of reply can be used to indicate that the command was accepted and the user-process may now pay attention to the data connections, for implementations where simultaneous monitoring is difficult.  The server-FTP process may send at most, one 1xx reply per command.
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;2xx&lt;/code&gt;
| Positive Completion reply
The requested action has been successfully completed.  A new request may be initiated.
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;3xx&lt;/code&gt;
| Positive Intermediate reply
The command has been accepted, but the requested action is being held in abeyance, pending receipt of further information.  The user should send another command specifying this information.  This reply is used in command sequence groups.
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;4xx&lt;/code&gt;
| Transient Negative Completion reply
The command was not accepted and the requested action did not take place, but the error condition is temporary and the action may be requested again.  The user should return to the beginning of the command sequence, if any. It is difficult to assign a meaning to "transient", particularly when two distinct sites (Server- and User-processes) have to agree on the interpretation. Each reply in the 4xx category might have a slightly different time value, but the intent is that the user-process is encouraged to try again.  A rule of thumb in determining if a reply fits into the 4xx or the 5xx (Permanent Negative) category is that replies are 4xx if the commands can be repeated without any change in command form or in properties of the User or Server (e.g., the command is spelled the same with the same arguments used; the user does not change his file access or user name; the server does not put up a new implementation.)
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;5xx&lt;/code&gt;
| Permanent Negative Completion reply
The command was not accepted and the requested action did not take place.  The User-process is discouraged from repeating the exact request (in the same sequence).  Even some "permanent" error conditions can be corrected, so the human user may want to direct his User-process to reinitiate the command sequence by direct action at some point in the future (e.g., after the spelling has been changed, or the user has altered his directory status.)
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;6xx&lt;/code&gt;
| Protected reply
The RFC 2228 introduced the concept of protected replies to increase security over the FTP communications. The 6xx replies are [[Base64]] encoded protected messages that serves as responses to secure commands. When properly decoded, these replies fall into the above categories.
|}

The second digit is a grouping digit and encodes the following information:

{| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%"
|-
! style="width:50px" | Range
! Purpose
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;x0x&lt;/code&gt;
| Syntax 
These replies refer to syntax errors, syntactically correct commands that don't fit any functional category, unimplemented or superfluous commands.
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;x1x&lt;/code&gt;
|  Information 
These are replies to requests for information, such as status or help.
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;x2x&lt;/code&gt;
| Connections 
Replies referring to the control and data connections.
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;x3x&lt;/code&gt;
|  Authentication and accounting 
Replies for the login process and accounting procedures.
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;x4x&lt;/code&gt;
| Unspecified as of RFC 959.
|-
| valign="top" | &lt;code&gt;x5x&lt;/code&gt;
| File system 
These replies indicate the status of the Server file system vis-a-vis the requested transfer or other file system action.
|}

Below is a list of all known return codes that may be issued by an FTP server.

{| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4991">This '''list of Ivy League medical schools''' outlines the seven universities of the [[Ivy League]] that host a [[medical school]]. Only one Ivy League university, [[Princeton University]], does not have a medical school. All Ivy League medical schools are located in the [[U.S. Northeast|Northeast]] region of the [[United States]] and are privately owned and controlled. Only two of the schools, at Dartmouth and Penn, are located adjacent to the undergraduate campuses. The schools at Brown, Columbia, Harvard, and Yale, are located on separate campuses in the same metropolitan area as the university. The school at Cornell, Weill Cornell Medicine, is located in New York City, far from the main Ithaca campus.

==Reputation==
Ivy League medical schools have some of the best reputations among medical schools in the United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} They are some of the oldest institutions of medical education, and leaders among medical research. They are also associated with some of the best [[hospitals]] in the United States. Some publications' most recent rankings of medical schools at these institutions are shown below.

{{Main|Lists of volcanoes}}

There are no active volcanoes in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but there are a few active volcanoes in some [[British Overseas Territories]]. [[Queen Mary's Peak]] in [[Tristan da Cunha]] erupted in 1961-2. The [[Soufrière Hills]] volcano on the Caribbean island of [[Montserrat]] erupted three times between 1995 and 2013. [[Mount Belinda]] in the British Overseas Territory of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]], erupted between 2001 and 2007. [[Mount Michael]], also in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, was active in 2005; its {{Convert|700|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} summit crater is thought to possibly contain an active [[lava lake]], one of only a handful in the world.

Below is a list of extinct [[volcano]]es in the United Kingdom.

[[File:3044 C46 - Taylor - Man and Matter.tif|thumb|Title page of book]]
'''''Man and Matter - Essays Scientific &amp; Christian''''' is a 1951 book written by a [[Great Britain|British]] chemist, museum curator and [[history of science|historian of science]] [[F. Sherwood Taylor|Frank Sherwood Taylor]].&lt;ref name="jce"&gt;Ralph E. Oesper, [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed027p253 "Frank Sherwood Taylor"], ''[[Journal of Chemical Education]]'', 27(5), p 253, May 1950. [[ACS Publications]]. {{doi|10.1021/ed027p253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work presents a critical mind's account of the clash between [[religion]] and [[science]]. It provides insight into an intriguing perspective of a person, who has been received into the [[Catholic Church]] after forty years of struggling to find his way in a conflicted world of scientific and religious explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Taylor, F. Mind and Matter - Essays Scientific &amp; Christian, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

The book consists of a [[preface]], personal [[Introduction (writing)|introduction]], and twelve [[essay]]s, read to the followers of the Catholic Church. The essays reflect on various, more or less controversial issues dividing religion and science, such as [[materialism]], [[pain]], and [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Taylor, F. Mind and Matter - Essays Scientific &amp; Christian, 1951, e.g. chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Taylor, F. Mind and Matter - Essays Scientific &amp; Christian, 1951, e.g. chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Taylor, F. Mind and Matter - Essays Scientific &amp; Christian, 1951, e.g. chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; They have been written at different times and therefore represent the shifting views of the author, as he searches for decisive arguments. All essays have been intended to fall in line with "the [[Christian theology|Christian doctrine]] and common sense".&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Taylor, F. Mind and Matter - Essays Scientific &amp; Christian, 1951, preface&lt;/ref&gt;

== Book contents ==
=== Preface ===
In the [[preface]], the author informs the reader of the position he has assumed when writing the essays - one of a formerly confused, but now reassured, believer.

=== Personal introduction ===
First [[Chapter (books)|chapter]], adequately titled Personal Introduction, gives insightful information on why a scientifically inclined and critical person would choose to return to Church, after having been exposed to various religious and scientific influences throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood Taylor, F. Mind and Matter - Essays Scientific &amp; Christian, 1951, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter provides rich insights into author's early experiences, such as growing up in an [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] family, receiving Christian education, praying, learning the [[Bible]], and partaking in various religious customs and traditions, all very typical of the times, place, and author's social class. However, despite these influences, Sherwood Taylor had great difficulties accepting faith and religion as they were presented to him. Realization that religion might lack rational foundation has severely swayed his views, and initiated an over 40-year long journey in quest of an ultimate verdict between religion and materialism. Along the way, the author has encountered themes such as [[mind and body]], physical concepts of [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]], [[mass]], and [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[perception]], [[superstitions]], [[consciousness]], [[spiritualism]], [[qualia]] and many more, all having great influence on the author and contributing to his understanding of the world, but still not decisive. Sherwood Taylor's problem with materialism lied in its inability to account for mental experiences, and for the sense of "self" as a thinking entity. Additionally, scientific praise of [[determinism]] was hardly in line with Sherwood Taylor's belief in [[free will|will]] and choice. Despite his great respect for science, the author started to find it increasingly difficult to believe that science could ever explain his life, thoughts, and experiences, his poetic, and mystic side, desperately searching for God.

A pivotal turn took place, when F. Sherwood Taylor accidentally received a letter meant for a member of the [[Rationalist Association|Rationalist Press Association]], asking to give a lecture on [[Galileo]]. Despite a mistake, Sherwood Taylor offered his services, and soon found himself an expert on Galileo's case. While investigating the matter, he came to the conclusion, that Galileo's story was full of deliberate distortions implemented by anti-Catholic and "rational" writers. This made him realize that science is guilty of all the offences usually assigned to Church - it's ill-founded, wicked, deceitful, and superstitious. Following this and other events, including hearing a voice in his head say "Why are you wasting your life?", F. Sherwood Taylor started to see [[Christianity]] as the purest and most intelligible of religions, offering so long-sought solutions to many countless problems of life. Additionally, his career in [[chemistry]] begun to feel uncomfortable, as it was contributing to a [[materialism|materialist worldview]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, P., J. Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain, 2001, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and, although not without doubts, has made up his mind.

The remaining of the book presents 12 essays, which are F. Sherwood Taylor's attempt at progressive, but not final, integration of the religious and scientific methodologies and ways of considering and understanding the world.

=== Essays ===
*The Deficiencies of Materialism
*Science, Philosophy and Religion
*Biology and Man
*Evolution and Religion
*The Problem of Pain in Nature
*On the Excellence of Things
*The Vocation of Science
*The Place of Science in Christian Education
*Some Moral Problems Raised by Science
*The Church and Science
*Mysticism, Christian and Pagan
*The Catholic Layman and His Responsibilities

==Reception==
The book has been [[book review|reviewed]] by Sister Francis Augustine Richey, who regards the author as "a distinguished scientist, a convert moreover from the fringes of scientism to catholicism, a writer with a singularly gifted mind, sensitive, imaginative, intuitive and logical".&lt;ref&gt;Richey, F., A. Man and Matter, 1954, College of Saint Elizabeth, Convent, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt; She states, that as a chemist and historian of science, Sherwood Taylor relies on experience, and writes from a position that emphasizes the appreciation of science. However, he does so in a thoughtful and critical manner, raising "an inspiring call into the battle against materialism". He engages in a careful analysis of [[scientific method]] and knowledge, and does so from an easily approachable objective perspective, which Sister Francis Augustine Richey calls "impersonally personal". She describes the book as valuable and illuminating for "teacher and pupil whether of science, philosophy, or religion".

[[File:Mécanique analytique.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''Mécanique analytique'' (1788)&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''''Mécanique analytique''''' (1788–89) is a two volume French treatise on [[analytical mechanics]], written by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], and published 101 years following [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. It consolidated into one unified and harmonious system, the scattered developments of contributors such as [[Alexis Clairaut]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], [[Leonhard Euler]], and [[Johann Bernoulli|Johann]] and [[Jacob Bernoulli]] in the historical transition from geometrical methods, as presented in Newton's ''Principia'', to the methods of [[mathematical analysis]]. The treatise expounds a great labor-saving and thought-saving general analytical method by which every mechanical question may be stated in a single algebraic equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{w|Robert Simpson Woodward}}, "An Historical Survey of the Science of Mechanics" (Nov. 26, 1894) address to the {{w|New York Academy of Sciences}}, as quoted in ''Science'' (Feb. 8, 1895) Vol. 1, No. 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hnlQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA148 p. 148.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lagrange wrote that this work was entirely new and that his intent was to reduce the theory and the art of solving mechanics problems to general formulae, providing all the equations necessary for the solution of each problem. He stated that...&lt;ref&gt;''Mécanique analytique'' (1788) Tr. [[E. W. Hobson]], ''Mathematics, from the points of view of the Mathematician and of the Physicist'' (1912) an address delivered to the Mathematical and Physical Society of {{w|University College London}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=H7Y_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p.13.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;No diagrams will be found in this work. The methods that I explain require neither geometrical, nor mechanical, constructions or reasoning, but only algebraical operations in accordance with regular and uniform procedure. Those who love Analysis will see with pleasure that Mechanics has become a branch of it, and will be grateful to me for having thus extended its domain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ernst Mach]] describes the work as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mach]], ''Die Mechanik in Ihrer Entwicklung Historisch-Kritsch Dargestellt'' (1883, 1888) Tr. Thomas J. McCormick ''The Science of Mechanics'' (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Analytic mechanics... was brought to the highest degree of perfection... Lagrange's aim is... to dispose, ''once and for all'', of the reasoning necessary to resolve mechanical problems, by embodying as much as possible of it in a single formula. This he did. Every case... can now be dealt with by a very simple... schema; and whatever reasoning is left is performed by purely mechanical methods. The mechanics of Lagrange is a stupendous contribution to the economy of thought.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vayda]] and research team between 1979 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/p666h42218624877/ | doi=10.1007/BF00891376 | volume=11 | title=Progressive contextualization: Methods for research in human ecology | year=1983 | journal=Human Ecology | pages=265–281 | last1 = Vayda | first1 = Andrew P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method was developed to help understand cause of damage and [[deforestation|destruction of forest]] and land during the New Order Regime in [[Indonesia]], as well as practical [[ethnography]]. Vayda proposed the Progressive contextualization method due to his dissatisfaction with several conventional [[anthropological]] methods to describe accurately and quickly cases of [[illegal logging]], land destruction and the network of actor-investor protecting the actions, as well as various consequences detrimental to the [[Natural environment|environment]] and social life.

The essence of this method is to track and assess: 
# what the actor (actor-based) or network of certain actors (actor-based network) does in a certain location and time
# the series of consequences (intended or unintended) that result from what the actors and/or networks do, in a time and space that can be different from the original time and space, as long as it is in accordance with the interest of the research and the available time. Therefore, the PC method does not have to be bound to a certain research place and time pre-determined in the research design.

It rejects the assumption of ecological and socio-cultural [[wikt:homogeneity|homogeneity]]. Instead, it focuses on [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and it looks at how different individuals and groups operate in and adapt to their total environments through a variety of behaviors, technologies, organizations, structures and beliefs.

:''Due attention to context in the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elucidate elucidation] of actions and consequences may often mean having to deal with precisely the kind of factors and processes often scanted or denied by holistic approaches: the loose, transient, and contingent interactions, the disarticulating processes, and the movements of people, resources, and ideas across whatever boundaries that ecosystems, societies, and cultures are thought to have'' &amp;mdash; [[Andrew P. Vayda|Vayda]], 1986

Based on such a premise and through the practical interpretation of facts, the approach will lead to 'concrete findings on who is doing what, why they are doing it, and with what effects.'

[[File:Proportional variables.svg|thumb|Variable ''y'' is directly proportional to the variable ''x''.]]
In [[mathematics]], two variables are '''proportional''' if there is always a constant [[ratio]] between them. The constant is called the [[coefficient]] of proportionality or '''proportionality constant'''.

*If one variable is always [[wiktionary:product#|the product]] of the other variable and a constant, the two are said to be ''directly proportional''. {{nowrap|''x'' and ''y''}} are directly proportional if the [[ratio]] {{sfrac|''y''|''x''}} is constant.
*If the product of the two variables is always a constant, the two are said to be ''inversely proportional''. {{nowrap|''x'' and ''y''}} are inversely proportional if the product ''xy'' is constant.

The statement "''y'' is directly proportional to ''x''" is written mathematically as "{{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''cx''}}," or "{{nowrap|''y'' ∝ ''x''}}," where ''c'' is the proportionality constant.

The statement "''y'' is inversely proportional to ''x''" is written mathematically as "{{nowrap|1=''y'' = {{sfrac|''c''|''x''}}}}." This is equivalent to "''y'' is directly proportional to {{sfrac|1|''x''}}."

==Direct proportionality ==
Given two [[variable (math)|variable]]s ''x'' and ''y'', ''y'' is '''directly proportional''' to ''x''&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Directly Proportional". [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DirectlyProportional.html ''MathWorld'' – A Wolfram Web Resource].&lt;/ref&gt; if there is a non-zero constant ''k'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;y = kx.&lt;/math&gt;

* {{unichar|223c|tilde operator|html=}}
* {{unichar|223a|GEOMETRIC PROPORTION|html=}}
''See also:'' [[Equals sign]]
|}

The relation is often denoted, using the ∝ or ~ symbol, as

:&lt;math&gt;y \propto x,&lt;/math&gt;

and the constant ratio

:&lt;math&gt; k = \frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the '''proportionality constant''', '''constant of variation''' or '''constant of proportionality'''. This can also be viewed as a two-variable [[linear equation]] with a [[y-intercept]] of 0.

===Examples===
* If an object travels at a constant [[speed]], then the [[distance]] traveled is directly proportional to the [[time]] spent traveling, with the speed being the constant of proportionality.
*The [[circumference]] of a [[circle]] is directly proportional to its [[diameter]], with the constant of proportionality equal to [[pi|π]].
*On a [[map]] of a sufficiently small area, drawn to [[scale (map)|scale]] distances, the distance between any two points on the map is directly proportional to the length of the projected line between the two locations that the points represent, with the constant of proportionality being the scale of the map.
*The [[force (physics)|force]], acting on a certain object across short distances due to [[gravity]], is directly proportional to the object's sufficiently small [[mass]]; the constant of proportionality between the force and the mass is known as [[gravitational acceleration]].
*The net force acting on an object is proportional to the acceleration of that object. The constant of proportionality in this, [[Newton's Second Law]], is the classical mass of the object.

===Properties===
Since

:&lt;math&gt; y = kx &lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;x = \left(\frac{1}{k}\right)y,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that if ''y'' is directly proportional to ''x'', with (nonzero) proportionality constant ''k'', then ''x'' is also directly proportional to ''y'', with proportionality constant {{sfrac|''k''}}.

If ''y'' is directly proportional to ''x'', then the graph of ''y'' as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of ''x'' is a [[line (mathematics)|straight line]] passing through the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] with the [[slope]] of the line equal to the constant of proportionality: it corresponds to [[linear growth]].

== Inverse proportionality  ==
[[File:Inverse proportionality function plot.gif|thumb|300x300px|Inverse proportionality with a function of {{nowrap|1=''y'' = {{sfrac|1|''x''}}}}.]]&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Poliomyelitis]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] --&gt;

The concept of ''inverse proportionality'' can be contrasted with ''direct proportionality''. Consider two variables said to be "inversely proportional" to each other. [[Ceteris paribus|If all other variables are held constant]], the magnitude or absolute value of one inversely proportional variable decreases if the other variable increases, while their product (the constant of proportionality ''k'') is always the same. As an example, the time taken for a journey is inversely proportional to the speed of travel.

Formally, two variables are '''inversely proportional''' (also called '''varying inversely''', in '''inverse variation''', in '''inverse proportion''', in '''reciprocal proportion''') if each of the variables is directly proportional to the [[multiplicative inverse]] (reciprocal) of the other, or equivalently if their [[Product (mathematics)|product]] is a constant.&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Inversely Proportional".  [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InverselyProportional.html ''MathWorld'' – A Wolfram Web Resource].&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the variable ''y'' is inversely proportional to the variable ''x'' if there exists a non-zero constant ''k'' such that
: &lt;math&gt;y = \left(\frac{k}{x}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently &lt;math&gt;xy=k.&lt;/math&gt; Hence the constant is the product of ''x'' and  ''y''.

The graph of two variables varying inversely on the [[Cartesian coordinate]] plane is a [[rectangular hyperbola]]. The product of the ''x'' and ''y'' values of each point on the curve equals the constant of proportionality (''k''). Since neither ''x'' nor ''y'' can equal zero (because ''k'' is non-zero), the graph never crosses either axis.

==Hyperbolic coordinates==
{{Main|Hyperbolic coordinates}}
The concepts of ''direct'' and ''inverse'' proportion lead to the location of points in the Cartesian plane by [[hyperbolic coordinates]]; the two coordinates correspond to the constant of direct proportionality that specifies a point as being on a particular [[line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]] and the constant of inverse proportionality that specifies a point as being on a particular hyperbola.

'''Reagent bottles''', also known as '''media bottles''' or '''graduated bottles''', are containers made of [[glass]], [[plastic]], [[Borosilicate glass|borosilicate]] or related substances, and topped by special [[Bottle cap|caps]] or [[Stopper (plug)|stoppers]] and are intended to contain [[chemical]]s in [[liquid]] or powder form for [[Laboratory|laboratories]] and stored in [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinets]] or on shelves. Some reagent bottles are tinted amber (actinic), brown or red to protect light-sensitive chemical compounds from visible light, ultraviolet and infrared radiation which may alter them; other bottles are tinted blue (cobalt glass) or uranium green for decorative purposes -mostly vintage apothecary sets, from centuries in which a doctor or apothecary was a prominent figure. The bottles are called "graduated" when they have marks on the sides indicating the approximate (often with a 10% error) amount of liquid at a given level within the container. A reagent bottle is a type of [[laboratory glassware]]. The term "[[reagent]]" refers to a substance that is part of a [[chemical reaction]] (or an [[ingredient]] of which), and "media" is the plural form of "[[Processing medium|medium]]" which refers to the liquid or gas which a reaction happens within, or is a processing chemical tool such as (for example) a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]].

Several companies produce reagent bottles, including [[Wheaton Industries|Wheaton]], [[Kimble Chase|Kimble]], [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]], [[Schott AG]] and trademark glass names include [[Pyrex]], [[Kimax]], [[Borosilicate glass|Duran]], Boro and [[Bomex]].

Common bottle sizes include 100 ml, 250 ml, 500 ml, 1000 ml (1 liter) and 2000 ml (2 liter). Older bottles, especially for medical use and for expensive chemicals, can be found of capacities well under 100 ml. 

The selection of caps and stoppers that reagent bottles are closed with are as important as the material the bottles are made of, and the decision as to which cap to use is dependent on the material stored in the container, and the amount of heat which the cap can be subject to. Common cap sizes include 33-430 (33mm), 38-430 (38mm), and GL 45 (45mm). Caps range in size from narrow mouthed to wide mouthed and often a glass or plastic [[funnel]] is needed to properly fill a reagent bottle from a larger or equal sized container's mouth. Reagent bottle caps are commonly said to be "[[Autoclave|autoclavable]]".

Antique or vintage reagent bottles tend to resemble the classic apothecary bottle and have a glass stopper, very often not of standard size, so that very old bottles and samples should be stored with care, as replacing a missing glass stopper would require dedicated glassworking.

Reagent bottles are subject to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations, and global scientific standards.

[[file:Edward J Routh.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Edward John Routh]], 1831–1907.]]

In [[analytical mechanics]], a branch of [[theoretical physics]], '''Routhian mechanics''' is a hybrid formulation of [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] developed by [[Edward John Routh]]. Correspondingly, the '''Routhian''' is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] which replaces both the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] functions.

The Routhian, like the Hamiltonian, can be obtained from a [[Legendre transform]] of the Lagrangian, and has a similar mathematical form to the Hamiltonian, but is not exactly the same. The difference between the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and Routhian functions are their variables. For a given set of [[generalized coordinates]] representing the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in the system, the Lagrangian is a function of the coordinates and velocities, while the Hamiltonian is a function of the coordinates and momenta.

The Routhian differs from these functions in that some coordinates are chosen to have corresponding generalized velocities, the rest to have corresponding generalized momenta. This choice is arbitrary, and can be done to simplify the problem. It also has the consequence that the '''Routhian equations''' are exactly the Hamiltonian equations for some coordinates and corresponding momenta, and the Lagrangian equations for the rest of the coordinates and their velocities. In each case the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are replaced by a single function, the Routhian. The full set thus has the advantages of both sets of equations, with the convenience of splitting one set of coordinates to the Hamilton equations, and the rest to the Lagrangian equations.

Often the Routhian approach may offer no advantage, but one notable case where this is useful is when a system has [[cyclic coordinates]] (also called "ignorable coordinates"), by definition those coordinates which do not appear in the original Lagrangian. The Lagrangian equations are powerful results, used frequently in theory and practice, since the equations of motion in the coordinates are easy to set up. However, if cyclic coordinates occur there will still be equations to solve for all the coordinates, including the cyclic coordinates despite their absence in the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian equations are useful theoretical results, but less useful in practice because coordinates and momenta are related together in the solutions - after solving the equations the coordinates and momenta must be eliminated from each other. Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian equations are perfectly suited to cyclic coordinates because the equations in the cyclic coordinates trivially vanish, leaving only the equations in the non cyclic coordinates.

The Routhian approach has the best of both approaches, because cyclic coordinates can be split off to the Hamiltonian equations and eliminated, leaving behind the non cyclic coordinates to be solved from the Lagrangian equations. Overall fewer equations need to be solved compared to the Lagrangian approach.

As with the rest of analytical mechanics, Routhian mechanics is completely equivalent to Newtonian mechanics, all other formulations of classical mechanics, and introduces no new physics. It offers an alternative way to solve mechanical problems.

==Definitions==

In the case of Lagrangian mechanics, the [[generalized coordinates]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ... and the corresponding velocities {{math|''dq''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dq''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ...}}, and possibly time&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The coordinates are functions of time, so the Lagrangian always has implicit time-dependence via the coordinates. If the Lagrangian changes with time irrespective of the coordinates, usually due to some time-dependent potential, then the Lagrangian is said to have "explicit" time-dependence. Similarly for the Hamiltonian and Routhian functions.&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''t''}}, enter the Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt;L(q_1,q_2,\ldots,\dot{q}_1,\dot{q}_2,\ldots,t)\,, \quad \dot{q}_i = \frac{d q_i}{dt} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the overdots denote [[time derivative]]s.

In Hamiltonian mechanics, the generalized coordinates {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} and the corresponding generalized momenta {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,}} and possibly time, enter the Hamiltonian,

:&lt;math&gt;H(q_1,q_2,\ldots,p_1,p_2,\ldots,t) = \sum_i \dot{q}_ip_i - L(q_1,q_2,\ldots,\dot{q}_1(p_1),\dot{q}_2(p_2),\ldots,t) \,, \quad p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the second equation is the definition of the generalized momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} corresponding to the coordinate {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} ([[partial derivative]]s are denoted using {{math|∂}}). The velocities {{math|''dq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} are expressed as functions of their corresponding momenta by inverting their defining relation. In this context, {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is said to be the momentum "canonically conjugate" to {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The Routhian is intermediate between {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''H''}}; some coordinates {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are chosen to have corresponding generalized momenta {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the rest of the coordinates {{math|''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to have generalized velocities {{math|''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ..., ''dζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}, and time may appear explicitly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where again the generalized velocity {{math|''dq''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt''}} is to be expressed as a function of generalized momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} via its defining relation. The choice of which {{math|''n''}} coordinates are to have corresponding momenta, out of the {{math|''n'' + ''s''}} coordinates, is arbitrary.

The above is used by [[course of theoretical physics|Landau and Lifshitz]], and [[Classical Mechanics (Goldstein book)|Goldstein]]. Some authors may define the Routhian to be the negative of the above definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the length of the general definition, a more compact notation is to use boldface for [[tuple]]s (or vectors) of the variables, thus {{math|'''q''' {{=}} (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, {{math|'''ζ''' {{=}} (''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, {{math|'''p''' {{=}} (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, and {{math|''d'' '''ζ'''/''dt'' {{=}} (''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ..., ''dζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt'')}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;R(\mathbf{q},\boldsymbol{\zeta}, \mathbf{p}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}}, t) = \mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{{\mathbf{q}}} - L(\mathbf{q}, \boldsymbol{\zeta}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}},t) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where · is the [[dot product]] defined on the tuples, for the specific example appearing here:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{{\mathbf{q}}} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dot{q}_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Equations of motion==

For reference, the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian equations]] for {{math|''s''}} degrees of freedom are a set of {{math|''s''}} coupled second order [[ordinary differential equation]]s in the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_j} \,,  &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''s''}}, and the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian equations]] for {{math|''n''}} degrees of freedom are a set of {{math|2''n''}} coupled first order ordinary differential equations in the coordinates and momenta

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} \,,\quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Below, the Routhian equations of motion are obtained in two ways, in the process other useful derivatives are found that can be used elsewhere.

===Two degrees of freedom===

Consider the case of a system with two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''ζ''}}, with generalized velocities {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} and {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}, and the Lagrangian is time-dependent. (The generalization to any number of degrees of freedom follows exactly the same procedure as with two).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lagrangian of the system will have the form

:&lt;math&gt; L(q, \zeta, \dot{q}, \dot{\zeta}, t) &lt;/math&gt;

The [[differential of a function|differential]] of {{math|''L''}} is

:&lt;math&gt; dL = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}d\dot{q} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Now change variables, from the set ({{math|''q''}}, {{math|''ζ''}}, {{math|''dq''/''dt''}}, {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}) to ({{math|''q''}}, {{math|''ζ''}}, {{math|''p''}}, {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}), simply switching the velocity {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} to the momentum {{math|''p''}}. This change of variables in the differentials is the [[Legendre transformation]]. The differential of the new function to replace {{math|''L''}} will be a sum of differentials in {{math|''dq''}}, {{math|''dζ''}}, {{math|''dp''}}, {{math|''d''(''dζ''/''dt'')}}, and {{math|''dt''}}. Using the definition of generalized momentum and Lagrange's equation for the coordinate {{math|''q''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \,,\quad  \dot{p} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; dL = \dot{p}dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + p d\dot{q} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt &lt;/math&gt;

and to replace {{math|''pd''(''dq''/''dt'')}} by {{math|(''dq''/''dt'')''dp''}}, recall the [[product rule]] for differentials,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For two functions {{math|''u''}} and {{math|''v''}}, the differential of the product is {{math|''d''(''uv'') {{=}} ''udv'' + ''vdu''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and substitute

:&lt;math&gt; pd\dot{q} = d(\dot{q} p) - \dot{q}dp &lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the differential of a new function in terms of the new set of variables:

:&lt;math&gt; d(L-p\dot{q}) = \dot{p} dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta  - \dot{q} dp + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the Routhian

:&lt;math&gt; R(q,\zeta,p,\dot{\zeta},t) = p \dot{q}(p) - L &lt;/math&gt;

where again the velocity {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} is a function of the momentum {{math|''p''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt; dR = -\dot{p} dq - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta  + \dot{q}dp - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt\,, &lt;/math&gt;

but from the above definition, the differential of the Routhian is

:&lt;math&gt; dR = \frac{\partial R }{\partial q}dq + \frac{\partial R }{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + \frac{\partial R }{\partial p}dp + \frac{\partial R }{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial R}{\partial t}dt \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the coefficients of the differentials {{math|''dq''}}, {{math|''dζ''}}, {{math|''dp''}}, {{math|''d''(''dζ''/''dt'')}}, and {{math|''dt''}}, the results are [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]] for the coordinate {{math|''q''}},

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{q} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial p} \,,\quad \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial R}{\partial q} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and [[Lagrange's equation]] for the coordinate {{math|''ζ''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta}  &lt;/math&gt;

which follow from

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta} = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta} \,,\quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and taking the total time derivative of the second equation and equating to the first. Notice the Routhian replaces the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions in all the equations of motion.

The remaining equation states the partial time derivatives of {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} are negatives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial R}{\partial t}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Any number of degrees of freedom===

For {{math|''n'' + ''s''}} coordinates as defined above, with Routhian

:&lt;math&gt;R(q_1,\ldots,q_n,\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s, p_1, \ldots,p_n , \dot{\zeta}_1 , \ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dot{q}_i(p_i) - L&lt;/math&gt;

the equations of motion can be derived by a Legendre transformation of this Routhian as in the previous section, but another way is to simply take the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the coordinates {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, momenta {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}, where {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''n''}}, and {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''s''}}. The derivatives are

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i} = -\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} = - \dot{p}_i &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial p_i} = \dot{q}_i &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta_j} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial t} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first two are identically the Hamiltonian equations. Equating the total time derivative of the fourth set of equations with the third (for each value of {{math|''j''}}) gives the Lagrangian equations. The fifth is just the same relation between time partial derivatives as before. To summarize&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{equation box 1
|indent = :
|background colour = white
|border colour =black
|border = 1
|title = '''Routhian equations of motion''' (''n'' + ''s'' degrees of freedom)
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial R}{\partial p_i} \,,\quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i}  \,,  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} \,. &lt;/math&gt;
}}

The total number of equations is {{math|2''n'' + ''s''}}, there are {{math|2''n''}} Hamiltonian equations plus {{math|''s''}} Lagrange equations.

==Energy==

Since the Lagrangian has the same units as [[energy]], the units of the Routhian are also energy. In [[SI units]] this is the [[Joule]].

Taking the total time derivative of the Lagrangian leads to the general result

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = \frac{d }{d t}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} + \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} - L\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the Lagrangian is independent of time, the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian is zero, {{math|∂''L''/∂''t'' {{=}} 0}}, so the quantity under the total time derivative in brackets must be a constant, it is the total energy of the system&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} + \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} - L\,.&lt;/math&gt;

(If there are external fields interacting with the constituents of the system, they can vary throughout space but not time). This expression requires the partial derivatives of {{math|''L''}} with respect to ''all'' the velocities {{math|''dq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} and {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}. Under the same condition of {{math|''R''}} being time independent, the energy in terms of the Routhian is a little simpler, substituting the definition of {{math|''R''}} and the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}},

:&lt;math&gt;E = R - \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice only the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} are needed. In the case that {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} and the Routhian is explicitly time-independent, then {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''R''}}, that is, the Routhian equals the energy of the system. The same expression for {{math|''R''}} in when {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} is also the Hamiltonian, so in all {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''R'' {{=}} ''H''}}.

If the Routhian has explicit time dependence, the total energy of the system is not constant. The general result is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = \dfrac{d}{dt}\left(R - \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be derived from the total time derivative of {{math|''R''}} in the same way as for {{math|''L''}}.

==Cyclic coordinates==

The Routhian formulation is useful for systems with [[cyclic coordinates]], because by definition those coordinates do not enter {{math|''L''}}, and hence {{math|''R''}}. The corresponding partial derivatives of {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} with respect to those coordinates are zero, which equates to the corresponding generalized momenta reducing to constants. To make this concrete, if the {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are all cyclic coordinates, and the {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are all non cyclic, then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}  = \dot{p}_i = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_i = \alpha_i \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are constants. With these constants substituted into the Routhian, {{math|''R''}} is a function of only the non cyclic coordinates and velocities (and in general time also)

:&lt;math&gt;R(\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n,\dot{\zeta}_1,\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\dot{q}_i(\alpha_i) - L(\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s,\dot{q}_1(\alpha_1),\ldots,\dot{q}_n(\alpha_n),\dot{\zeta}_1,\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|2''n''}} Hamiltonian equation in the cyclic coordinates automatically vanishes,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i=\frac{\partial R}{\partial \alpha_i}=f_i( \zeta_1(t),\ldots,\zeta_s(t), \dot{\zeta}_1(t),\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s(t), \alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n,t) \,,\quad \dot{p}_i=-\frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i}=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''s''}} Lagrangian equations are in the non cyclic coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the problem has been reduced to solving the Lagrangian equations in the non cyclic coordinates, with the advantage of the Hamiltonian equations cleanly removing the cyclic coordinates. Using those solutions, the equations for &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i&lt;/math&gt;can be integrated to compute &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we are interested in how the cyclic coordinates change with time, the equations for the generalized velocities corresponding to the cyclic coordinates can be integrated.

==Examples==

The Routhian method does not guarantee the equations of motion will be simple, however it will lead to fewer equations.

=== Central potential in spherical coordinates ===

One general class of mechanical systems with cyclic coordinates are those with [[central potential]]s, because potentials of this form only have dependence on radial separations and no dependence on angles.

Consider a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} under the influence of a central potential {{math|''V''(''r'')}} in [[spherical polar coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}}

:&lt;math&gt;L(r,\dot{r},\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi}) = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{r}^2 + {r}^2\dot{\theta}^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}^2) - V(r) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice {{math|''φ''}} is cyclic, because it does not appear in the Lagrangian. The momentum conjugate to {{math|''φ''}} is the constant

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = mr^2\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} can vary with time, but the angular momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant. The Routhian can be taken to be

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(r,\dot{r},\theta,\dot{\theta}) &amp; = p_\phi\dot{\phi} - L \\
&amp; = p_\phi\dot{\phi} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} + V(r) \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + V(r) \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi^2 }{2mr^2\sin^2\theta} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + V(r) \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''θ''}} using Lagrange's equations, and do not need to solve for {{math|''φ''}} since it is eliminated by Hamiltonian's equations. The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad-m\ddot{r} = -\frac{p_\phi^2}{mr^3\sin^2\theta} - mr\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad -m(2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^2\ddot{\theta}) = -\frac{p_\phi^2\cos\theta}{mr^2\sin^3\theta} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The Routhian approach has obtained two coupled nonlinear equations. By contrast the Lagrangian approach leads to ''three'' nonlinear coupled equations, mixing in the first and second time derivatives of {{math|''φ''}} in all of them, despite its absence from the Lagrangian.

The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{r} = mr\dot{\theta}^2 + mr\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}^2 - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^2\ddot{\theta} = r^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\phi}^2\,, &lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2r\dot{r}\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi} + 2r^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta \dot{\theta}\dot{\phi} + r^2\sin^2\theta \ddot{\phi}=0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetric mechanical systems===

====Spherical pendulum====

[[File:Spherical pendulum Lagrangian mechanics.svg|thumb|300px|Spherical pendulum: angles and velocities.]]

Consider the [[spherical pendulum]], a mass {{math|''m''}} (known as a "pendulum bob") attached to a rigid rod of length {{math|''l''}} of negligible mass, subject to a local gravitational field {{math|''g''}}. The system rotates with angular velocity {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} which is ''not'' constant. The angle between the rod and vertical is {{math|''θ''}} and is ''not'' constant.

The Lagrangian is&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The potential energy is actually
:&lt;math&gt;V=mg\ell(1-\cos\theta)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
but since the first term is constant, it can be ignored in the Lagrangian (and Routhian) which only depend on derivatives of coordinates and velocities. Subtracting this from the kinetic energy means a plus sign in the Lagrangian, not minus.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi}) = \frac{m\ell^2}{2}(\dot{\theta}^2 + \sin^2\theta \dot{\phi}^2) + mg\ell\cos\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''φ''}} is the cyclic coordinate for the system with constant momentum

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = m\ell^2\sin^2\theta \dot{\phi} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

which again is physically the angular momentum of the system about the vertical. The angle {{math|''θ''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} vary with time, but the angular momentum is constant. The Routhian is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(\theta,\dot{\theta}) &amp; = p_\phi \dot{\phi} - L \\
&amp; = p_\phi \dot{\phi} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{p_\phi \dot{\phi}}{2} - mg\ell\cos\theta \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi \dot{\phi}}{2} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2  - mg\ell\cos\theta \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi^2 }{2m\ell^2\sin^2\theta} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2 - mg\ell\cos\theta
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is found from the Lagrangian equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad - m\ell^2\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{p_\phi^2 \cos\theta}{m\ell^2\sin^3\theta} + mg\ell\sin\theta \,,&lt;/math&gt;

or simplifying by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_\phi^2}{m^2\ell^4}\,,\quad b = \frac{g}{\ell} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

gives

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta} = a\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^3\theta} - b \sin\theta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation resembles the simple nonlinear [[pendulum equation]], because it can swing through the vertical axis, with an additional term to account for the rotation about the vertical axis (the constant {{math|''a''}} is related to the angular momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}).

Applying the Lagrangian approach there are two nonlinear coupled equations to solve.

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ell^2\ddot{\theta} = m\ell^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\phi}^2 -mg\ell\sin\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2\sin\theta\cos\theta \dot{\theta}\dot{\phi} + \sin^2\theta \ddot{\phi}=0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

====Heavy symmetrical top====

[[File:Heavy symmetric top euler angles.svg|thumb|Heavy symmetric top in terms of the Euler angles.]]

The heavy [[symmetrical top]] of mass {{math|''M''}} has Lagrangian&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble|Berkshire|2004|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\psi},\dot{\phi})=\frac{I_1}{2}(\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{\phi}^2\sin^2\theta) + \frac{I_3}{2}(\dot{\psi}^2+\dot{\phi}^2\cos^2\theta)+I_3\dot{\psi}\dot{\phi}\cos\theta-Mg\ell\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ψ'', ''φ'', ''θ''}} are the [[Euler angles]], {{math|''θ''}} is the angle between the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis and the top's {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, {{math|''ψ''}} is the rotation of the top about its own {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, and {{math|''φ''}} the azimuthal of the top's {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis around the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis. The principal [[moments of inertia]] are {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''x''&amp;prime;}} axis, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''y''&amp;prime;}} axes, and {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis. Since the top is symmetric about its {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Here the simple relation for local [[gravitational potential energy]] {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''Mgl''cos''θ''}} is used where {{math|''g''}} is the acceleration due to gravity, and the centre of mass of the top is a distance {{math|''l''}} from its tip along its {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis.

The angles {{math|''ψ'', ''φ''}} are cyclic. The constant momenta are the angular momenta of the top about its axis and its precession about the vertical, respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\psi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\psi}} = I_3\dot{\psi} + I_3\dot{\phi} \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \dot{\phi}(I_1\sin^2\theta + I_3\cos^2\theta) + I_3\dot{\psi}\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

From these, eliminating {{math|''dψ''/''dt''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta = I_1\dot{\phi}\sin^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\phi} = \frac{p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^2\theta}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

and to eliminate {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}}, substitute this result into {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and solve for {{math|''dψ''/''dt''}} to find

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\psi} = \frac{p_\psi}{I_3} - \cos\theta \left(\frac{p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^2\theta}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The Routhian can be taken to be

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,\dot{\theta}) = p_\psi\dot{\psi} + p_\phi\dot{\phi} - L = \frac{1}{2}(p_\psi\dot{\psi} + p_\phi\dot{\phi}) - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

and since

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} = \frac{p_\phi^2}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_\psi \dot{\psi}}{2} = \frac{p_\psi^2}{2I_3} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta  }{2I_1\sin^2\theta} + \frac{p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;R =  \frac{p_\psi^2}{2I_3} + \frac{p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} + \frac{p_\phi^2}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta}{4I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first term is constant, and can be ignored since only the derivatives of ''R'' will enter the equations of motion. The simplified Routhian, without loss of information, is thus

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{1}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}\left[p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta + p_\phi^2 - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \cos\theta\right] - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of motion for {{math|''θ''}} is, by direct calculation,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-I_1\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^3\theta}\left[p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta + p_\phi^2 - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \cos\theta\right] + \frac{1}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} \left[-2 p_\psi^2 \cos\theta\sin\theta + \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \sin\theta\right] -Mg\ell\sin\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

or by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_\psi^2}{I_1^2} \,,\quad b = \frac{p_\phi^2}{I_1^2}\,,\quad c=\frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2 I_1^2}\,,\quad k= \frac{Mg\ell}{I_1}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

a simpler form of the equation is obtained

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta} = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^3\theta}( a\cos^2\theta +b -c\cos\theta ) + \frac{1}{2\sin\theta} (2 a \cos\theta - c) + k\sin\theta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Although the equation is highly nonlinear, there is only one equation to solve for, it was obtained directly, and the cyclic coordinates are not involved.

By contrast, the Lagrangian approach leads to ''three'' nonlinear coupled equations to solve, despite the absence of the coordinates {{math|''ψ''}} and {{math|''φ''}} in the Lagrangian.

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow \quad I_1\ddot{\theta} = (I_1- I_3)\dot{\phi}^2\sin\theta\cos\theta -I_3\dot{\psi}\dot{\phi}\sin\theta +Mg\ell\sin\theta\,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''ψ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\psi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \psi} \quad\Rightarrow \quad  \ddot{\psi} +  \ddot{\phi}\cos\theta - \dot{\phi}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta= 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow \quad \ddot{\phi}(I_1\sin^2\theta + I_3\cos^2\theta) + \dot{\phi}(I_1 - I_3)2\sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\theta} + I_3\ddot{\psi}\cos\theta - I_3\dot{\psi}\sin\theta\dot{\theta} =0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Velocity-dependent potentials ===

==== Classical charged particle in a uniform magnetic field ====
[[File:Charged particle in uniform B field.svg|thumb|300px|Classical charged particle in uniform '''B''' field, using cylindrical coordinates. '''Top:''' If the radial coordinate {{math|''r''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} vary, the trajectory is a helicoid with varying radius but uniform motion in the {{math|''z''}} direction. '''Bottom:''' Constant {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} means a helicoid with constant radius.]]

Consider a classical [[charged particle]] of mass {{math|''m''}} and [[electric charge]] {{math|''q''}} in a static (time-independent) uniform (constant throughout space) [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble|Berkshire|2004|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lagrangian for a charged particle in a general [[electromagnetic field]] given by the [[magnetic potential]] {{math|'''A'''}} and [[electric potential]] {{math|''φ''}} is

:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{m}{2} \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 - q \phi + q \dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient to use [[cylindrical coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''z'')}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{v} = (v_r, v_\theta,v_z) = (\dot{r},r\dot{\theta},\dot{z}) \,, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = (B_r,B_\theta,B_z) = (0,0,B)\,. &lt;/math&gt;

In this case the electric potential is zero, {{math|''φ'' {{=}} 0}}, and we can choose the axial gauge for the magnetic potential

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{B}\times\mathbf{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{A} = (A_r,A_\theta,A_z) = (0,Br/2,0)\,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;L(r,\dot{r},\dot{\theta},\dot{z}) = \frac{m}{2} (\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{z}^2) + \frac{qB r^2\dot{\theta}}{2} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice this potential has an effectively cylindrical symmetry (although it also has angular velocity dependence), since the only spatial dependence is on the radial length from an imaginary cylinder axis.

There are two cyclic coordinates, {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}}. The canonical momenta conjugate to {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} are the constants

:&lt;math&gt;p_{\theta} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot {\theta}} = mr^2\dot {\theta} + \frac{qBr^2}{2}  \,,\quad p_z = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot {z}} = m\dot{z} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so the velocities are

:&lt;math&gt;\dot {\theta} = \frac{1}{mr^2}\left(p_\theta - \frac{qBr^2}{2}\right) \,,\quad \dot{z} = \frac{p_z}{m}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The angular momentum about the ''z'' axis is ''not'' {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, but the quantity {{math|''mr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''dθ''/''dt''}}, which is not conserved due to the contribution from the magnetic field. The canonical momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the conserved quantity. It is still the case that {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the linear or translational momentum along the ''z'' axis, which is also conserved.

The radial component {{math|''r''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} can vary with time, but {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant, and since {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant it follows {{math|''dz''/''dt''}} is constant. The Routhian can take the form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(r,\dot{r}) &amp; = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta}+p_z\dot{z} - L \\
&amp; = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta}+p_z\dot{z} - \frac{m}{2}\dot r^2 - \frac{p_\theta\dot{\theta}}{2} - \frac{p_z\dot{z}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}qBr^2\dot{\theta} \\ 
&amp; =  (p_\theta - qBr^2 )\frac{\dot{\theta}}{2} - \frac{m}{2}\dot r^2 + \frac{p_z\dot{z}}{2} \\ 
&amp; = \frac{1}{2mr^2} \left(p_\theta - qBr^2 \right)\left(p_\theta - \frac{qBr^2}{2} \right) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 + \frac{p_z^2}{2m} \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2mr^2} \left(p_\theta^2 - \frac{3}{2}qBr^2  + \frac{(qB)^2r^4}{2} \right) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2  
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where in the last line, the {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/2''m''}} term is a constant and can be ignored without loss of continuity. The Hamiltonian equations for {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} automatically vanish and do not need to be solved for. The Lagrangian equation in {{math|''r''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} &lt;/math&gt;

is by direct calculation

:&lt;math&gt;-m\ddot{r} = \frac{1}{2m}\left[\frac{-2}{r^3} \left(p_\theta^2 - \frac{3}{2}qBr^2  + \frac{(qB)^2 r^4}{2} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2}(- 3qBr + 2(qB)^2r^3)\right] \,, &lt;/math&gt;

which after collecting terms is

:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{r}=\frac{1}{2m}\left[\frac{2p_{\theta}^2}{r^3}-(qB)^2 r\right] \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and simplifying further by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_{\theta}^2}{m^2} \,,\quad b = - \frac{(qB)^2}{2m^2} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

the differential equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{r} = \frac{a}{r^3} + br  &lt;/math&gt;

To see how {{math|''z''}} changes with time, integrate the momenta expression for {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} above

:&lt;math&gt; z = \frac{p_z}{m}t + c_z \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is an arbitrary constant, the initial value of {{math|''z''}} to be specified in the [[initial conditions]].

The motion of the particle in this system is [[helicoid]]al, with the axial motion uniform (constant) but the radial and angular components varying in a spiral according to the equation of motion derived above. The initial conditions on {{math|''r''}}, {{math|''dr''/''dt''}}, {{math|''θ''}}, {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}}, will determine if the trajectory of the particle has a constant {{math|''r''}} or varying {{math|''r''}}. If initially {{math|''r''}} is nonzero but {{math|''dr''/''dt'' {{=}} 0}}, while {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} are arbitrary, then the initial velocity of the particle has no radial component, {{math|''r''}} is constant, so the motion will be in a perfect helix. If ''r'' is constant, the angular velocity is also constant according to the conserved {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

With the Lagrangian approach, the equation for {{math|''r''}} would include {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} which has to be eliminated, and there would be equations for {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} to solve for.

The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{r} = mr\dot{\theta}^2 + qBr\dot{\theta} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m(2r\dot{r}\dot {\theta} + r^2\ddot {\theta}) + qBr\dot{r} = 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''z''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{z}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{z} = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''z''}} equation is trivial to integrate, but the {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''θ''}} equations are not, in any case the time derivatives are mixed in all the equations and must be eliminated.

A '''scintillation counter''' is an instrument for detecting and measuring [[ionizing radiation]] by using the excitation effect of incident radiation on a scintillating material, and detecting the resultant light pulses. 

It consists of a [[scintillator]] which generates photons in response to incident radiation, a sensitive [[photodetector]] (usually a [[photomultiplier]] tube (PMT), a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera, or a [[photodiode]]), which converts the light to an electrical signal and electronics to process this signal.

Scintillation counters are widely used in radiation protection, assay of radioactive materials and physics research because they can be made inexpensively yet with good [[quantum efficiency]], and can measure both the intensity and the [[Electronvolt|energy]] of incident radiation.

==History==
The modern electronic scintillation counter was invented in 1944 by [[Samuel Curran|Sir Samuel Curran]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL17868379M/Counting_tubes "Counting tubes, theory and applications", Curran, Samuel C., Academic Press (New York), 1949]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69524 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; whilst he was working on the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. There was a requirement to measure the radiation from small quantities of uranium and his innovation was to use one of the newly-available highly sensitive [[photomultiplier]] tubes made by the [[Radio Corporation of America]] to accurately count the flashes of light from a scintillator subjected to radiation.
This built upon the work of earlier researchers such as [[Antoine Henri Becquerel]], who discovered  [[radioactivity]] whilst working on the [[phosphorescence]] of uranium salts in 1896. Previously scintillation events had to be laboriously detected by eye using a [[spinthariscope]] which was a simple microscope to observe light flashes in the scintillator.

==Operation==
[[File:Scintillation Counter Schematic.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Apparatus with a scintillating crystal, [[photomultiplier]], and data acquisition components.]][[File:Scintillation Detector.gif|thumb|animation of radiation scintillation counter]]

When an ionizing particle passes into the scintillator material, atoms are ionized along a track.  For charged particles the track is the path of the particle itself.  For gamma rays (uncharged), their energy is converted to an energetic electron via either the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Compton scattering]] or [[pair production]].  The chemistry of atomic de-excitation in the scintillator produces a multitude of low-energy photons, typically near the blue end of the visible spectrum.  The number of such photons is in proportion to the amount of energy deposited by the ionizing particle.   Some portion of these low-energy photons arrive at the photocathode of an attached photomultiplier tube.  The photocathode emits at most one electron for each arriving photon by the [[photoelectric effect]]. This group of primary electrons is electrostatically accelerated and focused by an electrical potential so that they strike the first dynode of the tube. The impact of a single electron on the dynode releases a number of secondary electrons which are in turn accelerated to strike the second dynode. Each subsequent dynode impact releases further electrons, and so there is a current amplifying effect at each dynode stage. Each stage is at a higher potential than the previous to provide the accelerating field. The resultant output signal at the anode is in the form of a measurable pulse for each group of photons that arrived at the photocathode, and is passed to the processing electronics. The pulse carries information about the energy of the original incident radiation on the scintillator.  The number of such pulses per unit time gives information about the intensity of the radiation.  In some applications individual pulses are not counted, but rather only the average current at the anode is used as a measure of radiation intensity.

The scintillator must be shielded from all ambient light so that external photons do not swamp the ionization events caused by incident  radiation.  To achieve this a thin opaque foil, such as aluminized mylar, is often used, though it must have a low enough mass to minimize undue attenuation of the incident radiation being measured.

The article on the [[photomultiplier]] tube carries a detailed description of the tube's operation.

==Detection materials==
The scintillator consists of a transparent [[crystal]], usually a phosphor, plastic (usually containing [[anthracene]]) or [[organic liquid]] (see [[liquid scintillation counting]]) that fluoresces when struck by [[ionizing radiation]]. 

[[Cesium iodide]] (CsI) in crystalline form is used as the scintillator for the detection of protons and alpha particles. [[Sodium iodide]] (NaI) containing a small amount of [[thallium]] is used as a scintillator for the detection of gamma waves and [[zinc sulfide]] (ZnS) is widely used as a detector of alpha particles. Zinc sulfide is the material Rutherford used to perform his scattering experiment. [[Lithium iodide]] (LiI) is used in neutron detectors.

==Detector efficiencies==
{{See also|Counting efficiency}}
===Gamma===
The quantum efficiency of a [[gamma ray|gamma-ray]] detector (per unit volume) depends upon the [[electron density|density]] of [[electron]]s in the detector, and certain scintillating materials, such as [[sodium iodide]] and [[bismuth germanate]], achieve high electron densities as a result of the high [[atomic number]]s of some of the elements of which they are composed. However, [[Semiconductor detector|detectors based on semiconductors]], notably hyperpure [[germanium]], have better intrinsic energy resolution than scintillators, and are preferred where feasible for gamma-ray [[spectroscopy|spectrometry]].

===Neutron===
In the case of [[neutron]] detectors, high efficiency is gained through the use of scintillating materials rich in [[hydrogen]] that [[scattering theory|scatter]] neutrons efficiently. [[Liquid scintillation counting|Liquid scintillation counters]] are an efficient and practical means of quantifying [[beta particle|beta radiation]].

==Applications==
[[File:NNSA-NSO-1445.jpg|thumb|Scintillation probe being used to measure surface radioactive contamination. The probe is held as close to the object as practicable]]
Scintillation counters are used to measure radiation in a variety of applications including hand held [[Survey meter|radiation survey meters]], personnel and environmental monitoring for [[radioactive contamination]], medical imaging, radiometric assay, nuclear security and nuclear plant safety.

Several products have been introduced in the market utilising scintillation counters for detection of potentially dangerous gamma-emitting materials during transport. These include scintillation counters designed for freight terminals, border security, ports, weigh bridge applications, scrap metal yards and contamination monitoring of nuclear waste. There are variants of scintillation counters mounted on pick-up trucks and helicopters for rapid response in case of a security situation due to [[dirty bomb]]s or [[radioactive waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gammasonics.com/ardms.html|title=Automatic Radiation Detection and Monitoring System|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814155457/http://www.gammasonics.com/ardms.html|archivedate=2014-08-14}}{{Not in source|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gammasonics.com/r2.html|title=Automatic Radiation Detection Vehicles|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814155459/http://www.gammasonics.com/r2.html|archivedate=2014-08-14}}{{Not in source|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand-held units are also commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drct.com/survey_meters/MicroR_Meter.htm Portable MicroR Survey Meters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207201314/http://www.drct.com/survey_meters/MicroR_Meter.htm |date=2009-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidance on application use===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Health and Safety Executive]], or HSE, has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned. [http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/irp7.pdf] This covers all radiation instrument technologies, and is a useful comparative guide to the use of scintillation detectors.

==Radiation protection==
===Alpha and beta contamination===
[[File:US Navy 070208-N-9132D-002 Electronics Technician 2nd Class Shea Thompson tests an Alpha Particle Dection Probe.jpg|thumb| Hand-held large area alpha scintillation probe under calibration]]
[[File:Minamisoma Radiation 2011-11.jpg|thumb|left|Hand-held scintillation counter reading ambient gamma dose. The position of the internal detector is shown by the cross]]
Industrial [[radioactive contamination]] monitors, either hand-held for area or personal surveys or installed for personnel monitoring require a large detection area to ensure efficient and rapid coverage of monitored surfaces. For this the scintillation counter with a large area scintillator window and integrated photomultiplier tube is ideally suited and finds wide application in the field of radioactive contamination monitoring of personnel and the environment. Detectors are designed to have one or two scintillation materials, depending on the application. "Single phosphor" detectors are used for either alpha or beta, and "Dual phosphor" detectors are used to detect both.{{cn|date=August 2016}} 

A scintillator such as zinc sulphide is used for alpha particle detection, whilst plastic scintillators are used for beta detection. The resultant scintillation energies can be discriminated so that alpha and beta counts can be measured separately with the same detector.{{cn|date=August 2016}}  This technique is used in both hand-held and fixed monitoring equipment, and such instruments are relatively inexpensive compared with the gas proportional detector.

===Gamma===
Scintillation materials are used for ambient gamma dose measurement, though a different construction is used to detect contamination, as no thin window is required.

==As a spectrometer==
{{main|Gamma spectroscopy}}
[[File:Scintillation counter as a spectrometer.jpg|right|thumb|The experimental setup for determination of γ-radiation spectrum with a scintillation counter. A high voltage power supply is connected to the scintillation counter. The scintillation counter is connected to the Multichannel Analyser which sends information to the computer.]]
Scintillators often convert a single [[photon]] of high energy [[radiation]] into high number of lower-energy photons, where the number of photons per [[electronvolt|megaelectronvolt]] of input energy is fairly constant. By measuring the intensity of the flash (the number of the photons produced by the [[x-ray]] or gamma photon) it is therefore possible to discern the original photon's energy.

The spectrometer consists of a suitable [[scintillator]] crystal, a [[photomultiplier]] tube, and a circuit for measuring the height of the pulses produced by the photomultiplier. The pulses are counted and sorted by their height, producing a x-y plot of scintillator flash [[brightness]] vs number of the flashes, which approximates the energy spectrum of the incident radiation, with some additional artifacts. A monochromatic gamma radiation produces a photopeak at its energy. The detector also shows response at the lower energies, caused by [[Compton scattering]], two smaller escape peaks at energies 0.511 and 1.022 MeV below the photopeak for the creation of electron-positron pairs when one or both annihilation photons escape, and a [[backscatter]] peak. Higher energies can be measured when two or more photons strike the detector almost simultaneously ([[pileup (disambiguation)|pile-up]], within the time resolution of the [[data acquisition]] chain), appearing as sum peaks with energies up to the value of two or more photopeaks added.&lt;ref name="Knoll1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Glenn F.

{{main article|Sun in culture}}
A '''solar symbol''' is a [[symbol]] representing the [[Sun]]. 
Common solar symbols include circles with or without rays, crosses or spirals.
In religious iconography, personifications of the Sun or solar attributes are indicated by means of a  [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]  or a [[radiate crown]].

When the systematic study of [[comparative mythology]] first became popular in the 19th century, scholarly opinion tended to over-interpret historical myths and iconography in terms of "solar symbolism". 
This was especially the case with [[Max Müller]] and his followers beginning in the 1860s in the context of [[Indo-European studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Scott Littleton|title=The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of Georges Dumézil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuSy6xW99agC&amp;pg=PA34|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02404-5|page=34}}. See also  R. F. Littledale, "The Oxford Solar Myth, A Contribution to Comparative Mythology" in: '' Echoes from Kottabos'', London (1906), 279&amp;ndash;290 for a satire on this effect.&lt;/ref&gt; Many "solar symbols" claimed  in the 19th century, such as the [[swastika]], [[triskele]], [[Sun cross]], etc. have tended to be interpreted more conservatively in scholarship since the later 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;notably ciriticized by [[Richard Chase (folklorist)|Richard Chase]], ''The Quest for Myth'' (1951); see also ''[[Astralkult]]'' for the more general tendency of over-interpretation of mythology in terms of "astral" mythology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar disk==
[[File:Nebra Scheibe.jpg|thumb|The solar disk, [[crescent|crescent Moon]] and stars as shown on the [[Nebra sky disk]] (c. 1600 BC)]]
The basic element of most solar symbols is the circular solar disk.
 
The disk can be modified in various ways, notably by adding rays (found in the Bronze Age in Egyptian depictions of [[Aten]]) or  a [[Sun cross|cross]]. In Ancient Near East, the solar disk could also be modified by addition of the [[Uraeus]] (rearing cobra), and in Ancient Mesopotamia it was shown as [[Winged sun|winged]].

===Bronze Age writing===
[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] have a large inventory of solar symbolism because of the central position of solar deities ([[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Aten]] etc.) in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]].

&lt;div&gt;The main ideogram for "Sun" was a representation of the solar disk, &lt;hiero&gt;N5&lt;/hiero&gt; ([[Gardiner's sign list#N|Gardiner N5]]), with a variant including the [[Uraeus]], &lt;hiero&gt;N6&lt;/hiero&gt; (N6).&lt;/div&gt;
The "Sun" ideogram in early [[Chinese writing]], beginning with the [[oracle bone script]] (c. 12th century BC) also shows the solar disk with a central dot (whence the modern character [[:wikt:日|日]]), analogous to the Egyptian heroglyph.

=== Astronomical symbol===
{{further information|Planet_symbols#Sun}}
The modern [[astronomical symbol]] for the Sun ([[circled dot]], Unicode U+2609 ☉; c.f.  U+2299 ⊙ "circled dot operator") was first used in the Renaissance. A diagram in Johannes Kamateros' 12th century ''Compendium of Astrology'' shows the Sun represented by a circle with a ray.&lt;ref name=neugebauer-1987&gt;{{cite book

== Rayed depictions ==

[[File:C+B-Egypt-Fig12-AkhnatenWorshippingSun.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Akhenaten]] worshipping [[Aten]] (14th century BC; 1903 drawing)]]
A circular disk with alternating triangular and wavy rays emanating from it is a frequent symbol or artistic depiction of the sun.

===Antiquity===
{{further information|Aten|Sol Invictus|Vergina Sun|Radiate crown|Star and crescent}}
The ancient Mesopotamian  "star of [[Shamash]]" could be represented with either eight wavy rays, or with four wavy and four triangular rays.

The [[Vergina Sun]] (also known as the Star of Vergina, Macedonian Star, or Argead Star) is a rayed solar symbol appearing in [[ancient Greek art]] from the 6th to 2nd centuries BC. The Vergina Sun appears in art variously with sixteen, twelve, or eight triangular rays.

}}

The iconographic tradition of depicting the Sun with rays and with a [[face|human face]] develops in [[Western art|Western tradition]] in the high medieval period and becomes widespread in the [[Renaissance]], harking back to the Sun god ([[Helios|Sol/Helios]]) being depicted as wearing a [[radiate crown]] on his head in classical antiquity.

===Modern emblems===
The [[Jesuit emblem]], the [[flag of Uruguay]], the [[flag of Kiribati]], some versions of the [[flag of Argentina]], the [[Irish Defence Forces cap badge]], and the [[:File:Iraq state emblem CoA 1959-1965 Qassem.svg|1959–1965 coat of arms of Iraq]] are official insignia which incorporate rayed solar symbols.

The depictions of the sun on the [[flag of the Republic of China|flag of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]], the [[flag of Kazakhstan]], the [[flag of Kurdistan]], and the [[flag of Nepal]] have only straight (triangular) rays, while that on the [[flag of Kyrgyzstan]] has only curvy rays. The [[flag of the Philippines]] has short diverging rays grouped into threes.

Another form of rayed depiction of the sun is with simple radial lines dividing the field into two colors, as in the [[Flag of Japan#Military flags|military flags of Japan]] and the current [[Flag of the Republic of Macedonia]], and in the top parts of the [[flag of Tibet]] and the [[flag of Arizona]].

The [[flag of New Mexico]] is based on the [[Zia people#Zia symbol|Zia people's sun symbol]] which has four groups of four parallel rays emanating symmetrically from a central circle.

===Modern pictogram===
[[File:Weather-clear.svg|thumb|150px|Typical "clear weather" pictogram (triangular rays)]]
The modern pictogram  representing the Sun as a circle with rays, often eight in number (indicated by either straight lines or triangles; Unicode [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] {{resize|150%|☀}} U+2600; {{resize|150%|☼}} U+263C) is used for [[weather forecast]]s, indicating "clear weather".
Use of such pictograms originates in [[television]] weather forecasts in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Engber, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/magazine/who-made-that-weather-icon.html Who Made That Weather Icon?], ''New York Times'', 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Unicode (version 6.0)  [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]] block introduced another set of weather pictograms, with a character "WHITE SUN" depicted without rays in the official chart at  1F323 {{resize|150%|🌣}}. The same block has also a "Sun with face" character, at U+1F31E {{resize|150%|🌞}}.

The "sun with rays" pictogram is also used to represent the "high brightness" setting in [[Electronic visual display|display devices]], encoded separately by Unicode  (version 6.0) at U+1F506 {{resize|150%|🔆}}  ([[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]] block).

== Crosses == 
{{Main article|Sun cross}}
[[File:Crossed_circle.svg|left|120px]]

The "sun cross" or "solar wheel" (🜨) is often considered to represent the four seasons and the tropical year, and therefore the Sun.
In the [[prehistoric religion]] of [[Bronze Age Europe]], crosses in circles appear frequently on artifacts identified as cult items, for example the  "miniature standard" with an [[amber]] inlay that shows a cross shape when held against the light, dating to the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], held at the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landesmuseum-fuer-vorgeschichte-halle.de/himmel/en_standarte.htm entry] at the [[Nebra sky disk]] exhibition site (landesmuseum-fuer-vorgeschichte-halle.de)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronze Age symbol has also been connected with the [[spoke]]d [[chariot]] [[wheel]], which at the time was four-spoked (compare the [[Linear B]] ideogram 243 "wheel" {{lang|gmy|𐃏}}).  In the context of a culture that celebrated the [[Sun chariot]], it may thus have had a "solar" connotation (c.f. the [[Trundholm sun chariot]]).

The ''[[Arevakhach]]'' ("solar cross") symbol often found in Armenian [[Khachkar|memorial stelae]] is claimed as an ancient Armenian solar symbol.
is one of the ancient Armenian symbols of eternity and light.&lt;ref&gt;Айк Демоян «Армянские национальные символы» = «Հայկական ազգային խորհրդանշաններ». — Ереван: «Пюник», 2013.

Some [[Sami shamanism|Sami shaman]] drums have the [[Beaivi]] [[Sami people|Sami]] sun symbol that resembles a [[sun cross]].

It is used among [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] ("manji"), [[Jainism|Jains]], and [[Hinduism|Hindus]]; and many other cultures, though not necessarily as a solar symbol. Also see [[Malkh-Festival]].

Some forms of the triple spiral or [[triskelion]] signs have also been claimed as solar symbols.{{year needed|date=November 2016}}

The "[[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]]"  (German ''Schwarze Sonne'') is a symbol of [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] and [[occult]] significance based on a sun wheel mosaic with twelve-fold rotational symmetry incorporated into a floor of [[Wewelsburg|Wewelsburg Castle]] during the [[Nazism and occultism|Nazi era]], which was itself loosely based on [[Swastika (Germanic Iron Age)|swastika-like designs]] in Migration-period ''[[Zierscheibe]]n''. The Kolovrat, or in Polish "Kołowrót", represents the Sun in Slavic [[Modern Paganism|neopaganism]]. It is familiar to almost every ancient Slavic culture.

A '''solar telescope''' is a special purpose [[telescope]] used to observe the [[Sun]]. Solar telescopes usually detect light with wavelengths in, or not far outside, the [[visible spectrum]]. Obsolete names for sun telescopes include '''heliograph''' and '''photoheliograph'''.

==Professional solar telescopes==
Solar telescopes need optics large enough to achieve the best possible [[Diffraction#Diffraction limit of telescopes|diffraction limit]] but less so for the associated light-collecting power of other astronomical telescopes. However, recently newer narrower [[Optical filter|filters]] and higher framerates have also driven solar telescopes towards photon-starved operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stenflo|first=J. O.|title=Limitations and Opportunities for the Diagnostics of Solar and Stellar Magnetic Fields|journal=ASP Conference Proceedings|date=2001|volume=248|series=Magnetic Fields Across the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram|pages=639|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2001ASPC..248..639S&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=|editor=G. Mathys|editor2=S. K. Solanki|editor3=D. T. Wickramasinghe|publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]|location=San Francisco|bibcode=2001ASPC..248..639S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[European Solar Telescope|European Solar Telescope (EST)]] as well as the [[Advanced Technology Solar Telescope|Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST)]] have larger apertures not only to increase the resolution, but also to increase the light-collecting power.

Because solar telescopes operate during the day, seeing is generally worse than for night-time telescopes, because the ground around the telescope is heated which causes [[turbulence]] and degrades the resolution. To alleviate this, solar telescopes are usually built on towers and the structures are painted white. The [[Dutch Open Telescope]] is built on an open framework to allow the wind to pass through the complete structure and provide cooling around the telescope's main mirror.

Another solar telescope-specific problem is the heat generated by the tightly-focused sunlight. For this reason, a [[heat stop]] is an integral part of the design of solar telescopes. For the upcoming [[Advanced Technology Solar Telescope|ATST]], the heat load is 2.5 MW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with peak powers of 11.4&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalrymple|title=Heat Stop Concepts|date=1 April 2003|series=ATST Technical Notes|url=http://atst.nso.edu/files/docs/TN-0018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of such a heat stop is not only to survive this heat load, but also to remain cool enough not to induce any additional turbulence inside the telescope's dome.

Professional solar observatories may have main optical elements with very long [[focal length]]s (although not always, [[Dutch Open Telescope]]) and light paths operating in a [[vacuum]] or [[helium]] to eliminate air motion due to [[convection]] inside the telescope. However, this is not possible for apertures over 1 meter, at which the pressure difference at the entrance window of the vacuum tube becomes too large. Therefore, the [[European Solar Telescope|EST]] and [[Advanced Technology Solar Telescope|ATST]] have active cooling of the dome to minimize the temperature difference between the air inside and outside the telescope.

Because the Sun travels on a narrow fixed path across the sky, some solar telescopes are fixed in position (and are sometimes buried underground), with the only moving part being a [[heliostat]] to track the Sun. One example of this is the [[McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope]].

[[Image:Solarborg.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Example of amateur solar telescope equipped with a [[H-alpha#Filter|hydrogen-alpha filter]] system.]]
In the field of [[amateur astronomy]] there are many methods used to observe the sun. Amateurs use everything from simple systems to project the sun on a piece of white paper, light blocking [[Astronomical filter|filters]], [[Herschel wedge]]s which redirect 95% of the light away from the eyepiece,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1F_zSwe9iU4C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=herschel+wedge&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=e8YZTsONFYrY0QHZ8dCWBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=herschel%20wedge&amp;f=false, Pierre Guillermier, Serge Koutchmy, Total eclipses: science, observations, myths, and legends, page 37]&lt;/ref&gt; up to [[H-alpha#Filter|hydrogen-alpha filter]] systems and even home built [[spectrohelioscope]]s. In contrast to professional telescopes, amateur solar telescopes are usually much smaller.

The '''Soyuz-MS''' ({{Lang-rus|'''Союз МС'''}}, [[GRAU]]: '''11F732A48''') is the latest revision of the [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. It is an evolution of the [[Soyuz TMA-M]] spacecraft, with modernization mostly concentrated on the communications and navigation subsystems.

It is used by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] for [[human spaceflight]]. Soyuz-MS has minimal external changes with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]], mostly limited to antennas and sensors, as well as the thruster placement.&lt;ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /&gt;

The first launch was [[Soyuz MS-01]] on July 7, 2016 aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]] [[launch vehicle]] towards the [[International Space Station|ISS]].&lt;ref name=tass-enscience886832 /&gt; The trip included a two-day checkout phase for the design before docking with the ISS on July 9.&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzms01 /&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:Soyuz rocket and spaceship V1-1.svg|alt=Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket|thumb|Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket]]
A Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):

* A [[spheroid]] [[orbital module]]
* A small aerodynamic [[reentry capsule|reentry module]]
* A cylindrical [[service module]] with solar panels attached

The first two portions are habitable living space. By moving as much as possible into the orbital module, which does not have to be shielded or decelerated during [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] re-entry, the Soyuz three-part craft is both larger and lighter than the two-part [[Apollo spacecraft]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]]. The Apollo command module had six cubic meters of living space and a mass of 5000&amp;nbsp;kg; the three-part Soyuz provided the same crew with nine cubic meters of living space, an airlock, and a service module for the mass of the Apollo capsule alone. This does not consider orbital module that could be used instead of LEM in Apollo.

Soyuz can carry up to three [[astronaut|cosmonauts]] and provide life support for them for about 30 person-days. The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is regenerated through [[KO2|KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] cylinders, which absorb most of the [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[water]] produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen, and [[LiOH]] cylinders which absorb leftover CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The vehicle is protected during launch by a nose fairing, which is jettisoned after passing through the atmosphere. It has an automatic docking system. The ship can be operated automatically, or by a pilot independently of ground control.

=== Orbital Module (BO) ===

[[File:Soyuz-TMA orbital module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module]]

The forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module ({{ru icon}}: бытовой отсек (БО), ''Bitovoy otsek (BO)'') also known as Habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. Commonly, it is used as both eating area and lavatory. At its far end, it also contains the docking port. This module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. On the latest Soyuz versions, a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.

A hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed, cosmonauts exiting through its side port (at the bottom of this picture, near the descent module); on the launch pad, they have entered the spacecraft through this port.

This separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in zero gravity differs from that of the descent module, as cosmonauts stand or sit with their heads to the docking port.

=== Reentry Module (SA) ===

[[File:Soyuz-TMA descent module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Descent Module]]
The reentry module ({{ru icon}}: спускаемый аппарат (СА), ''Spuskaemiy apparat (SA)'') is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. It is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during [[re-entry]]. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the [[heat shield]] are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the reentry module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere, but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely [[ballistic reentry]]. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and can't be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. That is why it was decided to go with the "headlight" shape that the Soyuz uses&amp;nbsp;— a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section (seven degrees) to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was coined at a time when [[Sealed beam|nearly every automobile headlight]] was a circular paraboloid.

=== Service Module (PAO) ===

[[File:Soyuz-TMA propulsion module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Instrumentation/Propulsion Module]]
At the back of the vehicle is the service module ({{ru icon}}: приборно-агрегатный отсек (ПАО), ''Priborno-Agregatniy Otsek (PAO)''). It has an instrumentation compartment ({{ru icon}}: приборный отсек (ПО), ''Priborniy Otsek (PO)''), a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range [[radio]] communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. The propulsion compartment ({{ru icon}}: агрегатный отсек (АО), ''Agregatniy Otsek (AO)''), a non-pressurized part of the service module, contains the main engine and a spare: liquid-fuel [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion systems]] for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment ({{ru icon}}: переходной отсек (ПхО), ''Perekhodnoi Otsek (PkhO)''). Outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the sun by rotating the ship.

=== Re-entry procedure ===

Because its modular construction differs from that of previous designs, the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for de-orbiting fully 180° ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry, the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical [[Hohmann orbit]] to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.

Early Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation. Later Soyuz spacecraft detach the orbital module before firing the main engine, which saves even more propellant, enabling the descent module to return more payload. In no case can the orbital module remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, for the hatch enabling it to function as an airlock is part of the descent module.

Re-entry firing is typically done on the "dawn" side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth. Since the beginning of Soyuz missions to the ISS, only five have performed nighttime landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://spaceflight101.com/iss-expedition-45/soyuz-trio-set-for-rare-nighttime-landing-on-friday/ |title= Soyuz Trio set for rare Nighttime Landing on Friday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soyuz MS Improvements ==

The Soyuz MS received the following upgrades with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]]:&lt;ref name=nsfforum-26410.992797 /&gt;
* The fixed solar panels of the '''SEP''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|CЭП, Система Электропитания}}) power supply system have had their [[photovoltaic]] cell efficiency improved to 14% (from 12%) and collective area increased by {{convert|1.1|m2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep /&gt;
* A fifth battery with 155 [[amp-hour]] capacity known as '''906V''' was added to support the increased energy consumption from the improved electronics.
* Additional micro-meteoroid protection was added to the BO orbital module.&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep /&gt;
* The new computer ('''TsVM-101'''), weighs one-eighth that of its predecessor (8.3&amp;nbsp;kg vs. 70&amp;nbsp;kg) while also being much smaller than the previous '''Argon-16''' computer.&lt;ref name=nsf-20160706 /&gt;
* While {{as of|2016|7|lc=on}} it is not known whether the propulsion system is still called [[KTDU-80]], it has been significantly modified. While previously the system had 16 high thrust DPO-B and six low thrust DPO-M in one propellant supply circuit, and six other low thrust DPO-M on a different circuit, now all 28 thrusters are high thrust DPO-B, arranged in 14 pairs. Each propellant supply circuit handles 14 DPO-B, with each element of each thruster pair being fed by a different circuit. This provides full fault tolerance for thruster or propellant circuit failure.&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu /&gt;&lt;ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /&gt; The new arrangement adds fault tolerance for docking and undocking with one failed thruster or de-orbit with two failed thrusters.&lt;ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /&gt; Also, the number of DPO-B in the aft section has been doubled to eight, improving the de-orbit fault tolerance.
* The propellant consumption signal, '''EFIR''' was redesigned to avoid false positives on propellant consumption.&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu /&gt;
* The avionics unit, '''BA DPO''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|БА ДПО, Блоки Автоматики подсистема Двигателей Причаливания и Ориентации}}), had to be modified for changes in the [[Reaction control system|RCS]].&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu /&gt;
* Instead of relying on ground stations for orbital determination and correction, the now-included Satellite Navigation System '''ASN-K''' ({{lang-ru|АСН-К, Аппаратура Спутниковой Навигации}}) relies on [[GLONASS]] and [[GPS]] signals for navigation.&lt;ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nkmag-2015241928082 /&gt; It uses four fixed antennas to achieve a positioning accuracy of {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}}, and aims to reduce that number to as little as {{convert|3|cm|abbr=on}} and to achieve an attitude accuracy of 0.5°.&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzms /&gt;
* The old radio command system, the BRTS ({{lang-ru|БРТС Бортовая Радио-техническая Система}}) that relied on the '''Kvant-V''' was replaced with an integrated communications and telemetry system, '''EKTS''' ({{lang-ru|ЕКТС, Единая Kомандно-Телеметрическая Система}}).&lt;ref name=nkmag-2015241928082 /&gt; It can use not only the [[VHF]] and [[UHF]] ground stations but, thanks to the addition of an [[S band]] antenna, the [[Luch (satellite)|Lutch Constellation]] as well, to have theoretical 85% of real time connection to ground control.&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmsekts /&gt; But since the S band antenna is fixed and Soyuz spacecraft cruises in a slow longitudinal rotation, in practice this capability might be limited due to lack of antenna pointing capability.&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmsekts /&gt; It may also be able to use the American [[TDRS]] and the [[ESA|European]] [[EDRS]] in the future.&lt;ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /&gt;
* The old information and telemetry system, '''MBITS''' ({{lang-ru|МБИТС, МалогаБаритная Информационно-Телеметрическая Система}}), has been fully integrated into the EKTS.&lt;ref name=nkmag-2015241928082 /&gt;
* The old VHF radio communication system ({{lang-ru|Система Телефонно-Телеграфной Связи}}) Rassvet-M ({{lang-ru|Рассвет-М}}) was replaced with the Rassvet-3BM ({{lang-ru|Рассвет-3БМ}}) system that has been integrated into the EKTS.&lt;ref name=nkmag-2015241928082 /&gt;
* The old '''38G6''' antennas are replaced with four [[omnidirectional antennas]] (two on the solar panels tips and two in the PAO) plus one S band [[phased array]], also in the PAO.&lt;ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /&gt;
* The descent module communication and telemetry system also received upgrades that will eventually lead to having a voice channel in addition to the present telemetry.&lt;ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /&gt;
* The EKTS system also includes a [[COSPAS-SARSAT]] transponder to transmit its coordinates to ground control in real time during parachute fall and landing.&lt;ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /&gt;
* All the changes introduced with the EKTS enable the Soyuz to use the same [[RKA Mission Control Center|ground segment]] terminals as the [[Russian Orbital Segment|Russian Segment]] of the [[ISS]].&lt;ref name=nkmag-2015241928082 /&gt;
* The new [[Kurs (docking navigation system)#Kurs-NA|Kurs-NA]] ({{lang-ru|Курс-НА}}) automatic docking system is now made indigenously in Russia. Developed by Sergei Medvedev of AO NII TP, it is claimed to be {{convert|25|kg|abbr=on}} lighter, 30% less voluminous and use 25% less power.&lt;ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmskursna /&gt; An '''AO-753A''' [[phased array]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] replaced the '''2AO-VKA''' antenna and three '''AKR-VKA''' antennas, while the two '''2ASF-M-VKA''' antenna were moved to fixed positions further back.&lt;ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /&gt;&lt;ref name=nkmag-2015241928082 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmskursna /&gt;
* The [[SSVP docking system|docking system]] received a backup electric driving mechanism.&lt;ref name=rsw-progressms /&gt;
* Instead of the analog TV system '''Klest-M''' ({{lang-ru|Клест-М}}), the spacecraft uses a digital TV system based on [[MPEG-2]], which makes it possible to maintain communications between the spacecraft and the station via a space-to-space RF link and reduces interferences.&lt;ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /&gt;&lt;ref name=energiapr-iss48photo0704 /&gt;
* A new '''Digital Backup Loop Control Unit''', '''BURK''' ({{lang-ru|БУРК, Блок Управления Резервным Контуром}}), developed by RSC Energia, replaced the old avionics, the  Motion and Orientation Control Unit, BUPO ({{lang-ru|БУПО, Блок Управления Причаливанием и Ориентацией}}) and the signal conversion unit '''BPS''' ({{lang-ru|БПС, Блок Преобразования Сигналов}}).&lt;ref name=nkmag-2015241928082 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzms /&gt;
* The upgrade also replaces the old Rate Sensor Unit '''BDUS-3M''' ({{lang-ru|БДУС-3М, Блок Датчиков Угловых Скоростей}})  with the new '''BDUS-3A''' ({{lang-ru|БДУС-3А}}).&lt;ref name=nkmag-2015241928082 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzms /&gt;&lt;ref name=energiapr-iss48photo0704 /&gt;
* The old [[Halogen lamp|halogen]] headlights, '''SMI-4''' ({{lang-ru|СМИ-4}}), have been replaced with the [[LED]] powered headlight '''SFOK''' ({{lang-ru|СФОК}}).&lt;ref name=nkmag-2015241928082 /&gt;&lt;ref name=energiapr-iss48photo0704 /&gt;
* A new black box '''SZI-M''' ({{lang-ru|СЗИ-М, Система Запоминания Информации}}) that records voice and data during the mission was added under the pilot's seat in the descent module. The dual unit module was developed at AO RKS corporation in Moscow with the use of indigenous electronics.&lt;ref name=ria-201606301455160339 /&gt; It has a capacity of 4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] and a recording speed of 256 [[Kilobyte|KB]]/[[Second|s]].&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzmsszim /&gt; It is designed to tolerate falls of {{convert|150|m/s|abbr=on}} and is rated for 100,000 overwrite cycles and 10 reuses.&lt;ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sputniknews-20160630.1042247613 /&gt; It can also tolerate {{convert|700|C|abbr=on}} for 30 minutes.&lt;ref name=ria-201606301455160339 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64369">In planetary science a '''streaming instability''' is a hypothetical mechanism for the formation of [[planetesimal]]s in which the drag felt by solid particles orbiting in a gas disk leads to their spontaneous concentration into clumps which can gravitationally collapse.&lt;ref name=Lund_2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Planetesimal formation|url=http://www.astro.lu.se/Research/OTA/TAgroup/planetesimals.shtml|publisher=Lund University|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small initial clumps increase the orbital velocity of the gas, slowing radial drift locally, leading to their growth as they are joined by faster drifting isolated particles. Massive filaments form that reach densities sufficient for the gravitational collapse into planetesimals the size of large asteroids, bypassing a  number of barriers to the traditional formation mechanisms. The formation of streaming instabilities requires solids that are moderately coupled to the gas and a local solid to gas ratio of one or greater. The growth of solids large enough to become moderately coupled to the gas is more likely outside the ice line and in regions with limited turbulence. An initial concentration of solids with respect to the gas is necessary to suppress turbulence sufficiently to allow the solid to gas ratio to reach greater than one at the mid-plane. A wide variety of mechanisms to selectively remove gas or to concentrate solids have been proposed. In the inner Solar System the formation of streaming instabilities requires a greater initial concentration of solids or the growth of solid beyond the size of chondrules.&lt;ref name="Johansen_Jacquet_2015" /&gt;

==Background==
Planetesimals and larger bodies are traditionally thought to have formed via a hierarchical accretion, the formation of large objects via the collision and mergers of small objects. This process begins with the collision of [[cosmic dust|dust]] due to [[Brownian motion]] producing larger aggregates held together by [[van der Waals force]]s. The aggregates settle toward the mid-plane of the disk and collide due to gas turbulence forming pebbles and larger objects. Further collisions and mergers eventually yield planetesimals 1–10&amp;nbsp;km in diameter held together by self-gravity. The growth of the largest planetesimals then accelerates, as gravitational focusing increases their effective cross-section, resulting in runaway [[Nebular hypothesis#Rocky planets|accretion]] forming the larger [[asteroid]]s. Later, gravitational scattering by the larger objects excites relative motions, causing a transition to slower oligarchic accretion that ends with the formation of planetary embryos. In the outer Solar System the planetary embryos grow large enough to accrete gas, forming the giant planets. In the inner Solar System the orbits of the planetary embryos become unstable, leading to giant impacts and the formation of the terrestrial planets.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli_etal_2009" /&gt;

A number of obstacles to this process have been identified: barriers to growth via collisions, the radial drift of larger solids, and the turbulent stirring of planetesimals.&lt;ref name="Johansen_Jacquet_2015" /&gt; As a particle grows the time required for its motion to react to changes in the motion of the gas in turbulent eddies increases. The relative motions of particles, and collision velocities, therefore increases as with the mass of the particles. For [[Silicate#Silicate rock and minerals|silicates]] the increased collision velocities cause dust aggregates to compact into solid particles that bounce rather than stick, ending growth at the size of [[chondrule]]s, roughly 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref name="Zsom_etal_2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zsom|first1=A.|last2=Ormel|first2=C.

Solids orbiting through this gas lose angular momentum and spiral toward the central [[star]] at rates that increase as they grow. At 1 AU this produces a meter-sized barrier, with the rapid loss of large objects in as little as ~1000 orbits, ending with their vaporization as they approach too close to the star.&lt;ref name="Protostars_and Planets_2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johansen |first1=A. |last2=Blum |first2=J. |last3=Tanaka |first3=H. |last4=Ormel |first4=C. |last5=Bizzarro |first5=M. |last6=Rickman |first6=H. |date=2014 |chapter=The Multifaceted Planetesimal Formation Process |editor1-last=Beuther |editor1-first=H. |editor2-last=Klessen |editor2-first=R.

==Description==
Streaming instabilities, first described by Andrew Youdin and Jeremy Goodman,&lt;ref name="Youdin_Goodman_2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Youdin|first1=Andrew|last2=Goodman|first2=Jeremy|title=Streaming Instabilities in Protoplanetary Disks|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2005|volume=620|issue=1|pages=459–469|doi=10.1086/426895|arxiv = astro-ph/0409263 |bibcode = 2005ApJ...620..459Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; are driven by differences in the motions of the gas and solid particles in the [[protoplanetary disk]]. The gas is hotter and denser closer to the star, creating a pressure gradient that partially offsets gravity from the star. The partial support of the pressure gradient allows the gas to orbit at roughly 50&amp;nbsp;m/s below the [[orbital speed|Keplerian velocity]] at its distance. The solid particles, however, are not supported by the pressure gradient and would orbit at Keplerian velocities in the absence of the gas. The difference in velocities results in a headwind that causes the solid particles to spiral toward the central star as they lose momentum to [[aerodynamic drag]]. The drag also produces a back [[reaction (physics)|reaction]] on the gas, increasing its velocity. When solid particles cluster in the gas, the reaction reduces the headwind locally, allowing the cluster to orbit faster and undergo less inward drift. The slower drifting clusters are overtaken and joined by isolated particles, increasing the local density and further reducing radial drift, fueling an [[exponential growth]] of the initial clusters.&lt;ref name="Johansen_Jacquet_2015" /&gt; In simulations the clusters form massive filaments that can grow or dissipate, and that can collide and merge or split into multiple filaments.

The cold classical Kuiper belt objects may have formed in a low mass disk dominated by cm-sized or smaller objects. In this model the gas disk epoch ends with km-sized objects, possibly formed via gravitational instability, embedded in a disk of small objects. The disk remains dynamically cool due to inelastic collisions among the cm-sized objects. The slow encounter velocities result in efficient growth with a sizable fraction of the mass ending in the large objects.&lt;ref name="Shannon_etal_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shannon|first1=Andrew|last2=Wu|first2=Yanquin|last3=Lithwick|first3=Yoram|title=Forming the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt in a Light Disk|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2016|volume=818|issue=2|page=175|doi=10.3847/0004-637X/818/2/175|arxiv=1510.01323|bibcode = 2016ApJ...818..175S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamical friction from the small bodies would also aid in the formation of binaries.&lt;ref name="Fraser_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraser|first1=Wesley C.|last2=and 21 others|title=All planetesimals born near the Kuiper belt formed as binaries|journal=Nature Astronomy|date=2017|volume=1|issue=4|page=0088|doi=10.1038/s41550-017-0088|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0088|arxiv = 1705.00683 |bibcode = 2017NatAs...1E..88F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldreich_etal_2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldreich|first1=Peter|last2=Lithwick|first2=Yoram|last3=Sari|first3=Re'em|title=Formation of Kuiper-belt binaries by dynamical friction and three-body encounters|journal=Nature|date=2002|volume=420|issue=6916|pages=643–+646|doi=10.1038/nature01227|pmid=12478286|arxiv=astro-ph/0208490|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6916/full/nature01227.html|bibcode = 2002Natur.420..643G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planetesimals may also be formed from the concentration of chondrules between eddies in a turbulent disk. In this model the particles are split unequally when large eddies fragment increasing the concentrations of some clumps. As this process cascades to smaller eddies a fraction of these clumps may reach densities sufficient to be gravitationally bound and slowly collapse into planetesimals.&lt;ref name="Cuzzi_Hogan_2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cuzzi, J.

Icy particles are more likely to stick and to resist compression in collisions which may allow the growth of large porous bodies. If the growth of these bodies is [[fractal]], with their porosity increasing as larger porous bodies collide, their radial drift timescales become long, allowing them to grow until they are compressed by gas drag and self-gravity forming small planetesimimals.&lt;ref name="Okuzumi_etal_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okuzumi|first1=Satoshi|last2=Tanaka|first2=Hidekazu|last3=Kobayashi|first3=Hiroshi|last4=Wada|first4=Koji|title=Rapid Coagulation of Porous Dust Aggregates outside the Snow Line: A Pathway to Successful Icy Planetesimal Formation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2012|volume=752|issue=2|page=106|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/752/2/106|arxiv=1204.5035|bibcode = 2012ApJ...752..106O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kataoka_etal_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kataoka|first1=Akimasa|last2=Tanaka|first2=Hidekazu|last3=Okuzumi|first3=Satoshi|last4=Wada|first4=Koji|title=Fluffy dust forms icy planetesimals by static compression|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|date=2013|volume=557|page=L4|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201322151|url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2013/09/aa22151-13/aa22151-13.html|bibcode=2013A&amp;A...557L...4K|arxiv = 1307.7984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, if the local solid density of the disk is sufficient, they may settle into a thin disk that fragments due to a gravitational instability, forming planetesimals the size of large asteroids, once they grow large enough to become decoupled from the gas.&lt;ref name="Michikoshi_Kokubo_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michikoshi|first1=Shugo|last2=Kokubo|first2=Eiichiro|title=Planetesimal Formation by Gravitational Instability of a Porous Dust Disk|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2016|volume=825|issue=2|page=L28|doi=10.3847/2041-8205/825/2/L28|arxiv=1606.06824|bibcode = 2016ApJ...825L..28M }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar fractal growth of porous silicates may also be possible if they are made up of nanometer-sized grains formed from the evaporation and recondensation of dust.&lt;ref name="Arakawa_Nakamoto_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arakawa|first1=Sota|last2=Nakamoto|first2=Taishi|title=Rocky Planetesimal Formation via Fluffy Aggregates of Nanograins|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2016|volume=832|issue=2|page=L19|doi=10.3847/2041-8205/832/2/L19|arxiv=1611.03859|bibcode = 2016ApJ...832L..19A }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fractal growth of highly porous solids may be limited by the infilling of their cores with small particles generated in collisions due to turbulence;&lt;ref name="Dominik_etal_2016"&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Dominik|first1=Carsten|last2=Paszun|first2=Dominik|last3=Borel|first3=Herman|title=The structure of dust aggregates in hierarchical coagulation|eprint=1611.00167|date=2016|class=astro-ph.EP}}&lt;/ref&gt; by erosion as the impact velocity due to the relative rates of radial drift of large and small bodies increases;&lt;ref name="Krijt_etal_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krijt|first1=S.|last2=Ormel|first2=C.

Collisions at velocities that would result in the fragmentation of equal sized particles can instead result in growth via mass transfer from the small to the larger particle.

Planetesimal accretion could reproduce the size distribution of the asteroids if it began with 100 meter planetesimals.

'''TANPAKU''' was a [[distributed computing]] project aimed at researching the [[protein structure prediction problem]].  The project used the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) [[computer platform|platform]], and was developed in collaboration with the [[Yamato Lab]] (Department of Biological Science and Technology) and [[Takeda Lab]] (Department of Information Sciences) groups at the [[Tokyo University of Science]].

The project was suspended on August 8, 2008 due to [[server (computing)|server]] problems. Currently, researchers are releasing its results, and the project is not expected to become active again.
