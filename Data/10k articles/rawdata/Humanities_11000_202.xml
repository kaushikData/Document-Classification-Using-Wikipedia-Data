'''''All Quiet on the Western Front''''' ({{lang-de|Im Westen nichts Neues|lit=In the West Nothing New}}) is a novel by [[Erich Maria Remarque]], a German veteran of [[World War I]]. The book describes the German soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many of these soldiers upon returning home from the front.

The novel was first published in November and December 1928 in the German newspaper ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' and in book form in late January 1929. The book and its sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]'' (1930), were among the books banned and [[Nazi book burnings|burned]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the book was adapted as an Academy-Award-winning [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Lewis Milestone]]. It was adapted again in 1979 by [[Delbert Mann]], this time as [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)|a television film]] starring [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]].

==Title and translation==
The English translation by [[Arthur Wesley Wheen]] gives the title as '' All Quiet on the Western Front''. The literal translation of "Im Westen nichts Neues" is "In the West Nothing New," with "West" being the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]; the phrase refers to the content of an official communiqué at the end of the novel.

[[Brian O Murdoch|Brian Murdoch's]] 1993 translation would render the phrase as "there was nothing new to report on the Western Front" within the narrative. Explaining his retention of the original book-title, he says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although it does not match the German exactly, Wheen's title has justly become part of the English language and is retained here with gratitude.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase "all quiet on the Western Front" has become a colloquial expression meaning stagnation, or lack of visible change, in any context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/all+quiet+on+the+Western+Front|title=all quiet on the Western Front|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book tells the story of Paul Bäumer who belongs to a group of German soldiers on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]]. The patriotic speeches of his teacher Kantorek had led the whole class to volunteer for military service shortly after the start of [[World War I]]. His class was "scattered over the platoons amongst [[Frisians|Frisian]] fishermen, peasants, and labourers." Bäumer arrives at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with his friends and schoolmates (Leer, Müller, Kropp and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, an older soldier, nicknamed Kat, who becomes Paul's mentor. While fighting at the front, Bäumer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the treacherous and filthy conditions of trench warfare.

At the beginning of the book, Remarque writes, "This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped (its) shells, were destroyed by the war."&lt;ref name="DestroyedByWar" /&gt; The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery, but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles, the constant threat of [[artillery]] fire and bombardments, the struggle to find food, the lack of training of young recruits (meaning lower chances of survival), and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail. They had been forced into the army.

The battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance, except for the impending possibility of injury or death for Bäumer and his comrades. Only pitifully small pieces of land are gained, about the size of a football field, which are often lost again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally drained and shaken. "We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces."

Paul's visit on leave to his home highlight the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war; however, he finds that he does "not belong here anymore, it is a foreign world."  He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople. His father asks him "stupid and distressing" questions about his war experiences, not understanding "that a man cannot talk of such things."  An old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and advancing to Paris while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their "own little sector" of the war but nothing of the big picture.

Indeed, the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender, yet restrained relationship. The night before he is to return from leave, he stays up with her, exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each other. He thinks to himself, "Ah! Mother, Mother! How can it be that I must part from you?  Here I sit and there you are lying; we have so much to say, and we shall never say it."  In the end, he concludes that he "ought never to have come [home] on leave."

Paul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a man for the first time in hand-to-hand combat. He watches the man die, in pain for hours. He feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man's corpse. He is devastated and later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war.
They are then sent on what Paul calls a "good job." They must guard a supply depot in a village that was evacuated due to being shelled too heavily. During this time, the men are able to adequately feed themselves, unlike the near-starvation conditions in the German trenches. In addition, the men enjoy themselves while living off the spoils from the village and officers' luxuries from the supply depot (such as fine cigars). While evacuating the villagers (enemy civilians), Paul and Albert are taken by surprise by artillery fired at the civilian convoy and wounded by a shell. On the train back home, Albert takes a turn for the worse and cannot complete the journey, instead being sent off the train to recuperate in a Catholic hospital.
Paul uses a combination of bartering and manipulation to stay by Albert's side. Albert eventually has his leg amputated, while Paul is deemed fit for service and returned to the front.

By now, the war is nearing its end and the German Army is retreating. In despair, Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. It is the death of Kat that eventually makes Paul careless about living. In the final chapter, he comments that peace is coming soon, but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims or goals left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood.

In October 1918, Paul is finally killed on a remarkably peaceful day. The situation report from the frontline states a simple phrase: "All quiet on the Western Front." Paul's corpse displays a calm expression on its face, "as though almost glad the end had come."

==Themes==
One of the major themes of the novel is the difficulty of soldiers to revert to civilian life after having experienced extreme combat situations. Remarque comments in the preface that "[This book] will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war."&lt;ref name="DestroyedByWar"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5UVJYPUw18AC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=%22It+will+try+simply+to+tell+of+a+generation+of+men+who,+even+though+they+may+have+escaped+its+shells,+were+destroyed+by+the+war.%22 |title=Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front |page=48 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This internal destruction can be found as early as the first chapter as Paul comments that, although all the boys are young, their youth has left them. In addition, the massive loss of life and negligible gains from the fighting are constantly emphasized. Soldiers' lives are thrown away by their commanding officers who are stationed comfortably away from the front, ignorant of the daily terrors of the front line.

==Main characters==
[[Image:AllQuietOnTheWesternFront.jpg|thumb|Cover of first English language edition. The design is based upon a German [[war bonds]] poster by [[Fritz Erler (painter)|Fritz Erler]].]]

===Albert Kropp===
Kropp was in Paul's class at school and is described as the clearest thinker of the group as well as the smallest. Kropp is wounded towards the end of the novel and undergoes a [[leg amputation]]. Both he and Bäumer end up spending time in a [[Catholic]] hospital together, Bäumer suffering from shrapnel wounds to the leg and arm. Though Kropp initially plans to commit [[suicide]] if he requires an amputation, the book suggests he postponed suicide because of the strength of military camaraderie. Kropp and Bäumer part ways when Bäumer is recalled to his regiment after recovering. Paul comments that saying farewell was "very hard, but it is something a soldier learns to deal with."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter Ten of All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haie Westhus===
Haie is described as being tall and strong, and a [[peat]]-digger by profession. Overall, his size and behavior make him seem older than Paul, yet he is the same age as Paul and his school-friends (roughly 19 at the start of the book). Haie, in addition, has a good sense of humour. During combat, he is injured in his back, fatally (Chapter 6)—the resulting wound is large enough for Paul to see Haie's breathing lung when Himmelstoß (Himmelstoss) carries him to safety.

===Friedrich Müller===
Müller is about 18 and a half years of age, one of Bäumer's classmates, when he also joins the German army as a volunteer to go to the war. Carrying his old school books with him to the battlefield, he constantly reminds himself of the importance of learning and education. Even while under enemy fire, he "mutters propositions in physics". He became interested in Kemmerich's boots and inherits them when Kemmerich dies early in the novel. He is killed later in the book after being shot point-blank in the stomach with a "light pistol" (flare gun). As he was dying "quite conscious and in terrible pain", he gave his boots which he inherited from Kemmerich to Paul.

===Stanislaus "Kat" Katczinsky===
Kat has the most positive influence on Paul and his comrades on the battlefield. Katczinsky was a cobbler ([[shoemaker]]) in civilian life; he is older than Paul Bäumer and his comrades, about 40 years old, and serves as their leadership figure. He also represents a literary model highlighting the differences between the younger and older soldiers. While the older men have already had a life of professional and personal experience before the war, Bäumer and the men of his age have had little life experience or time for personal growth.

Kat is also well known for his ability to scavenge nearly any item needed, especially food. At one point he secures four boxes of lobster. Bäumer describes Kat as possessing a [[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]]. One night, Bäumer along with a group of other soldiers are holed up in a factory with neither rations nor comfortable bedding. Katczinsky leaves for a short while, returning with straw to put over the bare wires of the beds. Later, to feed the hungry men, Kat brings bread, a bag of horse flesh, a lump of fat, a pinch of salt and a pan in which to cook the food.

Kat is hit by shrapnel at the end of the story, leaving him with a smashed shin. Paul carries him back to camp on his back, only to discover upon their arrival that a stray splinter had hit Kat in the back of the head and killed him on the way. He is thus the last of Paul's close friends to die in battle. It is Kat's death that eventually makes Bäumer indifferent as to whether he survives the war or not, yet certain that he can face the rest of his life without fear. "Let the months and the years come, they can take nothing from me, they can take nothing more. I am so alone, and so without hope that I can confront them without fear."

=== Tjaden ===
One of Bäumer's non-schoolmate friends. Before the war, Tjaden was a locksmith. A big eater with a grudge against the former postman-turned corporal Himmelstoß (thanks to his strict "disciplinary actions"), he manages to forgive Himmelstoß later in the book. Throughout the book, Paul frequently remarks on how much of an eater he is, yet somehow manages to stay as "thin as a rake". He appears in the sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]''.

==Minor characters==

===Kantorek===
Kantorek was the [[schoolmaster]] of Paul and his friends, including  Kropp, Leer, Müller, and Behm. Behaving "in a way that cost [him] nothing," Kantorek is a strong supporter of the war and encourages Bäumer and other students in his class to join the war effort. Among twenty enlistees was Joseph Behm, the first of the class to die in battle. In an example of tragic irony, Behm was the only one who did not want to enter the war.

Kantorek is a hypocrite, urging the young men he teaches to fight in the name of patriotism, while not voluntarily enlisting himself. In a twist of fate, Kantorek is later called up as a soldier as well. He very reluctantly joins the ranks of his former students, only to be drilled and taunted by Mittelstädt, one of the students he had earlier persuaded to enlist.

===Peter Leer===
Leer is an intelligent soldier in Bäumer's company, and one of his classmates. He is very popular with women; when he and his comrades meet three French women, he is the first to seduce one of them. Bäumer describes Leer's ability to attract women by saying "Leer is an old hand at the game". In chapter 11, Leer is hit by a shell fragment, which also hits Bertinck. The shrapnel tears open Leer's hip, causing him to bleed to death quickly. His death causes Paul to ask himself, "What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician in school?"&lt;ref&gt;''All Quiet on the Western Front'' (London: Putnam &amp; Company Ltd, 1970 reprint), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bertinck===
Lieutenant Bertinck is the leader of Bäumer's [[Company (military)|company]]. His men have a great respect for him, and Bertinck has great respect for his men. He permits them to eat the rations of the men that had been killed in action, standing up to the chef Ginger who would only allow them their allotted share. Bertinck is genuinely despondent when he learns that few of his men had survived an engagement.

When he and the other characters are trapped in a trench under heavy attack, Bertinck, who has been injured in the firefight, spots a flamethrower team advancing on them. He gets out of cover and takes aim on the flamethrower but misses, and gets hit by enemy fire. With his next shot he kills the flamethrower, and immediately afterwards an enemy shell explodes on his position blowing off his chin. The same explosion also fatally wounds Leer.

===Himmelstoss===
Corporal Himmelstoss (spelled Himmelstoß in some editions) was a postman before enlisting in the war. He is a power-hungry corporal with special contempt for Paul and his friends, taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of his trainees during their basic training in preparation for their deployment. Paul later figures that the training taught by Himmelstoss made them "hard, suspicious, pitiless, and tough" but most importantly it taught them comradeship. However, Bäumer and his comrades have a chance to get back at Himmelstoss because of his punishments, mercilessly whipping him on the night before they board trains to go to the front.

Himmelstoss later joins them at the front, revealing himself as a coward who shirks his duties for fear of getting hurt or killed, and pretends to be wounded because of a scratch on his face. Paul Bäumer beats him because of it and when a lieutenant comes along looking for men for a trench charge, Himmelstoss joins and leads the charge. He carries Haie Westhus's body to Bäumer after he is fatally wounded. Matured and repentant through his experiences Himmelstoß later asks for forgiveness from his previous charges. As he becomes the new staff cook, to prove his friendship he secures two pounds of sugar for Bäumer and half a pound of butter for Tjaden.

===Detering===
Detering is a farmer who constantly longs to return to his wife and farm. He is also fond of horses and is angered when he sees them used in combat. He says, "It is of the vilest baseness to use horses in the war," when the group hears several wounded horses writhe and scream for a long time before dying during a bombardment. He tries to shoot them to put them out of their misery, but is stopped by Kat to keep their current position hidden. He is driven to desert when he sees a cherry tree in blossom, which reminds him of home too much and inspires him to leave. He is found by military police and court-martialed, and is never heard from again.

===Josef Hamacher===
Hamacher is a patient at the Catholic hospital where Paul and Albert Kropp are temporarily stationed. He has an intimate knowledge of the workings of the hospital. He also has a "Special Permit," certifying him as sporadically not responsible for his actions due to a head wound, though he is clearly quite sane and exploiting his permit so he can stay in the hospital and away from the war as long as possible.

===Franz Kemmerich===
A young boy of only 19 years. Franz Kemmerich had enlisted in the army for World War I along with his best friend and classmate, Bäumer. Kemmerich is shot in the leg early in the story; his injured leg has to be amputated, and he dies shortly after. In anticipation of Kemmerich's imminent death, Müller was eager to get his boots. While in the hospital, someone steals Kemmerich's watch that he intended to give to his mother, causing him great distress and prompting him to ask about his watch every time his friends visit him in the hospital. Paul later finds the watch and hands it over to Kemmerich's mother, only to lie and say Franz died instantly and painlessly when questioned.

===Joseph Behm===
A student in Paul's class who is described as youthful and overweight. Behm was the only student that was not quickly influenced by Kantorek's patriotism to join the war, but eventually, due to pressure from friends and Kantorek, he joins the war. He is the first of Paul's friends to die. He is blinded in [[no man's land]] and believed to be dead by his friends. The next day, when he is seen walking blindly around [[no-man's-land]], it is discovered that he was only unconscious. However, he is killed before he can be rescued.

==Publication and reception==
From November 10 to December 9, 1928, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was published in serial form in ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' magazine. It was released in book form the following year to smashing success, selling one and a half million copies that same year. Although publishers had worried that interest in [[World War I]] had waned more than 10 years after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]], Remarque's realistic depiction of trench warfare from the perspective of young soldiers struck a chord with the war's survivors—soldiers and civilians alike—and provoked strong reactions, both positive and negative, around the world.

With ''All Quiet on the Western Front'', Remarque emerged as an eloquent spokesman for a generation that had been, in his own words, "destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells." Remarque's harshest critics, in turn, were his countrymen, many of whom felt the book denigrated the German war effort, and that Remarque had exaggerated the horrors of war to further his pacifist agenda. The strongest voices against Remarque came from the emerging [[Nazi Party]] and its ideological allies. In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' became one of the first [[degenerate art|degenerate books]] to be publicly burnt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/remarque-publishes-all-quiet-on-the-western-front|title=Nov 10, 1928: Remarque publishes All Quiet on the Western Front|work=[[History.com]]|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1930, screenings of the [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|Academy Award-winning film based on the book]] were met with Nazi-organized protests and mob attacks on both movie theatres and audience members.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauer|first1=Patrick|title=The Most Loved and Hated Novel About World War I|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/most-loved-and-hated-novel-about-world-war-I-180955540/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 21, 2015|date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, objections to Remarque’s portrayal of the German army personnel during World War I were not limited to the Nazis. Dr. Karl Kroner ([[:de:Karl Kroner|de]]) objected to Remarque’s depiction of the medical personnel as being inattentive, uncaring, or absent from frontline action. Dr. Kroner was specifically worried that the book would perpetuate German stereotypes abroad that had subsided since the First World War. He offered the following clarification: “People abroad will draw the following conclusions: if German doctors deal with their own fellow countrymen in this manner, what acts of inhumanity will they not perpetuate against helpless prisoners delivered up into their hands or against the populations of occupied territory?”&lt;ref name="clardy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front#Reception|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615102102/http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front#Reception|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 15, 2013|title=All Quiet on the Western Front: Reception|author=Patrick Clardy|work=Yale Modernism Lab|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barker"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Christine R.|last1=Barker|first2=Rex William|last2=Last|title=Erich Maria Remarque|location=New York|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fellow patient of Remarque’s in the military hospital in [[Duisburg]] objected to the negative depictions of the nuns and patients, and of the general portrayal of soldiers: “There were soldiers to whom the protection of homeland, protection of house and homestead, protection of family were the highest objective, and to whom this will to protect their homeland gave the strength to endure any extremities.”&lt;ref name="barker"/&gt;

These criticisms suggest that perhaps experiences of the war and the personal reactions of individual soldiers to their experiences may be more diverse than Remarque portrays them; however, it is beyond question that Remarque gives voice to a side of the war and its experience that was overlooked or suppressed at the time. This perspective is crucial to understanding the true effects of World War I. The evidence can be seen in the lingering depression that Remarque and many of his friends and acquaintances were suffering a decade later.&lt;ref name="clardy"/&gt;

In contrast, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was trumpeted by [[pacifists]] as an anti-war book.&lt;ref name="barker"/&gt; Remarque makes a point in the opening statement that the novel does not advocate any political position, but is merely an attempt to describe the experiences of the soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hans|last=Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=uk&amp;id=sPH4NyyUlmAC&amp;dq=0-87249-740-2&amp;q=night+in+lisbon#v=snippet&amp;q=night%20in%20lisbon&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Erich Maria Remarque|location=Columbia, SC|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main artistic criticism was that it was a mediocre attempt to cash in on public sentiment.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The enormous popularity the work received was a point of contention for some literary critics, who scoffed at the fact that such a simple work could be so earth-shattering.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Much of this literary criticism came from [[Salomo Friedlaender]], who wrote a book ''Hat Erich Maria Remarque wirklich gelebt?'' "Did Erich Maria Remarque really live?" (under pen name Mynona), which was, in its turn, criticized in: ''Hat Mynona wirklich gelebt?'' "Did Mynona really live?" by [[Kurt Tucholsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Tucholsky (under pen name Ignaz Wrobel), [http://www.textlog.de/tucholsky-mynona-wirklich.html ''Hat Mynona wirklich gelebt?''], ''Die Weltbühne'', December 31, 1929, No. 1, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Friedlaender’s criticism was mainly personal in nature—he attacked Remarque as being ego-centric and greedy. Remarque publicly stated that he wrote ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' for personal reasons, not for profit, as Friedlaender had charged.&lt;ref name="clardy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barker" /&gt;   {{Interlanguage link multi|Max Joseph Wolff|de}} wrote a parody titled ''Vor Troja nichts Neues'' (''Compared to Troy, Nothing New'') under the pseudonym ''Emil Marius Requark''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/578423782 Catalogue entry] for ''Vor Troja nichts Neues'' in the German National Library, retrieved January 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''alphabet effect''' is a group of hypotheses in [[communication theory]] arguing that [[Phonetics|phonetic]] [[writing]], and [[Alphabet|alphabetic scripts]] in particular, have served to promote and encourage the cognitive skills of [[abstraction]], analysis, coding, decoding, and classification. Promoters of these hypotheses are associated with the [[Toronto School of Communication]], such as [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]], [[Walter Ong]] and more recently [[Robert K. Logan]]; the term "alphabet effect" comes from Logan's 1986 work (see the bibliography below which references the 2004 second edition).

==Overview==

The theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to the greater economy of [[symbol]]s in alphabetic systems; and this abstraction and the analytic skills needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed to the cognitive development of its users. Proponents of this theory hold that the development of phonetic writing and the alphabet in particular (as distinct from other types of writing systems) has made a significant impact on [[Western culture|Western]] thinking and development precisely because it introduced a new level of abstraction, analysis, coding, decoding and classification. McLuhan and Logan (1977) while not suggesting a direct causal connection nevertheless suggest that, as a result of these skills, the use of the alphabet created an environment conducive to the development of [[Codification (law)|codified law]], [[monotheism]], abstract [[science]], [[deductive logic]], objective [[history]], and [[individualism]]. According to Logan, "All of these innovations, including the alphabet, arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the [[Tigris-Euphrates]] river system and the [[Aegean Sea]], and within the very narrow time frame between 2000 B.C. and 500 B.C." (Logan 2004). The emergence of codified law in [[Sumer]] as exemplified by the Hammurabic code actually coincided with the reform of the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Syllabary|syllabic]] system and is not directly influenced by the alphabet per se but rather by a phonetic writing system consisting of only sixty signs. Also it has to be pointed out that there was a robust scientific tradition in [[China]] but that science as practised in ancient China was not abstract but concrete and practical. In fact the impetus for formulating the Alphabet Effect was to explain why abstract science began in the West and not China despite the long list of [[invention]]s and [[technology]] that first appeared in China as documented by [[Joseph Needham]] in his book ''The Grand Titration'' (Needham 1969). The Alphabet Effect provides an alternative explanation to what is known as [[Needham's Grand Question]], namely why China had been overshot by the West in science and technology, despite its earlier successes.

Another impact of alphabetic writing was that it led to the invention of [[zero]], the [[Positional notation|place number system]], [[negative number]]s, and [[algebra]] by [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] [[mathematician]]s in India 2000 years ago (Logan 2004). These ideas were picked up by [[Arab]] mathematicians and scientists and eventually made their way to Europe 1400 years later.

Prior to the written word there was a monopoly of knowledge by priests. (Innes: 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;4) This was because literacy was seen to be very time consuming. Therefore, all literacy was left in the hands of priests. With the priests monopolizing the content of religious texts there would be little or no dissention among the public. Thus the introduction of the alphabet substantially limited the power of the priests and religious texts were now open to society for questioning.

A social ramification of the introduction of the alphabet was the creation of social distinctions within society. Scholar Andrew Robinson supports this point by stating that those who are illiterate within society are seen as being deficient and ‘backward’ (Robinson: 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;215). Consequently, the development of the alphabet allowed for distinctions to be formed within society between the literate upper class and the illiterate lower class.

The development of the alphabet and hence the written word has also affected the impact of emotion. This point is also shared by Marshall McLuhan who believes that to translate a beautiful picture into words would be to deprive it of correctly articulating its best qualities (McLuhan: 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;83). Therefore, the written word has deprived both images and beautiful objects of the correct level of emotion with which to express their exact appearance.

The fact that the alphabet introduced the idea that a person’s writing could live on long after they died was another social ramification of the alphabet. This argument is also shared by Andrew Robinson. Robinson believes that the need for ‘immortality’ has always been of extreme importance for many authors. (Robinson: 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;83) As a result, the development of the written word allowed for the ‘immortality’ of authors and their written works.

==Criticism of the theory as ethnocentric==
Grosswiler (2004) notes that many scholars (including former adherents of the theory such as Goody) have pointed out that the theory is based on a particular Hellenocentric account of science, which neglects how different cultures have had hegemony scientifically irrespective of writing system

==Criticism of the theory's account of Chinese writing==
Several scholars have pointed out that the [[logogram|logographic]] account of Chinese writing is obsolete and incorrect. [[John DeFrancis]] suggests the use of the term semasiographic rather than logographic, because the idea of Chinese characters as pictorial in nature is only partially true. From Dominic Yu's account: 
:Take, for example, the character 他, representing the third person singular pronoun "tā". The left hand component, the "person" radical, indicates that this character vaguely has something to do with a person or people. I say "vaguely" because this is a very common radical is also used in characters such as 份, 假, and 做, meaning, "portion," "fake," and "to do," respectively. The right side is a phonetic component indicating that (at some earlier stage of Chinese), this character rhymed with 也, now pronounced "yě." Nothing in this character indicates the idea of "third person singular pronoun." From this example, we can see that Chinese characters mainly represent sounds, and only represent ideas in a rather insignificant way. Thus, Logan's claim that Chinese characters represent the "idea of a word" is baseless.

==Criticism of the theory from alternate paths to alphabetic script==
It has been suggested (by e.g. Grosswiler 2004) that [[Denise Schmandt-Besserat|Schmandt-Besserat's]] research into the origin of writing from three-dimensional tokens gives an alternative to the progressivist account of the Alphabet Effect theory. Grosswiler suggests that it is the potential for recording memory, not any one system of it, that propels a culture towards scientific thought.

'''''An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales''''' is a [[1995 in literature|1995 book]] by [[neurologist]] [[Oliver Sacks]] consisting of seven medical case histories of individuals with neurological conditions such as [[autism]] and [[Tourette syndrome]]. ''An Anthropologist on Mars'' follows up on many of the themes Sacks explored in his earlier book, ''[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]'', but here the essays are significantly longer and Sacks has more of an opportunity to discuss each subject with more depth and to explore historical case studies of patients with similar symptoms. In addition, Sacks studies his patients outside the hospital, often traveling considerable distances to interact with his subjects in their own environments. Sacks concludes that "defects, disorders, [and] diseases... can play a paradoxical role, by bringing out latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life that might never be seen, or even be imaginable, in their absence" (p. ''xvi'').

==Essays==
*"The Case of the Colorblind Painter" discusses an accomplished artist who is suddenly struck by [[cerebral achromatopsia]] or the inability to perceive color due to brain damage.
*"The Last Hippie" describes the case of a man suffering from the effects of a massive [[brain tumor]], including [[anterograde amnesia]], which prevents him from remembering anything that has happened since the late 1960s. Sacks' discussion of the case includes a comparison with [[Phineas Gage]], the American railroad worker who survived for eleven years after an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head. 
*"A Surgeon's Life" describes Sacks' interactions with Dr. Carl Bennett, a [[surgeon]] and amateur [[aviator|pilot]] with [[Tourette syndrome]]. The surgeon is often beset by [[tic]]s, but these tics vanish when he is operating. 
*"To See and Not See" is the tale of [[Shirl Jennings]], a man who was [[blindness|blind]] from early childhood, but was able to recover some of his sight after surgery. This is one of an extremely small number of cases where an individual regained sight lost at such an early age, and as with many of the other cases, the patient found the experience to be deeply disturbing.
*"The Landscape of His Dreams" discusses Sacks' interactions with Franco Magnani, an artist obsessed with his home village of [[Pontito]] in [[Tuscany]]. Although Magnani has not seen his village in many years, he has constructed a detailed, highly accurate, three-dimensional model of Pontito in his head.
*"Prodigies" describes Sacks' relationship with [[Stephen Wiltshire]], a young [[autistic savant]] described by [[Hugh Casson]] as "possibly the best child artist in Britain."
*"An Anthropologist on Mars" describes Sacks' meeting with [[Temple Grandin]], an autistic woman  who is a world-renowned designer of humane [[livestock]] facilities and a professor at [[Colorado State University]]. The title of this essay comes from a phrase Grandin uses to describe how she often feels in social interactions.

The 1999 film ''[[At First Sight (1999 film)|At First Sight]]'' is based on the fourth essay, "To See and Not to See". The Brian Friel play ''[[Molly Sweeney]]'' was also inspired by this essay. The 2011 film ''[[The Music Never Stopped]]'' is based on the second essay, "The Last Hippie".

== History ==

=== Prior to 2016 ===
According to the [[International Crisis Group]] (ICG) and a spokesperson for ARSA, the group was formed in 2013, following the [[2012 Rakhine State riots]], under the name ''Harakah al-Yaqin'' (translated as ''Faith Movement'' in English).&lt;ref name="econom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winchester" /&gt; A former member of ARSA described how he was recruited by the group's leader, Ataullah abu Ammar Jununi, three years prior to the attacks in October 2016. Ataullah had approached villagers, asking for five to ten recruits to join his group and telling them that the time had come to "stop the mistreatment of the Rohingya people". Prior to the October 2016 attacks, ARSA had merely patrolled villages armed with bamboo sticks, making sure that villagers prayed at mosques.&lt;ref name="BBCHead"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Head|first1=Jonathan|title=The truth about Rohingya militants|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41521268|accessdate=11 October 2017|work=BBC News|date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011042004/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41521268#|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rohingya locals and Burmese security officials, the group had again began approaching Rohingya men from various villages for recruitment six months prior to its first attack in October 2016, this time with the intention of training them across the border in [[Bangladesh]] for a future attack in Myanmar.&lt;ref name="Reuters2" /&gt;

=== 2016 ===
In October 2016, under the name ''Harakah al-Yaqin'', the group claimed responsibility for [[Northern Rakhine State clashes|attacks]] on Burmese border posts along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, which left 9 border officers and 4 soldiers dead.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar policemen killed in Rakhine border attack|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37601928|accessdate=12 October 2016|work=BBC News|date=9 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011223358/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37601928#|archive-date=11 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rakhine unrest leaves four Myanmar soldiers dead|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37627498|accessdate=13 October 2016|work=BBC News|date=12 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012154444/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37627498#|archive-date=12 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tatmadaw]] (Myanmar Armed Forces) announced on 15 November 2016 that a total of 69 insurgents had been killed by security forces in the recent fighting.&lt;ref name="Reuters3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slodkowski|first1=Antoni|title=Myanmar army says 86 killed in fighting in northwest|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-idINKBN13A11N|accessdate=17 November 2016|work=[[Reuters]] India|date=15 November 2016|language=en-IN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116231050/http://in.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-idINKBN13A11N#|archive-date=16 November 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICG reported on 14 December 2016 that in interviews, the leaders of ARSA claimed to have links to private individuals in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Pakistan]]. The ICG also claimed in unconfirmed reports that Rohingya villagers had been "secretly trained" by Afghan and Pakistani fighters.&lt;ref name="Yahoo1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohingya insurgency a 'game-changer' for Myanmar|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/1159557/rohingya-insurgency-a-game-changer-for-myanmar|accessdate=15 December 2016|work=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 ===
Burmese state media reported on 22 June 2017 that three insurgents had been killed by security forces in a raid on an insurgent camp supposedly belonging to ARSA, as part of a two-day "area clearance operation" by the government. Authorities confiscated gunpowder, ski masks and wooden rifles used for training.&lt;ref name="ASEAN1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar forces kill 3 in raid on 'terrorist training camps': State media - Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-forces-kill-3-in-raid-on-terrorist-training-camps-state-media/articleshow/59263240.cms|accessdate=19 July 2017|work=The Times of India|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622173328/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-forces-kill-3-in-raid-on-terrorist-training-camps-state-media/articleshow/59263240.cms#|archive-date=22 June 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the Burmese government accused ARSA of murdering 34 to 44 civilians and kidnapping 22 others in reprisal attacks against those ARSA have perceived as government collaborators. ARSA denied the accusations.&lt;ref name="ASEAN1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Taylor|title=Rohingya ‘insurgent’ camp raided - Asean Economist|url=http://aseaneconomist.com/rohingya-insurgent-camp-raided/|accessdate=19 July 2017|work=Asean Economist|date=22 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827132154/http://aseaneconomist.com/rohingya-insurgent-camp-raided/#|archive-date=27 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar sees insurgents behind Rohingya killings in northwest|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-attackers-idUSKBN1A515L|last=Lewis|first=Simon|accessdate=21 July 2017|work=Reuters|date=20 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720202123/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-attackers-idUSKBN1A515L#|archive-date=20 July 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 2017, the group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on police posts and an attempted raid on an army base. The government announced a death toll of 77 Rohingya insurgents and 12 security forces in northern [[Maungdaw]] following the attacks. The government stated that they had attacked a police station in the [[Maungdaw District]] with a handmade bomb alongside the coordinated attacks on several police posts.

On 9 November, Myint Khyine, the secretary of the Immigration and Population Department, blamed the deaths of 18 village leaders in the past three months in Maungdaw and Buthidaung, on ARSA. The village leaders helped the department to issue national verification cards to Rohingya villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Militants Kill Village Leaders Who Worked on Myanmar’s Verification Card Program|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/militants-kill-village-leaders-who-worked-on-myanmars-verification-card-program-11092017154134.html|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=Radio Free Asia|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112113011/http://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/militants-kill-village-leaders-who-worked-on-myanmars-verification-card-program-11092017154134.html#|archive-date=12 November 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2018, [[Amnesty International]] released a report claiming it had evidence that ARSA rounded up and killed as many as 99 Hindu civilians on 25 August 2017, the same day that ARSA launched a massive attack against Myanmar's security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amnesty: Rohingya fighters killed scores of Hindus in Myanmar|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/amnesty-rohingya-fighters-killed-scores-hindus-myanmar-180522182832333.html|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=www.aljazeera.com|date=22 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522222903/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/amnesty-rohingya-fighters-killed-scores-hindus-myanmar-180522182832333.html#|archive-date=22 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Tan Hui|title=Rohingya militants massacred Hindus: Amnesty International report|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/rohingya-militants-massacred-hindus-amnesty-international-report|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=The Straits Times|date=22 May 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523042146/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/rohingya-militants-massacred-hindus-amnesty-international-report#|archive-date=23 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report alleged that ARSA insurgents armed with guns and swords were responsible for at least one reported massacre of Hindus in northern Rakhine State. Survivors claimed that in the village of Kha Maung Seik, ARSA insurgents killed the men, whilst the women were kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam. It was also alleged in the report that statements given by Hindus immediately after the massacre were false, and that they were threatened by ARSA into blaming [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] for the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar: New evidence reveals Rohingya armed group massacred scores in Rakhine State|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/myanmar-new-evidence-reveals-rohingya-armed-group-massacred-scores-in-rakhine-state/|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=Amnesty International|date=22 May 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614133210/https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/myanmar-new-evidence-reveals-rohingya-armed-group-massacred-scores-in-rakhine-state/#|archive-date=14 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Press statements ==
ARSA periodically releases press statements online, in documents and videos posted to its [[Twitter]] account. Unlike other insurgent groups in Myanmar, most of ARSA's written statements are exclusively in [[English language|English]], rather than in the group's native tongue (in this case, [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]]).&lt;ref name="Lintner2017" /&gt;

On 17 October 2016, ARSA (then under the name Harakah al-Yaqin) released a press statement online. In a roughly five minute video, the group's leader, [[Ataullah abu Ammar Jununi]], flanked by armed fighters reads from a sheet of paper:

{{quote|
Citizens of [[Rakhine State|Arakan [State]]], citizens of Myanmar, and citizens of the world.

It is no longer a secret that the [[Rohingya people|Rohingyas]] are the most persecuted [[ethnic minority]] on earth. Throughout the last six decades, we have been [[Persecution of Muslims in Myanmar|subjected to genocidal mass-killings, and all kinds of atrocities]] at the hands of successive tyrannical Burmese regimes.

Yet the world has chosen to ignore us! Then again, the "resourceful" world has apparently failed to save us!

We [Harakah al-Yaqin], the sons of Arakan[ese] soil, who are compelled by our dire situation to follow our own destiny through uprising, self-determination and self-defence, stand as an independent body which is free from all [[Terrorism|elements of terror]] in any nature, seek [[Human rights|fundamental but legitimate rights]] and other [forms of] justice for all Arakanese, including our fellow innocent Rohingyas and other civilians dying from the continuous military assaults.

We categorically state that our people have chosen to free themselves from their oppressors, from the tragic deaths in the Bay of Bengal, in the Thai jungles and at the hands of human traffickers. We have also resolved to defend our mothers, sisters, elderly, children and ourselves.

We shall not rest until all our desired goals are achieved with the genuine help of the [[United Nations|civilised world]].
}}

Six other videos were released online by the group between 10 and 27 October 2016.&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McPherson|first1=Poppy|title=‘It will blow up’: fears Myanmar's deadly crackdown on Muslims will spiral out of control|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/myanmar-deadly-crackdown-muslims-rohingya|accessdate=11 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210021417/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/myanmar-deadly-crackdown-muslims-rohingya#|archive-date=10 December 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group released a press statement on 29 March 2017 under a new name, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). The document included demands made to the Burmese government and a warning that if they were not met, there would be further attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army|url=http://www.rohingyablogger.com/2017/03/statement-of-arakan-rohingya-salvation.html|website=www.rohingyablogger.com|accessdate=5 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405172013/http://www.rohingyablogger.com/2017/03/statement-of-arakan-rohingya-salvation.html#|archive-date=5 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armenian Golgotha''' ({{lang-hy|Հայ Գողգոթան}}) is a memoir written by [[Grigoris Balakian]] about his eyewitness account of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. The memoir was released in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittemore|first1=Katharine|title=Seven books on the Armenian genocide - The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2015/09/25/seven-books-armenian-genocide/vXumdvQTsNR061mOupX7xJ/story.html|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=BostonGlobe.com|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 1, about his life prior to and during the Armenian Genocide, was released in 1922. Volume 2, about his life as a fugitive after the Genocide, was released in 1959. Originally published in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], the memoir was later published in various languages including an English translation by [[Peter Balakian]], Balakian's great-nephew, with Aris Sevag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Carlin|title="Armenian Golgotha: A Memoir of the Armenian Genocide, 1915-18" by Grigoris Balakian|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/chi-books-review-armenian-golgotha-memoir-balakian-story.html|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Upon the release of the English translation in 2009, many publications reviewed the account. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' referred to the account as "a fascinating first-hand testimony to a monumental crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidson|first1=Amy|title=Armenian Golgotha|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/04/armenian-golgotha|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=The New Yorker|date=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elie Wiesel]], the author best known for the novel [[Night (book)|Night]], referred to the account as "heartbreaking" because he believes that the memory presented by Balakian "must remain a lesson for more than one generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Praise From Elie Wiesel and Others for Grigoris Balakian’s Armenian Golgotha: A Memoir of The Armenian Genocide|url=http://asbarez.com/60401/early-praise-from-elie-wiesel-and-others-for-grigoris-balakians-armenian-golgotha-a-memoir-of-the-armenian-genocide/|website=Asbarez.com|accessdate=23 June 2016|date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Republic]]'' praised the account as "a powerful and important book" because "it takes place as one of the key first-hand sources for understanding the Armenian Genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Republic|first1=The New|title=The Evil That Men Do|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/62933/the-evil-men-do|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=New Republic|date=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Chris Bohjalian]] (a second-generation Armenian American) felt personally connected by understanding what happened to his great-grandparents. Bohjalian opined that Balakian's account was "rich with evidence of the Turkish government's complicity and its leaders' premeditation." Bohjalian also hoped that the account would be widely read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bohjalian|first1=Chris|title=A Deadly Time Brought to Life|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/03/AR2009040301894.html|work=Washington Post|accessdate=28 November 2017|date=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4326">{{About|the literary device|"back-stories" of consumer goods|Back-story (production)|the book by [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]]|David Mitchell: Back Story}}
A '''backstory''', '''background story''', '''back-story''', or '''background''' is a set of events invented for a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], presented as preceding and leading up to that plot. It is a [[literary device]] of a [[narrative history]] all chronologically earlier than the narrative of primary interest. 

In [[acting]], it is the history of the [[character (arts)|character]] before the drama begins, and is created during the actor's preparation. 

It is the history of characters and other elements  that underlie the situation existing at the main narrative's start. Even a purely historical work selectively reveals backstory to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/backstory Backstory at Merriam Webster online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backstory Backstory at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage&lt;!--'Main story' redirects here--&gt;==
As a [[literary device]], backstory is often employed to lend depth or believability to the '''main story'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. The usefulness of having a  [[Discovery (fiction)|dramatic revelation]] was recognized by [[Aristotle]], in [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']].

Backstories are usually revealed, partially or in full, chronologically or otherwise, as the main narrative unfolds. However, a story creator may also create portions of a backstory or even an entire backstory that is solely for their own use.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/08/backstory-importance-of-what-isnt-told.html Backstory: The Importance of What Isn't Told]&lt;/ref&gt;

Backstory may be revealed by various means, including [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[dialogue]], [[Narrative|direct narration]], [[:wikt:summary|summary]], [[recollection]], and [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]]. The original ''[[Star Wars (film) | Star Wars]]'' movie and its first two [[sequels]] are examples of a work with a preconceived backstory, which was later released as the "prequel" second set of three movies.

== Recollection ==
[[Recollection]] is the [[Fiction-writing modes|fiction-writing mode]] whereby a character calls something to mind, or remembers it. A character's memory plays a role for conveying backstory, as it allows a fiction-writer to bring forth information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story. Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct fiction-writing mode, recollection is commonly used by authors of fiction.

For example, Orson Scott Card observes that "If it's a memory the character could have called to mind at any point, having her think about it just in time to make a key decision may seem like an implausible coincidence . . . ." Furthermore, "If the memory is going to prompt a present decision, then the memory in turn must have been prompted by a recent event."&lt;ref&gt;Card, Orson Scott (1988), "Character &amp; Viewpoint", p. 113. Cincinnati, OH: Writer's Digest Books. {{ISBN|0-89879-307-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shared universe ==
In a [[shared universe]] more than one author may shape the same backstory. The later creation of a backstory that conflicts with a previously written main story may require the adjustment device known as [[retroactive continuity]], informally known as "[[retcon]]".

==Acting==
Actors may create their own backstories for characters, going beyond the sometimes meager information in a script. Filling in details helps an actor interpret the script and create fully imagined characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homan |first1=Sidney |last2=Rhinehart |first2=Brian |title=Comedy Acting for Theatre: The Art and Craft of Performing in Comedies |date=2018 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9781350012783 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMVIDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=backstory+acting&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=26 November 2018 |chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Book of Abraham FirstPage.png|thumb|The first page of the Book of Abraham.]][[Image:Joseph Smith Papyrus I.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A portion of the papyri used by Joseph Smith as the source of the Book of Abraham. The difference between Egyptologists' translation and Joseph Smith's interpretations has caused considerable controversy.]]
The '''Book of Abraham''' is a work produced in 1835 by [[Joseph Smith]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{Harvnb|Gee|2000a|pp=4–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; based, he said, on Egyptian [[papyrus|papyri]] purchased from a traveling [[mummy]] exhibition. According to Smith, the book was "a translation of some ancient records [...] purporting to be the writings of [[Abraham]], while he was in Egypt, called the Book of Abraham, written by his own hand, upon [[papyri|papyrus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1842|p=704}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith said the papyri describe Abraham's early life, his travels to Canaan and Egypt, and his vision of the [[cosmos]] and its creation.

The work was [[biblical canon|canonized]] in 1880 by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) as part of its [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. It thus forms a doctrinal foundation for the LDS Church and [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] denominations of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] though is not considered a [[religious text]] by the [[Community of Christ]]. Other groups in the Latter Day Saint movement have differing opinions regarding the Book of Abraham, some rejecting and some accepting the text as inspired scripture. The book contains several doctrines that are unique to [[Mormonism]] such as the idea that God organized eternal elements to create the universe (instead of creating it ''[[ex nihilo]]''), the [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] of humanity, a [[Pre-existence|pre-mortal existence]], the first and second estates, and the [[plurality of gods]].

The Book of Abraham papyri were thought to have been lost in the 1871 [[Great Chicago Fire]]. However, in 1966 several fragments of the papyri were found in the archives of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and in the LDS Church archives. They are now referred to as the [[Joseph Smith Papyri]]. Upon examination by professional Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists, these fragments were identified as [[Ancient Egyptian Funerary Texts|Egyptian funerary texts]], including the "Breathing Permit of Hôr"{{#tag:ref|The name of the individual for whom the "Breathing Permit" was intended has variously been rendered as "Hôr" (e.g. {{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=6}}), "Hor" (e.g. {{Harvnb|Rhodes|2005}}), "Horos" (e.g. {{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=71}}), and "Horus" (e.g. {{citation|url=https://user.xmission.com/~research/breathing/index.htm|title=Breathing Permit of Horus|last=Marquardt|first=H. Michael|date=|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}).|group="nb"}} and the "Book of the Dead", among others. As a result, the Book of Abraham has been the source of significant controversy. Critics say it is a work of fiction created by Smith, while some [[Mormon apologetics|Mormon apologists]] defend its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utlm.org/other/nytimes1912papyrusarticle.pdf  Museum Walls Proclaim Fraud of Mormon Prophet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{Main|Joseph Smith papyri|Kirtland Egyptian papers}}
[[File:Joseph Smith, Jr. portrait owned by Joseph Smith III.jpg|thumb|The Book of Abraham was purportedly translated by [[Joseph Smith]] from Egyptian papyri.]]
Eleven mummies and several papyri were discovered near the ancient Egyptian city of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by [[Antonio Lebolo]] between 1818 and 1822. Following Lebolo's death in 1830, the mummies and assorted objects were sent to New York with instructions that they should be sold in order to benefit the bereft heirs of Lebolo.&lt;ref name=ritner11&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael H. Chandler eventually purchased the mummies and artifacts and began displaying them, starting in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=ritner12&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years Chandler toured the eastern United States, displaying and selling some of the mummies as he traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rhodes|2005|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith1902|p=236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 1835, Chandler exhibited his collection in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. A promotional flyer created by Chandler states that the mummies "may have lived in the days of Jacob, Moses, or David".&lt;ref name=ritner1415&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|pp=14–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Kirtland was the home of the Latter Day Saints, led by [[Joseph Smith]]. Smith{{snd}}who had claimed to have translated the [[Book of Mormon]] from [[golden plates]] that had been inscribed with "[[reformed Egyptian]]" text{{snd}}took an immediate interest in the papyri and soon offered Chandler a preliminary translation of the scrolls.&lt;ref name=ritner1/&gt; Smith claimed that the scrolls contained the writings of [[Abraham]] and [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], as well as the tale of an Egyptian princess named "Katumin".&lt;ref name=ritner2&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

{{quote|[W]ith [[William Wines Phelps|W. W. Phelps]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] as scribes, I commenced the translation of some of the characters or hieroglyphics, and much to our joy found that one of the [scrolls] contained the writings of Abraham, another the writings of Joseph of Egypt, etc. &amp;ndash; a more full account of which will appear in its place, as I proceed to examine or unfold them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;}}

Smith, [[Joseph Coe]], and Simeon Andrews soon purchased the four mummies and at least five papyrus documents for $2,400 ({{Inflation|US|2400|1835|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name=ritner1&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gee|2000a|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1835 he began "translating an alphabet to the Book of Abraham, and arranging a grammar of the Egyptian language as practiced by the ancients."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith et al.|1902|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, Smith worked closely with Cowdery and Phelps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jessee|2002|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ritner18/&gt; The result of this attempted deciphering was a collection of documents and manuscripts now known as the [[Kirtland Egyptian papers]]. One of these manuscripts was a bound book titled simply "Grammar &amp; A[l]phabet of the Egyptian Language", which contained Smith's interpretations of the Egyptian glyphs.&lt;ref name=ritner18/&gt;&lt;ref name=ritner1921&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|pp=19–21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the book focuses almost entirely on deciphering Egyptian characters, and the second part deals with a form of astronomy that was supposedly practiced by the ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name=ritner21/&gt; The majority of the pages in this tome were penned in July 1835. Most of the writing in the book was written not by Smith but rather by a scribe taking down what Smith said.&lt;ref name=ritner18&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Egyptian Alphabet" manuscript is particularly important because it illustrates how Smith attempted to translate the papyri. First, the characters on the papyri were transcribed onto the left-hand side of the book. Next, a postulation as to what the symbols sounded like was devised. Finally, an English interpretation of the symbol was provided. Smith's subsequent translation of the papyri takes on the form of five "degrees" of interpretation, each degree representing a deeper and more complex level of interpretation.&lt;ref name=ritner21&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the supposed deciphering of the Egyptian alphabet in July and October of 1835, Smith ostensibly translated the majority of the Book of Abraham in November 1835, followed by some minor revisions in March 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gee|2000a|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ritner192324&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|pp=19, 23–24, 31–32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In translating the book, Smith dictated, and Phelps, [[Warren Parrish]], and [[Frederick G. Williams]] acted as scribes.&lt;ref name=ritner27&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete work was first published serially in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] newspaper ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' in 1842,{{#tag:ref|Facsimile No. 1 and Chapter 1 through chapter 2 verse 18 are to be found in Volume III, No. 9, dated March 1, 1842; Facsimile No. 2 and chapter 2 verses 19 through chapter 5 are to be found in Volume III, No. 10, dated March 15, 1842; Facsimile No. 3 is to be found in Vol. III, No. 14, dated May 16, 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1842}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} and was later canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church as part of its [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

==Content of the work==

===Book of Abraham text===

[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Part of the text describes Abraham's journey from [[Ur Kaśdim|Ur]] to [[Canaan]] and [[Egypt]].]]
The Book of Abraham tells a story of Abraham's life, travels to Canaan and Egypt, and a vision he received concerning the universe, a [[Pre-existence#Mormonism|pre-mortal existence]], and the creation of the world.&lt;ref name="abrahamsummary"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Book of Abraham|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr?lang=eng|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]].org|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has five chapters. Chapter{{nbsp}}1 recounts how Abraham's father [[Terah]] and his forefathers had turned to "the god of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of Pharaoh, king of Egypt".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Pearl of Great Price/Abraham#1:6|Abraham 1:6]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2014|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaldea]]n priests then sacrifice three virgins to pagan gods of stone and wood, and one priest attempts to sacrifice Abraham himself before an angel comes to his rescue.&lt;ref name=ritner2658&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|pp=26, 58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2014|pp=166–168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The text then examines the origins of Egypt and its government.&lt;ref name="abrahamsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2014|p=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter{{nbsp}}2 includes information about God's covenant with Abraham and how it would be fulfilled; in this chapter, Abraham travels from Ur to Canaan, and then to Egypt.&lt;ref name="abrahamsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2014|pp=173–180}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter{{nbsp}}3, Abraham learns about an Egyptian understanding of celestial objects via the [[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]].&lt;ref name="abrahamsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chase204"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2014|p=204}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in this chapter that Abraham also learns about the eternal nature of spirits [...] pre-earth life, [[foreordination]], the Creation, the choosing of a [[Jesus in Christianity|Redeemer]], and the second estate of man."&lt;ref name="abrahamsummary"/&gt; Chapters{{nbsp}}4 and{{nbsp}}5 contain expansions and modifications of the creation narrative in Genesis.&lt;ref name=ritner40&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter{{nbsp}}4, the [[God in Mormonism#Plurality of gods|gods]] (there are over 48 references to the plurality of the gods in Chapters{{nbsp}}4 and{{nbsp}}5&lt;ref name=ritner42&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) plan the creation of the earth and life on the earth. In Chapter{{nbsp}}5, the gods complete creation, and Adam names all living creatures.&lt;ref name="abrahamsummary"/&gt;

Nearly half of the Book of Abraham shows a dependence on the [[King James Version]] of the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name=ritner52&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to H.{{nbsp}}Michael Marquardt, "It seems clear that Smith had the Bible open to Genesis as he dictated this section [i.e., Chapter{{nbsp}}2] of the 'Book of Abraham.'"&lt;ref name=ritner36&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith explained the similarities by reasoning that when Moses penned Genesis, he used the Book of Abraham as a guide, abridging and condensing where he saw fit. As such, since Moses was recalling Abraham's lifetime, his version was in the [[Narration|third person]], whereas the Book of Abraham, being written by its titular author, was composed in the [[First-person narrative|first person]].&lt;ref name=ritner36/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|1992|pp=17–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinct doctrines===
{{Main|Priesthood (Mormonism)|Mormon cosmology|Kolob|Pre-existence|Exaltation (Mormonism)|God in Mormonism}}
The Book of Abraham text is a source of some distinct Latter Day Saint doctrines, which Mormon author Randal S. Chase calls "truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ that were previously unknown to Church members of Joseph Smith's day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2014|p=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the nature of the [[Priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=1|verse=1–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; an understanding of the cosmos,&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] of humanity,&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=2|verse=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Pre-existence|pre-mortal existence]], the first and second estates,&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3|verse=18–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[plurality of gods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=4|verse=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Abraham expands upon the nature of the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] in the Latter Day Saint movement, and it is suggested in the work that those who are foreordained to the priesthood earned this right by valor or nobility in the pre-mortal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3|verse=22–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, the Book explicitly denotes that Pharaoh was a descendant of Ham&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=1|verse=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus "of that lineage by which he could not have the right of Priesthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=1|verse=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This passage is the only one found in any Mormon scripture that bars a particular lineage of people from holding the priesthood.  Even though nothing in the Book of Abraham explicitly connects the line of Pharaoh and Ham to black Africans,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mauss|2003|p=238}},&lt;/ref&gt; this passage was used as a scriptural basis for withholding the priesthood from black individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bringhurst|254|p=193}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither Joseph Smith nor Brigham Young used the Book of Abraham to justify the banning blacks from the priesthood. It wasn't until 1900 that George Q. Cannon, a member of the First Presidency, began using the story of Pharaoh as a scriptural basis for the ban.&lt;ref name="Reeve 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeve|first1=W. Paul|title=Religion of a Different Color: Race and the Mormon Struggle for Whiteness|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95j4BQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-975407-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|205}} In 1912, the First Presidency responded to an inquiry about the priesthood ban by using the story of Pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwTrAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Dialogue Foundation, 2001|year=2001|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 1900s, it became the foundation of church policy in regards to the priesthood ban.&lt;ref name="Reeve 2015" /&gt;{{rp|205}}  The 2002 ''Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual'' points to Abraham 1:21-27 as the reasoning behind the [[Black people and priesthood (LDS)|not giving black people the priesthood until 1978]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/official-declaration-2-every-faithful-worthy-man?lang=eng|title=Official Declaration 2, ‘Every Faithful, Worthy Man’|year=2002|publisher=LDS Church|pages=634-365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 3 of the Book of Abraham describes a unique (and purportedly Egyptian&lt;ref name="chase204"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ritner59&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) understanding of the hierarchy of heavenly bodies, each with different movements and measurements of time.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3|verse=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to this chapter, Randal S. Chase notes, "With divine help, Abraham was able to gain greater comprehension of the order of the galaxies, stars, and planets than he could have obtained from earthly sources."&lt;ref name="chase204"/&gt; At the pinnacle of the cosmos is the slowest-rotating body, [[Kolob]], which, according to the text, is the star closest to where God lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3|verse=3–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Abraham is the only work in the Latter Day Saint canon to mention the star Kolob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kolob|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/kolob|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]].org|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Book:
{{quote|[Abraham] saw the stars, that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God; ... and the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA1"&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3|verse=2|range=-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Based on this verse, the LDS Church claims that "Kolob is the star nearest to the presence of God [and] the governing star in all the universe."&lt;ref name=studyguide/&gt; Time moves slowly on the celestial body; one Kolob-day corresponds to 1,000 earth-years.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Church also notes: "Kolob is also symbolic of Jesus Christ, the central figure in God's plan of salvation."&lt;ref name=studyguide/&gt;

The Book of Abraham also explores pre-mortal existence. The LDS Church website explains: "Life did not begin at birth, as is commonly believed. Prior to coming to earth, individuals existed as spirits."&lt;ref name=ldst&amp;h/&gt; These spirits are eternal and of different intelligences.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3|verse=18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to mortal existence, spirits exist in the "first estate". Once certain spirits (i.e., those who choose to follow the plan of salvation offered by God the Father of their own accord) take on a mortal form, they enter into what is called the "second estate".&lt;ref name=studyguide&gt;{{harvnb|Church Educational System|2000|pp=28–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3|verse=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine of the second estate is explicitly named only in this book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Estate|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Second_Estate|publisher=[[Brigham Young University]]|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of earthly life, therefore, is for humans to prepare for a meeting with God; the Church, citing {{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3|verse=26}} notes: "All who accept and obey the saving principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ will receive eternal life, the greatest gift of God, and will have 'glory added upon their heads for ever and ever'."&lt;ref name=studyguide/&gt;&lt;ref name=ldst&amp;h&gt;{{cite web|title=Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng#9|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]].org|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also notable is the Book of Abraham's insistence that there are many gods, and that "the gods"{{#tag:ref|The identities of the gods themselves are unspecified in the Book itself, but the LDS Church teaches that [[God the Father]] ([[Elohim]]), [[Jesus Christ]] ([[Jehovah]]), [[Adam]] ([[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]), and "many of the great and noble ones" ({{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=3|verse=22}}) participated in the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctrines of the Gospel Student Manual Chapter 7: The Creation|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-7-the-creation?lang=eng|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]].org|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} created the Earth, not ''[[ex nihilo]]'', but rather from pre-existing, eternal matter.&lt;ref name=ldst&amp;h/&gt;&lt;ref name=ritner42/&gt; This shift away from [[monotheism]] and towards [[polytheism]] occurred c.{{nbsp}}1838–39, when Smith was imprisoned in the Liberty Jail in Clay County, Missouri (this was after the majority of the Book of Abraham had been supposedly translated, but prior to its publication).&lt;ref name=ritner313340&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|pp=31–33, 40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith noted that there would be "a time come in the {{sic}} which nothing shall be with held {{sic}} whither {{sic}} there be one god or many gods they {{sic}} shall be manifest all thrones and dominions, principalities and powers shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have indured {{sic}} valiently {{sic}} for the gospel of Jesus Christ" and that all will be revealed "according to that which was ordained in the midst of the councyl {{sic}} of the eternal God of all other Gods before this world was."&lt;ref name=ritner4041&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facsimiles===

Three images ([[facsimiles]] of [[vignetting|vignettes]] on the papyri) and Joseph Smith's explanations of them were printed in the 1842 issues of the ''Times and Seasons''.&lt;ref name=ritner3233&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|pp=32–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These three illustrations were prepared by Smith and an engraver named Reuben Hedlock.&lt;ref name=ritner55&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The facsimiles and their respective explanations were later included with the text of the Pearl of Great Price in a re-engraved format.&lt;ref name=ritner61&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smith's explanations, Facsimile No.{{nbsp}}1 portrays Abraham fastened to an altar, with the idolatrous priest of Elkenah attempting to sacrifice him.&lt;ref name=ritner306&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Facsimile No.{{nbsp}}2 contains representations of celestial objects, including the heavens and earth, fifteen other planets or stars, the sun and moon, the number 1,000 and God revealing the grand key-words of the holy priesthood.&lt;ref name=ritner326&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Facsimile No.{{nbsp}}3 portrays Abraham in the court of [[Pharaoh]] "reasoning upon the principles of Astronomy".&lt;ref name=ritner310&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations and contributions to the Latter Day Saint movement==

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Book of Abraham was canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church,&lt;ref name = ldsorg&gt;{{cite web|title=The Book of Abraham|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng&amp;_r=1|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]].org|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a part of the larger scriptural work, The Pearl of Great Price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pearl of Great Price|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp?lang=eng|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]].org|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the LDS Church has softened its position on the Book of Abraham. An essay on the church's website, titled "Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham," explains: "None of the characters on the papyrus fragments mentioned Abraham’s name or any of the events recorded in the book of Abraham. Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists agree that the characters on the fragments do not match the translation given in the book of Abraham, though there is not unanimity, even among non-Mormon scholars, about the proper interpretation of the vignettes on these fragments."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community of Christ===

The [[Community of Christ]], formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, does not accept the Book of Abraham as canonical, although it was referenced in early church publications.{{#tag:ref|In 1896, two leaders of the church at the time, [[Joseph Smith III]] and [[Heman C. Smith]], made the following observation on the Book of Abraham: "The church has never to our knowledge taken any action on this work, either to indorse {{sic}} or condemn; so it cannot be said to be a church publication; nor can the church be held to answer for the correctness of its teaching. Joseph Smith, as the translator, is committed of course to the correctness of the translation, but not necessarily to the indorsement {{sic}} of its historical or doctrinal contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Smith|1896|p=569}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)===

The [[Strangite]] branch of the movement does not take an official position on the Book of Abraham.

==Loss and rediscovery of the papyrus==
[[File:Chicago in Flames by Currier &amp; Ives, 1871.jpg|thumb|350px|For many years, it was believed that all the papyri that served as the basis for the Book of Abraham had been lost during the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]].]]
After Joseph Smith's death, the Egyptian artifacts were in the possession of his mother, [[Lucy Mack Smith]], and she and her son [[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William Smith]] continued to exhibit the four mummies and associated papyri to visitors.&lt;ref name=ritner61/&gt; Two weeks after Lucy's death in May of 1856, Smith's widow, [[Emma Hale Smith]] Bidamon, her second husband [[Lewis C. Bidamon]],{{#tag:ref|Despite the sale of the mummies and papyri, Bidamon kept in his possession the ten page "'Book of Abraham' Translation Manuscript I", which he later passed onto his son, Charles. The younger Bidamon then sold this item to LDS collector Wilford Wood in 1937, who subsequently donated it to the Church in the same year.&lt;ref name=ritner62/&gt;|group="nb"}} and her son [[Joseph Smith III]], sold "four Egyptian mummies with the records with them" to Abel Combs on May{{nbsp}}26, 1856.&lt;ref name=ritner61/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1995|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=todd1992&gt;{{Harvnb|Todd|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Combs later sold two of the mummies, along with some papyri, to the [[St. Louis Museum]] in 1856.&lt;ref name=ritner62&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the closing of the St.{{nbsp}}Louis Museum, these artifacts were purchased by Joseph H. Wood and found their way to the Chicago Museum in about 1863, and were promptly put on display.&lt;ref name=todd1992/&gt; The museum and all its contents were burned in 1871 during the [[Great Chicago Fire]]. Today it is presumed that the papyri that formed the basis for Facsimiles{{nbsp}}2 and{{nbsp}}3 were lost in the conflagration.&lt;ref name=ritner62/&gt;&lt;ref name="ritner69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fire, however, it was believed that all the sources for the book had been lost.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{Harvnb|Reeve|Parshall|2010|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this belief, Abel Combs still owned several papyri fragments and two mummies. While the fate of the mummies is unknown, the fragments were passed to Combs' nurse Charlotte Benecke Weaver, who gave them to her daughter, Alice Heusser. In 1918 Heusser approached the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (MMA) about purchasing the items; at the time, the museum curators were not interested, but in 1947 they changed their mind, and the museum bought the papyri from Heusser's widower husband, Edward. In the 1960s the MMA decided to raise money by selling some of its items which were considered "less unique". Among these were the papyri that Heusser had sold to the museum several decades earlier.&lt;ref name=ritner64/&gt; In May of 1966, Aziz S. Atiya, a coptic scholar from the [[University of Utah]], was looking through the MMA's collection when he came across the Heusser fragments; upon examining them, he recognized one as the vignette known as Facsmile{{nbsp}}1 from The Pearl of Great Price.&lt;ref name=ritner64/&gt;&lt;ref name=wade1967/&gt; He informed LDS Church leaders, and several months later, on November{{nbsp}}27, 1967, the LDS Church was able to procure the fragments,&lt;ref name=ritner64&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Henry G. Fischer, curator of the Egyptian Collection at the MMA, an anonymous donation to the MMA made it possible for the LDS Church to acquire the papyri.&lt;ref name=wade1967&gt;{{Harvnb|Wade et al.|1967|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent transfer included eleven pieces of papyri, including the original of Facsimile{{nbsp}}1.&lt;ref name=ritner65&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of these fragments were designated [[Joseph Smith Papyri|Joseph Smith Papyrus (JSP) I, X, and XI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barney|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fragments, designated JSP{{nbsp}}II, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII, are thought by critics to be the Book of Joseph to which Smith had referred. Egyptologist John A. Wilson stated that the recovered fragments indicated the existence of at least six to eight separate documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson et al.|1968|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The twelfth fragment was discovered in the LDS Church Historian's office and was dubbed the "Church Historian's Fragment". Disclosed by the church in 1968, the fragment was designated JSP{{nbsp}}IX.&lt;ref name=ritner6566&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritner|2013|pp=65–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is some debate about how much of the papyrus collection is missing, there is broad agreement that the recovered papyri are portions of Smith's original purchase, partly based on the fact that they were pasted onto paper which had "drawings of a temple and maps of the Kirtland, Ohio area" on the back, as well as the fact that they were accompanied by an affidavit by [[Emma Smith]] stating that they had been in the possession of Joseph Smith.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Deseret News]]'', Salt Lake City, November 27, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
{{Main|Critical appraisal of the Book of Abraham}}
[[File:Eugene Francois Marie Joseph Deveria, Portrait of Charles Theodule Deveria, 1864 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|In the late 19th century, French [[Egyptologist]] [[Theodule Deveria]] was one of the first to offer a scholarly critique of Joseph Smith's translation.]]

Since its publication in 1842, the Book of Abraham has been a source of controversy. Non-Mormon Egyptologists, beginning in the late 19th century,&lt;ref name=ritner61/&gt; have disagreed with Joseph Smith's explanations of the facsimiles. They have also asserted that damaged portions of the papyri have been reconstructed incorrectly. In 1912, a letter about the Book of Abraham was published by [[Arthur Cruttenden Mace]], Assistant Curator in the Department of Egyptian Art in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I return herewith, under separate cover, the 'Pearl of Great Price.' The 'Book of Abraham,' it is hardly necessary to say, is a pure fabrication. Cuts 1 and 3 are inaccurate copies of well known scenes on funeral papyri, and cut 2 is a copy of one of the magical discs which in the late Egyptian period were placed under the heads of mummies. There were about forty of these latter known in museums and they are all very similar in character. Joseph Smith's interpretation of these cuts is a farrago of nonsense from beginning to end. Egyptian characters can now be read almost as easily as Greek, and five minutes' study in an Egyptian gallery of any museum should be enough to convince any educated man of the clumsiness of the imposture.&lt;ref name=maceinspalding&gt;{{Citation|url=https://archive.org/details/josephsmithjrast00spala| title=Joseph Smith, Jr., as a translator: an inquiry conducted by Rt. Rev. FS Spalding,|first=F. S.|last=Spalding|accessdate = October 30, 2016|publisher=[[The Arrow Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
The controversy intensified in the late 1960s when portions of the Joseph Smith Papyri were located. The translation of the papyri by both Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists does not match the text of the Book of Abraham as purportedly translated by Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|1992|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the transliterated text from the recovered papyri and facsimiles published in the Book of Abraham contain no direct references, either historical or textual, to Abraham,&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|ashment|2000|p=126}}."&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashment|2000|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ritner69"/&gt; and Abraham's name does not appear anywhere in the papyri or the facsimiles. Edward Ashment notes, "The sign that Smith identified with Abraham [...] is nothing more than the [[hieratic]] version of [...] a 'w' in Egyptian. It has no phonetic or semantic relationship to [Smith's] 'Ah-broam.'"&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|ashment|2000|p=126}}."/&gt; University of Chicago Egyptologist [[Robert K. Ritner]] concluded in 2014 that the source of the Book of Abraham "is the 'Breathing Permit of Hôr,' misunderstood and mistranslated by Joseph Smith",&lt;ref name=ritnerresponse/&gt; and that the other papyri are common Egyptian funerary documents like the Book of the Dead.&lt;ref name=ritner65/&gt; 

Original manuscripts of the Book of Abraham, microfilmed in 1966 by Jerald Tanner, show portions of the Joseph Smith Papyri and their purported translations into the Book of Abraham. Ritner concludes, contrary to the LDS position, due to the microfilms being published prior to the rediscovery of the Joseph Smith Papyri, that "it is not true that 'no eyewitness account of the translation survives'", that the Book of Abraham is "confirmed as a perhaps well-meaning, but erroneous invention by Joseph Smith", and "despite its inauthenticity as a genuine historical narrative, the Book of Abraham remains a valuable witness to early American religious history and to the recourse to ancient texts as sources of modern religious faith and speculation".&lt;ref name=ritnerresponse&gt;{{Citation|url=http://signaturebooks.com/a-response-to-translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham-by-dr-robert-ritner/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119024634/http://signaturebooks.com/a-response-to-translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham-by-dr-robert-ritner/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 19, 2015|title=A Response to 'Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham'|first=Robert K.|last=Ritner|authorlink=Robert K. Ritner|accessdate=January 19, 2016|publisher=[[Signature Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book of Joseph==

As noted above, a second untranslated work was identified by Joseph Smith after scrutinizing the original papyri. He said that one scroll contained "the writings of [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] of Egypt". Based on descriptions by Oliver Cowdery, some, including Charles M. Larson, believe that the fragments Joseph Smith Papyri II, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII are the source of this work.&lt;ref name=larsonchap8&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|1992|pp=81–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Cowdery, in a letter that was published in a Mormon publication, described the papyrus scroll that supposedly contained the Book of Joseph, noting: "The representation of the god-head—three, yet in one, is curiously drawn to give simply, though impressively, the writer's view of that exalted personage. The serpent, represented as walking, or formed in a manner to be able to walk, standing in front of, and near a female figure, is to me, one of the greatest representations I have ever seen upon paper […] Enoch's Pillar, as mentioned by Josephus, is upon the same [scroll]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|1992|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Larson argues that many of these figures (e.g. the god-head, a snake with legs, and a pillar) can be found on JSP II, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|1992|pp=82–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}

      <comment>/* China */ Hyphenated the adjectival phrases ‘high-tin’ and ‘low-tin’—a good idea in general, and crucial here, as ‘high’ and ‘low’ could also refer to the physical shape of the sword’s parts rather than their metallurgical composition. Also improved the last sentence, which was a bit awkward.</comment>

'''Bronze Age swords''' appeared from around the 17th century BC, in the [[Black Sea]] region and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], as a further development of the [[dagger]]. They were replaced by [[Iron Age sword|iron swords]] during the early part of the 1st millennium BC.

From an early time the swords reached lengths in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;cm. The technology to produce blades of such lengths appears to have been developed in the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]], using  alloys of copper and tin or arsenic, around 1700 BC. [[Bronze Age]] swords were typically not longer than 80&amp;nbsp;cm; weapons significantly shorter than 60&amp;nbsp;cm are variously categorized as ''[[short swords]]'' or daggers. Before about 1400 BC swords remained mostly limited to the Aegean and southeastern Europe, but they became more widespread in the final centuries of the 2nd millennium BC, to Central Europe and Britain, to the Near East, Central Asia, Northern India and to China.

==Predecessors==
[[File:Khopesh.jpg|thumb|right|250px|18th century BC [[Khopesh]], [[Shechem]], [[West Bank]]; blade decorations with [[electrum]] inlays.]]
Before [[bronze]], stone (such as [[flint]] and [[obsidian]]) was used as the primary material for edged cutting tools and weapons. Stone, however, is too brittle for long, thin implements such as swords. With the introduction of [[copper]], and subsequently bronze, knives could be made longer, leading to the sword.

Thus, the development of the sword from the [[dagger]] was gradual, and in 2004 the first "swords" were claimed for the Early Bronze Age (c. 33rd to 31st centuries), based on finds at [[Arslantepe]] by Marcella Frangipane, professor of Prehistory and Protohistory of the Near and Middle East at [[Sapienza University of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dekunukem.deviantart.com/journal/Oldest-Swords-Found-in-Turkey-369725919 Oldest Swords Found in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frangipane, M. et.al. 2010: The collapse of the 4th millennium centralised system at Arslantepe and the far-reaching changes in 3rd millennium societies. ORIGINI XXXIV, 2012: 237-260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frangipane, "The 2002 Exploration Campaign at Arslantepe/Malatya" (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A cache of nine swords and daggers was found; they are made of [[Arsenical bronze|arsenic-copper alloy]]. Among them, three swords were beautifully inlaid with [[silver]].

These are the weapons of a total length of 45 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm which could be described as either short swords or long daggers. Some other similar swords have been found in Turkey, and are described by Thomas Zimmermann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/iss/kap_b/backbone/rb_1_1.html First Swords] uni-kiel.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword remained extremely rare for another millennium, and became more widespread only with the closing of the 3rd millennium. The "swords" of this later period can still readily be interpreted as daggers, as with the copper specimen from Naxos (dated roughly 2800 to 2300 BC), with a length of just below 36&amp;nbsp;cm, but individual specimens of the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] "copper swords" of the period around 2300 reach a length up to 60&amp;nbsp;cm.  The first weapons that can unambiguously be classified as swords are those found in [[Minoan Crete]], dated to about 1700 BC, which reach lengths of more than 100&amp;nbsp;cm. These are the "type A" swords of the Aegean Bronze Age.

==Aegean==
{{Further|Military of Mycenaean Greece#Offensive weapons}}

The [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] (Middle to Late Aegean Bronze Age) swords are classified in types labeled A to H following [[Nancy Sandars|Sandars]] (1961, 1963), the "Sandars typology".&lt;!-- ?Killian-Dirlmeier typology--&gt;
Types A and B (''Tab-tang'') are the earliest from about the 17th to 16th centuries, types C (''Horned swords'') and D (''Cross swords'') from the 15th century, types E and F (''T-hilt swords'') from the 13th and 12th.
The 13th to 12th centuries also see a revival of the "Horned" type, classified as types G and H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Swords and daggers in Late Bronze Age Canaan |last=Shalev |first=Sariel |page=62 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |isbn=978-3-515-08198-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type H swords are associated with the [[Sea Peoples]] and were found in  Anatolia ([[Pergamon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Omero tremila anni dopo: atti del Congresso di Genova, 6-8 luglio 2000 |chapter=Anatolia and the Eastern Aegean at the time of the Trojan War |last=Benzi |first=Marion |editor=Franco Montanari, Paola Ascheri |page=384 |year=2002 |publisher=Edizione di Storia e Letteratura |isbn=978-88-8498-059-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Greece.
Contemporary with types E to H is the so-called Naue II type, imported from south-eastern Europe.

Typologically, these swords are of the ''Sögel'' type, but their shape and decoration&lt;ref&gt;
"the decorative lines on the sword blades that had initially been regarded as incrustations consisted of pure copper hammered into channels that had presumably already been produced in the casting process. Thus the swords are among the very few Early Bronze Age examples of a true inlay technique outside the Mediterranean world [...] An interesting parallel to these has now been found in a sword from the parish of Vreta Kloster in Östergötland, Sweden."  Roland Schwab, Inga Ullén, Christian-Heinrich Wunderlich, ''A sword from Vreta Kloster, and black patinated bronze in Early Bronze Age Europe'', Journal of Nordic Archaeological Science 17, 27–35 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; shows influence of the ''Hajdúsámson-Apa'' type found in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;
"Typologically, the swords from Nebra and Vreta belong to the Sögel blades, which copy the shape and decoration of Hajdúsámson-Apa swords [...] Concerning the provenance of the swords, the area between the rivers Danube and Tisza in present-day Hungary and Romania has been suggested, as also the production in present Germany [...] Vandkilde (1996:240) proposed that these swords and daggers of the Sögel and Wohlde type in southern Jutland could have been manufactured locally." Roland Schwab, Inga Ullén, Christian-Heinrich Wunderlich, ''A sword from Vreta Kloster, and black patinated bronze in Early Bronze Age Europe'', Journal of Nordic Archaeological Science 17, 27–35 (2010).

{{Further|Bronze Age Europe}}

===Naue II===
One of the most important, and longest-lasting, types of prehistoric European swords was the '''Naue II''' type, named for [[Julius Naue]] who first described them and also known as ''Griffzungenschwert'' or "grip-tongue sword". It first appears in c. the 13th century BC in [[Terramare culture|Northern Italy]] (or a general [[Urnfield culture|Urnfield]] background), and survived well into the Iron Age, with a life-span of about seven centuries, until the 6th century BC. During its lifetime the basic design was maintained, although the material changed from bronze to iron. Naue II swords were exported from Europe to the Aegean, and as far afield as [[Ugarit]], beginning about 1200 BC, i.e. just a few decades before the final collapse of the palace cultures in the [[Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Jung,  M. Mehofer, ''A sword of Naue II type from Ugarit and the Historical Significance of Italian type Weaponry in the Eastern Mediterranean'', Aegean Archaeology 8, 2008, 111–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Naue II swords could be as long as 85&amp;nbsp;cm, but most specimens fall into the 60 to 70&amp;nbsp;cm range.

Swords from the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] appear from ca. the 13th century BC, often showing characteristic spiral patterns. The early Nordic swords are also comparatively short; a specimen discovered in 1912 near Bragby, Uppland, Sweden, dated to about 1800 to 1500 BC, was just over 60&amp;nbsp;cm long. This sword was, however, classified as of the  Hajdúsámson-Apa type, and was presumably imported. The [[Vreta Kloster]] sword discovered in 1897 (dated 1600 to 1500 BC) has a blade length (the hilt is missing) of 46&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of National Antiquities (Statens Historiska Museum)   inventory number SHM 10419.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical variant for European swords is the '''leaf shaped''' blade, which was most common in North-West Europe at the end of the Bronze Age, on the [[Bronze Age Britain|British Isles]] in particular.
The '''carp's tongue sword''' is a type of bronze sword that was common to Western Europe during ca. the 9th to 8th centuries BC. The blade of the carp's tongue sword was wide and parallel for most of its length but the final third narrowed into a thin tip intended for thrusting. The design was probably developed in north-western France, and combined the broad blade useful for slashing with a thinner, elongated tip suitable for thrusting. Its advantages saw its adoption across [[Atlantic Europe]]. In Britain, the metalwork in the south east derived its name from this sword: the [[Carp's Tongue complex]]. Notable examples of this type were part of the [[Isleham Hoard]].

The Bronze Age style sword and construction methods died out at the end of the early Iron Age (Hallstatt D)), around 600-500 BC, when swords are once again replaced by daggers in most of Europe. An exception is the [[Xiphos]] from Greece, the development of which continued for several more centuries.
The '''antenna sword''', named for the pair of ornaments suggesting antennae on its hilt,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antennae%20sword&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of the Late Bronze Age, continued in early [[iron swords]] of the [[East Hallstatt]] and Italy region.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis William, The archaeology of Celtic art, 2007,  p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
{{Further|Bronze Age China}}

Sword production in China is attested from the Bronze Age [[Shang Dynasty]], from roughly 1200 BC. The technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the [[Warring States period]] and [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC – 207 BC). Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high-tin edges over softer, lower-tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade (see the [[sword of Gou Jian]]). Also unique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high-tin bronze (17-21% tin), which is very hard and breaks under excess stress, whereas other cultures preferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends instead. China continued to make both iron and bronze swords longer than any other region; iron completely replaced bronze only in the early [[Han Dynasty]].

==India==
{{Further|Ochre Coloured Pottery culture}}
Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings of the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]] throughout the [[Ganges]]-[[Yamuna]] [[Doab]] region of India, commonly made of copper, but in some instances made of bronze.  Diverse specimens have been discovered in [[Fatehgarh]], where there are several varieties of hilt. These swords have been variously dated to periods between 1700-1400 BC, but were probably used more extensively during  1200-600 BC ([[Painted Grey Ware culture]], [[Iron Age India]]).&lt;ref&gt;F.R.

'''Chaa Creek''' is a [[tributary]] of the [[Macal River]] in the [[Cayo District]] in western [[Belize]].  One of the official [[gauging station]]s of the Macal is located near the confluence with Chaa Creek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydromet.gov.bz/Hydrological_Stations.htm Belize hydrological stations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821170203/http://www.hydromet.gov.bz/Hydrological_Stations.htm |date=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins that remain largely unexcavated in the Chaa Creek catchment basin; certain early research was conducted on the [[archaeology]] at Chaa Creek in 1997 by [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;[http://lms01.harvard.edu/F/5E4R31SUNE671K81AXGT9CJUCAH1JE9YDHB5IDTM4HSLVRGR5C-24905?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=759077&amp;set_ent Harvard University: Archaeological research at Xunantunich and nearby areas]&lt;/ref&gt; Significant [[Maya ceramics|pottery]] finds and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] have been recovered at the Chaa Creek site, which is posited to be a satellite site of [[Xunantunich]].&lt;ref name="harvard" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18170 C.Michael Hogan, ''Chaa Creek'', Megalithic Portal, ed.

'''Clemencia Rodriguez''' is a [[Colombia]]n US-based media and communication scholar recognized for her role in establishing and promoting the field of [[alternative media]] studies in English language [[media studies]], notably through her work on '[[citizens' media]],' a term she coined in her 2001 book ''Fissures in the Mediascape'' and through co-founding and facilitating OURMedia/NUESTROSMedios, a global network of researchers and practitioners of [[alternative media]], [[community media]] and citizens' media, currently the biggest network of its kind with over 500 members in over 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040501080150/http://www.ourmedianet.org/general/about_us.html About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rodriguez has conducted research since 1984 on citizens’ media in different international contexts including [[Nicaragua]], Colombia, [[Spain]], [[Chile]], and among Latino communities in the [[United States.]] Her current research explores the role(s) of community radio and audiovisual initiatives in regions of armed conflict in Colombia. Her studies focus on the AREDMAG network of community radio stations in Magdalena Medio; the audiovisual school and community radio station (Radio Andaqui) in Belen de los Andaquies, Caqueta; and the Colectivo de Comunicacion de Montes de Maria.

In 2001, she initiated OURMedia/NUESTROSMedios with [[Chris Atton]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.napier.ac.uk/sci/staff/pages/chrisatton.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Couldry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/media-communications/staff/couldry.php Goldsmiths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131182325/http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/media-communications/staff/couldry.php |date=2008-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John DH Downing]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtv.siu.edu/profile.php?pageID=301&amp;ID=18 RTV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807210319/http://rtv.siu.edu/profile.php?pageID=301&amp;ID=18 |date=2007-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 2003 was a key organizer of its yearly conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmc.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/2/3/267 ''Global Media and Communication''] 2006 2: 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizens' media==
“Various media technologies provide different ways of 'communicating' both in the kinds of information they present and in the ways we experience it”.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, D and Hoynes, W: ''Media Society: Industries, Images and Audiences'' (third edition), page 301, Pine Forge Press, Thousand Oaks, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; '''Clemencia Rodriguez''' recognises a universal cultural change within the mediascape whereby media users have become media producers. She defines '''citizens' media''' as a concept 'that implies a collective embracing of new media and interaction, in a way that contests social codes, legitimised identities and institutionalised social relations, through a means of empowering the community'.&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, G: “Networks of Influence: Internet Activism in Australia and Beyond” in Gerard Goggin (ed.) Virtual nation: the Internet in Australia, University of New South Wales Press, Sydney, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Moving away from the original concept of media whereby “communication is sent from one place and received in many places by a large audience”,&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, D and Hoynes, W, Media Society: Industries, Images and Audiences, page 313, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens’ media’ encourages a two-way media process, reflecting participatory democracy and greater media access through networking, and broadcasting from citizen to citizen.

'''Dinesh Joseph Wadiwel''' is an Australian [[social theory|social]] and [[political theory|political theorist]] who is presently a Senior Lecturer in Human Rights and Socio-Legal Studies at the [[University of Sydney]]. His work addresses [[critical animal studies]], the [[disability rights|rights of disabled people]], and theoretical perspectives on [[violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Wadiwel, Dr Dinesh|url=http://animalstudies.org.au/member-profiles/4193/dr-dinesh-wadiwel|publisher=Australasian Animal Studies Association|accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Dinesh Wadiwel|url=http://sydney.edu.au/arts/staff/profiles/dinesh.wadiwel.php|publisher=University of Sydney|accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Wadiwel worked for 15 years in the [[voluntary sector|third sector]], including with the [[Council of Social Service of New South Wales]]. He completed his [[doctorate]] in [[Political Philosophy]] and [[Cultural Studies]] at the [[University of Western Sydney]] in 2006.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dinesh Wadiwel|publisher=[[The Conversation]]|url=https://theconversation.com/profiles/dinesh-wadiwel-134890|accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently moved to the [[University of Sydney]], where he is now a [[senior lecturer]].&lt;ref name="Sydney"/&gt;

Wadiwel is the author of the 2015 monograph ''The War Against Animals'', published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]]. In the book, he argues that humans are in a state of (literal) war with animals.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Armstrong, Philip|date=2017|title=[Review] Dinesh Wadiwel. The War Against Animals|journal=Animal Studies Journal|volume=6|issue=2|pages=237–47|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/asj/vol6/iss2/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calarco"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Calarco, Matthew|year=2016|title=Animal Studies|journal=The Year's Work in Critical and Cultural Theory|volume=24|issue=1|pages=24–42|doi=10.1093/ywcct/mbw002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref name="War Against"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wadiwel, Dinesh|year=2015|title=The War Against Animals|location=Leiden, Netherlands|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary [[philosophical]] influence is the work of [[Michel Foucault]], though other important influences include [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Roberto Esposito]], and [[Achille Mbembe]]. For Wadiwel, mainstream approaches to [[animal ethics]] (including the classic works of [[Peter Singer]] and [[Tom Regan]], and more recent works of [[Donna Haraway]] as well as those of [[Sue Donaldson]] and [[Will Kymlicka]]) are insufficient for failing to appreciate the near-complete internalisation of a human belief in [[sovereignty]] over animals; indeed, he argues that the works reinforce them. Drawing upon Foucauldian notions of [[biopower]], [[governmentality]], and counter-conduct, Wadiwel argues for the existence of, and examines the detail of, the war against animals. He argues that [[capitalism]] is complicit in the war, and that the [[commodification]] of animals is an inherently violent act. Wadiwel calls for resistance against the war. This resistance includes [[veganism]] and other pro-animal practices, but also a [[truce]], even if only (initially) for a day.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calarco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="War Against"/&gt;

Wadiwel was a part of The Human Animal Research Network Editorial Collective that edited the 2015 [[Sydney University Press]] [[edited collection|collection]] ''Animals in the Anthropocene: Critical Perspectives on Non-human Futures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Human Animal Research Network Editorial Collective (eds.)|year=2015|title=Animals in the Anthropocene|location=Sydney, Australia|publisher=Sydney University Press|isbn=9781743324394}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-edited the 2016 collection ''Foucault and Animals'' with Matthew Chrulew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chrulew, Matthew, and Dinesh Wadiwel (eds.)|year=2016|title=Foucault and Animals|series=Human-Animal Studies|volume=18|location=Leiden, Netherlands|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fine press''' [[printing]] and [[publishing]] comprises historical and contemporary printers and publishers publishing [[book]]s and other printed matter of exceptional intrinsic quality and artistic taste, including both commercial and [[private press]]es.  Their dedication to fine printing distinguishes them from other [[small press]]es.  Fine press publications are often published in [[limited edition]]s, that are swiftly bought up by [[Book collecting|book collectors]] and libraries.

==History of fine press==

As part of the [[Art Nouveau]] movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Englishman [[William Morris]] wanted to hearken back to a golden age of printing, printmaking, and publishing.  One of the books they published was the [[Kelmscott Chaucer]].  Soon, fine presses began to spring up in the United States as well.  The most prominent was the [[Roycroft Press]].  Los Angeles was a center of the fine press movement, particularly centered on the Ward Ritchie press

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2755">The '''fireman's rule''' ('''firefighter's rule''') also known as the '''professional rescuers rule''' is a [[common law]] or [[statute|statutory]] restriction on [[tort]] actions by public safety officials. In general, the fireman's rule bars lawsuits by [[police officers]], [[firefighters]], and in some jurisdictions all professional rescuers from collecting on damages that occur in the course of their duties even in cases of clear [[negligence]] by other parties.

==Rationale==
At the most basic, the fireman's rule is based on the notion that public safety officers willingly assume the risks inherent in their duties. Since the very purpose of public safety officers is to confront danger, the public is not liable for injuries incurred while carrying out that function. While the rule is named after the risks and actions by firemen, the relationship between danger and duties is similar in all public safety officers, and other professional rescuers.

==Criticism==
The fireman's rule has been heavily criticized for preventing [[police officer]]s from suing criminals who intentionally lead them on high-speed [[car chase]]s.  In response to one such case, the [[California State Legislature]] enacted [[California Civil Code]] Section 1714.9 in 1982, which overrides the fireman's rule where the tortious conduct occurred after the defendant knew or should have known of the plaintiff's presence.  In Minnesota peace officers are exempted from the fireman's rule by statute.§ M.S. 604.06

In certain states, such as Pennsylvania, the courts have not always applied the fireman's rule. In 1995, The Pennsylvania Superior Court ruled that in regards to landowners, firefighters are viewed as "licensees," and are therefore owed the same duty of care that any citizen who is permitted to be on the property would receive. In earlier decisions, such as [http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=1988601373PaSuper228_1579.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006 MULL v. KERSTETTER 373 Pa.Super. 228 (1988)], in which a volunteer firefighter was injured after falling into an unmarked and unprotected window well,  the court ruled that a police officer entering land in his or her official capacity and in response to a call for assistance is generally considered a licensee. Therefore, the landowner is responsible for warning the licensee of any dangerous hidden conditions on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennerly|first=Maxwell|title=Fireman's Rule|url=http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2012/05/articles/litigation/firefighters-rule-warehouse-fire/|work=Litigation and Trial Law Blog|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14682">A '''fixed book price agreement''' (FBPA) is a form of [[resale price maintenance]] applied to books. It commonly takes the form of an agreement between [[publisher]]s and [[bookseller]]s which set the prices at which [[book]]s were to be sold to the public. An example of an FBPA was the former [[Net Book Agreement]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

The key idea of an FBPA is to promote [[non-price competition]] between booksellers in order to promote the sale of little-known, difficult or otherwise culturally interesting books rather than catering only to [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] readers. To do so, an FBPA is deemed to ensure that the booksellers that provide the corresponding [[presale services]] are able to recoup their higher costs with a guaranteed margin on blockbusters.

A related case is the existence of a fixed book price law (FBPL), where the book prices are kept fixed by law. An example of an FBPL is the current [[Lang Law]] in [[France]]. 

An FBPA/FBPL, with various provisos, has existed in some developed countries since the beginning of the twentieth century. It remains in force in roughly half the countries of the [[European Union]] as well as in some other countries.

== Principle ==

The core idea of the FBP (either by agreement or law) is that a dense network of well-stocked, high quality bookshops is a necessary condition for the publication of a large variety of books, large variety itself deemed desirable for the cultural life of a country {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|p=742}}. Such bookshops have additional costs that are not borne by discounters, who just stock their shelves with the current blockbusters. Since the latter represent a large proportion of book sales, price competition between high-quality bookshops and discounters reduces bookshops' profitability. 

The FBP allows the publisher to mitigate this competition and thereby guarantees a sufficient margin for high-quality bookshops to operate.

== Scope ==

Historically, most countries with a significant book industry have known an FBPA since the 19th century. The development of [[competition policy]] in the 1970s led to a wave of repeals of those agreements (Australia 1972, Sweden 1974, UK 1995) at a time when any form of [[resale price maintenance]] was seen with much suspicion. Conversely, other countries (Spain 1975, Greece 1997, Italy 2005) enacted laws making the FBP mandatory.

The following table gives an overview of the prevalence of FBP in rich countries (sources: European Booksellers Federation&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090713220757/http://www.ebf-eu.org/papers/Book%20Trade%20in%20Europe%20updated010206.doc&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|p=749}}).

== Assessment ==

The assessment of the FBP is a controversial one. On the one hand, most economists ({{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|}} for an overview, {{Harv|Ringstad|2004}} for a specific discussion) are skeptical of the cultural merits of the FBP and underline its distorting effect. On the other hand, other economists ({{Harv|Rouet|2007}} on the French case, {{Harv|Backhaus|Hansen|2003}} on the German case) and the book industry{{who?|date=December 2012}} argue that the FBP is the only tool that allows difficult, high-brow, and culturally significant books{{clarification needed|date=December 2012}} to be published. Therefore, they say, the distortion should account for the much larger cultural [[externality|externalities]] of meaningful cultural works. As {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|p=743}} put it,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural merits ascribed to such agreements have almost reached mythical proportions. No public debate in Europe on the cultural value of books is complete without a discussion of the FBP.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Theoretical framework ===

Several [[industrial organization]] frameworks can be applied to assess the consequences of the FBP. 

The most commonly cited result is {{Harv|Telser|1960}}. This paper states that when two retailer can engage on [[tangible presale services]], that is can undertake an unobservable costly effort that increases the demand for both of them (advertisement, sessions with authors, thematic weeks), each one has an incentive to [[Free rider problem|free-ride]] on the other retailer's effort by setting its price slightly below his competitor (which cannot correspondingly cut his price, since he supports the cost of a higher level of effort). This leads to a suboptimal (too low, from the publisher's point of view) level of aggregate effort. By cancelling the possibility of price competition, a FBP makes impossible this kind of opportunistic behaviour and induces both retailers to compete in services.

According to {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|}}, the main idea of FBP (keeping best seller prices high in order to subsidize the sale of less popular books) is unconvincing for several reasons: 

* the market subsidizes new books per se, in order to get a best seller
* there is no guarantee that the subsidy will occur anyway. In fact, the authors suggest that both publishers and booksellers have an incentive not to carry it out
* if less popular books are less price elastic than popular books, monopoly profits in them are higher
* even if the subsidy works, there is no accounting for what or how it's done
* even if the subsidy works, it's not clear that it's worth the price distortion

=== Empirical assessment ===

{{Harv|Ringstad|2004}} and {{Harv|Fishwick|2005}} provide empirical assessments of FBP comparing countries with and without a FBP (Nordic countries for the former, France and the UK for the latter). According to these authors, the two main effects of a repeal of a FBP is a displacement of small [[independent bookstore]]s by larger chain outlets and a decrease in the price of bestsellers, compensated by an increase of the price of all other books.

{{Harv|Ringstad|2004}} notices that the level of book prices and the number of published titles evolves in a similar manner in all Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland) although only Norway has a FBP and Finland belongs to a different linguistic group. In Denmark (FBP since 2000), however, book prices have increased one-third quicker than general inflation since 1985 and the number of books sold has fallen by two-thirds, a sharp contrast with Sweden and Norway, which belong to the same linguistic group. His conclusion, supported by elements from {{Harv|Fjeldstad|2001}}, is that the effects of a FBP are less than both proponents and critics make them, and that other institutional agreements (e.g. only pure bookshops can carry textbooks in Norway) better explain the evolution of the book markets in those countries. 

According to {{Harv|Fishwick|2005}}, the ending of the FBPA in the UK (1995) did not lead to a sharp decrease of the number of bookshops, rather to a displacement of small, independent bookshops by big-chain outlets. He notices however that the former stayed in place where a quality-sensitive demand existed, and that competition between bookshops spurred a reduction of operational costs thanks to better logistics and collection management (an argument also found in {{Harv|Ringstad|2004}}). In a counterfactual manner, {{Harv|Rouet|2007}} shows that in France, the FBP helped to maintain a dense network of independent bookshops, reined in the deployment of chain bookstores and spurred supermarkets to boost their offer of books. Fishwick also shows that while the number of published titles increases as fast as in France, there is no sign of an overall increase of book prices. He shows however that this stability hides a strong distributive effect. Comparison with France show that the FBP leads to an increase of the price of bestsellers relative to non-FBP markets and a decrease of low-selling or long-selling books. He argues that the assessment of this effect is difficult, since the relation between the (un)popularity of a book and its cultural value is unclear, whereas consumers of low-selling books are, on average, wealthier than consumers of bestsellers (making a FBP a subsidy of wealthier people by poorer people).

The '''Free Scotland Party''' was a minor [[political party]] in [[Scotland]] that stood for an independent Scotland, independent of both the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[European Union]].

The party was founded by Brian Nugent, from [[Shetland]], after he left the [[Scottish National Party]] due to disagreements over Europe.&lt;ref name=ready&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/archives/2004/December/free_scotland_ready_to_fight.htm|title=Free Scotland ready to fight|last=Marter|first=Hans J|date=29 December 2004|work=The Shetland News|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party holds up [[Norway]], a non-EU country, as an example for Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/archives/2005/05_2005/freescot_look_to_norway!.htm|title=Free Scotland says look to Norway|date=2 May 2005|work=The Shetland News|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28043">The '''French–Eversole feud''' occurred primarily from 1887–1894. The events occurred in the mountains of southeastern [[Kentucky]] and were mainly situated in [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]], [[Perry County, Kentucky|Perry County]].  The two instigators of this [[feud]] were [[Joseph C. Eversole]] and Benjamin Fulton French, who were both merchants and lawyers and at one time were friendly. The war or Feud was a media sensation and was covered by many US papers at the time. The First report was in the Louisville Courier-Journal on June 30, 1886 on Page 1.&lt;ref&gt;June 30, 1886 Louisville Courier-Journal, Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; A listing of the various media reports is included at the end of this article. Ultimately, those media reports became the basis for various books written about the French-Eversole War.

Based on a report by General Sam Hill to Governor [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]], the feud killed more than 20 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTOmqTyHEFwC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;dq=French%E2%80%93Eversole+feud+20+men+killed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzc2euOPUAhWSK1AKHaW1DLcQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=French%E2%80%93Eversole+feud+20+men+killed&amp;f=false|title=Days of Darkness: The Feuds of Eastern Kentucky|first=John Ed|last=Pearce|date=1 December 2009|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians exaggerated the numbers killed to about 74 deaths attributed to the feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZkoGoiyBscC&amp;pg=PA468&amp;dq=how+many+were+killed+during+the+French%E2%80%93Eversole+feud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX8IeKt-PUAhVEaFAKHS1pAHIQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=how+many+were+killed+during+the+French%E2%80%93Eversole+feud&amp;f=false|title=Kentucky's Last Frontier|first=Henry P.|last=Scalf|date=11 August 2017|publisher=The Overmountain Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoCJUB42lokC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=how+many+were+killed+during+the+French%E2%80%93Eversole+feud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX8IeKt-PUAhVEaFAKHS1pAHIQ6AEIXDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=how+many+were+killed+during+the+French%E2%80%93Eversole+feud&amp;f=false|title=Weird Kentucky: Your Travel Guide to Kentucky's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets|first1=Jeffrey Scott|last1=Holland|first2=Mark|last2=Sceurman|first3=Mark|last3=Moran|date=11 August 2017|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the feud==
Jacob Eversole (1760-1840) was one of the first settlers of the area moving from Lancaster County, PA.&lt;ref&gt;Eversole Family in America 1727-1937&lt;/ref&gt; Originally spelled, 'Ebersohl', six brothers migrated from Europe to Pennsylvania: Abraham, Johannes, Peter, Yost, Carl and Jacob.&lt;ref&gt;Eversole families in America 1717-1937, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; One of Yost Ebersohl's son's Jacob, moved from Pennsylvania to Eastern Kentucky. When [[Perry County, Kentucky|Perry County]] was created on November 2, 1820&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia page: Perry County, Kentucky founded Nov 2, 1820&lt;/ref&gt; by 'General' Elijah H. Combs he named the small group of streets [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]] as its seat. Both the County and the Town are named after [[Oliver Hazard Perry|General Oliver Hazard Perry]], a hero of the War of 1812. The small town had only one road, scattered buildings, and only a few boards to walk on over the muddy streets. It became the trading center of the county with a population of around 100 during the feud.

Jacob Eversole's (1760-1840) son 'Woolery' G. Eversole married the daughter of Jesse Cornett (1761-1836) another founding family of [[Perry County, Kentucky]]. Woolery and Lucy (Cornett) Eversole had several children, one of which was Maj. John C. Eversole, USA who lead portions of the 14th Kentucky Cavalry and was assassinated during the Civil War. His son, [[Joseph C. Eversole]] was the leader of the Eversole Clan in the French Eversole Feud.

Eversole and French were very similar men.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 187 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; They were both lawyers, merchants, and very well off.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 188 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph Eversole married a woman from another prominent Perry County family, Susan Combs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/18659040|title=Susan Combs Eversole (1855 - 1946) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan was the daughter of Judge [[Josiah Henry Combs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89665971|title=Judge Josiah Henry Combs (1831 - 1894) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the members of the Eversole clan. Susan's Great-grandfather was Elijah H. Combs who founded Hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89665284|title=Elijah "General Lige" Combs (1770 - 1855) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; French, however, was not a Kentuckian. He hailed from Tennessee but married a Kentuckian, Susan Lewis and thereby was related to influential families in Breathitt, Leslie and other Counties.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Both [[Joseph C. Eversole]] and Benjamin Fulton French had competing mercantile stores in Hazard.

==Cause of the feud==
There are two supposed causes of the feud. One is romanticized and probably not true though it is the popular and much more interesting cause. The other is a definite and more reasonable cause for the start of the feud.

'''CAUSE 1 ('On Account of a Woman'):''' The popular story for the cause of the feud is a disagreement over a woman. As the story goes a clerk that worked in French's mercantile store was madly in love. One day the clerk saw the woman with Fulton French and he became jealous. He went to the [[Joseph C. Eversole]] and told him that he had heard French say he sought to take Joe's life. When Joe questioned the clerk about the allegations he sat silent. Eversole warned him that he was taking his silence as fact that the allegations were true. Initially, Joe Eversole did not believe the clerk. He asked him to sign a sworn affidavit attesting to the plan to murder him.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 192 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  This is what caused Eversole to believe that he needed protection and he reason for begin to gather an armed clan around him. French followed suit closely after and a war was unavoidable.  It is believed that this was the clerk's revenge on Fulton French.

'''Cause 2 ('Coal rights'):''' The more likely story (or a combination of the two) is that the two were businessmen and they came at odds with each other. After the civil war, companies began buying huge amounts of land for the coal underneath the mountains. French worked for one of these companies that was buying coal rights from illiterate farmers while Eversole was a local merchant and had loyalty to long-time citizens (most of whom he was related to). French was worried about getting the land at bottom dollar for the large companies he represented. Eversole saw this practice as cheating illiterate farmers. He began to travel the County and tell farmers that Fulton French was going to try and cheat them with low prices for 'coal rights'. French (as a non-native) has no such considerations regarding the mountain people of Eastern Kentucky. The resentment grew until they eventually raised their armies, which French reportedly paid $2 – $2.50 a day for his hired guns.

==The assassinations==
Ambush was the favored tactic of this feud rather than standard warfare. It was safer for the concealed perpetrators and responsibility for the attacks was more difficult to determine.  Many people lived, justifiably, in fear.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 194 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Death of Silas Gayheart:''' The first death of the feud was one of French's friends, Silas Gayheart. A dozen white men and a couple of African-Americans reportedly ambushed and killed Gayheart. The Eversoles denied the killing and many believed it was the cause of a different dispute that Gayheart had. French, however, blamed the Eversole clan.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 195 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

One night French left Hazard, possibly to gather more men to attack Eversole. Once Eversole discovered this, he withdrew his forces and left a few men in town. He waited for French to attack the town so he could make a surprise attack of his own. Neither was fooled by these tactical maneuvers and blood was spared. When French finally reentered the town in June 1887 Eversole set out to meet him. The two sides had a shootout in town; only one of French's men was wounded. After a day of shooting at each other, French's forces withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 196 &amp; 197 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of cat and mouse scuffle happened throughout the summer of 1887. The cost of paying these men day in and day out began taking their tolls on the businessmen as they almost were bankrupt (or at least were out of cash). Both sides owned most of the large land tracts in Perry County. Both sides agreed to a meeting at Big Creek and a peace was formulated. The written agreements were signed and witnessed.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 199 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement stated that they could return home, would disband their armies, and surrender their guns. The grudge was still there and, soon after their funds were replenished, French accused Eversole of taking his guns back from [[Josiah Henry Combs|Judge Josiah Combs]], Eversole's father-in-law. Eversole claimed that French hadn't witnessed that, that he hadn't disbanded his army, and that the deal only called for a partial surrender of arms. The short lived peace crumbled.

'''The murder of William 'Bill' Gambriel (AKA William 'Bill' G. Gambrel):''' The next major incident occurred on September 15, 1887. Joe Eversole and Bill Gambriel, a French supporter and itinerate preacher, began arguing in the street in Hazard.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 201 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; This formed into a scuffle or fist fight. Some of Eversole's men shot at Gambriel and wounded him. While attempting to escape, another man, reportedly an officer, shot him. As Gambriel turned away from his attacker, Joe Eversole pulled his pistol out and shot Gambriel in the head, instantly killing him.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 202 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; One man was tried for the murder. The trial resulted in a hung jury the first time and an acquittal in the second trial. Joe Eversole was not tried because witnesses said that Silas had attacked Joe first.

'''The Assassination of [[Joseph C. Eversole]]:''' There was a relative calm throughout the winter until Sunday, April 15, 1888. Joe Eversole, Nick Combs, his brother-in-law, and Judge Josiah Combs were on their way to Hyden for the regular term of the circuit court, of which Joe and Josiah had been members for years. [[Josiah Henry Combs|Judge Combs]] was riding slightly ahead of Joe and Nick with policeman Tom Hollifield, who was transporting a prisoner (Mary Jones) to Hyden, when Josiah heard the gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 203 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; Josiah turned and saw Joe and Nick fall to the ground. Joe almost instantly died. To read more graphic details of the assassination of [[Joseph C. Eversole]], see his Wikipedia page.  After investigating, it appeared the attackers had been camping for days waiting on them. French was accused and indicted but left town with a posse in fear of retaliation. No one was ever convicted of the murders, but seven years later, 'Bad Tom' Smith, a paid French enforcer, would confess while standing on the gallows. He stated that he and Joseph Adkins committed the murders under orders from French.

'''John Campbell takes Over:''' After Joe Eversole's death, John Campbell took over the war against French. Campbell surrounded the town with guards, had men patrol the streets, and took on scouting the countryside. He feared a French attack so he only let people into town who knew the password. This was his undoing however. One night Campbell found a sleeping guard and startled him. The guard shot Campbell, who died a month later from his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 209 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

While Campbell was still alive, Shade Combs had an idea that he could end the feud by killing French and a select few of his men. Campbell gave him men and he set out to do the deed. French got wind of the plot and set up an ambush of his own. Combs escaped only to succumb to a successful ambush soon after at his home.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 210 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Death of Elijah Morgan:''' Elijah Morgan, son-in-law to Judge Josiah Combs, was a French supporter and was the next to be assassinated on October 9, 1888. He was working on an agreement with Frank Grace when he was ambushed. He wanted peace and the Eversole clan told him to meet them in Hazard to discuss a deal. This was all a ploy to lure him in and he was murdered. It is widely believed this was is retaliation for the death of Shade Combs since they occurred so close together.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 211 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kentucky Government asked to intervene:''' Judge Lilly, responsible for the law in Perry along with other counties, had had enough. He dispatched state troops to Hazard, which arrived in early November 1888. He wrote the governor on November 13, 1888, telling him of the need for troops and that he would not conduct court in Perry, along with other counties, without a state guard for fear of shootings. On November 14, 1888 Sam Hill, who was in charge of the state troops, wrote to Governor Buckner that only 35 people remained in town when they arrived. Many came back after the troops arrived and that the juries' ties to the clans or fear of the accused had caused lawlessness. The November 1888 term of court went by with ease since the troops were occupying the town.

==Battle of Hazard==
The Battle of Hazard occurred on the fourth court day, November 8, 1889. A supposedly inebriated Campbell was on Graveyard Hill and discharged his gun. A storekeeper saw him shooting, took aim, and killed Campbell with one shot. The people in the courthouse heard the shot, thought it was the feud, and scattered. The Eversole clan took control of the courthouse and French's men captured the jailhouse. Jesse Fields and Bob Profitt, both French men, escaped from the courthouse's second story and made it to the jail. That night they escaped the jailhouse to regroup with the rest of the French party. Jesse Fields and 'Bad' Tom Smith then took the high ground on Graveyard Hill. J. McKnight, an Eversole man, attempted to run across the street with a friend to gain some ground and was shot dead by French's men. The Eversoles retreated across the river after their ammo was exhausted. They left Green Morris and one other along the river bank so they could escape safely. When Jesse Fields and Tom Smith pursued, Morris opened fire and hit Fields in the arm. The Battle of Hazard was over.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 214 to 239 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

==The end==
Following the incidents in Hazard, the courthouse was burned down on July 4, 1890 though the records were saved.

'''The death of Robin Cornett:''' Robin Cornett, an Eversole supporter, finally returned to his home hoping to be done with the feud. He was [[ambush]]ed and killed in July 1890 when he went to cut a tree in the forest near his home.

This was the final straw for Judge Lilly. He appeared with state troops for a special August court term in 1890 that would be held in a tent. They quickly brought up each of the accused and sent them to Clark County to be tried. Lilly knew that there is no way any would have a fair trial in Hazard and for fear of another battle. None were allowed bail at first. The jail became so full they had to keep the men in a guarded tent. The "Blanket Court" worked well and there was little to no incidents until 1894.

'''The Assassination of Judge Josiah Combs:''' In 1894, [[Josiah Henry Combs|Judge Josiah Combs]] decided to return to the home he loved, hoping the fighting was all over. He was ambushed and killed while having a conversation with friends outside of his house. A large field of corn was growing in Hazard. The killers: Joe Adkins, Jesse Fields, and Boone Frazier hid in the corn and fired at Judge Combs. None of this would have come to life except that 'Bad' Tom Smith had been caught on a different murder and sentenced to death row previously for the murder of Dr. John E. Rader.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky's Famous Feuds and Tragedies, Page 250 by Chas G. Munzenberg, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a gallows confession outlining how Fulton French had organized the plot and that Joe Adkins had fired the fatal shot that killed Judge Combs. French was acquitted of the charges, Frazier was never caught, Fields was sentenced to life then acquitted in a second trial, and Adkins received life in both trials, though he only served 8 years before being released.

'''The Murder of B. Fulton French:''' After the events in Hazard, Fulton French began wearing a [[bulletproof vest]]. Years later, in 1913, French came across Susan Eversole, Joe's Widow, and her son Harry Clay Eversole (then 28), sometimes referred to as 'One Arm' Harry since he lost an arm in childhood. Fulton said "Good Morning, Mrs. Eversole". Harry took out his pistol and shot him in the spleen. Harry was only charged a $75 [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] [[fine (penalty)|fine]]. French did die from the shot from 'One Arm' Harry, though it took him over a year to finally succumb from the wound in 1915.

==Media coverage==
During the period from 1886 when notice arrived of Benjamin Fulton French amassing a private army to assassinate Joseph C. Eversole the public and media followed the twists and turns of the French-Eversole Feud and the various trials, battles, indictments, convictions, re-trials, and death of the participants.

The so-called '''Gesta Francorum''' ("The Deeds of the Franks") or in full ''Gesta Francorum et aliorum Hierosolimitanorum'' ("The deeds of the Franks and the other pilgrims to Jerusalem") is a [[Latin]] [[chronicle]] of the [[First Crusade]] written in [[circa]] 1100-1101 by an anonymous author connected with [[Bohemond I of Antioch]].

It narrates the events of the First Crusade from the inception in November 1095 to the [[Battle of Ascalon]] in August 1099. The name of the author is unknown, but he was a member of the crusading party, either [[Normans|Norman]] or [[Italy|Italian]], recruited by [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] in 1096 from the [[duchy]] of [[Apulia]]. His narrative of the trip to Jerusalem, initially under the leadership of Bohemond and then [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Toulouse]], was composed and written during the journey. He had the help of a scribe who made occasional edits of his own, and thus the chronicle provides invaluable viewpoints of a knight who was not a high level leader or cleric.

The most important historical contribution is the day-to-day events of the journey: tactical operations, provisioning, changing moods of the crusaders, the anti-Greek prejudice, and progress of each day.

To his literary contemporaries, the anonymous author was a "rustic". [[Guibert of Nogent]] wrote his ''[[Dei gesta per Francos]]'' (1108) based on it, saying the original "frequently left the reader stunned with its insipid vacuity". [[Robert the Monk]] of [[Rheims]] was later commissioned to re-write the entire work for literary and historical improvements while [[Baudri of Dol]] also later re-wrote a version of "this rustic little work". However the original has persisted and today it remains one of the most valuable contemporary sources of the First Crusade.

[[Steven Runciman]] &lt;ref&gt;''The First Crusade;'' Volume 1 of ''A History of the Crusades'', Appendix I (Cambridge University Press, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; writes of the ''Gesta'':
: .... the author was a simple soldier, honest according to his lights but credulous and prejudiced and a strong admirer of Bohemond .... who hawked it round Northern France during his visit there in 1106. .... it was republished by Tudebod .... and about 1130 in the ''[[Historia Belli Sacri]]'', a clumsy compilation using other sources eg Radulph of Caen. .... The ''Gesta'' was several times rewritten; in about 1109 by Guibert of Nogent, who added personal information and borrowed from Fulcher and who aimed at a more critical and moral tone; in about 1110 by Baudri of Bourgueil, Archbishop of Dol, who sought to improve its literary style; and by [[Robert of Rheims]], whose popular and somewhat romantic version, the ''Historia Hierosolymitana'', appeared in about 1122. It also inspired a short anonymous ''Expedition contra Turcos'', and the chapters on the Crusades in the chronicles of Hugh of Fleury and Henry of Huntington.

==Relationship with Peter Tudebode's Account of the First Crusade==
The ''Gesta Francorum'' closely parallels the account of the First Crusade by the priest and crusader [[Peter Tudebode]], ''Historia de Hierosolymitano itinere''. Both chronicles have highly similar details and phrasing, but each account also contains minor details not found in the other. Historians and paleographers dispute the relationship between the chronicles and the order in which they appeared; one influential suggestion has been Jay Rubenstein's argument that the texts share a fuller, common source which has since been lost.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Jay |date=2005 |title=What is the Gesta Francorum, and who was Peter Tudebode? |journal=Revue Mabillon |volume=16 |pages=179-204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Immigrant languages''' are [[language]]s spoken by [[Human migration|immigrant communities]]. Immigrant languages have arrived to the country or region relatively recently, unlike historical [[minority language]]s, which have been spoken in the country for several generations. Historical minority languages also tend to have a certain [[Official language|official status]]. Immigrant languages should not be confused with [[foreign language|foreign]] or [[second language]]s which are different concepts.

'''International Gender Champions''' ('''IGC''') is a network of female and male leaders of member states, international organizations, and civil society working for gender equality. It is an initiative of Women@TheTable, and was founded in 2015 by Caitlin Kraft-Buchman of Women@TheTable, Ambassador [[Pamela Hamamoto|Pam Hamamoto]], Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations in Geneva, and [[Michael Møller]], the Under-Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] and current Director-General of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]].

==Purpose==
Champions pledge to no longer sit on single sex panels, and commit to implementing two individual institutional commitments for gender equality in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Solange Behoteguy and Garry Aslanyan, “How a ‘table’ could change the world,” UN Special, https://www.unspecial.org/2016/03/how-a-table-could-change-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt; According to co-founder Caitlin Kraft-Buchman, International Gender Champions’ strategy is to help make a wide range of organizations make “huge changes through tiny steps” by committing to realistic, achievable transformations for gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Meg Riggs, “International Gender Champions,” Geneva Geeks, Podcast audio, March 31, 2017. https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1224098484&lt;/ref&gt;

At the IGC launch in 2015, Møller stated, “With the unique concentration of Member States, international organizations, civil society, research and academic institutions and private sector entities, International Geneva provides an ideal platform to show that leadership in a most practical way.  Together, our actions have a truly global impact, making a difference for peace, rights and well-being for all people across the planet.  We have a special responsibility to capitalize on this potential for greater gender equality.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael Møller, “International Geneva Gender Champions Launch: Director-General Møller’s Remarks,” July 1, 2015, https://geneva.usmission.gov/2015/07/01/international-geneva-gender-champions-launch-director-general-mollers-remarks/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network==
There are currently over 200 International Gender Champions in [[Geneva]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Vienna]], and [[Nairobi]]. Champions include UN Secretary General [[António Guterres]], the heads of UN Offices at Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi, the [[ILO]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[UNHCR]], [[OHCHR]], [[Inter-Parliamentary Union|IPU]], and other member states and civil society groups.&lt;ref&gt;About,” International Gender Champions, https://genderchampions.com/about&lt;/ref&gt; After joining IGC, Secretary General Guterres stated, “I encourage other senior leaders to be part of this campaign for equality. In a male dominated world, the empowerment of women must be a key priority. Women’s rights are human rights – and attacks on women are attacks on all of us. Our world needs more women leaders. And our world needs more men standing up for gender equality."&lt;ref&gt;Rita Emch, “Switzerland campaigns for equal pay at the UN,” SWI, March 20, 2017, https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/women-s-rights_switzerland-campaigns-for-equal-pay-at-the-un/43042664.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact Groups==
IGC has organized impact groups, led by Champions which channel sector knowledge in greater detail on Representation, Trade, Change Management, Disarmament, and Standards.&lt;ref&gt;"Impact,” International Gender Champions, https://genderchampions.com/impact&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organization’s]] Ministerial Conference in [[Buenos Aires]] in December 2017, the IGC Trade Impact Group was joined by 120 WTO members and observers to issue the historic Joint Declaration on Trade and Women’s Economic Empowerment, the first international declaration to explicitly link women’s economic empowerment and trade.&lt;ref&gt;Buenos Aires Declaration on Women and Trade outlines actions to empower women,” World Trade Organization, December 21, 2017. https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/mc11_12dec17_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Malcorra, who presided over the conference, called the Declaration a “great success… Collectively, we were able to recognize the key role women can play in a fair, just and sustainable international trade system. The fact that so many countries, both members and observers of the WTO, rallied behind women’s empowerment in this field signifies that not everything is lost.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Susana Malcorra]], “Even amid Protectionism, Buenos Aires Gave Women Momentum,” Centre for International Governance Innovation, April 2, 2018, https://www.cigionline.org/articles/even-amid-protectionism-buenos-aires-gave-women-momentum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
In 2017 and 2018, Geneva’s [[Jet d'Eau|Jet d’Eau]] was illuminated on International Women’s Day with the turquoise of the International Gender Champions logo.&lt;ref&gt;“International Women’s Week,” International Gender Champions, https://genderchampions.com/events/international-womens-week&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inuktitut''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|n|ʊ|k|t|ᵻ|t|ʊ|t}}; {{IPA-iku|inuktiˈtut|lang}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Inuktitut syllabics|syllabics]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|iu-Cans|'''ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ'''}}; from {{wikt-lang|iu-Latn|ᐃᓄᒃ|inuk}}, "person" + {{lang|iu-Latn|-titut}}, "like", "in the manner of"), also '''Eastern Canadian Inuktitut''', is one of the principal [[Inuit languages]] of [[Canada]]. It is spoken in all areas north of the [[tree line]], including parts of the provinces of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Quebec]], to some extent in northeastern [[Manitoba]] as well as the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]. It is one of the aboriginal languages written with [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wintranslation.com/2014/02/12/aboriginal-languages-facts/|title=field to show translation -&gt; 10 facts about Canadian Aboriginal Languages|publisher=Wintranslation.com|date=2014-02-12|accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recognised as an official language in Nunavut alongside [[Inuinnaqtun]], and both languages are known collectively as ''Inuktut''. Further, it is recognized as one of eight official native tongues in the Northwest Territories.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It also has [[legal recognition]] in [[Nunavik]]—a part of Quebec—thanks in part to the [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]], and is recognised in the [[Charter of the French Language]] as the official language of instruction for Inuit school districts there. It also has some recognition in [[Nunatsiavut]]—the [[Inuit]] area in [[Labrador]]—following the ratification of its agreement with the [[government of Canada]] and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The [[Canada 2006 Census|Canadian census]] reports that there are roughly 35,000 Inuktitut speakers in Canada, including roughly 200 who live regularly outside traditionally Inuit lands.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89189&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=705&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= Various Languages Spoken (147), Age Groups (17A) and Sex (3) for the Population of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2006 Census – 20% Sample Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016163022/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89189&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=705&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=|date=2013-10-16}} and [http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2006&amp;APATH=3&amp;PID=89149&amp;THEME=73&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;VID=0&amp;GK=NA&amp;GC=99&amp;FL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;METH=0&amp;S=1 Selected Language Characteristics (165), Aboriginal Identity (8), Age Groups (7), Sex (3) and Area of Residence (6) for the Population of Canada, Provinces and Territories, 2006 Census – 20% Sample Data (Total – Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal identity population]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Inuktitut'' is often used more broadly to include [[Inuvialuktun]] and thus nearly all the Inuit dialects of Canada.  For more information on the relationship between Inuktitut and the Inuit languages spoken in [[Greenland]] and [[Alaska]], see ''[[Inuit languages]]''.

==History==

=== Inuktitut in the school system ===
Before contact, Inuit learned skills by example and participation. The Inuktitut language provided them with all the vocabulary required to describe traditional practices and natural features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorais |first=Louis-Jacques |date=1995 |title=Language, culture and identity: some Inuit examples |journal=Canadian Journal of Native Studies |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=129–308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to this point, it was solely an [[oral language]]. [[Colonialism]] brought the European schooling system over to Canada. The missionaries of the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches were the first ones to deliver education to Inuit in schools. The teachers used the Inuktitut language for instruction and developed writing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.k12studycanada.org/files/Inuktitut.pdf |title=Inuktitut – the Inuit Language |last=Fabbi |first=Nadine |date=2003 |website=K12 Study Canada |access-date=March 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 the first [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] for Inuit opened, and English became the language of instruction. As the government's interests in the North increased, it started taking over the education of Inuit. After the end of World War II, English was seen as the language of communication in all domains. Officials expressed concerns about the difficulty for Inuit to find employment, if they were not able to communicate in English. Inuit were supposed to use English at school, work, and even at the playground.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Patrick |first=Donna |date=1999 |title=The roots of Inuktitut-language bilingual education |journal=The Canadian Journal of Native Studies |volume=XIX, 2 |pages=249–262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inuit themselves viewed Inuktitut as the way to express their feelings and be linked to their identity, while English was a tool for making money.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1960s, the European attitude towards the Inuktitut language started to change. Inuktitut was seen as a language worth preserving, and it was argued that knowledge, particularly in the first years of school, is best transmitted in the mother tongue. This set off the beginning of bilingual schools. In 1969, most Inuit voted to eliminate federal schools and replace them with programs by the {{lang|fr|[[:fr:Direction générale du Nouveau-Québec|Direction Generale du Nouveau-Quebec]]|italic=no}} (DGNQ). Content was now taught in Inuktitut, English and French.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Legislation ===
Inuktitut became one of the official language in the Northwest Territories in 1984. Its status is secured in the [[Northwest Territories#Language|Northwest Territories Official Language Act]]. With the split of the Territory into NWT and Nunavut in 1999, both territories kept the Language Act.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767733303 |title=The language of the Inuit : syntax, semantics, and society in the Arctic |last=Dorais |first=Louis-Jacques |date=2010 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=9780773544451 |location=Montreal |oclc=767733303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nunatsiavut in Labrador made Inuktitut the official language of the government. In Nunavik, the [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]] recognizes Inuktitut in the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/inuktitut/#h3_jump_4 |title=Inuktitut |last=Compton |first=Richard |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |access-date=2018-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nunavut's basic law lists four official languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], Inuktitut and [[Inuinnaqtun]], but to what degree Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun can be thought of as separate languages is ambiguous in state policy. The word ''Inuktitut'' is often used to describe both. A more proper term has been adopted using "Inuit Languages" when speaking of Inuinnaqtun and Inuktitut.

The demographic situation of Inuktitut is quite strong in Nunavut. Nunavut is the home of some 24,000 Inuit, most of whom—over 80% according to the 2001 census—speak Inuktitut, including some 3,500 people reported as monolinguals. 2001 census data shows that the use of Inuktitut, while lower among the young than the elderly, has stopped declining in Canada as a whole and may even be increasing in Nunavut.

The South Baffin dialect ({{lang|iu-Latn|Qikiqtaaluk nigiani}}, {{lang|iu-Cans|ᕿᑭᖅᑖᓗᒃ ᓂᒋᐊᓂ}}) is spoken across the southern part of [[Baffin Island]], including the territorial capital [[Iqaluit]]. This has in recent years made it a much more widely heard dialect, since a great deal of Inuktitut media originates in [[Iqaluit]]. Some linguists also distinguish an ''East Baffin'' dialect from either South Baffin or North Baffin, which is an Inuvialuk dialect.

As of the early 2000s, Nunavut has gradually implemented early childhood, elementary, and secondary school-level immersion programmes within its education system to further preserve and promote the Inuktitut language. {{as of|2012}}, "Pirurvik, [[Iqaluit]]'s Inuktitut language training centre, has a new goal: to train instructors from Nunavut communities to teach Inuktitut in different ways and in their own dialects when they return home."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Dawson |first=Samantha |title=A new way to nurture the Inuit language: train the instructors |work=NunatsiaqOnline |accessdate=2013-01-24 |date=2013-01-17 |url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674a_new_way_to_spread_the_inuit_language_train_the_instructors/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nunavik===
[[Quebec]] is home to roughly 12,000 Inuit, nearly all of whom live in [[Nunavik]]. According to the 2001 census, 90% of Quebec Inuit speak Inuktitut.

The Nunavik dialect ({{lang|iu-Latn|Nunavimmiutitut}}, {{lang|iu-Cans|ᓄᓇᕕᒻᒥᐅᑎᑐᑦ}}) is relatively close to the South Baffin dialect, but not identical. Because of the political and physical boundary between Nunavik and Nunavut, Nunavik has separate government and educational institutions from those in the rest of the Inuktitut-speaking world, resulting in a growing standardization of the local dialect as something separate from other forms of Inuktitut. In the Nunavik dialect, Inuktitut is called {{lang|iu-Latn|Inuttitut}} ({{lang|iu-Cans|ᐃᓄᑦᑎᑐᑦ}}). This dialect is also sometimes called {{lang|iu-Latn|Tarramiutut}} or {{lang|iu-Latn|Taqramiutut}} ({{lang|iu-Cans|ᑕᕐᕋᒥᐅᑐᑦ}} or {{lang|iu-Cans|ᑕᖅᕐᕋᒥᐅᑐᑦ}}).

Subdialects of Inuktitut in this region include Tarrarmiut and Itivimuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arctic.synergiesprairies.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/viewFile/1477/1457 |title=Review |publisher=Arctic.synergiesprairies.ca |accessdate=2015-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224044033/http://arctic.synergiesprairies.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/viewFile/1477/1457 |archivedate=2014-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Itivimuit is associated with [[Inukjuak]], Quebec, and there is a [[Itivimuit River]] near the town.

===Labrador===
The [[Nunatsiavut]] dialect ({{lang|iu-Latn|[[Nunatsiavummiut dialect|Nunatsiavummiutut]]}} {{lang|iu-Cans|ᓄᓇᑦᓯᐊᕗᒻᒥᐅᑐᑦ}} , or often in government documents {{lang|iu-Latn|Labradorimiutut}}) was once spoken across northern [[Labrador]].  It has a distinct writing system, created by German missionaries from the [[Moravian Church]] in Greenland in the 1760s.  This separate writing tradition, and the remoteness of Nunatsiavut from other Inuit communities, has made it into a distinct dialect with a separate literary tradition.  The Nunatsiavummiut call their language {{lang|iu-Latn|Inuttut}} ({{lang|iu-Cans|ᐃᓄᑦᑐᑦ}}).

Although Nunatsiavut claims over 4,000 inhabitants of Inuit descent, only 550 reported Inuktitut to be their native language in the 2001 census, mostly in the town of [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]].  Inuktitut is seriously endangered in Labrador.

Nunatsiavut also had a separate dialect reputedly much closer to western Inuktitut dialects, spoken in the area around [[Rigolet, Newfoundland and Labrador|Rigolet]]. According to news reports, in 1999 it had only three very elderly speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/nunavut990528/nvt90507_16.html |title=A precious Inuktitut dialect slowly dies in Rigolet |publisher=Nunatsiaq.com |date=1999-05-07 |accessdate=2012-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029145259/http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/nunavut990528/nvt90507_16.html |archive-date=2007-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenland===
Though often thought to be a dialect of [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], [[Inuktun]] or Polar Eskimo is a recent arrival in Greenland from the Eastern Canadian Arctic, arriving perhaps as late as the 18th century.

==Phonology==
{{Main|Inuit phonology}}
Eastern dialects of Inuktitut have fifteen [[consonant]]s and three [[vowel]]s (which can be long or short). Consonants are arranged with five [[place of articulation|places of articulation]]: [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]], [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[palatal consonant|palatal]], [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]]; and three [[manner of articulation|manners of articulation]]: voiceless [[stop consonant|stops]], voiced [[continuant]]s and [[nasal consonant|nasals]], as well as two additional sounds—voiceless [[fricative consonant|fricatives]].  Natsalingmiutut has an additional consonant  {{IPA|/ɟ/}}, a vestige of the [[retroflex consonant]]s of [[Proto-Inuit]]. [[Inuinnaqtun]] has one fewer consonant, as {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ɬ/}} have merged into {{IPA|/h/}}. All dialects of Inuktitut have only three basic vowels and make a phonological distinction between short and long forms of all vowels. In {{lang|iu-Cans|Inuujingajut}}—Nunavut standard Roman orthography—long vowels are written as a double vowel.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Inuit grammar}}

Inuktitut, like other [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]], has a very rich morphological system, in which a succession of different [[morpheme]]s are added to root words to indicate things that, in languages like English, would require several words to express.  (See also: [[Agglutinative language]] and [[Polysynthetic language]].) All words begin with a root morpheme to which other morphemes are suffixed.  Inuktitut has hundreds of distinct suffixes, in some dialects as many as 700. However, it is highly regular, with rules that do not have exceptions like in English and other [[Indo-European languages]], though they are sometimes very complicated.

One famous example is the word {{lang|iu-Latn|qangatasuukkuvimmuuriaqalaaqtunga}} ({{lang|iu-Cans|ᖃᖓᑕᓲᒃᑯᕕᒻᒨᕆᐊᖃᓛᖅᑐᖓ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dench |first1=Catherine |last2=Cleave |first2=Patricia L. |last3=Tagak |first3=Jane |last4=Beddard |first4=Janice |display-authors=2 |title=The Development of an Inuktitut and English Language Screening Tool in Nunavut |journal=Canadian Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology |date=2011 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=168–177 |url=http://cjslpa.ca/files/2011_CJSLPA_Vol_35/No_02_103-213/Dench_Cleave_Tagak_Beddard_CJSLPA_2011.pdf |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922110818/http://cjslpa.ca/files/2011_CJSLPA_Vol_35/No_02_103-213/Dench_Cleave_Tagak_Beddard_CJSLPA_2011.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-22 |access-date=2015-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning ''I'll have to go to the airport'':

==Writing==
Inuktitut is written in several different ways, depending on the dialect and region, but also on historical and political factors.

[[Moravia]]n missionaries, with the purpose of introducing the Inuit peoples to [[Christianity]] and the [[Bible]], contributed to the development of an Inuktitut alphabet in Greenland during the 1760s that was based on the Latin script. (This alphabet is distinguished by its inclusion of the letter [[kra (letter)|kra]], ĸ.) They later travelled to Labrador in the 1800s, bringing the Inuktitut alphabet with them.

The Alaskan [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] and [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] (who, in addition, developed [[yugtun script|their own syllabary]]) and the [[Siberian Yupik]] also adopted Latin alphabets.

Eastern Canadian Inuit were the last to adopt the written word when, in the 1860s, missionaries imported the written system {{lang|iu-Latn|Qaniujaaqpait}} they had developed in their efforts to convert the [[Cree]] to Christianity. The very last Inuit peoples introduced to missionaries and writing were the [[Netsilik Inuit]] in [[Kugaaruk, Nunavut|Kugaaruk]] and north [[Baffin Island]]. The Netsilik adopted {{lang|iu-Latn|Qaniujaaqpait}} by the 1920s.

The "Greenlandic" system has been substantially reformed in recent years, making Labrador writing unique to [[Nunatsiavummiutut]] at this time. Most Inuktitut in Nunavut and Nunavik is written using a scheme called {{lang|iu-Latn|Qaniujaaqpait}} or [[Inuktitut syllabics]], based on [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]].  The western part of Nunavut and the [[Northwest Territories]] use a Latin alphabet usually called {{lang|iu-Latn|[[Inuinnaqtun]]}} or {{lang|iu-Latn|Qaliujaaqpait}}, reflecting the predispositions of the missionaries who reached this area in the late 19th century and early 20th.

In April 2012, with the completion  of the [[Old Testament]], the first complete Bible in Inuktitut, translated by native speakers, was published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nnsl.com/northern-news-services/stories/papers/apr23_12bb.html Hebrew Bible published in Eskimo language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108093615/http://nnsl.com/northern-news-services/stories/papers/apr23_12bb.html |date=2012-11-08 }}, [[News/North]] Nunavut, 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted literature in Inuktitut has included the novels ''Harpoon of the Hunter'' by [[Markoosie Patsauq]],&lt;ref name=collections&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/literaryarchives/027011-200.086-e.html "MARKOOSIE, 1942-: LMS-0017"]. [[Collections Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|iu-Latn|[[Sanaaq]]|italic=yes}} by [[Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk]].&lt;ref name=southern&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Keavy |title=Southern readers finally get a chance to read Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk, the accidental Inuit novelist |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/book-reviews/southern-readers-finally-get-a-chance-to-read-mitiarjuk-nappaaluk-the-accidental-inuit-novelist/article16389857/ |accessdate=18 October 2014 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=17 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Canadian syllabary===
{{Main|Inuktitut syllabics}}
[[File:Inuktitut.svg|framed|right|The syllabary used to write Inuktitut ({{lang|iu-Latn|titirausiq nutaaq}}). The extra characters with the dots represent long vowels; in the Latin transcription, the vowel would be doubled.]]

The Inuktitut syllabary used in Canada is based on the [[Cree syllabics|Cree syllabary]] devised by the missionary [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]]. The present form of the syllabary for Canadian Inuktitut was adopted by the [[Inuit Cultural Institute]] in Canada in the 1970s.  The Inuit in Alaska, the [[Inuvialuit]], Inuinnaqtun speakers, and Inuit in [[Greenland]] and [[Labrador]] use Latin alphabets.

Though conventionally called a [[syllabary]], the writing system has been classified by some observers as an [[abugida]], since syllables starting with the same consonant have related [[glyph]]s rather than unrelated ones.

All of the characters needed for the Inuktitut syllabary are available in the [[Unicode]] block [[Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (Unicode block)|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]]. The territorial government of [[Nunavut]], Canada has developed a [[TrueType]] [[typeface|font]] called {{lang|iu-Latn|Pigiarniq}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ch.gov.nu.ca/en/ComputerTools.aspx Computer Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fonts"&gt;[http://www.pirurvik.ca/en/productions/iu-computing/font-download Inuktitut Syllabic Fonts – Download]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Inuktitut syllabics|ᐱᓄᐊᕐᓂᖅ]] {{IPA-iku|pi.nu.aʁ.ˈniq|}}{{Dubious|date=October 2015|reason=clearly does not match written form}}) for computer displays. It was designed by [[Vancouver]]-based Tiro Typeworks. Apple Macintosh computers include an Inuktitut IME (Input Method Editor) as part of keyboard language options.&lt;ref name="fonts" /&gt;

===Braille===
{{main|Inuktitut Braille}}
In 2012 Tamara Kearney, Manager of Braille Research and Development at the Commonwealth Braille and Talking Book Cooperative, developed a Braille code for the Inuktitut language syllabics. This code is based on representing the syllabics orientation. Machine translation from Unicode UTF-8 and UTF-16 can be performed using the liblouis Braille translation system which included an Inuktitut Braille translation table. The book {{lang|ike|ᐃᓕᐊᕐᔪᒃ ᓇᓄᕐᓗ|italic=yes}} (''The Orphan and the Polar Bear'') became the first work ever translated into Inuktitut Braille and a copy is held by the Nunavut Territorial Library at [[Baker Lake, Nunavut]].

'''Ioannis Kakridis''' ({{lang-el|Ιωάννης Κακριδής}}) (17 November 1901 – 20 March 1992) was a [[Greece|Greek]] classical scholar.

He was born in [[Athens]] in 1901 and received his PhD at the [[University of Athens]]. He went on to become a professor at the universities of [[University of Athens|Athens]], [[University of Thessaloniki|Thessaloniki]], [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[Stockholm University|Stockholm]], [[Lund University|Lund]] and [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]]. Kakridis was a Homer scholar and one of the most important classicists of twentieth-century Greece. He was also an early and staunch advocate of the adoption of the [[Greek diacritics|monotonic system]] in the Greek language. In 1941, he was denounced by the faculty of the University of Athens for republishing a lecture in the monotonic system, which led to the so-called "Trial of Accents" and his suspension and later dismissal from the university.&lt;ref&gt;Demaras, K. Th., ''A History of Modern Greek Literature'', trans. by Mary Gianos (London 1974) ii. 193–97, cited in {{citation |last=Papaioannou |first=Sophia |title=Translating Homer in 20th century Greece: the 'Silent' Voice of a Revolution |url=http://www.class.uh.edu/mcl/faculty/armstrong/papa.draft.html#f9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505035839/http://www.class.uh.edu/mcl/faculty/armstrong/papa.draft.html#f9 |archivedate=5 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of his written work is quite extensive. The most important works are a translation into the [[modern Greek language]] of the works of [[Homer]], together with [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] and a five-volume collection of Greek mythology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5706">'''Keith Muckelroy''' (1951-1980) was a pioneer of [[maritime archaeology]]. Instead of the traditional particularist or historiographic approach used by maritime archaeologists, Muckelroy's ideas were new to the field, influenced by the prehistoric and analytical archaeology he learned under [[Grahame Clark]] and [[David L. Clarke|David Clarke]] at Cambridge, the tenets of [[processual archaeology]] gaining traction in the U.S., and his own experiences on shipwreck sites in British waters, notably the 1664 Dutch East Indiaman Kennemerland, several [[Spanish Armada]] wrecks, and the [[Mary Rose]].

==Research, theories, and publications==
In 1976 he published a paper&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K., 1976.  The integration of historical and archaeological data concerning an historic wreck site: The 'Kennemerland'.  World Archaeology 7.3 pp 280-289.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed a theory for the formation of shipwreck sites.  He later expanded this and other theories in his seminal publication, a book titled ''Maritime Archaeology''.&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K., 1978.  Maritime Archaeology.  Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521220793}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his discussion on shipwreck formation processes, he introduced terms such as "extracting filters" and "scrambling devices" into the lexicon, and used statistical models to clarify large bodies of data in order to discern patterns in the wrecking process, ideas that had never been proposed before.&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K., 1978.  Maritime Archaeology.  Cambridge University Press, pp 157-214 {{ISBN|0521220793}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas coincided nicely with [[processual archaeology]]’s call for a more scientific, analytic methodology. Muckelroy's shipwreck formation theory became a classic model for interpretation of wreck sites and even today, either his original paper or his later book are referenced regularly in studies on the [[archaeology of shipwrecks]].  

Muckelroy's other prominent contribution was a three-part interpretive framework for better understanding the ship in its original social context. The three aspects he proposed were 1. The ship as a machine designed for harnessing a source of power in order to serve as a means of transport; 2. The ship as an element in a military or economic system, providing its basic raison d'être; and 3. The ship as a closed community, with its own hierarchy, customs, and conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K., 1978.  Maritime Archaeology.  Cambridge University Press, p. 216 {{ISBN|0521220793}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic model has proven useful to many maritime archaeologists seeking to understand the role of ships as part of a greater cultural system. 

Muckelroy also edited an atlas of underwater archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Muckleroy, K. 1980, Archaeology under water: an atlas of the world's submerged sites.  McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0070439516}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His research covered the Kennemerland,&lt;ref&gt;Muckelroy, Keith, 1977: A Possible Seventeenth-Century Dutch Backstaff.  The Mariner's Mirror Vol. 63, London, pp 213-214, ill. A find from the Dutch East-Indaman Kennmerland which was at the Shetland Ilands in 1664.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bronze age]] cargoes and trade&lt;ref&gt;Muckelroy, Keith. 1981.  Middle Bronze Age trade between Britain and Europe: a maritime perspective.  Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society.  Vol 47.  pp275-297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muckelroy, Keith.  1980. Two bronze age cargoes in British waters. Antiquity Vol 54 number 211 pp100-109&lt;/ref&gt; and terrestrial archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Muckelroy, K 1976.  Enclosed ambulatories in Romano-Celtic temples in Britain Britannia vol 7, pp173-91.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that archaeological research on more recent wrecks, such as early iron vessels and steamships, was a waste of time because more information on them could be gleaned from material in archives and in museums than from artifacts recovered from the seabed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime/exhibtions/north.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  This view is challenged by other maritime archaeologists.

His career was cut short on 8 September 1980 when he drowned in a diving accident in [[Loch Tay]].

==The Keith Muckelroy Award==
The Keith Muckelroy award is awarded biennially for the best published work in the preceding two years covering British maritime, nautical or underwater archaeology.  Entries are eligible if they address work in Britain, Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey or British territorial waters.  The award is given for work that best reflects the pioneering ideas and scholarly standards of Keith Muckelroy.

The award became part of the British Archaeological Awards in 2004 and is sponsored by the Keith Muckelroy Trust, The Maritime Affairs Group of the [[Institute of Field Archaeologists|IFA]], the [[Nautical Archaeology Society]] and the Maritime Committee of the Association of Local Government Archaeological Officers.  Prior to 2004, the award had been given five times during the 1980s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1145">'''Kesh''' was an ancient [[Sumer]]ian city and religious site, whose patron goddess was [[Ninhursag]]. Its location is uncertain; some of the possible sites put forth include [[Al Ubaidi|Al-Ubaid]], near [[Ur]], or [[Tell al-Wilayah]] near [[Adab (city)|Adab]] or [[Abu Salabikh]]. [[Robert D. Biggs]] suggested it could have just been a variation in the spelling of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]].&lt;ref name="Biggs"&gt;[http://related.springerprotocols.com/lp/de-gruyter/an-archaic-sumerian-version-of-the-kesh-temple-hymn-from-tell-ab-al-b-UDU6yHuFgR Biggs, Robert D., Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische, Archäologie , Volume 61 (2), de Gruyter – Jan 1, 1971 - Springerprotocols]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a famous [[Kesh temple hymn]]&lt;ref&gt;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.4.80.2#&lt;/ref&gt; about Ninhursag's temple in Kesh, where she is called Nintud.  The goddess [[Nisaba]] appears as the temple's caretaker and decision maker.

The '''Lahore Fort''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|شاہی قلعہ}}}}: ''Shahi Qila'', or ''"Royal Fort"''), is a [[citadel]] in the city of [[Lahore]],Punjab, [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Location of Lahore Fort"&gt;{{cite web|last=Google maps|title=Location of Lahore Fort|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;q=shahi+qila+lahore&amp;fb=1&amp;hq=lahore+fort&amp;cid=3872470187115328748&amp;hnear=&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A|publisher=Google maps|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress is located at the northern end of [[Walled City of Lahore|walled city Lahore]], and spreads over an area greater than 20 [[hectare]]s.&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt; It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor [[Akbar]]. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Ruggles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruggles|first=D. Fairchild |authorlink=D. Fairchild Ruggles |title=Islamic Gardens and Landscapes|date=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812207286}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Mughal Empire]] was at the height of its splendour and opulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic art in the Metropolitan Museum: The Historical Context|date=1992|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia,&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt; the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort.&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt; The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs.&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt;  Additions from the [[Shah Jahan]] period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs,&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt; while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal Emperors, [[Aurangzeb]], and faces the renowned [[Badshahi Mosque]].

And after the fall of the Mughal Empire, the Lahore Fort was used as the residence of [[Ranjit Singh]], founder of the [[Sikh Empire]]. The fort then passed to [[British Raj|British colonialists]] after they annexed Punjab following their victory over the Sikhs at the [[Battle of Gujrat]] in February 1849. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] for its "outstanding [[wikt:repertoire|repertoire]]" of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic [[wikt:zenith|zenith]].&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Badshahi Mosqu - Mughal Art in an Ocean of Concrete.jpg|thumb|Lahore Fort is located across the [[Hazuri Bagh]] from the [[Badshahi Mosque]] (foreground).]]
The fort is located in the northern part of [[Lahore]]'s old walled city. The fort's Alamgiri gate is part of an ensemble of buildings, which along with the [[Badshahi Mosque]], [[Roshnai Gate]], and [[Samadhi of Ranjit Singh]], form a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] around the [[Hazuri Bagh]]. The ''[[Minar-e-Pakistan]]'' and [[Iqbal Park]] are adjacent to the northern boundary of the fort.

== History ==

===Early history===
[[File:The Hazuri Bagh Pavilion(1870).jpg|thumb|A picture showing the Lahore Fort and Hazuri Bagh Pavilion in 1870.]]
Though the site is known to have been inhabited for millennia,&lt;ref name="Unesco"/&gt; the origins of Lahore Fort are obscure and traditionally based on various myths.&lt;ref&gt;G. Johnson, [[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]], and J F Richards (1988). [[The New Cambridge History of India]]. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-40027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delhi Sultanate===
The first historical reference to a fort at the site is from the 11th century during the rule of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]. The fort was made of mud, and was destroyed in 1241 by the [[Mongols]] during their invasion of Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~rnoor/lahore_fort.html|title=lahore fort|publisher=University of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new fort was constructed in 1267 at the site by Sultan [[Ghiyas ud din Balban|Balban]] of the Turkic [[Mamluk dynasty of Delhi|Mamluk dynasty]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamadani, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The re-built fort was destroyed in 1398 by the invading forces of [[Timur]], only to be rebuilt by [[Sayyid dynasty#Sayyid Mubarak Shah|Mubarak Shah Sayyid]] in 1421,&lt;ref&gt;Khan, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1430s, the fort was occupied by Shaikh Ali of [[Kabul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Punjab (India)|title=Punjab District Gazetteers, Volume 13|publisher=Controller of Print. and Stationery, 2002|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained under the control of the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] sultans of the [[Lodi dynasty]] until Lahore was captured by the Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] in 1526.

===Mughal era===

====Akbar period====
[[File:Lahore Fort Elephant Pillars.jpg|thumb|upright|The use of elephant-shaped column brackets reflects Hindu influences on the syncretic architectural style of [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]].]]
The present design and structure of the fort traces its origins to 1575, when the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] occupied the site as a post to guard the northwest frontier of the empire.&lt;ref name="LF"&gt;Asher, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic location of Lahore,  between the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal territories]] and the strongholds of [[Kabul]], [[Multan]], and [[Kashmir]] necessitated the dismantling of the old mud-fort and fortification with solid brick masonry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=3991 Lahore Fort Complex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507070803/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=3991 |date=7 May 2008 }}.

Retrieved 7 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Lofty palaces were built over time, along with lush gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt; Notable Akbar period structures included the ''Doulat Khana-e-Khas-o-Am'', ''Jharoka-e-Darshan'', and ''Akbari Gate''. Many Akbari structures were modified or replaced by subsequent rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhry, p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jahangir period====
[[File:A_picture_of_Gate_back_in_2000AD_by_Usman_Ghani.jpg|thumb|The fort's massive Picture Wall dates from the [[Jahangir]] period.]]
Emperor [[Jahangir]] first mentions his alterations to the fort in 1612 when describing the [[Lahore Fort#Maktab Khana|Maktab Khana]]. Jahangir also added the [[Lahore Fort#Kala Burj|Kala Burj]] pavilion, which features European-inspired angels on its vaulted ceiling.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt; British visitors to the fort noted [[Christian iconography]] during the Jahangir period, with paintings of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] and [[Jesus]] found in the fort complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schimmel|first1=Annemarie|title=The Empire of the Great Mughals: History, Art and Culture|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=9781861891853|pages=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1606, [[Guru Arjan]] of the Sikh faith was imprisoned at the fort before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh| title= Life and Work of Guru Arjan: History, Memory, and Biography in the Sikh Tradition| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbPXAAAAMAAJ| year=2006| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-567921-2| pages=23, 217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the mosque likely served as a Friday congregational mosque for members of the Royal Court, it was not financed by Jahangir, although it likely required his approval.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt;

====Shah Jahan period====
[[Shah Jahan]]'s first contribution to the fort commenced in the year of his coronation, 1628, and continued until 1645.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt; Shah Jahan first ordered the construction of the [[Lahore Fort#Diwan-i-Aam|Diwan-i-Aam]] in the style of a ''Chehel Sotoun'' - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt; Though construction of the Shah Burj commenced under Jahangir, Shah Jahan was displeased with its design and appointed [[Abul-Hasan ibn Mirza Ghiyas Beg|Asif Khan]] to oversee reconstruction.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt; Shah Jahan's Shah Burj forms a quadrangle with the famous [[Sheesh Mahal (Lahore Fort)|Sheesh Mahal]], and Naulakha Pavilion. Both are attributed to Shah Jahan, although the Naulakha Pavilion may be a later addition possibly from the Sikh era.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt; The white marble Moti Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, also dates from the Shah Jahan period.

====Aurangzeb period====
[[File:Lahore Fort - Main Entrance.JPG|thumbnail|The fort's iconic Alamgiri Gate was built during the reign of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]].]]
Emperor [[Aurangzeb]], built the Alamgiri Gate,&lt;ref&gt;Bhalla, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; whose semi-circular towers and domed pavilions are a widely recognised symbol of Lahore that was once featured on [[Pakistani rupee|Pakistani currency]].

===Sikh era===
The Mughals lost the fort to the Afghan [[Durrani]]s, who in turn briefly lost the fort to [[Maratha Empire|Maratha forces]] before being recaptured by the Durranis.&lt;ref name="Emotional Literacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan|url=http://emotional-literacy-education.com/classic-books-online-a/tfmeh10.htm|publisher=Emotional Literacy|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fort was then captured by the [[Bhangi Misl]] - one of the 12 Sikh Misls of Punjab that ruled Lahore from 1767 until 1799. The fort fell to the army of [[Ranjit Singh]], who took Lahore from the Bhangi Misl in 1799.&lt;ref name="Lulu"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Students’ Academy|title=Lahore-The Cultural Capital of Pakistan|publisher=Lulu|isbn=1458322874|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maharaja [[Duleep Singh]] was born at the fort's ''Jind Kaur Haveli'' in 1838.&lt;ref name=bansal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bansal|first1=Bobby|title=Remnants of the Sikh Empire: Historical Sikh Monuments in India &amp; Pakistan|date=2015|publisher=Hay House, Inc|isbn=9384544930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duleep Singh had signed the [[Treaty of Lahore#The Treaty of Bhyroval|Treaty of Bhyroval]] in 1847 that brought the Sikh empire to an effective end.&lt;ref name=bansal/&gt; The fort and the city had remained under the control of Ranjit Singh's family until the fall of the Sikh empire in 1849.&lt;ref name="Abhinav Publications"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kartar Singh Duggal|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Last to Lay Arms|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=9788170174103|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their occupation of the fort, the Sikhs repurposed portions of the fort for their own use. Ranjit Singh used the fort's Summer Palace as his own residence.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt; The ''Sehdari'' pavilion, or "Three-doored" pavilion, was added to the fort during Sikh rule. The fort's Naag Temple was also constructed during Sikh rule, while the ''Mai Jindan Haveli'' was extensively modified during Sikh rule. The fort's Diwan-i-Aam was destroyed in 1841 when the son of Ranjit Singh, [[Sher Singh]] bombarded the fort in his fight against [[Chand Kaur]].&lt;ref name="Lahore"&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Buildings and Structures of Lahore Fort:|url=http://www.pakistantoursguide.com/lahore-fort.html|publisher=Pakistan Tourist Guide|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
[[File:Plan map of Lahore Fort 1911.jpg|thumb|upright|Layout of the Lahore Fort in 1911]]
Excavations in 1959 in front of Diwan-i-Am led to the discovery of a gold coin dated 1025 CE belonging to [[Mahmud Ghaznavi]]. The coin was unearthed at the depth of {{convert|25|ft|m}} from the lawn. The cultural layers were continuous to the depth of {{convert|15|ft|m|}} indicating that the fort was inhabited by people even before his conquest.

While relaying the deteriorated floor of Akbari Gate in April 2007, three floors in the fort were unearthed belonging to the British, Sikh and Mughal period. The floor of the British, Sikh and Mughal periods were constructed with bricks, burnt bricks and pebbles respectively. The latter either built during Jahangir's or Shah Jahan's era was the hallmark of Mughals.&lt;ref name="Pak"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three floors revealed at Lahore Fort|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/244473/three-floors-revealed-at-lahore-fort|publisher=Dawn|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Layout ==
[[File:Lahore Fort Top view.JPG|thumb|The fort, as seen from the northeast minaret of the [[Badshahi Mosque]].]]
The fort is divided into two sections: first the administrative section, which is well connected with main entrances, and includes gardens and ''Diwan-e-Khas'' for royal audiences. The second, a private and concealed residential section is divided into courts in the north and accessible through elephant gate.  It also contains Sheesh Mahal, spacious bedrooms and small gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine E G Asher (1993) Architecture of Mughal India.

==Major structures==

===Shah Burj Quadrangle===
==== Naulakha Pavilion ====
[[File:Naulakha Pavilion in Lahore Fort.jpg|thumbnail|The marble [[Naulakha Pavilion]] is one of the most iconic sights at the fort.]]
{{main article|Naulakha Pavilion}}
The [[Naulakha Pavilion]] is an iconic sight of the Lahore Fort built in 1633 during the Shah Jahan period that is made of prominent [[white marble]], and known for its distinctive [[Curvilinear|curvilinear roof]]. It cost around 900,000 [[rupee]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=AB Rajput|title=Architecture in Pakistan|publisher=Pakistan Publications|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exorbitant amount at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Rajput A B (1963) Architecture in Pakistan. Pakistan Publications, pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; The structure derives its name from the [[Urdu]] word for 900,000, ''Naulakha''.

The Naulakha pavilion served as a personal chamber and was located to the west of the [[Sheesh Mahal (Lahore)|Sheesh Mahal]], in the northern section of the fort. The pavilion served as inspiration for [[Rudyard Kipling]], who named his [[Vermont]] home [[Naulakha (Rudyard Kipling House)|Naulakha]] in honour of the pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;Kipling, Rudyard (1996) Writings on Writing. Cambridge University Press. 241 pages. {{ISBN|0-521-44527-2}}. see p.36 and p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure was originally inlaid with [[precious stones|precious and semi-precious stones]]. It reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions at the time of its construction, with a sloping-roof based on a [[Bengal]]i style, and a [[baldachin]] from Europe, which makes evident the imperial as well as religious function of the pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; The marble shades of the pavilion are capped with merlons to hide view from the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Nabi Khan, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

====Picture Wall====
[[File:Old lahore pattern.jpg|thumb|The Picture Wall features mosaics depicting a myriad of scenes.]]
Emperor Jahangir ordered construction of the massive "Picture Wall', which is considered to be the greatest artistic triumph of the Lahore Fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicoli|first1=Fernando|title=Shah Jahan|date=2009|publisher=Penguin Books|location=India|isbn=9780670083039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Red Fort]] and [[Agra Fort]], Lahore Fort's ramparts were made of brick rather than red stone. The monumental Picture Wall is a large section of the outer wall which is exquisitely decorated with a vibrant array of glazed tile, faience mosaics, and frescoes.&lt;ref name="Completion of Fort Picture Wall"/&gt;

The embellished wall stretches over much of the fort's northern and western walls and measures approximately {{convert|1450|ft|m}} by {{convert|50|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Completion of Fort Picture Wall"/&gt;  The wall contains 116 panels,&lt;ref name="nation.com.pk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Steps afoot to restore Fort's Picture Wall|url=http://nation.com.pk/featured/16-Mar-2016/steps-afoot-to-restore-fort-s-picture-wall|accessdate=25 December 2016|agency=The Nation|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depict a myriad of subjects, including elephant fights, angels, and polo games that do not form a cohesive narrative; each can be viewed in isolation. Though begun under Jahangir, the Picture Wall was decorated throughout the 1620s, and may have been completed under the reign of his son, Shah Jahan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=J.P.|editor1-last=Marshall|editor1-first=Sir John|title=TIle Mosaics of Lahore Fort|date=1921|publisher=Government Printing|location=Calcutta|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Picture Wall was badly neglected, and suffered from disrepair and damage. Conservation works at the site began in 2015 by the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] and [[Walled City of Lahore Authority]], which together have also restored other Lahore landmarks such as the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] and [[Shahi Hammam]]. Detailed documentation of the wall using [[3D scanner]] was completed in July 2016,&lt;ref name="thenews.com.pk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Completion of Fort Picture Wall|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/134915-Completion-of-Fort-Picture-Wall|accessdate=25 December 2016|agency=The News|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which conservation work would start.&lt;ref name="nation.com.pk"/&gt;

==== Sheesh Mahal ====
{{main article|Sheesh Mahal (Lahore Fort)}}
[[File:Magnificent Shish Mehal.jpg|thumb|The Sheesh Mahal is elaborately decorated with a myriad of reflective glass tiles.]]
The [[Sheesh Mahal (Lahore Fort)|Sheesh Mahal]] ("''The Palace of Mirrors''"; {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|شیش محل}}}}) is located within Jahangir's ''Shah Burj'' block in northern-western corner of the Lahore Fort. It was constructed under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631-32 by Mirza Ghiyas Begh, the grand father of [[Mumtaz Mahal]], and father of Nur Jahan. The ornate white marble pavilion's walls are decorated with frescoes, and are inlaid with [[pietra dura]] and complex mirror-work known as ''ayina kari''. It is among the best known monuments of Lahore Fort, and forms the jewel in the fort's crown.&lt;ref name="khan"&gt;Khan, Shehar Bano (2004) [http://www.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/040711/dmag1.htm Wither heritage?] ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]''. 11 July.

Sheesh Mahal was reserved for personal use by the imperial family and close [[:wiktionary:aide|aide]]s.

====Summer Palace====
[[File:Summer Palace Lahore Fort (WCLA).jpg|thumb|The Summer Palace is a labyrinth of chambers that was used as a residence during the hot summer months.]]
Located directly beneath the Sheesh Mahal and Shah Burj quadrangle is the Summer Palace, also known as the ''Pari Mahal'', or "Fairy Palace." The palace is a labyrinth of chambers that date from the Shah Jahan period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dar|first1=Nadeem|title=The Hidden Palace|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/tns/80518-The-hidden-palace|accessdate=25 December 2016|agency=The News (Magazine edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used as a residence during hot weather months, as they were cooled by effective ventilation systems that channeled cool breezes into the palace.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt; The palace's flooring system also helped cool the space - its floors were made of two layers that were separated by a layer of water pumped in from the Ravi River.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Qureshi|first1=Tania (Deputy Director of [[Walled CIty of Lahore Authority]])|title=The secret chamber of royals – summer palace|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/blog/2016/06/25/the-secret-chamber-of-royals-summer-palace/|website=Pakistan Today|accessdate=25 December 2016|date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cool water perfumed by roses flowed through an elaborate system of 42 waterfalls and cascades throughout the palace.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;

The palace was historically only accessible from the overlying Sheesh Mahal,&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt; though a new entrance was built by the British near Hathi Pul, or "Elephant Stairs."&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite news|title=The best-kept secret of Lahore Fort|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/24-Mar-2016/the-best-kept-secret-of-lahore-fort|accessdate=25 December 2016|publisher=The Nation|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its walls were decorated with intricate frescoes and marble [[inlay]] that have been severely deteriorate by layers of subsequent white-washing and centuries of dampness.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt; Passage tunnels also exist that lead from the palace to the fort's exterior where the River Ravi once flowed, suggesting that it may have been part of an escape tunnel designed to allow occupants to flee in case of attack.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;

The Summer Palace remained in use during the Sikh period under the reign of [[Ranjit Singh]]. Beginning in World War 2, the Summer Palace was used as a storehouse for the British [[Civil Defence Department]], and remained in use by Pakistan until 1973.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt; The building's structural integrity was affected by its use as a storehouse. As of 2014, the [[Walled City of Lahore Authority]] has assumed control of the space in order to undertake restoration works with the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]]&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt; Following its restoration, the space will house the Lahore Fort's museum.&lt;ref name="Qureshi"/&gt;

=== Khilwat Khana ===
''Khilwat Khana'' was built by Shah Jahan in 1633 to the east of the Shah Burj Pavilion, and west of the Shah Jahan Quadrangle.  It was the residence of the royal ladies of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Camerapix|title=Spectrum guide to Pakistan|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=9780816021260|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plinth and door frames are made of marble with a curvilinear roof.&lt;ref name="Lahore"/&gt;

====Kala Burj====
[[File:Oldheritageinlahore.jpg|thumb|The Kala Burj.]]
In the northwest corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Kala Burj ("Black Pavilion"). The pavilion is the most significant of the Jahangir-era additions to the Lahore Fort.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt; The vaulted ceilings in the pavilion feature paintings in a European-influenced style of angels which symbolize the virtuosity of [[King Solomon]],&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt; who is regarded as the ideal ruler in the [[Quran]], and a ruler with whom Jahangir identified.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt; Angels directing ''[[djinn]]s'' are also painted on tiles in the ceiling, which also reference King Solomon.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt; Kala Burj was used as a summer pavilion.&lt;ref name="Lahore"/&gt;

====Lal Burj====
In the northeast corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Lal Burj ("Red Pavilion"). Like the nearby Kala Burj, the Lal Burj was built during the reign of Jahangir,  though finished during the reign of Shah Jahan. Octagonal in shape, the Lal Burj was used as a summer pavilion. It features primary windows that opened to the north to catch cool breezes. The interior frescoes date mostly from the Sikh era, along with the entire upper level that was also added during the Sikh era.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt;

===Shah Jahan's Quadrangle===
The collection of buildings surrounding the quadrangle situated between Jahangir's Quadrangle and Khilawat Khana is referred to as Shah Jahan's Quadrangle.

====Diwan-i-Khas====
[[File:Dewan-e-Khas (Hall of Special Audience).JPG|thumb|The ''Diwan-i-Khas'' is where the Emperor would attend to state affairs.]]
{{main article|Diwan-i-Khas (Lahore Fort)}}
In contrast to the Diwan-i-Aam, the Diwan-i-Khas served as a hall where the Emperor would attend to matters of the state, and where courtiers and state guests were received.&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://islamic-arts.org/2011/the-citadel-lahore-fort/ |title=The Citadel (Lahore Fort) |year=2011 |website= |publisher=Islamics Arts and Architecture |accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hall was site of elaborate pageantry, with processions of up to one hour long occurring before each audience session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latif|first1=Syad Muhammad|title=Lahore: Its History, Architectural Remains and Antiquities: With an Account of Its Modern Institutions, Inhabitants, Their Trade, Customs, &amp;c|date=1892|publisher=Oxford University|location=New Imperial Press (London)|pages=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Khwabgah of Shah Jahan====
Khwabgah was the bedroom of Shah Jahan. It was built by Shah Jahan under the supervision of Wazir Khan in 1634 during his first visit to the city.&lt;ref name="Lahore"/&gt; Five sleeping chambers are aligned in a single row. The chambers feature carved marble screens, and are decorated with inlaid white marble and frescoes, It is the first building built by Shah Jahan in the fort. At present its decorations have vanished except for a trace of the marble which once might have beautified the façade.&lt;ref name="LFF"/&gt;

===Jahangir's Quadrangle===
Jahangir's Quadrangle occupies the northeastern corner of the fort. Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began during the reign of Akbar, but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir.&lt;ref name="Ruggles"/&gt; Akbar's syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as it employs column brackets carved in the form of animals. The quadrangle's layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a Persian [[paradise garden]], and instead is formed by concentric rectangles with a fountain in its centre.&lt;ref name="Ruggles"/&gt;

====Diwan-i-Aam====
[[File:House of people.jpg|thumb|upright|The current Diwan-i-Aam is a reconstruction undertaken during the British era.]]
The Diwan-i-Aam was built by [[Shah Jahan]] in 1628 in a prominent part of the fort immediately south of Jahangir's Quadrangle. It was built style of a ''Chehel Sotoun'' - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall,&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt;  in a style similar to the Diwan-i-Aam at the [[Agra Fort]]. The Diwan-i-Aam was used a hall for the emperors to hold audience with commoners.

Shah Jahan's Diwan-i-Aam was destroyed in 1841 when the son of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]], [[Sher Singh]] bombarded the fort in his fight against Maharani [[Chand Kaur]], the wife of Mahraja [[Kharak Singh]]. The current structure was built by the British in the 1849 after their victory against the Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Lahore"/&gt;

====Kharak Singh Haveli====
Kharak Singh Haveli was the ''haveli'' of Kharak Singh, the heir to Ranjit Singh. It lies in the south-east of the Jahangir's Quadrangle. It was later occupied by the British where the first and the ground floor were used as a Commandant's Quarters and godown and servants house respectively. Currently it houses the archaeological survey office.&lt;ref name="LFF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lahore Fort|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~rnoor/lahore_fort.html|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Khwabgah of Jahangir====
The Jahangir Quadrangle is bordered on its northern edge by Jahangir's sleeping chambers, the ''Bari Khwabgah'', which was largely reconstructed during the British era.

====Sehdari pavilion====
[[File:Lahore Fort - 1.JPG|thumbnail|The Sikh-era ''Sehdari'', or "Three-doored pavilion" served as an office for Faqir Syed Noor-ud-din, a trusted Governor of [[Ranjit Singh]].]]
The Sikh-era ''Sehdari'' pavilion, or "Three-doored" pavilion, is located to the east of the ''Bari Khwabgah''. A second ''Sehdari'' pavilion was located to the west of the ''Bari Khwabgah'', but was subsequently destroyed during the British period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dar|first1=Nadeem|title=Jahangir’s quadrangle through the centuries|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/11/21/jahangirs-quadrangle-through-the-centuries/|accessdate=2 January 2017|publisher=Pakistan Today|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving pavilion was used as an office for Faqir Syed Noor-ud-din, a trusted Governor of Ranjit Singh. The architectural style of the ''Sehdari'' pavilion is typical of the Sikh period. Frescoes decorating the pavilion portray floral designs, birds, and Hindu religious themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects by WCLA|url=http://www.itdhub.net/wcla/?page_id=2448|publisher=Walled City of Lahore Authority|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maktab Khana===
The Maktab Khana ("Clerk's Quarters") originally known as ''Dawlat Khana-e-Jahangir'', was constructed in 1617 under the supervision of Mamur Khan during the reign of Jahangir as a set of cloisters near the Moti Masjid.&lt;ref name="AMI"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asher|first1=Catherine|title=Architecture of Mughal India, Part 1, Volume 4|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521267281|pages=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by Khawaja Jahan Muhammad Dost, it was used as passage to the Audience Hall from the palace buildings to the north.&lt;ref name="AMI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lahore"/&gt; Clerks in the Maktab Khana would also record the entry of guests into the fort. It features [[iwan]]s in the Persian-Timurid style in each of its four sides. Each iwan is flanked by arches.

=== Moti Masjid ===
{{main article|Moti Masjid (Lahore Fort)}}
[[File:Moti Masjid lahore fort.jpg|thumbnail|Lahore's Moti Masjid is earliest of three Mughal "Pearl Mosques." The two others are [[Moti Masjid (Agra Fort)|the one in Agra]] and [[Moti Masjid (Red Fort)|the other in Delhi]].]]
The [[Moti Masjid (Lahore Fort)|Moti Masjid]] ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|موتی مسجد}}}}), one of the "Pearl Mosques", is a [[mosque]]  dating from the Shah Jahan Period that is located on the western side of Lahore Fort, closer to Alamgiri Gate. It is situated in the northwestern corner of ''Dewan-e-Aam''. The white marble structure is among his prominent extensions (such as [[Sheesh Mahal (Lahore)|Sheesh Mahal]] and [[Naulakha pavilion]]) to the Lahore Fort Complex.&lt;ref&gt;Nadiem (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moti'' in [[Urdu|Urdu language]] means ''[[pearl]]'', which designates a perceived preciousness to the religious structure. It was an established practice among [[List of Mughal emperors|Mughal emperors]] to name the mosques after [[wikt:generic|generic]] names for [[gemstones]].&lt;ref&gt;Koch 1991, p. 121-22&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque, built between 1630–35,&lt;ref name="nath422"&gt;Nath (1982), p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; has three superimposed domes, two aisles of five bays, and a slightly raised central ''[[pishtaq]]'', or [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] with a [[rectangular]] frame.&lt;ref&gt;Koch (1991), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; This five-arched [[facade]] distinguishes it from other mosques of the similar class with three-arched facades. The interior is simple and plain with the exception of ceilings that are decorated and designed in four different orders, two arcuate, and two trabeated.&lt;ref&gt;Nath (1982), p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;

After the demise of the [[Mughal Empire]], the mosque was converted into a [[Sikh temple]] and renamed ''Moti Mandir'' during the period of the Sikh rule under Ranjit Singh's [[Sikh Confederacy]].&lt;ref name="Historical mosques of Lahore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/01/03/comment/historical-mosques-of-lahore/|title=Historical mosques of Lahore|publisher=Pakistan Today|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later used the building for the [[State (polity)|state]] [[treasury]].

=== Gates ===
[[File:Akbari-Gate-Lahore-Fort.jpg|thumbnail|Akbari Gate]]

====Akbari Gate====
Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] built two gates. Akbari Gate was built in 1566 and now called Maseeti Gate.

====Alamgiri Gate====
Located at the western end of the fort, the Alamgiri Gate is the entrance of the Lahore Fort. It was built by Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in 1674.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mohammad Abdulhai Qureshi|title=Muslim Rule in Spain, Muslim Rule in India, Memories of Two Failures|publisher=Author House|isbn=9781456776152|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two semi-circular bastions where lotus petal design adorns its base.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient India by Daud Ali, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; It opens to the [[Hazuri Bagh]] and faces the [[Badshahi Mosque]]. The gate is one of Lahore's most iconic monuments, and once featured on Pakistani currency.

=== Naag Temple ===
The Naag temple is a Sikh temple built by [[Chand Kaur]], the wife of [[Kharak Singh]], daughter in law of the then ruling Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]]. The temple is square in plan and built on a raised platform. Its exterior walls are covered with fresco paintings. The temple also has a water-melon shaped dome. The site is currently closed to the public in order to prevent further deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lahore Fort's Naag Temple – a no-go area for public|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/657902/lahore-forts-naag-temple-a-no-go-area-for-public|publisher=Dawn|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mai Jindan Haveli===
''Mai Jindan Haveli'' is of unknown origins and believed to be a Mughal structure but attributed to the Mai Jindan, Chand Kaur because of the extensive additions by the Sikhs. It is a two storied building where she is alleged to have been murdered. Presently this building is site of the Sikh Gallery Museum.&lt;ref name="LFF"/&gt;

== Conservation ==
In 1980, Government of Pakistan nominated the fort for inclusion in [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] based on the criteria i, ii, and iii together with the [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore|Shalimar]].&lt;ref name="Unesco"&gt;{{cite web|title=International council on monuments and sites|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/171.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth meeting session held in [[Sydney]] in October 1981, the World Heritage Site committee added both the monuments to the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage Committee Fifth session|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom81.htm#171|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Pakistan sent a letter to the organization to include both the sites in List of World Heritage in Danger and sought help to restore the damaged part of the outer walls and hydraulic works of Shalamar Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage Committee Twenty Fourth session|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom00.htm#shalamar|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee Decisions|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/2422|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2006, it was reported that officials had urged [[UNESCO]] to remove the name of the fort from the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of extensive restoration work funded by [[Norway]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unesco urged to delist Lahore Fort|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/186988/unesco-urged-to-delist-lahore-fort|publisher=Dawn|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration projects included works at the Sheesh Mahal, Alamgiri Gate, and Hazuri Bagh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/08/16/nat23.htm Cultural week opens at Fort]. ''Dawn''. 16 August 2006. Retrieved 22 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; After years of extensive renovation and restoration work, the fort and Shalimar Gardens were removed from the endangered list in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishment of the World Heritage List in Danger (Removed Properties)|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/4839|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shalimar Garden, Lahore Fort not in danger anymore|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/06/29/city/lahore/shalimar-garden-lahore-fort-not-in-danger-anymore/|publisher=Pakistan Today|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in 1990, UNESCO had ordered the Punjab Archaeological Department to bar the use of the Fort for state or private functions on account of historical significance, a wedding reception was held in violation on December 23, 2010. The Antiquities Act of 1975, which prohibits the use of historical places to protect them from damage, was violated in the following month by hosting a dinner in the Diwan-i-Khas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another function at Lahore Fort in violation of rules|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/601831/another-function-at-lahore-fort-in-violation-of-rules|publisher=Dawn|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation works at the Picture Wall began in 2015 by the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] and [[Walled City of Lahore Authority]]. Documentation of the wall using [[3D scanner]] was completed in July 2016,&lt;ref name="thenews.com.pk"/&gt; after which conservation work would start.&lt;ref name="nation.com.pk"/&gt;

In constitutional usage in [[Commonwealth realms]] and in some other systems, a '''ministry''' (usually preceded by the [[definite article]], i.e., '''the ministry''') is a collective body of [[government]] [[minister (government)|minister]]s headed by a [[prime minister]] or [[premier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Wiktionary-inline|ministry}}: &amp;nbsp;"The complete body of government ministers (whether or not they are in cabinet) under the leadership of a head of government (such as a prime minister)"&lt;/ref&gt; and also referred to as the [[head of government]]. It is described by the [[Oxford Dictionary]] as "a period of government under one prime minister".&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|Ministry|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "[[cabinet (government)|cabinet]]" can in some circumstances be a synonym, a ministry can be a broader concept which might include office-holders who do not participate in cabinet meetings. Other titles can include "administration" (in the United States) or "government" (in common usage among most parliamentary systems) to describe similar collectives.

The term is primarily used to describe the successive governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which share a common [[Westminster model|parliamentary]] political heritage.&lt;ref name="DDs23"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Dods Parliamentary Companion]] | publisher=Dod's Parliamentary Companion Ltd | year=1919 | page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, a new ministry begins after each election, regardless of whether the prime minister is re-elected, and whether there may have been a minor rearrangement of the ministry. For example, after winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] (as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]) formed the [[first Thatcher ministry]]. After being re-elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], she formed the [[second Thatcher ministry]], and so on. In Canada, a new ministry is only formed if the government loses an election.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Despite the use of the term "ministry" in this sense being rare in Portugal nowadays, until the first half of the 20th century, the term  was frequently used in this country to designate the collective body of government ministers. From 1911 to 1933, the official title of the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] was even that of "President of the Ministry" ({{lang-pt|Presidente do Ministério}}), reflecting his role as the head of the collective ministry.

A '''musician''' is a person who plays a [[musical instrument]] or is musically talented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musician|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/musician?q=musician|publisher=Oxford Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music is referred to as a musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musician|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/musician|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; A musician who plays a musical instrument is also known as an '''instrumentalist'''.

Musicians can specialize in any musical style, and some musicians play in a variety of different styles depending on cultures and background. Examples of a musician's possible skills include performing, conducting, singing, [[rapping]], producing, [[Musical composition|composing]], [[arranging]], and the [[orchestration]] of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Musician|url=http://www.aboutmusicschools.com/resources/musicianstypes/|publisher=About MusicSchools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Medieval music}}

In the [[Middle Ages]], instrumental musicians performed with soft [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] inside and [[Loudness|loud]] instruments outdoors. Many European musicians of this time catered to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and they provided arrangements structured around [[Gregorian chant]] structure and [[Mass (music)|Masses]] from church texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IB Music Technology II Study Guide|url=http://www.salem.k12.va.us/shs/band/IBIIStudyGuide.pdf|publisher=IBO- International Bacccalaureate International}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance]] musicians produced music that could be played during masses in churches and important chapels. Vocal pieces were in [[Latin]]—the language of church texts of the time—and typically were [[Polyphonic|Church-polyphonic]] or "made up of several simultaneous [[Melody|melodies]]." By the end of the 16th century, however, [[patronage]] split among many areas: the [[Catholic Church]], [[Protestant]] churches, royal courts, wealthy amateurs, and music printing—all provided income sources for composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music in the Renaissance|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/renm/hd_renm.htm|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Baroque music}}

The [[Baroque period]] (about 1600 to 1750) introduced heavy use of [[counterpoint]] and [[basso continuo]] characteristics. Vocal and instrumental "color" became more important compared with the [[Renaissance]] style of music, and emphasized much of the volume, texture and pace of each piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Baroque Era|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/15413/history/history-bar.htm|publisher=Oracle Education Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428223512/http://library.thinkquest.org/15413/history/history-bar.htm|archivedate=28 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Classical music}}

Classical music was created by musicians who lived during a time of a rising middle class. Many middle-class inhabitants of France at the time lived under long-time [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]]. Because of this, much of the music was performed in environments that were more constrained compared with the flourishing times of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque era]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit IV 1750–1914|url=http://www.historyhaven.com/APWH/unit%204/UNIT%20IV%20NOTES.htm|publisher=West Forsyth HS History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Romantic music}}
The foundation of Romantic period music coincides with what is often called the ''age of revolutions'', an age of upheavals in political, economic, [[Society|social]], and military traditions. This age included the initial transformations of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. A revolutionary energy was also at the core of [[Romanticism]], which quite consciously set out to transform not only the theory and practice of poetry and art, but the common perception of the world. Some major Romantic Period precepts survive, and still affect modern culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romanticism|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/rom.html|publisher=Brooklyn College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable musicians===

* [[Franz Schubert]]

* [[Franz Liszt]]
* [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]]
* [[Richard Wagner]]
* [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]

{{Further|20th-century music}}
The world transitioned from 19th-century [[Romanticism]] to 20th century [[Modernism]], bringing major musical changes. In 20th-century music, composers and musicians rejected the emotion-dominated [[Romantic period]], and strove to represent the world the way they perceived it. Musicians wrote to be "...objective, while objects existed on their own terms. While past eras concentrated on [[spirituality]], this new period placed emphasis on physicality and things that were concrete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 20th Century|url=http://www.fasindy.org/education/twentieth/#axzz1qqVXde5F|publisher=Fine Arts Society Radio|access-date=2 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033148/http://www.fasindy.org/education/twentieth/#axzz1qqVXde5F|archive-date=11 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio recording]] and mass media in the 20th century caused a boom of all kinds of music—pop, [[electronic music|electronic]], dance, rock, [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]] and all forms of classical music.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, Tim "The Triumph of Music; The Rise of Composers, Musicians and Their Art" [[Harvard University]] Press 2008,  {{ISBN|9780674057098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">The '''Navya-Nyāya''' or '''Neo-Logical''' ''[[Darshana|darśana]]'' (view, system, or school) of [[Indian logic]] and [[Indian philosophy]] was founded in the 13th century [[Common Era|CE]] by the philosopher [[Gangesha Upadhyaya|Gangeśa Upādhyāya]] of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] and continued by [[Raghunatha Siromani]].  It was a development of the classical [[Nyāya]] ''darśana''. Other influences on Navya-Nyāya were the work of earlier philosophers [[Vācaspati Miśra]] (900&amp;ndash;980 CE) and [[Udayana]] (late 10th century). It remained active in India through to the 18th century.

Gangeśa's book ''[[Tattvacintāmaṇi]]'' ("Thought-Jewel of Reality") was written partly in response to [[Śrīharśa]]'s ''Khandanakhandakhādya'', a defence of [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedānta]], which had offered a set of thorough criticisms of Nyāya theories of thought and language.  In his book, Gangeśa both addressed some of those criticisms and &amp;ndash; more important &amp;ndash; critically examined the Nyāya ''darśana'' himself.  He held that, while Śrīharśa had failed to successfully challenge the Nyāya realist [[ontology]], his and Gangeśa's own criticisms brought out a need to improve and refine the logical and linguistic tools of Nyāya thought, to make them more rigorous and precise.

''Tattvacintāmani'' dealt with all the important aspects of Indian philosophy, [[logic]], [[set theory]], and especially [[epistemology]], which Gangeśa examined rigorously, developing and improving the Nyāya scheme, and offering examples.  The results, especially his analysis of [[cognition]], were taken up and used by other ''darśanas''.

Navya-Nyāya developed a sophisticated language and conceptual scheme that allowed it to raise, analyse, and solve problems in logic and epistemology. It systematised all the Nyāya concepts into four main categories (sense-)perception (''pratyakşa''), inference (''anumāna''), comparison or similarity (''upamāna''), and testimony (sound or word; ''[[śabda]]'').

'''Nigel Barley''' (born 1947 in [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[England]]) is an [[anthropologist]] famous for the books he has written on his experiences. His reputation was established with his first book, ''The Innocent Anthropologist'' (1983), a witty account of anthropological field work in [[Cameroon]]. After working in Africa and writing more books about his time there, he moved to [[Indonesia]], where he wrote in a variety of genres: travel, art, historical biography, and fiction. His first book there, the humorous ''Not a Hazardous Sport'' (1989), described his anthropological experiences in [[Tana Toraja Regency|Tana Toraja]].

==Biography==
[[File:Wake Preparation.JPG|thumb|Barley spent some years living in [[Tana Toraja Regency|Tana Toraja]], [[Sulawesi]] and studying the local customs.]]

Barley studied modern languages at [[Cambridge University]] and completed a [[doctorate]] in [[social anthropology]] at [[Oxford University]]. He held a number of academic positions before joining the [[British Museum]] as an assistant keeper in the Department of [[Ethnography]], where he remained until 2003.

Barley's first book, ''The Innocent Anthropologist'' (1983), was a witty and informative account of anthropological field work among the [[Dowayo language|Dowayo]] people of [[Cameroon]]. The anthropologist Tony Waters calls it a memorably written story, and writes that it is the book he gets students to read for an understanding of "field work, ethnography, and cultural anthropology."&lt;ref name=Waters&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waters|first1=Tony|title=Why Does Anthropology Worry about Jared Diamond when they have Nigel Barley?|url=http://www.ethnography.com/2013/01/why-does-anthropology-worry-about-jared-diamond-when-they-have-nigel-barley/|website=Ethnography.com|accessdate=22 December 2014|date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waters says he truly admires the book as it gives a realistic idea of field experience, but "Oddly, I find few anthropologists who have read it, much less heard of it."&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;

This was followed by other books about [[Africa]] including ''A Plague of Caterpillars'' (1986) and ''Ceremony'' (1987).

Barley then spent some years in [[Indonesia]], branching out into other genres: travel, art, historical biography, and fiction. His first book based on his time there was the humorous ''Not a Hazardous Sport'' (1989) describing his experiences in [[Tana Toraja Regency|Tana Toraja]] in the mountains of [[Sulawesi]], the non-sport in question again being anthropology.

Barley has been twice nominated for the [[Travelex Group|Travelex]] Writer of the Year Award. In 2002, he won the [[Foreign Press Association]] prize for [[travel writing]].

'''''Ninety from the Nineties: A Decade of Printing''''' was an exhibition held at the [[New York Public Library]] from November 7, 2003 through May 28, 2004.

''Ninety from the Nineties'' showcased a selection of ninety books made in the 1990s that were chosen on the merit of book arts. Note that the books were not necessarily written in the 1990s; some were older texts that were used to make special books in the 1990s. And, the books were not selected on literary merit.

In a contemporary review, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the concept of the selection like this: "books, which we are accustomed to thinking of as containers — and conveyers — of information, are placed in a context in which form is valued over content. Language is less important than the type that impresses it on the page. The paper counts for more than the story told on it. The illustrations and the binding might be the story."

The books were divided into five categories: [[Bookbinding|binding]], paper, [[typography|type]], [[illustration]] and "inspiration." The exhibition was curated by Virginia Bartow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3851">The '''Paleo-Arctic Tradition''' is the name given by [[archaeology|archaeologists]] to the cultural tradition of the earliest well-documented human occupants of the [[North America]]n [[Arctic]], which date from the period 8000&amp;ndash;5000 BC. The tradition covers Alaska and expands far into the east, west, and the Southwest [[Yukon Territory]].

The [[Upward Sun River site]], a [[Late Pleistocene]] archaeological site associated with the Paleo-Arctic Tradition, located in the [[Tanana Valley]], Alaska has now been dated to around 11,500 [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potter|first1=Ben A.|last2=Irish|first2=Joel|title=New insights into Eastern Beringian mortuary behavior: A terminal Pleistocene double infant burial at Upward Sun River|journal=[[PNAS]]|date=December 2, 2014|volume=111|issue=48|pages=17060–17065|bibcode=2014PNAS..11117060P|doi=10.1073/pnas.1413131111|pmc=4260572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upward Sun River is the site of the oldest human remains discovered on the American side of [[Beringia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horne|first1=Naomi|title=Ancient Alaska infants’ DNA supports human migration theory|url=http://news.uaf.edu/upward_sun_river_dna/|publisher=[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]|accessdate=30 October 2015|date=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 8000 BC, [[Alaska]] was still connected to [[Siberia]] with the [[Bering land bridge|landbridge]], located in the current [[Bering Strait]]. People who inhabited this region in Alaska were of the [[Dyuktai culture|Dyuktai]] tradition, originally located in Siberia. Eventually, the Dyuktai changed into the [[Sumnagin]] culture, a hunting/fishing group, whose culture was defined by possessing a new technology. Other cultures flourished as well, all being placed under the general category of the Paleo-Arctic tradition. 

:"The Paleo-Arctic tradition is still a shadowy entity, a patchwork of local Early [[Holocene]] cultural traditions that flourished over an enormous area of extreme northwestern North America for at least 4000 years, and longer in many places. Other terms such as the Northwest Microblade tradition, Denali Complex, and Beringian tradition have been used to describe these same general adaptations, but Paleo-Arctic is the most appropriate because it is the kind of general label that reflects a great variety of different human adaptations during a period of increasing environmental diversity and change" (Fagan, p.173). 

The Paleo-Arctic is mostly known for [[Stone tool|lithic]] remains (stone technology). Some artifacts found include [[Microblade technology|microblade]]s, small wedge-shaped cores, some  leaf-shaped [[Hand axe |bifaces]], [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s, and [[graving tool]]s. The microblades were used as hunting weapons and were mounted in wood, antler, or bone points.  Paleo-Arctic stone specialists also created bifaces that were used as tools and as cores for the production of large artifact blanks.  Little evidence remains of the culture's settlement patterns, because many of the settlements were inundated by the rising sea levels of the [[Holocene]]; however, remains of stone tools were discovered, giving indirect evidence of settlement sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6243">'''Performance Writing''' was pioneered at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in [[Devon|Devon, UK]] as a radical new approach to writing. It is a multi-modal approach which explores through artistic practice how [[writing]] interacts with other art forms and practices — [[visual art]], [[sound art]], [[video art|time-based media]], [[installation art|installation]], [[electronic literature]], [[Artist's book|bookworks]], and [[performance art]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Performance-Writing/446221925633?v=info&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Performance Writing was inaugurated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] undergraduate course at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in 1994. The course was written, and the field developed, by a number of self-described Performance Writers and academics including John Hall, Ric Allsopp, [[Caroline Bergvall]], Aaron Williamson, Brigid Mc Leer, Alaric Sumner, [[Redell Olsen]], [[cris cheek]], Peter Jager, Barbara Bridger, Melanie Thompson, Jerome Fletcher, and many others, and enriched by an program of visiting artists from around the world.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen"&gt;John Hall, ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing: a Lecture'', Plymouth, UK: Plymouth College of Art Press, 2007. (A more extensive list of performance writers is given on p.35.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the merger of DCA and [[University College Falmouth]] ( now [[Falmouth University]] in 2010, the undergraduate Performance Writing course was relocated to a new performance centre at Tremough Campus (now [[Penryn Campus]]) near [[Penryn, Cornwall]]. The course ceased taking applications for new students from 2010 onwards pending a reconfiguration of its Performance Writing courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013037/http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment has not resumed.

The [[Falmouth University]] post-graduate [[Master of Arts]] course in Performance Writing led by Associate Professor of Performance Writing Jerome Fletcher ran for two years at the [[Arnolfini]] in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/201/courses-7/postgraduate-courses-43/performance-writing-ma-1688.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment to the MA Performance Writing was ceased in 2012. Performance Writing continues at the postgraduate and research level at [[Falmouth University]].

The democratic, inclusive, and above all extensible nature of Performance Writing methodology has led to its adoption and adaptation by both independent and academic researchers, practitioners, pedagogs, and institutions in places as far flung as Oakland, California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jacket2.org/commentary/what-performance-writing|title= What is performance writing? |publisher=Jacket2|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Banff Centre]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banffcentre.ca//programs/program.aspx?id=1393|title=In(ter)ventions: Literary Practice at the Edge|publisher=The Banff Centre|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, Performance Writing methodologies and sensibilities have spread – primarily through graduates of the program at Dartington – into a rich diversity of artistic forms and institutional formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luckysoap.com/lapsuslinguae/2013/07/writing-on-writing-on-performance-writing/|title=Writing on Writing on Performance Writing |publisher=J. R. Carpenter|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of definition==
As an emerging field, its definition and limits are the subject of ongoing debate. John Hall's lecture ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing'', explores [[definition]] as a process, using playful and precise language to establish the complexity of reflexive descriptions: a performance of writing about writing as such.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen" /&gt;

At the symposium launching the field, Performance Writing was described by Caroline Bergvall as exploring "relationships between textual and text-based work when developed in conjunction with other media and discourses.", and opening "the investigation of formal and ideological strategies which writers and artists develop textually in response or in reaction to their own time and their own fields"&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote"&gt;Caroline Bergvall, [http://www.carolinebergvall.com/content/text/BERGVALL-KEYNOTE.pdf Keynote Paper for Performance Writing Symposium], Dartington, U.K. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

She also understood it as "not primarily [a] unified academic discipline [or] one delineated, hybridic artform", but rather as an "area of joint practical and critical investigation of the many uses writing and language are being put to and push themselves into."&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote" /&gt;

==Events==
Performance Writing events so far include two symposia; one at Dartington College of Arts in 1996 and a second at the Theatre School in Utrecht in 1999.

In May 2010 Bristol's [[Arnolfini]], in collaboration with University College Falmouth, held ''PW10'': a weekend of Performance Writing themed talks, readings, and artistic works exploring [[interdisciplinary]] approaches to language and [[textuality]]. It was timed to coincide with the exhibition ''Say: "Parsley"'' by Performance Writing co-founder [[Caroline Bergvall]] and Ciaran Maher. It included works by [[Allen Fisher]], [[Drew Milne]], [[David Prior (artist)]], [[Jason Nelson]], [[J.R. Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 Arnolfini Programme 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302211816/http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 |date=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 PW12 was held at [[Arnolfini]].

Powers]] in response to renowned ecologist Dr. [[Archie Carr]]'s award-winning book, ''[[The Windward Road]]'', which first alerted the world to the plight of [[sea turtle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The man who saved sea turtles: Archie Carr and the origins of conservation biology |last=Davis |first=Frederick Rowe |year=2007 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press US]] |isbn=978-0-19-531077-1 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Carr served as Scientific Director of STC from 1959 until his death in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American environmental leaders: from colonial times to the present |last=Becher |first=Anne |year=2000 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=978-1-57607-162-5 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, STC's research and conservation initiatives have been instrumental in saving the Caribbean [[green sea turtle]] from immediate extinction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biodiversity and the precautionary principle: risk and uncertainty in conservation and sustainable use |last=Dickson |first=Barney |author2=Rosie Cooney |year=2005 |publisher=[[Earthscan]] |isbn=978-1-84407-277-4 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as raising awareness and protection for sea turtles across the globe with 50 years of experience in national and international sea turtle conservation, research and educational endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The man who saved sea turtles: Archie Carr and the origins of conservation biology |last=Davis |first=Frederick Rowe |year=2007 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press US]] |isbn=978-0-19-531077-1 |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization began its work in [[Costa Rica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Policymaking for conservation in Latin America: national parks, reserves, and the environment |last=Hopkins |first=Jack W. |year=1995 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-275-95349-2 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has expanded its research and conservation efforts throughout [[Central America]] and the wider [[Caribbean]].

== Habitat Preservation &amp; Advocacy ==
STC works to enact protective laws and establish refuges for the preservation of sea turtle habitats and coastal environments. The organization was instrumental in creating the [[Tortuguero National Park]] in Costa Rica. In the United States, STC worked with other groups and agencies to establish the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge in Melbourne, Florida and continues to lobby Congress and government agencies to purchase the lands necessary to complete the refuge. STC's international efforts include advocating for sea turtles at the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, and protecting one of the most important sea turtle nesting beaches in the world by helping prevent off-shore oil-drilling in Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Costa Rica Says "No" to Offshore Oil Drilling |url=http://www.conserveturtles.org/velador.php?page=velart37 |website=conserveturtles |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tortuguero ==
STC continues the work of Dr. Archie Carr every year on the 35&amp;nbsp;km black sand beach of [[Tortuguero, Costa Rica|Tortuguero]], Costa Rica, the nesting site of more endangered green sea turtles than anywhere else in the Western Hemisphere. For more than 40 years, this monitoring program has provided much information on the reproductive ecology and migratory habits of sea turtles. Researchers, who are based at STC's John H. Phipps Biological Field Station, continue to monitor nesting trends, growth rates and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=STC Programs: Research: Tortuguero Sea Turtle Program |url=http://www.conserveturtles.org/costarica.php?page=researchprogram |website=conserveturtles |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://conserveturtles.org/wp-content/uploads/Tortuguero%20Green%20Turtle%20Report%201999.pdf |title=Report on the 1999 Green Turtle Program at Tortugero, Cosa Rica |publisher=Caribbean Conservation Corporation and the Ministry of Environment and Energy of Costa Rica |date=22 February 2000 |first1=Sebastian |last1=Troëng |first2=Jeff |last2=Mangel |first3=Sheleyla |last3=Kélez |first4=Andy, et al |last4=Meyers |pages=11, 21-23, 29, 32 |format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chiriquí Beach ==
In 2003, STC began working to protect and restore the once globally significant [[hawksbill sea turtle]] nesting population at [[Chiriquí Beach]], [[Panama]]. The program consists of intensive monitoring of hawksbill and [[leatherback sea turtle]] nesting activity, protection of nesting females and their nests, and public education in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=STC Programs: Research: Chiriquí Beach, Panama |url=http://www.conserveturtles.org/panama.php?page=chiriqui |website=conserveturtle |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Research ==
STC has supported hundreds of research projects on the biology and conservation of sea turtles around the world. Recent studies have focused on impacts of tourism on nesting beaches, the levels of turtle harvesting at feeding grounds, satellite tracking of turtles, and monitoring of juvenile turtles around Bermuda.

== Birds of Tortuguero ==
STC also supports a [[bird banding]] and monitoring project that was begun in Tortuguero in 1991 as part of the "Partners in Flight" program, in association with Costa Rican and North American ornithologists. Resident and neotropical migrant bird species are surveyed in natural and disturbed habitats of the area and vital statistics are collected. The project also seeks to train Latin American wildlife biologists in ornithological field techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Neotropical Birds of Tortuguero Research |url=http://www.conserveturtles.org/volunteer-research-programs.php?page=bird_res |website=conserveturtles |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and Training ==
STC works with coastal residents, businesses, conservationists and governments to increase awareness of the threats facing sea turtles, including coastal development, pollution, poaching and accidental capture in nets. STSL developed an educational program that uses the internet to allow school children and others around the world to learn about sea turtles as they follow the movements of turtles being tracked by satellite. More than 300,000 children around the world have been reached by this program already.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In Tortuguero, Costa Rica, CCC operates the H. Clay Frick Natural History Visitor Center to inform the more than 40,000 people who visit every year about the importance of the region's habitats to the survival of sea turtles, manatees and other tropical wildlife.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The STC is also a partner in a new environmental education center at the heart of Eastern Florida's Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge.

== Training ==
STC provides training in the management and stewardship of sea turtles and coastal ecosystems. Graduates of previous training programs now lead conservation efforts in over 25 countries around the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

'''Sheep shearing''' is the process by which the [[Wool|woollen fleece]] of a [[sheep]] is cut off. The person who removes the sheep's wool is called a ''[[Sheep shearer|shearer]]''. Typically each adult sheep is shorn once each year (a sheep may be said to have been "shorn" or "sheared", depending upon dialect). The annual shearing most often occurs in a [[shearing shed]], a facility especially designed to process often hundreds and sometimes more than 3,000 sheep per day.&lt;ref name="Land"&gt;
{{cite journal

Sheep are shorn in all seasons, depending on the climate, management requirements and the availability of a [[Wool classing|woolclasser]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/shearer|shearers]]. Ewes are normally shorn prior to lambing, but consideration is typically made as to the welfare of the lambs by not shearing during cold climate winters. Shorn sheep tolerate frosts well, but young sheep especially will suffer in cold, wet windy weather (even in cold climate summers). In this event they are shedded for several nights until the weather clears. Some sheep may also be shorn with stud combs which leave more wool on the animal, giving greater protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moule, G.R.|title=Handbook for Woolgrowers|year=1972|publisher=[[Australian Wool Board]]|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheep shearing is also considered a sport with competitions held around the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}
It is often done between spring and summers

==History==

===Bronze age Crete===
[[File:Flock Of Sheep In Omalos Plateau.jpg|thumb|Sheep in modern Crete]]
The wealth of ancient [[Knossos]], Europe's oldest city, derived from its sheep wool industry. The largest group of [[Linear B]] tablets is the great archive principally of shearing records though also of sheep breeding.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Killen, "The Wool Industry of Crete in the Late Bronze Age".

The [[medieval English wool trade]] was one of the most important factors in the English economy. The main sheep-shearing was an annual midsummer (June) event in medieval England culminating in the sheep-shearing feast.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} It had always been conventional practice to wash sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Preparing Wool for Market. pg 34, col 3,''The Scientific American'', Vol 1, No 3. published July 16, 1859.

;Australia's fine wools
In Australia, up until the 1870s, [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] washed their sheep in nearby creeks prior to shearing.&lt;ref name="Cleanwool"&gt;
{{cite encyclopedia

|id = Shearing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later some expensive hot water installations were constructed on some of the larger [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]] for the washing.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;Gilbert, Lionel, New England Readings, Armidale College of Advanced Education, Armidale, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Australian growers were influenced by the Spanish practice of washing their very fine wool after shearing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} There were three main reasons for the custom in Australia:{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

# The English manufacturers demanded that Australian woolgrowers provide their fleeces free from excessive vegetable matter, [[Burr (fruit)|burrs]], soil, etc. so they could be processed in the same way as any other raw wool
# The dirty fleeces were hard to shear and demanded that the metal blade shears be sharpened more often.
# Wool in Australia was carted by [[Ox-wagon|bullock team]] or horse teams and charged by weight. Washed wool was lighter and did not cost as much to transport.

The practice of washing the wool rather than the sheep evolved from the fact that hotter water could be used to wash the wool, than that used to wash the sheep. When the practice of selling wool in the grease occurred in the 1890s, wool washing became obsolete.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Australia and New Zealand had to discard the old methods of wool harvesting and evolve more efficient systems to cope with the huge numbers of sheep involved. Shearing was revolutionized by the invention of an Australian sheepgrower, [[Frederick York Wolseley]]. His machines made in Birmingham England by his business [[The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company]] were introduced after 1888, reducing second cuts and shearing time.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt; By 1915 most large [[sheep station]] sheds in Australia had installed machines, driven by steam or later by internal combustion engines.

Shearing tables were invented in the 1950s and have not proved popular, although some are still used for [[crutching]].

In the US, the worldwide shortage of shearers is becoming a consideration for those wanting to expand wool production.&lt;ref name="citsi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Changes in the Sheep Industry in the United States: Making the Transition from Tradition |author=Committee on the Economic Development and Current Status of the Sheep Industry in the United States, Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council |year=2008 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=0309134390 |page=286 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhXfZvQIRV8C |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With sheep numbers declining in that country the profession sees significantly less interest in becoming a qualified shearer.  Importing labour during the Australian off-season has also become problematic because of delays in obtaining work visa and because shearers numbers are limited worldwide.&lt;ref name="citsi"/&gt;

==Modern shearing==
[[Image:Rouseabout.jpg|thumb|upright|Shearer on a raised board and [[rouseabout]], [[Lismore, Victoria]]]]
[[Image:Shearing 08.JPG|thumb|Throwing a fleece onto a wool table.]]
Today large flocks of sheep are [[muster (livestock)|mustered]], inspected and possibly treated for parasites such as [[lice]] before shearing can start.&lt;ref name="sffmw"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sheep Farming for Meat and Wool |last=Court |first=Jane |author2=Sue Hides |author3=John Webb-Ware  |year=2010 |publisher=Csiro Publishing |isbn=064310206X |page=183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zhY-uUUQboC |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; then shorn by professional shearing teams working eight-hour days, most often in spring, by machine shearing. These contract-teams consist of shearers, shed hands and a cook (in the more isolated areas). Their working hours and wages are regulated by industry awards. A working day starts at 7:30 [[12-hour clock|am]] and the day is divided into four "runs" of two hours each. "Smoko" breaks are a half-hour each and a lunch break is taken at midday for one hour. Most shearers are paid on a piece-rate per sheep. Shearers who "tally" more than 200 sheep per day are known as "gun shearers". Typical mass shearing of sheep today follows a well-defined workflow: 
* remove the wool 
* throw the fleece onto the wool table 
* skirt, roll and class the fleece 
* place it in the appropriate wool bin 
* press and store the wool until it is transported. 
In 1984 Australia became the last country in the world to permit the use of wide combs, due to previous [[Australian Workers' Union]] rules. Although they were once rare in sheds, women now take a large part in the shearing industry by working as pressers, wool rollers, rouseabouts, [[wool classer]]s and shearers.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Peter, Pastoral Properties of Australia, George Allen &amp; Unwin, Sydney, London, Boston,1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wool removal===
A sheep is caught by the shearer, from the catching pen, and taken to his "stand" on the shearing board. It is shorn using a mechanical handpiece (see ''Shearing devices'' below). The wool is removed by following an efficient set of movements, devised by [[Godfrey Bowen]] in about 1950 (the ''Bowen Technique''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/bowen.html|title=The Bowen Technique|accessdate=26 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or the ''Tally-Hi'' method developed in 1963 and promoted by the Australian Wool Corporation. Sheep struggle less using the Tally-Hi method, reducing strain on the shearer and there is a saving of about 30 seconds in shearing each one.
[[Image:ShearersMoccasinsC2289.jpg|thumb|right|Shearers wear [[Moccasin (footwear)|moccasins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/sheep/10042.html |title=Sheep parasites |accessdate=10 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202084159/http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/sheep/10042.html |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to protect their feet, grip wooden floors well, and absorb sweat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}]]
The shearer begins by removing the belly wool, which is separated from the main fleece by a rouseabout, while the sheep is still being shorn. A professional or "gun" shearer typically removes a fleece, without significantly marking or cutting the sheep, in two to three minutes, depending on the size and condition of the sheep—less than two minutes in elite-competitive shearing. The shorn sheep is released and removed from the board via a chute in the floor or in a wall, to an exterior counting-out pen.

The [[CSIRO]] in Australia has developed a non-mechanical method of shearing sheep using an injected [[protein]] that creates a natural break in the wool fibres. After fitting a retaining net to enclose the wool, sheep are injected with the protein. When the net is removed after a week, the fleece has separated and is removed by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/news/mediarel/mr1998/mr98148.html|accessdate=26 August 2008|date=26 June 1998|publisher=CSIRO|author=Julian Cribb|title=CSIRO Media Release: REVOLUTIONARY WOOL HARVESTING TAKES OFF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some breeds a similar process occurs naturally

===Fleece skirting===
Once the entire fleece has been removed from the sheep, the fleece is ''thrown'', clean side down, on to a wool table by a shed hand (commonly known in New Zealand and Australian sheds as a ''[[rouseabout]]'' or ''rousie''). The wool table top consists of slats spaced approximately 12&amp;nbsp;cm apart. This enables short pieces of wool, the ''locks'' and other debris, to gather beneath the table separately from the fleece. The fleece is then ''skirted'' by one or more wool rollers to remove the sweat fribs and other less desirable parts of the fleece. The removed pieces largely consist of shorter, seeded, burry or dusty wool etc. which is still useful in the industry. As such they are placed in separate containers and sold along with fleece wool. Other items removed from the fleece on the table, such as faeces, skin fragments or twigs and leaves, are discarded a short distance from the wool table so as not to contaminate the wool and fleece.

Following the skirting of the fleece, it is folded, rolled and examined for its quality in a process known as [[wool classing]], which is performed by a registered and qualified wool classer. Based on its type, the fleece is placed into the relevant wool bin ready to be pressed (mechanically compressed) when there is sufficient wool to make a [[wool bale]].

===Rooing===
In some primitive sheep (for example in many [[Shetland sheep|Shetlands]]), there is a natural break in the growth of the wool in spring. By late spring this causes the fleece to begin to peel away from the body, and it may then be plucked by hand without cutting – this is known as ''rooing''. Individual sheep may reach this stage at slightly different times.

==Shearing devices==
[[Image:BladeShears.jpg|thumb|left|Blade shears]]
[[Image:BladeShearing.jpg|thumb|right|Blade shearing demonstration at the New York Sheep &amp; Wool Fair]]
Whatever device is used, shearers must be careful to keep it clean so as to prevent the spread of disease amongst a flock.&lt;ref name="ejwa"&gt;{{cite book |title=Extraordinary Jobs with Animals |last=Devantier |first=Alecia T. |author2=Carol A. Turkington   |year=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=1438111703 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6rvNNVPhKcC |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blade shearing has recently made a resurgence in Australia and the UK but mostly for sport rather than commercial shearing. Some competitions have attracted almost 30 competitors and there have even been shows created just for blade shearers to compete in.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170310001718/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-31/blade-shearing-renaissance/7802224 Australian Broadcasting Corp. News] accessed 10 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear left}}

===Blade shears===
{{main|Blade shearing}}
Blade shears consist of two blades arranged similarly to [[scissors]] except that the hinge is at the end farthest from the point (not in the middle). The cutting edges pass each other as the shearer squeezes them together and shear the wool close to the animal's skin. Blade shears are still used today but in a more limited way. Blade shears leave some wool on a sheep and this is more suitable for cold climates such as the Canterbury high country in the South Island of New Zealand where approximately half a million sheep are still shorn with blade shears each year. For those areas where no powered-machinery is available blade shears are the only option. In Australia blades are more commonly used to shear stud rams.

===Machine shears===
{{Main|The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company|Frederick Wolseley}}
Machine shears, known as handpieces, operate in a similar manner to human [[hair clipper]]s in that a power-driven toothed blade, known as a cutter, is driven back and forth over the surface of a comb and the wool is cut from the animal. The original machine shears were powered by a fixed hand-crank linked to the handpiece by a shaft with only two universal joints, which afforded a very limited range of motion. Later models have more joints to allow easier positioning of the handpiece on the animal. Electric motors on each stand have generally replaced overhead gear for driving the handpieces. The jointed arm is replaced in many instances with a [[flexible shaft]]. Smaller motors allowed the production of shears in which the motor is in the handpiece; these are generally not used by professional shearers as the weight of the motor and the heat generated by it becomes bothersome with long use.

==Animal welfare==
[[Animal welfare]] organizations have raised concerns about the abuse of sheep during shearing, and have advocated against the selling and buying of wool products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-10/peta-sheep-campaign/5587216|title=Welfare group targets abuse in Australian shearing sheds
|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an anonymous shearer reported instances of animal abuse by workers, an allegation to which an Australian Worker's Union representative added that he had witnessed "shearers gouge eyes and break sheep jaws."&lt;ref name="unionconcerns"&gt;Kath Sullivan,"[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-17/union-concerns-for-sheep-welfare/5028816 Union concerned about shearers mistreating sheep]," ABC Rural, 17 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Wool Innovation insisted that animal welfare was a priority among shearers.&lt;ref name="unionconcerns"/&gt; The following year, the [[RSPCA]] began a cruelty investigation following the release of video footage that [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] said was taken in more than a dozen shearing sheds in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. ''The Guardian'' reported that the video showed, "sheep being roughly handled, punched in the face and stamped upon. One sheep was beaten with a hammer while another was shown having a deep cut crudely sewn up."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Millman, "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/sheep-cruelty-video-sparks-rspca-investigation Sheep cruelty video sparks RSPCA investigation,]" ''The Guardian'' 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Shearing Contractors Association of Australia "applauded" the investigation, and Wool Producers Australia president Geoff Fisken said the behavior shown in the video was "unacceptable and unsupportable" but that "we're sure it doesn't portray the 99.9% majority of wool shearers – and those shearers would be appalled by it as well".&lt;ref&gt;Colin Bettles, "[http://www.farmonline.com.au/news/agriculture/sheep/general-news/shearers-back-peta-no-excuse-for-cruelty/2704965.aspx?storypage=0 Shearers back PETA: no excuse for cruelty]," FARMONLINE, 11 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shearing in culture==
A culture has evolved out of the practice of sheep shearing, especially in post-colonial Australia and New Zealand. The sheep-shearing feast is the setting for Act IV of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Winter's Tale]]''. [[Thomas Tusser]] provides doggerel verse for the occasion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wife make us a dinner, spare flesh neither corne,&lt;br&gt;
Make wafers and cakes, for our sheepe must be shorne,&lt;br&gt;
At sheep shearing neighbors none other thing craue,&lt;br&gt;
but good cheer and welcome, like neighbors to haue"&lt;ref&gt;Tusser, '' Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry'', 1557.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In Australia===
[[Image:Tom Roberts - Shearing the rams - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Shearing the Rams]]'' by [[Tom Roberts]], 1890]]
''[[Shearing the Rams]]'', a painting by Australian painter [[Tom Roberts]] is like an [[icon]] for the livestock-growing culture or "life on the land" in Australia. It was parodied in [[Michael Leunig]]'s ''Ramming the Shears''. The expression that Australia's wealth rode on ''the sheep's back'' in parts of the twentieth century no longer has the currency it once had.

In 2001, Mandy Francis of [[Hardy's Bay, New South Wales|Hardy's Bay]], Australia, constructed a blackbutt seat for the Street Furniture Project at [[Walcha, New South Wales|Walcha]], NSW, Australia. This seat was inspired by the combs, cutters, wool tables and grating associated with the craft and industry of shearing.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Holiday Ideas – Relax at Walcha'', Vol. 4, May 2009, The Land, Rural Press, North Richmond, NSW&lt;/ref&gt;

During Australia's long weekend in June 2010, 111 machine shearers and 78 blade shearers shore 6,000 Merino ewes and 178 rams at the historic 72 stand ''North Tuppal'' station. Along with the shearers there were 107 wool handlers and penners-up and more than 10,000 visitors to witness this event in the restored shed. Over this weekend the scene in Tom Robert's ''Shearing of the Rams'' was twice re-enacted for the visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sim |first1=Terry |last2=Hough |first2=Cassie |work=The Land |date=10 June 2010 |title=Shear spectacular sparks pilgrimage |pages=16–19 |publisher=Rural Press |location=North Richmond, NSW }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stations across Australia no longer carry sheep due to lower wool prices, drought and other disasters, but their [[shearing shed]]s remain, in a wide variety of materials and styles, and have been the subject of books and documentation for heritage authorities. Some farmers are reluctant to remove either the equipment or the sheds, and many unused sheds remain intact.

===Contests===
Sheep shearing and wool handling competitions are held regularly in parts of the world, particularly Ireland, the UK, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/03/06/1864115.htm|title=Shearer sets records|date=6 March 2007|accessdate=26 August 2008|publisher=ABC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sheep shearing is an arduous task, speed shearers, for all types of equipment and sheep, are usually very fit and well trained. In [[Wales]] a sheep shearing contest is one of the events of the [[Royal Welsh Show]], the country's premier agricultural show held near [[Builth Wells]].

The world's largest sheep shearing and wool handling contest, the [[Golden Shears]], is held in the Wairarapa district, New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenshears.co.nz/ Golden Shears 2009] Retrieved on 2009-6-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The shearing World Championships are hosted by different countries every 2–3 years and eight different countries have hosted the event. The first World Championships were held at the Bath &amp; West showground, England, in 1977, and the first Machine-Shearing winner was Roger Cox from New Zealand. Other countries that have hosted the sheep shearing World Championships have been New Zealand (3 times), England (3 times), Australia (2 times), Wales, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa &amp; Norway. Out of 13 World Championships, New Zealand have won the team Machine contest 10 times, and famous New Zealand sheep-shearer [[David Fagan]] has been World Champion a record 5 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/shearing/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500910&amp;objectid=10444471&amp;pnum=0 |title=Star Profile: David Fagan – Shearing – NZ Herald News |first= Chris |last= Rattue |work=The New Zealand Herald |year=2011 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2008 the event was hosted in Norway. It was the first time ever that the event was hosted by a non-English speaking country. The newly crowned World Machine Shearing champion is Paul Avery from New Zealand. New Zealand also won the team event, and the traditional blade-shears World Champion is Ziewilelle Hans from South Africa. A record 29 countries competed at the 2008 event. The next World Championship will be held at the Royal Welsh Show, Llanelwedd, Wales in July, 2010.  {{asof|2010}}

A '''stone row''' (or '''stone alignment'''), is a linear arrangement of upright, parallel [[megalith]]ic [[standing stone]]s set at intervals along a common axis or series of axes, usually dating from the later [[Neolithic]] or [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Power (1997), p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Rows may be individual or grouped, and three or more stones aligned can constitute a stone row.

==Description==
[[File:Alignement Kerlescan Carnac.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the Kerlescan alignment in Carnac (Brittany, France)]]
Stone rows can be few metres or several kilometres in length and made from stones that can be as tall as 2m, although 1m high stones are more common. The terminals of many rows have the largest stones and other [[megalithic]] features are sometimes sited at the ends, especially burial [[cairn]]s. The stones are placed at intervals and may vary in height along the sequence, to provide a graduated appearance, though it is not known whether this was done deliberately. Stone rows  were erected by the later [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] peoples in the British Isles, parts of [[Scandinavia]] and northern France. 

The most famous example is the [[Carnac stones]], a complex of stone rows around [[Carnac]] in [[Brittany]]. There are a number of examples on [[Dartmoor]] including the row at [[Stalldown Barrow|Stall Down]] and three rows at [[Drizzlecombe]] and the [[Hill O Many Stanes]] in [[Caithness]]. In Britain they are exclusively found in isolated moorland areas.  The term alignment is sometimes taken to imply that the rows were placed purposely in relation to other factors such as other monuments or topographical or astronomical features. Archaeologists treat stone rows as discrete features however and alignment refers to the stones being lined up with one another rather than anything else. Their purpose is thought to be religious or ceremonial perhaps marking a processual route. Another theory is that each generation would erect a new stone to contribute to a sequence that demonstrated a people's continual presence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5361">[[File:Wide World Magazine.JPG|thumb|''The Wide World Magazine'' - half-yearly volume edition]]
'''''The Wide World Magazine''''' was a British monthly illustrated publication which ran from April 1898 to December 1965.&lt;ref name="collecting"&gt;[http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/wide.html ''The Wide World Magazine''] (collectingbooksandmagazines.com).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--It was resurrected (the same title was registered with Companies House) in 2009 as ''WideWorld'', an online publication headquartered in England and devoted to outdoor sport, adventure and offbeat travel.&lt;ref name="online"&gt;[http://www.wideworldmag.co.uk/ ''WideWorld magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|talk page|date=August 2010}}--&gt;

The magazine was founded by well-known publisher [[George Newnes]], also famous for ''[[Tit-Bits]]'', ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' and others. It described itself as "an illustrated magazine of true narrative" and each month purported to feature "true-life" adventure and travel stories gathered from around the world. Its motto was "Truth is stranger than fiction".&lt;ref name="collecting" /&gt;

In August 1898, it published the first in a number of installments of "The Adventures of [[Louis de Rougemont]]", billed as "the most amazing story a man ever lived to tell", and claiming to be an account of a man who had spent thirty years in the outback of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The adventures of Louis de Rougemont'' (stories from ''[https://archive.org/details/wideworldmagazin03londuoft ''Wide World Magazine'', volume 3]'', May 1899 &amp; June 1899 , pp. 3-15 and pp. 115-131).&lt;/ref&gt; The story caused a sensation, but was exposed as a hoax by the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'', to the embarrassment of the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;John Arnold, Sally Batten. ''The bibliography of Australian literature, Volume 2  '' p259-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some famous names occasionally wrote for the magazine (such as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Henry Morton Stanley]], [[Douglas Reeman]] etc.), and it was copiously illustrated with photographs, as well as black and white drawings by such artists as [[Terence Cuneo]], Cecil Stuart Tresilian, Alfred Pearse, Chas Sheldon, Paul Hardy, [[William Barnes Wollen]], John L. Wimbush, Charles J. Staniland, [[Joseph Finnemore]], [[John Charlton (artist)|John Charlton]], [[Warwick Goble]], [[Tom Browne (illustrator)|Tom Browne]], [[Ernest Prater]], [[Gordon Browne]], [[Edward S Hodgson]], Norman H. Hardy, [[Inglis Sheldon Williams]], and [[Harry Rountree]].&lt;ref&gt;See Volumes 3 and 7, for example (bibliography).&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 1913 issue contained the first reports of the death of notorious outlaw [[Butch Cassidy]] in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="collecting" /&gt;

''[[The Times]]'', in retrospect, humorously described the magazine as about "brave chaps with large moustaches on stiff upper lips, who did stupid and dangerous things".&lt;ref&gt;Ben Macintyre. ''[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article494387.ece Buried alive by an elephant]'' (''[[The Sunday Times]]'' - 16 October 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theatrical makeup''' is [[makeup]] that is used to assist in creating the appearance of the [[Character (arts)|characters]] that [[actors]] portray during a [[theater production]].

==Background==

In Greek and Roman theatre, makeup was unnecessary. Actors wore various masks, allowing them to portray another gender, age, or entirely different likeness.&lt;ref name="makeup (performing arts) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/359220/makeup|title=makeup (performing arts) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia:|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thespis]], considered to be the first actor, used white lead and wine to paint his face.&lt;ref name="History of Theatre Makeup before 1920"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://50.87.248.181/~taramagi/?p=2903|title=History of Theatre Makeup before 1920|accessdate=2009-11-24|year=2008|author=Tara Maginnis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[medieval]] Europe, actors altered their appearances by painting their faces a different color. Performers who portrayed God painted their faces white or gold; actors playing angels painted their faces red.&lt;ref name="makeup (performing arts) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia"/&gt; During the [[Renaissance]], actors were creative and resourceful when making-over their faces. They used lamb's wool for false beards and flour as face paint.&lt;ref name="makeup (performing arts) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Advancements in [[stage lighting]] technology required stage makeup to evolve beyond one over-all face color to a multidimensional craft. Originally, theatres used candles and oil lamps; these two sources of light were dim and allowed for crude, unrealistic makeup applications.&lt;ref name="makeup (performing arts) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia"/&gt; Once [[gas lighting]], [[limelight]] and [[electric light]] were introduced to theatres, a need emerged for new makeup materials and more skillful application techniques. In 1873, Ludwig Leichner, a [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] opera singer, began commercially producing a non-toxic greasepaint stick, easing the application of makeup.&lt;ref name="makeup (performing arts) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Highlight and shadow==

Through the use of makeup, specifically highlighting and shading, the apparent shape of an actor’s face can be changed.&lt;ref name="Stage Makeup"&gt;{{cite book | title=Stage Makeup| last=Corson| first=Richard| year=1986| pages=6, 8, 16–18| publisher=Prentice Hall| location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; By highlighting the face's protruding bones, the features become pronounced; shadowing cavities can add depth.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen| last=Westmore| first=Michael G.| year=1973| pages=2, 21–29| publisher= McGraw-Hill, Inc| location=New York| isbn=0-07-069485-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagging jowls, forehead wrinkles, eye pouches, and prominent veins can be created by manipulating highlights and shadows.&lt;ref name="Stage Makeup"/&gt; A highlight is a base makeup that is at least two shades lighter than the base. It is applied on the bridge of the nose, cheekbones, and areas under the eyes and below the brows.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt; Using a color two shades deeper than the base provides depth and definition. This depth is commonly used on the eye sockets, to thin the sides of the nose, to shallow the cheeks, and to minimize heaviness under the chin.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

==Makeup and lighting==

Lighting controls makeup to a high degree. Makeup can lose its effectiveness due to incorrect stage lighting. Conversely, skillful lighting can greatly aid the art of makeup. Close communication between the lighting director and the makeup artist is crucial for the best possible effect.&lt;ref name="The Technique of Film and Television Make-Up for Color and Black and White"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Technique of Film and Television Make-Up for Color and Black and White| last=Kehoe| first=Vincent| year=1969| pages=21| publisher=Hastings House Publishers| location=New York| isbn=0-240-44942-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding light's effect on makeup and various shades and pigments is important when designing a performer’s makeup. The following are among the basic rules of light: nothing has color until light is reflected from it; an object appears black when all of the light is absorbed; an object appears white when all of the light is reflected. If certain rays are absorbed and others are reflected, the reflected rays determine the color.&lt;ref name="Stage Makeup"/&gt;

===Light's effect on makeup===
*Pink tends to gray the cool colors and intensify the warm ones. Yellow becomes more orange.
*Flesh pink flatters most makeup. 
*Fire red ruins makeup. All but the darker flesh tones virtually disappear. Light and medium rouge fade into the foundation, whereas the dark red rouges turn a reddish brown. Yellow becomes orange, and the cool shading colors become shades of gray and black.
*Bastard amber is flattering because it picks up the warm pinks and flesh tones in the makeup.
*Amber and orange intensifies and yellow most flesh colors. They turn rouges more orange. Cool colors are grayed.
*Green grays all flesh tones and rouges in proportion to its intensity. Green will be intensified. Yellow and blue will become greener.
*Light blue-green lowers the intensity of the base colors. One should generally use very little rouge under this type of light.
*Green-blue washes out pale flesh tones, and will gray medium and deep flesh tones, as well as all reds.
*Blues gray most flesh tones and cause them to appear more red or purple.
*Violet causes orange, flame, and scarlet to become redder. Rouge appears more intense.
*Purple affects makeup like violet lighting, except reds and oranges will be even more intense, and most blues will look violet.&lt;ref name="Stage Makeup"/&gt;

==Straight makeup==

Straight makeup is a style of makeup that provides a natural, clean and healthy glow.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

===Skin===

If a performer’s skin is perfectly toned, makeup spreads smoothly and adheres easily. Dry skin or oily skin is dealt with prior to makeup application; otherwise, the makeup appears blotchy or smeared due to variations in absorption. Performers with dry skin use a moisturizer daily and after their faces have been cleansed following a performance. Performers with oily complexions use a facial [[Toner (skin care)|toner]] wipe or [[astringent]] to remove the oil and allow a smooth application.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

Skin has four basic tones: brown, fair, pink and olive. Individuals with fair, pink, and olive skin tones use olive, beige, or suntan bases. Makeup artist and performers select shades compatible with the natural skin tone, but the base is one to several shades deeper. Performers with predominately pink or ruddy complexions use base colors with cool undertones. The character, size of the theatre, and light intensity will determine the tone depth of the foundation.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

A thin layer of base makeup is applied to the neck, ears, and face using a white rubber sponge or fingers. A heavy application of base appears aged and creepy.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

===Rouge===

Fair complexions are enhanced by soft shades of peach and pink, while brown complexions are best accented with coral shades. Moist rouge is applied before powder; dry rouge is used to accent the already powdered makeup.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

===Eyes===

Eyes and eyebrows are the greatest communicative tool in an actor’s arsenal. They are the most expressive feature on the face.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

====Eye shadow====

Grease or stick shadow is applied to the eyelids and blended out toward the eyebrow bone before powder is applied; dry eye shadow is used alone or to intensify and touch up the color underneath. Dark eye shadow or grease deepens the eye sockets, creating a skull-like effect. Shades of brown and gray are best for individuals with fair complexions. Individuals with brown complexions use lighter shadows such as toast, mushroom or soft yellows.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

====Eye liner====

Liquid eyeliner, cake eyeliner, or the eyebrow pencil is used to accent and frame the eyes. There are two ways to line the upper lid of the eye: the owl eye or the almond eye. The owl eye is used to widen the eye and involves using a heavier line in the middle of the lid. The almond-shaped eye is created by extending the line out beyond the outer corner of the eye. The lower line is created by using the same tool used on the upper lid. The line begins a quarter-inch from the inner corner of the eye. This extra space is needed to open the eye.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

====Eyelashes====

Mascara is used to add extra attention to the eyes. Black lash mascara is the most popular and commonly used by women with fair and brown complexions. Very fair individuals and men use brown mascara. The bottom lashes are coated with mascara and to avoid using false lashes, a process of layering powder and mascara is used to provide greater thickness.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

===Powder===

A generous amount of powder is needed to reduce unwanted shine. If a performer’s makeup is under-powdered, his skin oils will break through quickly, producing shine and possibly running. After powder is applied to the entire face, starting under and around the eyes, it is gently pressed for thirty seconds. The excess is brushed off with a large soft brush or piece of cotton. A wet natural sponge or cotton is wiped lightly across the face to set the makeup, to remove any visible powder, and to eliminate the masky feeling.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

[[Wiktionary:translucent#Pronunciation|Translucent]] powders are used for fair complexions because they do not alter the original color of the base, the under-rouge, or the moist eye shadow. Brown complexions are set with tinted that is compatible with the base color. It is used sparingly over the under-rouge and moist eye shadow. After the powder is applied, dry eye shadow and dry rouge are added.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

===Lips===
[[File:Stage makeup.JPG|thumb|Applied makeup to the lips and cheeks assisting in the conveyance of emotion.]]
Though the eyes are the most expressive feature of the face, the eyes and ears of the audience follow mouth movements to understand a play’s progression. If a performer’s lips are underdone or overplayed, they will detract from the performer and the performance. A general rule is: the larger the mouth, the deeper the lipstick tone. However, the actor should not appear “all mouth”.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

Fair complexions use shades of lipstick like pink and coral. Brown complexions are enhanced by coral and orange shades. Red lipsticks are reserved for large theatres and character portrayals. An auburn or brown pencil are used to provide definition to the lips. Lipsticks on men can look doll-like. Men use natural-colored lipsticks, lightly applied.&lt;ref name="The Art of Theatrical Makeup for Stage and Screen"/&gt;

==Training/Education==

Because stage actors are seen from farther away than actors on screen, it is crucial that their makeup is more dramatic and professionally done. Many higher-learning institutions have drama departments where all aspects of theater are taught, including the art of theatrical makeup. Some independent agencies also provide classes in theatrical makeup, and online courses are also available. Through training, makeup artists learn important techniques such as hand-eye coordination, ability to draw straight lines and consistent shapes, creativity, good grooming and personal hygiene habits, etc. Many makeup artists who specialize in theatrical makeup build portfolios to show their clients and employers. Many of them work as freelance makeup artists or work for cosmetics brands in department stores.

'''The Rev. William Slater Calverley (1847–1898)''' was an unassuming rural English [[vicar]] who through diligent study and painstaking scrutiny became an extraordinary amateur [[antiquarian]]. Although born in [[Leicestershire]], Calverley claimed his fame through interpreting the carved sculptured relics that he and others found in [[Cumberland]] churchyards. He made intricate drawings, corresponded with academic authorities, and gave his own interpretation to meaning, which he then relayed to a wider audience. Calverley later reproduced in intricate detail a life-sized reproduction of the famous [[Gosforth Cross]], which now stands in [[Aspatria]] churchyard.

==Biography==
===Religion and education===
William Slater Calverley (1847–1898) was born at Kibworth, Leicestershire in 1847. After completing his formal education he entered [[New College, Oxford]], but left to take up private tuition before attaining his degree. During this period he began to study art at the [[South Kensington School of Art]] and according to contemporary reports could have achieved the gold medal but for illness. This period of study proved very useful later in life. Notwithstanding his artistic ability he chose to enter the church. He was ordained [[deacon]] by Bishop Goodwin at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], Cumberland, in 1872 and afterwards became curate of [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]] parish, South Cumberland. In the following year he took priest's orders and assumed an appointment as [[curate]] at [[Maryport]], moving in 1874 to [[Dearham]], where he served three years as curate and eight years as vicar of the same church. Under his guidance the church was restored, the vicarage and church yard enlarged and improved, and the district church at [[Ellenborough, Cumbria|Ellenborough]] founded. In 1885, he became vicar of [[St. Kentigern]]'s Church, Aspatria. One important feature of his pastorate of Aspatria was the acquisition of a peal of bells for the church.&lt;ref&gt;''West Cumberland Times'', 24 September 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquarianism===
[[Image:Grave Stone Memorial.JPG|right|300pxs|thumb|Grave Stone Memorial for W S Calverley at St. Kentigern's Church, Aspatria, designed by his friend and colleague, [[W. G. Collingwood]], and based on the Dearham Cross&lt;ref&gt;Townend, 2009, p.150&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Calverley ignited an interest in local and [[ancient history]] during the church restorations at Dearham, which brought to light remains of ancient art. Through the study of pre-[[Normans|Norman]] stones and artefacts he became one of the world's foremost antiquarian scholars. After finding several pre-Norman sculptures he contacted leading authorities, and formed a close working relationship with the English born professor, [[George Stephens (philologist)|George Stephens]] of [[Copenhagen University]]. Stephens incorporated and embodied Calverley's discoveries and descriptions into one of the chapters of his book ''Old Northern Runic Monuments''&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society'' 1883&lt;/ref&gt; The communications with Stephens encouraged Calverley to delve deeper into the subject and in 1883 he announced to the Archaeological Institute at Carlisle, his reading of [[Edda]] myths on the Christian cross at [[Gosforth]], West Cumberland.&lt;ref&gt;"The Sculptured Cross at Gosforth", by the Rev. W. S. Calverley, printed in the ''Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The news created a sensation; prior to these discovery authorities held that Christian monuments contained nothing but Christian subjects. Although others had tried to make a connection with [[Buddhism]], [[Druidism]], and [[Astronomy]], Calverley identified the '[[Pagan]] overlap' in English relics. His critics were finally silenced after the Rev. G. F. Browne (later Bishop of [[Bristol]]) published his research into the meaning of the Scandinavian legends on the cross at Leeds, and the one at [[Kirk Andreas]], [[Isle of Man]]. In February 1891, Calverley interpreted the [[Völsung]] myth at [[Halton (borough)|Halton]] in a lecture to the [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] Philosophical Society and later that year he read a paper on the same subject to an audience at the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]] at [[Edinburgh]].

==Calverley at Aspatria==
[[File:The Replica Gosforth Cross, Aspatria.JPG|thumb|400pxs|right|The Replica Gosforth Cross at Aspatria]]

As vicar at Aspatria, Calverley began to study the ancient relics of that parish. He made intricate drawings of the 'Standing Cross', which at that time stood in its own rectangular socket in the south side of the churchyard, and compared its markings to other artefacts in the county. He also studied the [[Saxon]] [[hogback (sculpture)|hogbacks]], the [[swastika]]s, the two spiral shafts, the spiral fragments and began to draw conclusions, which related to the age and importance of the site of the ancient church. Having realised the importance of these relics he removed them to the [[vestry]]. All of his conclusions remain his testimony today. However, it was his interpretation of the meaning of the spiral markings on the Gosforth Cross which assured his fame. Not content to make sketches of the carvings, Calverley determined to make an exact life-size reproduction a means of understanding the Masonic mystery of the sculpture. Aspatria parish is rich in red [[freestone (masonry)|freestone]] and in due course he acquired from the local quarries, a solid piece of rock 2 feet wide, 2 feet thick and 16 feet long. With the aid of a retired master mason he carved out the cross and then proceeded with the carving. He reproduced the markings in intricate detail and the replica cross now stands in its own socket in the east end of Aspatria churchyard, a few feet away from Calverley's final resting place.&lt;ref&gt;Calverley and Collingwood (1899), p.139-167&lt;/ref&gt; As to the significance of the Gosforth Cross; Stephens, on visiting the site, pronounced it, "one of the costliest olden [[Roods]] in Europe" – unique in all his experience, and "probably of seventh century date."&lt;ref&gt;Calverley and Collingwood (1899), p.140&lt;/ref&gt; In Calverley's opinion it was a Christian monument, not an heathen pillar surmounted by a cross. He described it as an "elaborately carved Christian cross set in a socket of three Calvary steps.".&lt;ref&gt;Calverley and Collingwood (1899), p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic achievements==
Calverley was elected F.S.A. (Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]) in 1885, and in that capacity served as the Cumberland secretary, reporting new finds. He was also a member of the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]], and a Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]]. In addition to delivering a large number of technical papers to a variety of Societies and historical organisations he was heavily involved in the excavation of the [[Hardknott Roman Fort]], South Cumberland. He also became one of the committee of experts who superintended the exploration of [[Hadrian's Wall]] in northern England.&lt;ref&gt;Calverley and Collingwood (1899), p.iii-x&lt;/ref&gt; He died before the publication of his ''magnum opus'' entitled ''Notes on the Early Sculptured Crosses, Shrines and Monuments in the Present Diocese of Carlisle'', which was published in 1898 with [[W. G. Collingwood]] as editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The Early Sculptured Crosses, Shrines and Monuments in the Diocese of Carlisle'' by the late W. S. Calverley, ed. by W. G.

==Civic duties==
Calverley took a keen interest in the affairs of Aspatria. He occupied a seat on the [[Local Board]], and afterwards the Aspatria [[Urban District Council]]. He also had a position on the Aspatria and Brayton [[School Board]].&lt;ref&gt;''West Cumberland Times'', 24 September 1898&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Y Gaer''' ({{Lang-la|Cicucium}}) is a [[Roman fort]] situated near modern-day [[Brecon]] in [[Mid Wales]], [[United Kingdom]].
Y Gaer is located at {{gbmapping|SO00332966}} (Landranger 160).

== History ==

Y Gaer was built around AD 75 and sits on a crossroads of [[Roman road]]s in the valley of the [[River Usk]] at a strategic point in [[Wales in the Roman Era|Roman Wales]], linking [[South Wales]] and Mid Wales. It was part of a chain of similar forts, such as [[Gobannium]] at [[Abergavenny]], a day's march away down the Usk valley, and larger bases, such as [[Moridunum (Carmarthen)|Moridunum]] ([[Carmarthen]]) via [[Alabum]] ([[Llandovery]]), [[Cardiff Roman Fort]] to the south and [[Isca Augusta]], [[Caerleon]], the main base for the [[Roman legion]] locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A short guide to Brecon Gaer Roman Fort| url=http://www.cpat.org.uk/educate/guides/brecgaer/brecgaer.htm||publisher=Clwyd Powys Archaeological Trust|accessdate= 2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was excavated in the 1920s by Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], a prominent [[archaeologist]] of his day.

The fort was built for a contingent of up to 500 cavalrymen, recruited originally in Spain from the [[Vettones]], and these Vettonian cavalry would have played a significant part in the conquest of the area held by the [[Silures]].

Their early stables were wooden and their accommodation basic, protected by clay banks topped with a wooden palisade. This was rebuilt in the 2nd century AD by the [[Legio II Augusta]] and also shows signs of being repaired again in the 4th century.

== Y Gaer Today ==

The site is in the care of [[Cadw]]. It lies on private farmland and Cadw provides no signposting to the site, which lies on the further side of the farm buildings at the end of the approach lane.

Visitors can see remnants of stone walls standing in parts to some {{convert|3|m}} in height, part of three gatehouses and corner guard towers. Several artifacts have been removed to local museums, such as a tombstone of a young cavalryman called Candidus, held at [[Brecknock Museum]] in Brecon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Maiden stone from Brecon Gaer (Roman fort), 1809 |url=http://www.peoplescollectionwales.co.uk/Item/11078-the-maiden-stone-from-brecon-gaer-roman-fort |work=Gathering the Jewels |publisher=peoplescollectionwales.co.uk |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
