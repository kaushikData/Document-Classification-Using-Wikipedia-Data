The entire film was shot on 7 December 2012 shot at a three-storey bungalow near [[Porur]] in [[Chennai]].&lt;ref name="thehindu2"/&gt; The film running for 2 hours, 3 minutes and 30 seconds was shot on a single camera without any cuts and therefore awarded the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for being the longest uncut film,&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords2000"/&gt; beating the record held by ''[[Russian Ark]]'' directed by Alexander Sokurov, which used a single 96-minute [[Steadicam]] [[sequence shot]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3157774/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Russian Ark |accessdate=25 October 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A director registered with the union (L.

Director Issack gave up his software job to "make a film that is different, yet entertaining" and said that he wanted his first film to make an impact.&lt;ref name="thehindu2"/&gt; He spent over a year on the script and stated that he was inspired by ''Russian Ark''.&lt;ref name="thehindu2"/&gt; Ten people were involved in the making of the film, the director, the cameraman, and 8 actors,&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords2000"/&gt; who were all newcomers. The team rehearsed for over a month before the filming and the entire sequence was said to be rehearsed over 40 times.&lt;ref name="thehindu2"/&gt; ''Agadam'' was also the first film to be shot in the night effect with a hand-held camera.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt; The film, which had no songs, was awarded a U/A certificate by the Censor Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/94612.html |title='Agadam' A Single Shot Movie Breaks Guinness World Record! - Tamil Movie News |publisher=Indiaglitz.com |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Dinamalar]] appreciated the film stating that 'the film has a good medical message and stand out in its unique attempt of single shot filming'. They also lauded the entire cast as well as the technician's, concluding that the slow pace of some part has not affected the good result. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=தினமலர் விமர்சனம் - அகடம்|url=http://cinema.dinamalar.com/tamil_cinema_fullstory.php?id=1079|publisher=[[Dinamalar]]|accessdate=18 January 2017|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kungumam]] magazine appreciated the cameraman as well as director for making a single shot film completely in a house. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=வண்ணத்திரை விமர்சனம்-அகடம்|url=http://kungumam.co.in/VArticalinnerdetail.aspx?id=3376&amp;id1=45&amp;issue=20140113|publisher=[[Kungumam]]|accessdate=18 January 2017|date=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maalai Malar]] daily mentioned that the cinematography as well as direction has to be appreciated, but music lacked the thrill. Overall the effort can be appreciated for making a single shot film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=அகடம்|url=http://www.maalaimalar.com/Cinema/Review/2014/01/03150918/Agadam-Cinema-preview.vpf|publisher=[[Maalai Malar]]|accessdate=18 January 2017|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, M. Suganth of ''[[The Times of India]]'' rated the film 1.5 out of 5, saying that "''Agadam'' is a cautionary tale that proves that while digital has made it possible for anyone to make a film, not everyone should make one." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie-reviews/agadam/movie-review/28463733.cms|title=Agadam Movie Review|last=Suganth|first=M.|date=3 January 2014|website=|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serviceman reading brooklyn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|US Serviceman Nunzio Antonio "Jim" Giambalvo reads an Armed Services Edition of ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (novel)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'']]

'''Armed Services Editions''' ('''ASEs''') are small, compact, paperback books that were printed by the [[Council on Books in Wartime]] for distribution within the [[American military]] during [[World War II]]. This program was in effect from 1943 to 1947. The ASEs were designed to provide entertainment to soldiers serving overseas, while also educating them about political, historical, and military issues. The slogan of the Council on Books in Wartime was, "Books are weapons in the [[war of ideas]]."

== ASE titles ==
[[File:Armed Services Edition UnprocessedHuckleberry Finn &amp; Country Lawyer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Armed Services Editions were printed in pairs, one atop the other, to make most efficient use of the digest magazine presses.  This rare "two-up" of [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Huckleberry Finn]]'' and ''Country Lawyer'' by Bellamy Partridge was never cut apart by the printer, and its edges remain untrimmed.]]
The ASE program featured an array of fiction and non-fiction titles, including classics, contemporary bestsellers, biographies, drama, poetry, and genre fiction (mysteries, sports, fantasy, action/adventure, westerns). Non-fiction books included biographies, religious/self-help titles, and science titles. Most of these books were printed in unabridged versions. Authors included&lt;ref&gt;Cole 1984, p.33+&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hervey Allen]], [[Robert Benchley]], [[Stephen Vincent Benét]], [[Max Brand]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[A. J. Cronin]], [[Carl Crow]], Eugene Cunningham, [[Clyde Brion Davis]], [[Walter D. Edmonds]], [[Edward Ellsberg]], [[William Faulkner]],
Peter Field, [[C. S. Forester]], [[Erle Stanley Gardner]], [[Edmund Gilligan]], [[Arthur Henry Gooden]], [[Zane Grey]], [[Ernest Haycox]], [[MacKinlay Kantor]], Frances and [[Richard Lockridge]], [[Jack London]], [[William Colt MacDonald]], [[John P. Marquand]], [[Ngaio Marsh]], [[W. Somerset Maugham]], [[Clarence E. Mulford]], [[John O'Hara]], [[George Sessions Perry]], [[William MacLeod Raine]], [[Eugene Manlove Rhodes]], [[Craig Rice (author)|Craig Rice]], [[Charles Alden Seltzer]], [[Luke Short (writer)|Luke Short]], [[Thorne Smith]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[George R. Stewart]], [[Grace Zaring Stone]], [[James Thurber]], [[W. C. Tuttle]], [[Mark Twain]], [[H. G. Wells]], and [[Philip Wylie]].

The distinctive covers bore the description, "Armed Services Edition: This is the Complete Book—Not a Digest." Seventy-nine (79) of the titles printed were abridged, usually for length rather than content. These bore the slogan, "Condensed for wartime reading," or slight variations such as "Slightly condensed for rapid reading."

Over the life of the program, over 122 million copies of 1,324 books were printed. This makes the ASE program one of the largest wide-scale distributions of free books in history.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Of the 1,324 books, 1,225 were unique titles and 99 were reprints of titles issued earlier in the series.&lt;ref name=rare&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loc.gov/rr/rarebook/coll/020.html |title=Armed Services Editions Collection |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-three (63) of the titles were "made books"; they were collections of short stories, poems, plays, essays, or radio plays, usually by the same author, that were assembled and published together for the first time.

A complete, extant collection of all 1,324 ASE books is held at the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name=rare /&gt;&lt;ref name=locblog&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2015/09/ |title=Books in Action: The Armed Services Editions |last=Cole |first=John Y. |website=Library of Congress Blog |date= September 30, 2015 |access-date= February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==
The small books were convenient for soldiers because they fit easily into a cargo pocket. Finished size varied slightly, from 5½" to 6½" long and from 3⅞" to 4½" high.  Unlike traditional paperbacks, most of the ASEs were bound on the short side of the text block rather than the long side, due to the printing presses used.  A few titles near the end of the series were published in traditional paperback format with the spine on the long side.

Armed Services Editions were printed on digest and pulp magazine presses, usually in two columns per page for easier reading. Some ASEs were stapled along the binding, in addition to being glued, to make them sturdier. Because the Council on Books in Wartime made use of magazine presses to print ASEs when the presses were not in use, printing costs were low. The cost for printing was around 6 cents per copy, and royalties of one cent per copy were split between authors and publishers. This early experiment with mass paperback printing helped to prove the viability of paperback publishing in the United States.

== Popularity ==
ASEs were very popular amongst the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Atlantic|author=Yoni Appelbaum |title=Publishers Gave Away 122,951,031 Books During World War II''|date=September 10, 2014| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/publishers-gave-away-122951031-books-during-world-war-ii/379893/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies were shared, re-read, and ripped into sections so they could accommodate two or more readers at once. A contemporary newspaper article recounted, "The hunger for these books, evidenced by the way they are read to tatters, is astounding even to the Army and Navy officers and the book-trade officials who conceived Editions for the Armed Services" (Wittels, 11). ASEs were the first books some readers had picked up since high school.

== Armed Services Editions today ==
[[File:US Navy 031117-N-3994W-048 Quartermaster Seaman John Tadyeh reaches for Armed Services Edition (ASE) books.jpg|thumb|upright|Members of the U.S. armed forces receive Armed Service Editions books in 2003. Author [[Andrew Carroll]] used a $50,000 corporate donation to print 100,000 copies of four new Armed Services Editions distributed free to active-duty American military personnel serving in combat zones overseas.]]
Today, many Armed Services Editions are still readily available from used booksellers. However, the rarer titles from the series are difficult to find and very valuable.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The scarcest tend to be the titles produced at the beginning and the ending of the series.  Other titles, such as ''Superman'' and ''A Rose for Emily,'' are more common but valuable because they appeal to a wider array of collectors.

A complete set of ASEs is owned by the [[Library of Congress]]. Near-complete sets are in the libraries of the [[University of Alabama]], the [[University of South Carolina]] and the [[University of Virginia]]. The [[University of Notre Dame]] hosts 1064 titles.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Many other libraries have special Armed Services Edition collections including the [[University of Texas]], the [[University of Rochester]], [[Princeton University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and [[Harvard University]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

There is one known complete set and another near-complete set (missing 2 books) which are held by private collectors.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Netto Katalog 2017 4 country.jpg|thumb|2017 four country Austria Netto Katalog]]
The '''''Austria Netto Kataloge''''' are [[Austria]]'s most popular collectors' catalogs. They have been regularly issued since the mid-20th century. Among [[philatelist]]s, [[Numismatics|numismatists]], and [[Telephone_card#Phone_card_as_an_artifact_or_collectible|phone card collectors]] they are considered the authoritative reference catalogs.

The most famous of these catalogs are those issued in the field of philately. These are limited to the Austrian collecting field, and are issued annually. The oldest of these, the ''Österreich Spezial Katalog'' (Austria Special Catalog), as of 2007, is in its 63rd edition. Also issued annually are the ''Österreich Standardkatalog'' (Austria Standard Catalog) and the ''Vierländerkatalog'' (Four Countries Catalog), the latter of which lists all stamps issued in each of the four German-speaking countries: Austria, [[Germany]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Switzerland]].

In addition to its [[stamp catalog]]s, the ''Austria Netto Kataloge'' line also includes  annually-issued Austrian [[coin catalog]]s and Austrian phone card catalogs. The catalogs' publisher also issues catalogs for special cancellations.

The editor-in-chief of the Austria Netto Kataloge, as of 2008, is Christine Steyrer.

Due to the length of the name ''Austria Netto Kataloge'', collectors often use the abbreviation ''ANK''. Therefore, while also commonly used, the expression ''ANK catalog'' is technically redundant.

==Contents==

*personalized stamps

*court tax/[[revenue stamp]]s

{{Distinguish|Chronicon Venetum (1388)}}
The '''''Chronicon Venetum et Gradense''''', formerly known as the '''''Chronicon Sagornini''''', is a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] chronicle compiled by [[John the Deacon (Venetian chronicler)|John the Deacon]] in ca. 1008. It is the oldest chronicle of the Republic of Venice.{{sfn|Herbermann|1950}} John was the chaplain and perhaps a relative of Venetian Doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] (r. 991–1009).{{sfn|Herbermann|1950}} The first part, dealing with early history, is lacking, only later becoming more accurate, and in the time of John himself deemed particularly valuable.{{sfn|Herbermann|1950}} It details the reign of Pietro II.{{sfn|Herbermann|1950}}

'''HTML parsers''' are software for automated [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML) [[parsing]]. They have two main purposes: 
* HTML traversal: offer an interface for programmers to easily access and modify of the "HTML string code".  Canonical example: [[Document Object Model#Libraries|DOM parsers]].
* HTML clean:  to fix invalid HTML and to improve the layout and indent style of the resulting markup. Canonical example: [[HTML Tidy]].

[[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows 8]] [[operating system]] introduced an updated [[Start menu]] known as the "Start screen", which uses a full-screen design consisting of tiles to represent applications. This replaced the Windows desktop as the primary interface of the operating system. Additionally, the on-screen Start button was replaced by a hidden button in the corner of the screen; Microsoft explained that the Start button was removed because few people used it, noting the addition of "pinning" apps to the [[taskbar]] from [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/enterprise/375550/why-microsoft-killed-the-windows-start-button |title=Why Microsoft killed the Windows Start button |publisher=PC Pro |date= |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney |first=Lance |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-57371830-75/microsoft-removes-start-button-in-windows-8/ |title=Microsoft removes start button in Windows 8 |work=CNET |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/enterprise/375550/why-microsoft-killed-the-windows-start-button |title=Why Microsoft killed the Windows Start button |publisher=PC Pro |date= |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The change was controversial among users, and a market ensued for applications which restore the visible Start button, emulate the previous Start menu design, or allow users to boot directly to the Desktop instead of the Start screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney |first=Lance |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20119131-75/microsoft-reacts-to-gripes-over-windows-8-start-screen/ |title=Microsoft reacts to gripes over Windows 8 Start screen |work=CNET |date=2011-10-12 |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Computers and Typesetting''''' is a 5-volume set of books by [[Donald Knuth]] published in 1986 describing the [[TeX]] and [[METAFONT|Metafont]] systems for [[digital typography]].  Knuth's computers and typesetting project was the result of his frustration with the lack of decent software for the typesetting of mathematical and technical documents.  The results of this project include TeX for typesetting, Metafont for [[typeface|font]] construction and the [[Computer Modern]] typefaces that are the default fonts used by TeX.  In the series of five books Knuth not only describes the TeX and Metafont languages (volumes A and C), he also describes and documents the source code (in the [[WEB]] programming language) of the TeX and Metafont interpreters (volumes B and D), and the source code for the [[Computer Modern]] fonts used by TeX (volume E).  The book set stands as a tour de force demonstration of [[literate programming]].

The books themselves were typeset in the [[Computer Modern]] Roman typeface using TeX; thus, in Knuth's words, they "belong to the class of sets of books that describe precisely their own appearance."

==Volumes==
The five volumes are published by Addison-Wesley.
#Volume A: The TeXbook. ''Describes the TeX typesetting language''.  It is by far the most common and available of the set, as the TeX interpreter is widely used for typesetting.  It is available in softcover {{ISBN|0-201-13448-9}} (blue spiral-bound with a built-in flap for a bookmark) and hardcover {{ISBN|0-201-13447-0}}
#Volume B: TeX: The program. ''A documented listing of the source code of the TeX interpreter'' The 1986 edition in hardcover is {{ISBN|0-201-13437-3}}
#Volume C: The METAFONTbook. ''Describes the [[METAFONT]] font description language.'' Hardcover {{ISBN|0-201-13445-4}}, softcover {{ISBN|0-201-13444-6}}.
#Volume D: Metafont: The program. ''A documented listing of the source code of the [[Metafont]] interpreter.''  Hardcover {{ISBN|0-201-13438-1}}, paperback {{ISBN|0-201-60658-5}} 
#Volume E: Computer Modern Typefaces. ''A character-by-character listing (in the [[Metafont]] language) of the source code for the [[Computer Modern]] typefaces (cmr, cmbx, cmti, etc.) used by TeX.'' Hardcover: {{ISBN|0-201-13446-2}}, Softcover: {{ISBN|0-201-60660-7}} 
The set is also available as a hardcover boxed set with the latest editions as of the year 2000.  {{ISBN|0-201-73416-8}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2497">„'''European Certification Body“ (ECB)''' is a since 7 July 1992 accredited ([[European Committee for Standardization|ISO/IEC 17065]]) and neutral certification body for physical security products. It certifies according to ([[European Committee for Standardization|European Standards]]) – without any national additional requirements. ECB issues the ECB•S certification mark.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.empiresafe.com/384/ecbs_certifications&lt;/ref&gt;

== ECB•S-certification program ==
* Secure safe cabinets and [[Safe]]
* [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] safes 
* Strongrooms
* Deposit systems (deposit safes and night safes)
* Light fire storage units
* Data cabinets, Data rooms&lt;ref&gt;http://www.datacenters.ro/hot_topics/view/26&lt;/ref&gt;
* Burglar resistant construction products (Windows, Doors, Shutters)
* High security locks

== Certification ==
Certified security products may be marked with the blue ECB•S certification mark. A requirement of the ECB•S certification is a type testing according to European Standards. The type test is based on an authentic and real-life simulation e.g. of a burglary or a fire. The result of the test leads to the qualification of the product (e.g. resistance grade I, II, III for a safe). Ongoing audits in the manufacturing plants are necessary to maintain an equal quality.

== Insurance ==
The ECB•S certification gives insurance companies a basis for the calculation of risks. Very often insurance companies assure worths only if they are kept in a tested and certified secure storage unit. Therefore it is recommended also by governmental bodies, e.g. the police, to better choose certified security broducts in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/526557/Security_Guidance_for_all_Businesses_and_Other_Organisations-_Final-_May_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The storage of weapons or medicine can require certified secure storage products.

== History/Background ==
ECB is together with the international security association ESSA&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fireproofsafes.co.uk/testing-houses-certification-and-the-ecb-s/&lt;/ref&gt; the follow-up organisations of the FuP e.V. The FuP, founded in 1969, initiated and forced the standardization of physical security products. At first in Germany, later on also on the European Market.

'''Exclusionary zoning''' is the utilization of [[zoning]] ordinances to exclude certain types of land uses from a given community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoning|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/657885/zoning|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism began gaining prominence in land-use regulations throughout the United States in the late 19th century. Ultimately, despite resistance from excluded peoples and activists, the policy is still extensively used today across the country.

The vast, land-rich country upheld the notion that state powers should not interfere with private property. Also, given the country's predominately rural and isolated composition, most citizens were unconcerned about who their neighbors were at the time. Thus, early Americans largely disapproved of any early attempts at exclusionary zoning.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock, Richard; Fred Bosselman (1973). Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s. New York: Praeger Publishers. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, around the turn of the 20th century, a rapid [[urbanization]] process and influx of immigrants transformed the country. Middle and upper-classes consequently encountered much greater diversity than they had before making the intrusion of unwanted people into their neighborhoods appear more conceivable. As a result, many cities began implementing the first exclusionary zoning policies. In 1908, Los Angeles adopted the first citywide zoning ordinance protecting residential areas from the entrance of these undesirable community elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silver|first=Christopher|title=The Racial Origins of Zoning in American Cities|year=1997|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these early regulations directly debarred racial and ethnic minorities from community residence until explicit racial zoning was declared unconstitutional in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Babcock|first=Richard|title=Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s|year=1973|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|author2=Fred Bosselman|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the unconstitutionality of such explicit measures, exclusionary ordinances continued to gain popularity throughout the country.

Given the increased utilization of exclusionary zoning, the United States federal government finally addressed the issue with the enactment of the [[Standard State Zoning Enabling Act]] of 1922. This legislation established the institutional framework for zoning ordinances. It delegated land-use power to local authorities for the conservation of community welfare and provided guidelines for appropriate regulation usage.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Paul|title=Exclusionary Zoning and Open Housing: A Brief Judicial History|journal=Geographical Review|year=1978|volume=68|issue=4|page=460|jstor=214217|doi=10.2307/214217}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In light of these developments, the Supreme Court considered zoning's constitutionality in the 1926 landmark case of [[Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.]]. The court ultimately condoned zoning as an acceptable means of community regulation. Following this verdict, the number of municipalities with zoning legislation multiplied from 368 in 1925 to over 1,000 in 1930.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;United States National Commission on Urban Problems, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II's end and the country's subsequent [[suburbanization]] process, exclusionary zoning policies experienced an uptick in complexity, stringency and prevalence as suburbanites attempted to more effectively protect their new communities. Many people had severed ties with the city and its unwanted elements as they searched for their suburban utopia. They feared that these very city elements that they escaped would follow them into the suburbs if left unchecked. Thus, middle-class and affluent whites, who constituted the majority of suburban inhabitants, more frequently employed measures preventing immigrant and minority integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Paul|title=Exclusionary Zoning and Open Housing: A Brief Judicial History|journal=Geographical Review|year=1978|volume=68|issue=4|page=462|jstor=214217|doi=10.2307/214217}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of resident's newly found protectionism, the number of jurisdictions with such ordinances increased to over 5,200 by 1968.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

While well-off whites mainly inhabited the suburbs, the remaining city residents, primarily  impoverished minorities, faced substantial obstacles to wealth. Many attributed their impecunious state to their exclusion from the suburbs. In response, a flurry of exclusionary zoning cases were brought before the Supreme Court in the 1970s that would ultimately determine the tactic's fate. The Supreme Court sided with the proponents of exclusionary zoning in near unanimity which virtually halted any zoning reform movement. The ability of minorities and other excluded populations to challenge exclusionary zoning became essentially nonexistent, allowing the policy's unabated continuation today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzdorf|first=Marsha|title=Locked Out of Paradise: Contemporary Exclusionary Zoning, the Supreme Court, and African Americans, 1970 to the Present|year=1997|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, exclusionary zoning ordinances are standard in almost all communities. A recent comprehensive survey found that over 80% of United States jurisdictions imposed minimum lot size requirements of some kind on their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gyourko|first=Joseph |author2=Albert Saiz |author3=Anita Summers|title=A New Measure of the Local Regulatory Environment for Housing Markets: The Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index|journal=Urban Studies|year=2008|volume=45|issue=3|page=701|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/content/45/3/693.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1177/0042098007087341}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ordinances continue to reinforce discriminatory housing practices throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusionary Zoning Continues Racial Segregation's Ugly Work|url=https://tcf.org/content/commentary/exclusionary-zoning-continues-racial-segregations-ugly-work/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

===Description===
American courts have historically most greatly valued individual [[property rights]]. However, more recently, concern for the general community welfare has begun taking precedence thus exculpating most exclusionary zoning measures.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Communities are granted freedom to enact policies in accordance with community welfare goals even in the case that they infringe upon a specific individual's property rights.

Courts also have regularly ruled as if municipal regulatory power emanated from their role as agents for local families rather than for the government. [[Regulation]] was equated with some manner of 'market force' rather than 'state force' thereby allowing the policies to bypass many questions of justification required for state policy enactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Jonathan|title=Zoned Out: Regulation, Markets, and Choices in Transportation and Metropolitan Land-Use|year=2006|publisher=Resources for the Future|location=Washington, DC|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, they did not have to prove that their policies benefited the well-being of society at large. Rather, they could merely enact regulations on the sole basis that it was their prerogative as an agent of the market regardless of any adverse effects on others. Therefore, exclusionary mechanisms were allowed to endure as complaints about the negative effects on the excluded population ultimately became null and irrelevant.

===Case history===
[[Buchanan v. Warley]] 1917: A Louisville city ordinance prohibiting the sale of property to African Americans was brought to court. It was ultimately declared that such racial zoning was unconstitutional and a breach of individuals' [[freedom of contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Babcock, Richard; Fred Bosselman (1973). Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s. New York: Praeger Publishers. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, ordinances were no longer able to explicitly reject certain types of people but rather were now forced to resort to subtler means of exclusion.

[[Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.]] 1926: The Ambler Realty company accused the Village of Euclid of depriving their [[liberty]] with its ban on industrial uses. The ban on industry reduced the company's land value from $10,000 down to $2,500 per acre and undermined the company's right to govern its own property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Paul|title=Exclusionary Zoning and Open Housing: A Brief Judicial History|journal=Geographical Review|year=1978|volume=68|issue=4|pages=460|jstor=214217|doi=10.2307/214217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Court officials, however, sided with the village and upheld the ordinance on the basis that it was a just and reasonable delegation of the state's police power. Municipals, the court ruled, are entitled to regulate community property when it reflects the best interests of its constituents. This landmark decision would lay the constitutional foundation for all future exclusionary zoning policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Jonathan|title=Zoned Out: Regulation, Markets, and Choices in Transportation and Metropolitan Land-Use|year=2006|publisher=Resources for the Future|location=Washington, DC|pages=89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belle Terre et al. v. Boras et al. 1974: A group of 6 unrelated college students living together challenged a neighborhood ordinance that restricted unit residence to no more than two unrelated individuals. The case differed from the Euclid one in that there was no residential land use or structural type at issue. It rather addressed the constitutionality of directly regulating occupancy. Eventually, the court sanctioned this variety of ordinances. A community's pursuit of homogeneity was self-justifying, the court logic went, so long as there is no explicit class or racial discrimination. Their decision hinged on the view that an area's definition of the family is acceptable as long as a rational basis exists for the determination. It is not a judge's domain to overrule such legislative decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Jonathan|title=Zoned Out: Regulation, Markets, and Choices in Transportation and Metropolitan Land-Use|year=2006|publisher=Resources for the Future|location=Washington, DC|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit within the case's ruling is permission for exclusionary zoning regulations to attempt preservation of identity in the context of family compositions. Thus, given the previous Village of Euclid decision, municipalities were now granted the right to legislate both external property and internal inhabitant characteristics.

[[Warth v. Seldin]] 1975: Low-income individuals and a not-for-profit housing organization sued a New York State suburb contending that the community's exclusionary principles increased their housing costs. The court ultimately asserted that any harm is a generalized consequence of [[real estate economics]] rather than a specific result of the suburb's regulations. Therefore, since the elevated housing costs could not be directly attributed to a certain exclusionary policy, the court ruled in favor of the suburb's ordinance. Specific legislation would not be held accountable for any overarching effects that it may have advanced. Therefore, exclusionary mechanisms could expand without threat of lawsuits from refused populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Jonathan|title=Zoned Out: Regulation, Markets, and Choices in Transportation and Metropolitan Land-Use|year=2006|publisher=Resources for the Future|location=Washington, DC|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

===Restrictions on the supply of housing units===
Municipalities will often impose density controls on developable land with the intention of limiting the number of individuals that will live in their particular area. This process denies neighborhood access to certain groups by limiting the supply of available housing units. Such concerns may manifest in measures prohibiting [[multi-family residential]] dwellings, limiting the number of people per unit of land and mandating lot size requirements. Most vacant land is particularly overzoned in that it contains excess regulations impeding the construction of smaller, more affordable housing. In the New York City suburbs of Fairfield County, Connecticut, for instance, 89% of land is classified for residential zoning of over one acre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Babcock|first=Richard|title=Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s|year=1973|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|author2=Fred Bosselman|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of regulation ensures that housing developments are of adequately low density. Such ordinances can collectively raise costs anywhere from 2 to 250% depending on their extensiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Babcock|first=Richard|title=Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s|year=1973|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|author2=Fred Bosselman|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With such high costs, lower-income groups are effectively shut out of the community's housing market.

===Direct cost increases===
Another means by which exclusionary zoning and related ordinances contribute to the exclusion certain groups is through direct cost impositions on community residents. As of recently, municipalities have established measures decreeing developers greater responsibility in the provision and maintenance of many basic neighborhood resources such as schools, parks, and other related services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Babcock|first=Richard|title=Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s|year=1973|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|author2=Fred Bosselman|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers incur excess costs for these aforementioned obligations which are then passed on to consumers in the form of fees or a financial [[bond (finance)|bond]]. For instance, many newer developments charge monthly recreational fees to fund community facilities. Also, restrictive zoning regulations have made the approval process for development more arduous and extensive. The increased bureaucracy and [[red tape]] has meant that developers now encounter a myriad of fees for [[variance (land use)]], a [[building permit]], a [[certificate of occupancy]], a [[filing (legal)]] cost, special permits and planned-unit development applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Babcock|first=Richard|title=Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s|year=1973|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|author2=Fred Bosselman|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do the fees diminish builder profits, but they also lengthen the development process which further drains company resources. Just as with the community resource requirements, these extra costs are inevitably delivered to housing purchasers. All of these fees accumulate and escalate unit prices to levels inaccessible for lower income people.

==Motivations==

===Fiscal===
The exclusion of certain types of individuals safeguards the community's public finances and the individual's [[property value]]. Lower-income residents generally demand more public resources than they contribute in taxes. Moreover, given the discrepancy between public service intake and taxation output, wealthier residents will need to subsidize these inhabitants, which forces more affluent inhabitants to pay extra taxes without receiving any direct additional benefits for themselves. Also, the entrance of lower-income residents threatens the property values of a community. As the neighborhood's median income levels decline, others may perceive the area as deteriorating and less desirable. Hence, the valuation of the unit may also experience a decline causing monetary losses to the homeowner. Property owners have been found to receive a payoff for the exclusion of low-income and minority households in the form of both increased property values and tax proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cervero|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Cervero|author2=Michael Duncan|title=Neighbourhood composition and residential land prices: does exclusion raise or lower values?|journal=Urban Studies|year=2004|volume=41|issue=2|pages=312|doi=10.1080/0042098032000165262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, in order to prevent this subsidization process and to augment their own monetary assets, upper-class individuals enact regulations prohibiting neighborhood accessibility for specific groups.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogart|first=William|title='What Big Teeth You Have!': Identifying the Motivations for Exclusionary Zoning|journal=Urban Studies|year=1993|volume=30|issue=10|pages=1669–1681|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=5&amp;sid=0e4e115f-d3bb-4321-881c-71073f521b1a%40sessionmgr112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=eoh&amp;AN=0323604|doi=10.1080/00420989320081651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Density externalities===
Exclusionary zoning's assurance of lower densities precludes some potential deleterious consequences associated with increased [[population density]]. More people in a community can result in more traffic congestion, which may interfere with the original inhabitants' quality of life.   Greater populations may lead to strains on potentially limited or vulnerable environmental resources such as water or air, if the urban form is designed in an automobile-dependent way.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Exclusion===
Some suburbanites also champion exclusionary zoning policies on the simple motivation of excluding unalike groups irrespective of any negative effects that they may impose. Some researchers partly attribute the policies to class or racial [[prejudice]] as individuals often prefer to live in homogeneous communities of people similar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ihlanfeldt|first=Keith|title=Exclusionary Land-use Regulations within Suburban Communities: A Review of Evidence and Policy Prescriptions|journal=Urban Studies|year=2004|volume=41|issue=2|pages=275|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/content/41/2/261.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1080/004209803200165244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others assert that race is merely a proxy and that upper classes and whites stereotype overall neighborhoods containing certain groups rather than the individual group members specifically. Such areas are stigmatized for their perceived correlation with high crime, low-quality schooling and low property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellen|first=Ingrid|title=Sharing America's Neighborhoods|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the entrance of heterogenous residents could have severe political ramifications. If enough lower-income individuals, who typically differ in political ideology, move into the community, then they may garner enough political power to overshadow the traditional contingent. As such, the original constituency is politically subjugated in the very community in which they used to enjoy power.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Thus, whites and upper classes divert those groups for their unsuitable characteristics, perceived link with negative neighborhood qualities and threat to community politics.

==Effects==
===Racial/economic stratification===
[[File:Chicago Race and Ethnicity 2010.jpg|thumb|Racial composition of Chicago area (2010 Census)]] Exclusionary zoning initiatives reduce the presence of both rental housing and ethnic minorities in an affected community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pendall|first=Rolf|title=Local Land Use Regulation and the Chain of Exclusion|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|year=2000|volume=66|issue=2|pages=125–142|doi=10.1080/01944360008976094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite federal court mandates prohibiting blatant racial and [[economic discrimination]], many of these less fortunate groups have encountered systematic obstacles preventing access to higher-income areas. Studies have demonstrated that higher-income and predominately-white jurisdictions generally adopt more restrictive land-use regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ihlanfeldt|first=Keith|title=Exclusionary Land-use Regulations within Suburban Communities: A Review of Evidence and Policy Prescriptions|journal=Urban Studies|year=2004|volume=41|issue=2|pages=269|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/content/41/2/261.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1080/004209803200165244}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, minority and lower-income groups are essentially locked into rigidly segregated neighborhoods. [[Residential segregation]] has remained constant from the 1960s to 1990s in spite of civil rights progress, primarily because of hindering policies that relegate certain groups to less-regulated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzdorf|first=Marsha|title=Locked Out of Paradise: Contemporary Exclusionary Zoning, the Supreme Court, and African Americans, 1970 to the Present|year=1997|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the prevalence of exclusionary land-use policies exacerbates social segregation by deterring any racial and economic integration.

Restrictive from the standpoint of economic efficiency, regulations that limit density also decrease the total housing supply of a region. With the lowered housing stock, market demand for the units is amplified thus raising prices. Along with reduced overall supply, the insistence on detached single-family homes also increases individual housing costs as homeowners must individually account for many land improvements (such as sidewalks, streets, water and sewer lines) that otherwise could be shared among more inhabitants as in denser communities. Studies in [[Maryland]] and the [[District of Columbia]] find that higher densities cut per capita water and sewer installation costs by 50% and road installation/maintenance by 67%.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock, Richard; Fred Bosselman (1973). Exclusionary Zoning: Land Use Regulation and Housing in the 1970s. New York: Praeger Publishers. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, residential developers and homeowners must implement expensive housing features to comply with jurisdictional zoning mandates. For instance, [[setback (land use)]] requirements that are commonly used throughout the United States increase total unit costs by 6.1 to 7.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Richard|title=Land Use Regulation and the Price of Housing in a Suburban Wisconsin County|journal=Journal of Housing Economics|year=1999|volume=8|issue=2|pages=144–159|doi=10.1006/jhec.1999.0243}}&lt;/ref&gt; All land-use factors contribute to mounting housing unit prices in comparison to less regulated communities. The communities specifically administering restrictive ordinances experience higher housing costs, like neighboring areas. Exclusionary zoning affects the overall regional housing market by reducing the total supply of units. As there are less available units, the demand for the units will rise causing more expensive housing across the area. Ultimately, the additional competition and resulting costs accumulate making regional markets with strictly regulated housing have 17% higher rents and 51% higher housing prices than do leniently governed areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malpezzi|first=Stephen|title=Housing Prices, Externalities, and Regulation in U.S. Metropolitan Areas|journal=Journal of Housing Research|year=1996|volume=7|issue=2|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, housing regulations evidently have significant impacts on both the specific community and overall region's housing expenditure.

===Education===
Education has been proven to be vitally important to human welfare, as it can promote higher incomes, greater labor market performance, a higher social status, increased societal participation and improved health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothwell|first=Jonathan|title=Housing Costs, Zoning, and Access to High- Scoring Schools|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/4/19%20school%20inequality%20rothwell/0419_school_inequality_rothwell.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with individual benefits, [[educational attainment in the United States]] also has the ability to foster greater regional and national economic prosperity as an educated populace can better adapt to global economic trends and conditions. Nevertheless, there is a stark [[education inequality]] between various groups as the average low-income student attends a school that scores on the 42nd percentile on state exams while the average middle and upper-income student attends a school that scores on the 61st percentile on state exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothwell|first=Jonathan|title=Housing Costs, Zoning, and Access to High- Scoring Schools|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/4/19%20school%20inequality%20rothwell/0419_school_inequality_rothwell.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast differences in attainment cannot be accounted for by assuming inheritable group differences, as empirical research has demonstrated that simple genetic contrasts are insufficient to explain education disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Jams|title=Searching for Justice: The Discovery of IQ Gains Over Time|journal=American Psychologist|year=1999|volume=54|issue=1|page=12|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, environmental factors involving school quality also contribute to educational achievement. Regions with much economic segregation, which, as noted earlier, partially stems from exclusionary zoning, also have the largest gaps in test scores between the low-income and other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothwell|first=Jonathan|title=Housing Costs, Zoning, and Access to High- Scoring Schools|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/4/19%20school%20inequality%20rothwell/0419_school_inequality_rothwell.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low-income students are trapped in inadequate schooling since their economic conditions limit access of high-performing schools and education. Across the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, costs of housing is 2.4 times higher for units zoned to higher-performing public schools than to those zoned to lower-performing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothwell|first=Jonathan|title=Housing Costs, Zoning, and Access to High- Scoring Schools|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/4/19%20school%20inequality%20rothwell/0419_school_inequality_rothwell.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, exclusionary zoning serves to channel lower income students into lower performing schools thereby prompting educational achievement differences.

The '''Exhibition of National Portraits''' was a series of three grand exhibitions in London at the [[South Kensington Museum]] between 1866 and 1868. The first one opened in April 1866, and contained portraits of people from or linked to the history of England until the [[Glorious Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Redgrave|first=Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Redgrave|title=Catalogue of the first special exhibition of national portraits ending with the reign of King James, the Second, on loan to the South Kensington museum|year=1866|publisher= Strangeways and Walden|pages=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8IrAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Exhibition+of+National+Portraits%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second exhibition displayed portraits between the Glorious Revolution and 1800, with the final exhibition showing portraits from people living after 1800, including living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Redgrave|first=Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Redgrave|title=Catalogue of the third and concluding exhibition of national portraits commencing with the fortieth year of the reign of George the Third and ending with the year MDCCCLXVII.

The third exhibition for example showed 9 works attributed to  Hans Holbein, 9 works by [[Anthony van Dyck]], 27 by Reynolds and 34 by Gainsborough, even though they should normally have been shown in the previous exhibitions.

The 1866 exhibition, lasting from 16 April until 18 August, had 73,156 visitors for 1035 pictures, including works by [[Hans Memling]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. The 1867 exhibition, held between 2 May and 31 August, showed 866 portraits, many of them by [[Joshua Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough]], and received 49,385 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report. 3rd-30th|year=1868|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67cEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq=%22Exhibition+of+National+Portraits%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bI4sTJHWO4O88gbD1tH3DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Exhibition%20of%20National%20Portraits%22&amp;f=false|author=Science and art department|accessdate=1 July 2010|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third exhibition opened on 13 April 1868, with 951 portraits.

'''''Flora of China''''' is a scientific publication aimed at describing the plants native to [[China]].

The project is a collaborative scientific effort to publish the first modern English-language account of the 31,000 species of [[vascular plants]] of China. This number includes about 8,000 species of medicinal and economically important plants and about 7,500 species of trees and shrubs.

''Flora of China'' describes and otherwise documents these species. ''Flora of China'' is an English-language revision of ''Flora Republicae Popularis Sinicae'' (FRPS), with taxonomy reflecting the current understanding of each group. The sequence of families is a modified [[Englerian system]], similar to that used in FRPS; however, the circumscription of some families reflects the present understanding of the groups. It is intended that all the vascular plants of China will be covered, including descriptions, identification keys, essential synonymy, [[phenology]], provincial distribution in China, brief statements on extra-Chinese distribution, and remarks regarding the circumscription of problematic taxa.

''Flora of China Illustrations'' series, a companion set of volumes, illustrated ca. 65% of species documented in ''Flora of China''. Many of the illustration volumes are largest collections of line drawings of related families/genera ever published in the world.

In addition, [[botanical name]]s, literature, geographical distribution inside and outside China, and endemism status are available in the online Flora of China Checklist. This checklist and Missouri Botanical Garden's Tropicos database together provide interfaces for querying the nomenclatural and distributional data and illustrations.

The data from the published volumes are presented online as separate treatments of families, genera, and species. These treatments are searchable in eFloras on names and various other information. Interactive identification keys are available for large genera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=2|title=Flora of China @ efloras.org|website=www.efloras.org|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Close international collaboration on the research, writing, review, and editing characterizes the production of the ''Flora''. Chinese authors work together with their non-Chinese colleagues from 29 countries (Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, UK, Ukraine, and USA). The resulting draft is then reviewed by Chinese botanists, the Flora of China Editorial Committee, family specialists from around the world, and advisors on the floras of regions neighboring China to produce the best possible treatments.

The project has seven non-Chinese editorial centers at [[Harvard University Herbaria]], the [[California Academy of Sciences]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]], the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], the [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] (Paris), and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], the organizational and coordination center of the project. The four Chinese centers are the [[Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences|CAS Institute of Botany]] (Beijing), the [[Kunming Institute of Botany]], the [[Jiangsu Institute of Botany]] (Nanjing), and the [[South China Botanical Garden]] (Guangzhou). Some 478 scientists from throughout the world have cooperated in the preparation of individual treatments in the ''Flora''.

[[Kai Larsen]] (1926&amp;ndash;2012) was one of the advisors for the series.

[[File:FroissartOurs.jpg|thumb|A detail from the margin of a page]]
The '''Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse''' (BnF Fr 2643-6) is a heavily illustrated deluxe [[illuminated manuscript]] in four volumes, containing a French text of [[Froissart's Chronicles|Froissart's ''Chronicles'']], written and illuminated in the first half of the 1470s in [[Bruges]], [[Flanders]], in modern Belgium.  The text of Froissart's ''Chronicles'' is  preserved in more than 150 manuscript copies.  This is one of the most lavishly illuminated examples, commissioned by [[Louis of Gruuthuse]], a [[Flemings|Flemish]] nobleman and bibliophile. 

The four volumes are now in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris as '''BnF, MSS Français 2643-6''', and contain 110 miniatures of various sizes painted by some of the best Brugeois artists of the day. The page size is approximately 44 x 33&amp;nbsp;cm, with miniatures of various sizes, from 3/4 page and half-page, to [[historiated initial]]s.  The French text is in two columns and there is extensive marginal decoration of scrolling stems and other plant motifs, with some human and animal figures among them.

==Artists==
[[File:Fire carles6.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bal des Ardents]] by the [[Master of Anthony of Burgundy]], from BnF Fr 2646, shows his qualities well]]
'''Loiset Lyédet''' did the sixty [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in the first two volumes. He was a very successful, if somewhat formulaic, illuminator, working mainly on secular manuscripts for [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy]] (Philip the Good) and his court.  He probably used assistants, but it is hard to detect separate hands in his work.  

The last two volumes, which are in general finer, were worked on by the anonymous illuminators known as the [[Master of Anthony of Burgundy]] (identified by some writers with Philippe de Mazerolles), the '''Master of [[Margaret of York]]''', and the '''Master of the Dresden Prayer Book''', the last as an assistant to the Master of Anthony of Burgundy.   These masters are named after prominent works or patrons of theirs.  It appears that the project was split in half from an early stage, as the scribes who wrote the text and the style of border decoration (also the work of specialists) differ between volumes 1-2 and 3-4.  

The large miniatures by the Master of Anthony of Burgundy are especially sophisticated in style, and those by the young Master of the Dresden Prayer Book (above) are notable for "their startlingly ambitious palette and combination of colors, agitated and vibrantly modelled drapery, an apparently inexhaustible range of well-designed figure poses, and challenging placement of figures within complex spaces" (McKendrick).  All the illustrations below are from the first two volumes, unless otherwise stated.

[[Louis of Gruuthuse]] (1427–1492) was born and lived in Bruges and was an important member of the court of Philip the Good.  He appears to have been the second largest purchaser in the period, after Philip himself, of [[illuminated manuscript]]s from the best Flemish workshops, then at their peak of success.  He had a book collection totalling about 190 volumes, mostly secular in content, of which over half were contemporary illuminated copies.  This made his collection over twice the size of the contemporary English Royal collection.  Louis was in fact one of the last people to commission new manuscripts on such a scale; he probably began collecting books in the late 1460s, with many of his major commissions dating from the 1470s.  In some cases even from that decade the titles already existed in printed form, and by the end of his life most titles could be bought printed, and Flemish illumination, especially of secular works, was in deep decline.  Froissart's Chronicles were not printed until about 1498, in Paris. 

He incorporated portraits of himself in miniatures in several books (but not these volumes); an extra figure, wearing the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], appears in his copies but not in similar compositions in other copies of the same works.&lt;ref&gt;T Kren &amp; S McKendrick (eds), Illuminating the Renaissance: The Triumph of Flemish Manuscript Painting in Europe, p 68 &amp; 266 Getty Museum/Royal Academy of Arts, 2003, {{ISBN|1-903973-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of his volumes, like this set, passed to King [[Louis XII of France]], and are now in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].  King Louis painted his arms over those of Louis de Gruuthuse on some pages in this set (and in other books had the Burgundian collar of the Fleece over-painted on the de Gruuthuse figures).  The current bindings are later (17th or 18th century), but traces of what were probably the original blue velvet bindings remain.

Like the "Harley Froissart" ([[British Library]] Harley MSS 4379-4380), which is the most fully illustrated of all illuminated Froissarts, this is an example of a notable resurgence of interest in Froissart's work from the late 1460s onwards; the earliest parts of the Chronicles were by then over a century old, and covered a period beginning 140 years before.

The '''Cycladian frying pan''' (formerly Karlsruhe, Badisches Landesmuseum, inventory number 75/11) is an ornately decorated stone object from the [[Bronze Age]] [[Cycladic civilization]]. It dates to the Early Cycladic period, between the 27th and 24th centuries BC (EC II). The find spot is unknown, except that it originated on the [[Cyclades|Cycladic island]] of [[Naxos]]. The item derived from an [[Grave robbery|illegal excavation]] and was acquired in 1975 by the [[Badisches Landesmuseum]] in [[Karlsruhe]]. On 6 June 2014 it was [[Art repatriation|repatriated]] to the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] of [[Athens]], [[Greece]].

== Description ==
The frying pan is a round dish with a diameter of 17.5&amp;nbsp;cm and a depth of 2.8&amp;nbsp;cm. There is a 2.2&amp;nbsp;cm long handle in the shape of a pie slice. It is made from [[greenschist]], which derives from the Cycladic island of Naxos.&lt;ref name=blm2011-307&gt;Claus Hattler (Ed.): ''Kykladen - Lebenswelten einer frühgriechischen Kultur''. Primus Verlag, Darmstadt 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-86312-016-0}}, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

The front side, with a flat bottom and narrow, recessed edge, is undecorated. It is the back side which makes the object stand out. This surface is surrounded by a [[Chip carving|chip]] patterned band, even on the handle. The area inside this band is filled with a pattern of interwoven spirals. A single large spiral in the centre is connected by double strands to seven medium-sized spirals surrounding it. These seven spirals are surrounded by an outer row of fourteen yet smaller spirals. Each of the seven medium spirals are connected to two of their neighbours and to three of the spirals in the outer row. The spirals on the outer edge are each connected to their two neighbours and are formed of three or four spirals, depending on whether they are linked to one or two of the medium-sized spirals. On the handle, double and triple strands form a crisscross pattern with triangles.&lt;ref name=blm1976-517&gt;Jürgen Thimme (Ed.): ''Kunst und Kultur der Kykladeninseln im 3. Jahrtausend vor Christus.'' C. F. Müller 1976, {{ISBN|3-7880-9568-7}}, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer surface of the bowl is a bit weathered, slightly knocked and has a few scratches on it. On the inside there are flecks of [[Calcareous sinter|sinter]]; a thick layer of sinter was removed from the decorated back side in modern times, revealing the patterns now visible.&lt;ref name=blm1976-517 /&gt;

Patterns of interlocking spirals are often incised in Cycladic pottery, but in stone they are found on only a few items, particularly [[pyxis|pyxides]]. An example was discovered in excavations on the island of [[Amorgos]] and acquired for the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]] by [[Georg Ferdinand Dümmler]].&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Antikensammlung, [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=694886&amp;viewType=detailView Inv. Misc. 8102] (Link to the digital collection of the Staatliche Museen in Berlin, with image)&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the work and the very carefully executed pattern ought to be attributed to an experienced and especially talented artisan. The frying pan must have been a prominent prestige object for its owner.&lt;ref name=blm2011-307 /&gt;

In the [[Keros-Syros culture|Keros-Syros phase]] of the Cycladic civilization, to which this piece is attributed, ceramic frying pans are very common. In addition a very few are known which are made out of marble. But the only other example made out of stone is an undecorated example first published by [[Nikolaos M. Kontoleon]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=blm1976-102&gt;Pat Getz-Preziosi, ''Frühkykladische Steingefäße''. in Jürgen Thimme (Ed.): ''Kunst und Kultur der Kykladeninseln im 3. Jahrtausend vor Christus.'' C. F. Müller, Karlsruhe 1976, {{ISBN|3-7880-9568-7}}, pp. 97–110, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; This frying pan is thus unique in material and execution and is therefore seen as a "masterpiece of Cycladic art." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John E. Coleman |title="Frying Pans" of the Early Bronze Age Aegean|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume= 89|number =2|year=1985|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The use and purpose of Cycladic frying pans is unclear. They are mostly known as grave goods in especially rich graves. [[Christos Tsountas]] originally suggested that they were mirrors. According to him, the flat bowl would have been filled with water and the user would have been able to see their reflection in them.&lt;ref name=blm1976-102 /&gt; Experiments do not support this theory, since water does not produce a mirror effect and, while olive oil does work it is believed to have been too rare and expensive for this purpose in the early Cycladic period.&lt;ref name=blm2011-100ff&gt;Bernhard Steinmann, ''Spiegel oder Spendenschale?'' in Claus Hattler (ed.), ''Kykladen - Lebenswelten einer frühgriechischen Kultur''. Primus Verlag, Darmstadt 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-86312-016-0}}, pp. 100–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

On account of several finds in the cemetery of Chalandriani on the island of [[Syros]] and small examples of clay and bone with paint residue, Nikolaos M. Kontoleon suggested that they could have been [[Palette (painting)|palette]]s for the creation of paints from crushed pigments.&lt;ref name=blm1976-102 /&gt;

The decoration of the frying pans recall water, almost without exception. Spirals, ships and stars are usual. The ceramic frying pans often have two handles, projecting from the body with a women's genitals incised in the triangular space between them. On account of this, it has been suggested that they received [[libation]]s in some kind of [[fertility rite]];&lt;ref name=blm2011-307 /&gt; sea, Sun and femininity may have been seen as symbols of the fertility of the body and the sea, which was essential for human life.&lt;ref name=blm2011-100ff /&gt;

A further possibility was raised by [[Christos Doumas]] in 1993, who suggested that they were used to process [[sea salt]]. Doumas connected the issue of trade and exchange of goods before the invention of money with this, proposing that salt might have served as a valuable material, while leaving no archaeologically detectable traces.&lt;ref name=blm2011-100ff /&gt;

== Provenance ==
In 1975, in the lead up to the 1976 exhibition ''"Kunst der Kykladen"'' (Art of the Cyclades), the then curator of the Badisches Landesmuseum, [[Jürgen Thimme]], bought the frying pan from an art dealer for 35,000 [[German Mark|marks]]&lt;ref&gt;Südwestrundfunk: [http://www.swr.de/swr2/programm/sendungen/kontext/illegaler-handel-mit-antiker-kunst/-/id=4352076/did=13290156/nid=4352076/179yfxz/index.html Kriminelle Archäologie: Warum fast der komplette Handel mit antiker Kunst illegal ist]. SWR2, broadcast of 6 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; along with a female [[Cycladic figurine (Karlsruhe 75/49)]] and other artefacts. The frying pan did not derive from a legal excavation, but the vendor guaranteed that the object had been acquired before 1970, although he offered no evidence and remained anonymous. In any case, an illegal excavation violated Greek law and the object could only have been removed from the country by smuggling. But since the original acquisition took place before 1970, the [[UNESCO]] ''Convention for the Banning and Prevention of Illegal Import, Export and Sale of Cultural Artefacts'' enacted in 1970 would not have been violated and the purchase would have been legal under international law. In addition, the German Republic only signed the convention in 2007.

The exhibition in the Karlsruhe Schloss in 1976 featured by far the widest collection of Cycladic objects displayed up till that time. In accord with the then prevailing view in Museum circles and with the support of the [[International Council of Museums]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Petrasch]], "Zur Ausstellung," in Thimme, 1976 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; loans from international museums and a number of private collections were displayed without scrutinising their provenance.&lt;ref name=blm1976-517 /&gt; The Greek antiquities department objected to this at the time of the exhibition first being publicised and therefore refused to make any pieces from their state collections available for the exhibition. However, the then leader of the [[Ephorate for Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities|antiquities department of the Cyclades]], Christos Doumas wrote the chapter for the exhibition catalogue on the archaeological exploration of Cycladic culture and spoke in it about graverobbing.&lt;ref&gt;Christos Doumas, "Die archäologische Erforschung der frühen Bronzezeit auf den Kykladen," in Jürgen Thimme (Ed.): ''Kunst und Kultur der Kykladeninseln im 3. Jahrtausend vor Christus''. C. F. Müller, Karlsruhe 1976, {{ISBN|3-7880-9568-7}}, pp. 190–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Germany acceded to the UNESCO convention in 2007, museums found themselves in a problematic situation - especially the Badische Landesmuseum. In their second great international exhibition in 2011, ''Kykladen - Lebenswelten einer frühgriechischen Kultur'' (Cyclades - Life-world of an Early Greek Culture), the Landesmuseum specifically identified the provenance of the exhibits and displayed only objects from national and international collection which disclosed the origin of the pieces. Objects from private collections were not displayed. But the Greek authorities were not satisfied with their handling of the issues and again refused to loan items.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Siebenmorgen, "Vorwort" in Claus Hattler (Ed.), ''Kykladen - Lebenswelten einer frühgriechischen Kultur''. Primus Verlag 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-86312-016-0}}, pp. 6–9, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long negotiations followed and on 6 June 2014, the frying pan, along with figurine 75/49 were returned to the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]] by the State Secretary of the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of Scholarship, Research &amp; Art, [[Harald Siebenmorgen]], in the company of the Greek Minister of Culture [[Panagiotis Panagiotopoulos]]. The current value of the frying pan has been estimated to lie in the millions of [[Euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/service/presse/pressemitteilung/pid/rueckgabe-von-raubgrabkunst-an-griechenland/ Pressemitteilung: Rückgabe von Raubgrabkunst an Griechenland] Ministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst, Baden-Württemberg, 6.

'''''Guinness World Records: The Videogame''''' is a [[Party video game|party]] [[video game]] based on the [[Guinness World Records]] series of books of world records. Developed by [[TT Fusion]] and published by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]], the game was released on November 7, 2008 in Europe and Australasia, and on November 11, 2008 in North America. The game involves attempting to beat real-life world records through minigames. The game saw mixed to positive reviews upon release, and was considered better than most minigame compilations that were on [[Nintendo]] consoles at the time.

== Gameplay ==
''Guinness World Records: The Videogame'' contains 36 mini-games based on real-world record attempts. The player can select 12 avatars, and can travel around a globe- like map that allows them to select minigames. Beating minigames allows the player to unlock more minigames and outfits for their avatars. Minigames involve attempting to beat a world record as fast as possible, such as building the highest skyscraper in a [[Tetris]] style minigame, attempting the world's highest [[BMX]] stunt jump, and eating a [[jumbo jet]] as fast as possible. The player's score is placed on a scoreboard at the end of the round, and is then compared over the internet to other player's scores. The game shows trivia about real-life world records on the menu and during loading screens.&lt;ref name=EuroG&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/guinness-world-records-the-videogame-review?page=2 |title=Guinness World Records: The Videogame Review |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |last=Parkin |first=Simon |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NWR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiMola|first1=Franchesca|title=Guinness World Records: The Videogame- review|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/17508/guinness-world-records-the-videogame-wii|website=Nintendo World Report|publisher=NINWR|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the DS and Wii version for [[IGN]], Mark Thomas praised the games strange minigames, comparing it positively to [[Warioware]], before ending the review with, "[...] But even then there are a couple of more fully-fledged gems in this pack that are addictive enough to warrant keeping the game handy long after you've been declared the best, the tallest, the strongest and the smartest with every record there is.".&lt;ref name=IGN&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/932/932458p1.html |title=IGN: Guinness World Records: The Videogame Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |last=Thomas |first=Lucas M. |date=20 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216025539/http://wii.ign.com/articles/932/932458p1.html |archivedate=16 December 2008 |accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for [[Nintendo World Report]] and reviewing both versions, Francesca DiMola found the games lack of similarity to actual World Records disappointing and the games boring, saying, "The lack of identity and direction is unfulfilling, and while a select group of mini-games are entertaining and original, many of them feel generic and bland.".&lt;ref name="NWR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiMola|first1=Franchesca|title=Guinness World Records: The Videogame- review|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/17508/guinness-world-records-the-videogame-wii|website=Nintendo World Report|publisher=NINWR|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for [[Eurogamer]] and reviewing the Wii version, Simon Parkin found the idea to be interesting, ending the review with "[...] Guinness World Records is the best mini-game collection we've played on the Wii, in part because of the content but principally because of its context."&lt;ref name=EuroG&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/guinness-world-records-the-videogame-review?page=2 |title=Guinness World Records: The Videogame Review |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |last=Parkin |first=Simon |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Helm Identification Guides''''' are a series of books that identify groups of [[bird]]s. The series include two types of guides, those that are:
* Taxonomic, dealing with a particular family of birds on a worldwide scale&amp;mdash;most early Helm Guides were this type, as well as many more-recent ones, although some later books deal with identification of such groups on a regional scale only (e.g., ''The Gulls Guide,'' which covers only species in Europe, Asia, and North America)
* Geographic, including all bird species in an area (e.g., ''The Birds of the West Indies'')

Early volumes were sometimes published under the '''[[Croom Helm]]''' or '''[[Christopher Helm Publishers|Christopher Helm]]''' imprints. In addition, a parallel set of guides, very similar in design, was published by '''[[Pica Press]]''' in the 1990s (marked '''''Pica''''' in the list below); Pica was later absorbed into [[A &amp; C Black]] (now part of [[Bloomsbury Publishing Plc]]), and all guides are now marketed as a single series.

Several of the books have won the [[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]] ''Bird Book of the Year'' award.
A list of titles in the series, in chronological order of publication, is as follows:

'''Implicational hierarchy''', in [[linguistics]], is a chain of implicational [[linguistic universal|universals]]. A set of chained universals is schematically shown as in (1):

(1)	'''A &lt; B &lt; C &lt; D'''

It can be reformulated in the following way: If a language has property D, then it also has properties A, B, and C; if a language has a property C, then it also has properties A and B, etc. In other words, the implicational hierarchy defines the possible combinations of properties A, B, C, and D as listed in matrix (2):
{| class="wikitable"
! width="50"| ||width="25"|A||width="25"|B||width="25"|C||width="25"|D
|-
| Type 1: || align='center'|+ || align='center'|+ ||align='center'|+ ||align='center'|+
|-
| Type 2: || align='center'|+ || align='center'|+ ||align='center'|+ ||align='center'|-
|-
| Type 3: || align='center'|+ || align='center'|+ ||align='center'|- ||align='center'|-
|-
| Type 4: || align='center'|+ || align='center'|- ||align='center'|- ||align='center'|-
|-
| Type 5: || align='center'|- || align='center'|- ||align='center'|- ||align='center'|-
|}

Implicational hierarchies are a useful tool in capturing linguistic generalizations 
pertaining the different components of the language. They are found in all subfields of grammar.

==Phonology==
(3) is an example of an implicational hierarchy concerning the distribution of nasal phonemes across languages, which concerns dental/alveolar, bilabial, and palatal voiced nasals, 
respectively: 
 
(3)  '''{{IPA|/n/}}     &lt;  {{IPA|/m/}}     &lt;  {{IPA|/ɲ/}}'''

This hierarchy defines the following possible combinations of dental/alveolar, bilabial, and palatal voiced nasals in 
the phoneme inventory of a language:

(4) 
{| class="wikitable"
! width="50"| ||width="30"|{{IPA|/n/}} ||width="30"|{{IPA|/m/}}||width="30"|{{IPA|/ɲ/}}
|-
| Type 1: || align='center'|{{IPA|/n/}} || align='center'|{{IPA|/m/}} ||align='center'|{{IPA|/ɲ/}}
|-
| Type 2: || align='center'|{{IPA|/n/}} || align='center'|{{IPA|/m/}} || align='center'|-
|-
| Type 3: || align='center'|{{IPA|/n/}} || align='center'|- ||align='center'|-
|}
In other words, the hierarchy implies that there are no languages with {{IPA|/ɲ/}} but without {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, or with {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} but without  {{IPA|/n/}}.

==Morphology==
[[grammatical number|Number]] marking provides an example of implicational hierarchies in morphology.

(5) '''Number: singular &lt; plural &lt; dual &lt; trial / paucal'''

On the one hand, the hierarchy implies that no language distinguishes a trial unless having a dual, and no language has dual without a plural. On the other hand, the hierarchy provides implications for the morphological marking: if the plural is coded with a certain number of morphemes, then the dual is coded with at least as many morphemes.

==Syntax==
Implicational hierarchies also play a role in syntactic phenomena. For instance, in some languages (e.g. [[Tangut people|Tangut]]) the transitive verb agrees not with a subject, or the object, but with the syntactic argument which is higher on the person hierarchy.

(5) '''Person: first &lt; second &lt; third'''&lt;br/&gt;

The '''''Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch''''' ('''''IEW'''''; "Indo-European Etymological Dictionary") was published in 1959 by the Austrian-German comparative linguist and Celtic languages expert [[Julius Pokorny]]. It is an updated and slimmed-down reworking of the three-volume ''Vergleichendes Wörterbuch der indogermanischen Sprachen'' (1927–1932, by [[Alois Walde]] and Julius Pokorny).

Both of these works aim to provide an overview of the lexical knowledge of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] accumulated through the early 20th century. The ''IEW'' is now significantly outdated, especially as it was conservative even when it was written, ignoring the now integral [[laryngeal theory]], and hardly including any [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] material.

The goal of this article is to present a complete [[bibliography]] of the books written or edited by [[Isaac Asimov]], arranged alphabetically.&lt;ref name=book&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/asimov_catalogue.html "A Catalogue of Isaac Asimov's Books."] ''www.asimovonline.com.'' Retrieved November 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;   Since Asimov is one of the most prolific authors of all time{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}, and since he engaged in many collaborations with other authors, this is a substantial research project. This list may not yet be complete. The total number of books listed here is over 500.  Asimov died in 1992 at age 72. A small number of these books were published posthumously.

{{Use British English|date=February 2017}}
Many '''motifs''' are used in traditional '''[[kilims]]''', handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish [[Anatolia]] in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the [[evil eye]]. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.

In these tribal societies, women wove kilims at different stages of their lives, choosing themes appropriate to their own circumstances. Some of the motifs used are widespread across Anatolia and sometimes across other regions of West Asia, but patterns vary between tribes and villages, and rugs often expressed personal and social meaning.

==Context==
&lt;!--[[File:Tree of Life (Hayat Agaci).JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Tree of Life]] (Hayat Aǧacı, top and bottom of image) symbolizes the desire for immortality. Each Tree of Life symbol here contains at its centre an Earring (Küpe) motif, a wedding present symbolizing the desire for marriage.]]--&gt;
[[File:Kilim slit weave.jpg|thumb|upright|Diagram of Kilim slit weave technique, showing how the weft threads of each colour are wound back from the colour boundary, leaving a slit]]
{{main|Kilim}}

A Turkish [[kilim]] is a flat-woven rug from [[Anatolia]]. Although the name kilim is sometimes used loosely in the West to include all type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile [[carpet]]s, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, [[soumak]] and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only warp and weft threads. Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp threads, leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A. S. |edition=1st |date=1998 |pages=4–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create a sharp pattern, weavers usually end each pattern element at a particular thread, winding the coloured weft threads back around the same warps, leaving a narrow gap or slit. These are prized by collectors for the crispness of their decoration. The motifs on kilims woven in this way are constrained to be somewhat angular and geometric.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book | last=Davies | first=Peter | year=2000 | title=The Visual Language of the Anatolian Kilim  |work=Antique kilims of Anatolia | publisher=[[W.W. Norton &amp; Co.]] | isbn=978-0-393-73047-0 | pages=Chapter 5 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In tribal societies, kilim were woven by women at different stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an earring, a trousseau chest, a jug, a hook.&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taskiran&gt;{{cite web |last1=Taskiran |first1=Nurdan |title=Reading Motifs on Kilims: A Semiological Approach to Symbolic Meaning |url=http://docplayer.net/24199186-Reading-motifs-on-kilims-a-semiological-approach-to-symbolic-meaning.html |publisher=Yeditepe.edu.tr |accessdate=22 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029093031/http://docplayer.net/24199186-Reading-motifs-on-kilims-a-semiological-approach-to-symbolic-meaning.html |archivedate=29 October 2017 |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meanings==
[[File:Elibelinde2.svg|thumb|left|The ''{{lang|tr|[[Elibelinde]]}}'' or hands-on-hips motif is a stylized female figure, symbolizing motherhood and [[fertility]].]]

The meanings expressed in kilims derive both from the individual motifs used, and by their pattern and arrangement in the rug as a whole.&lt;ref name=Taskiran/&gt; A few symbols are widespread across Anatolia as well as other regions including [[Persia]] and the Caucasus; others are confined to Anatolia.&lt;ref name=Arastan&gt;{{cite web |title=Carpet Motifs: A Beginner's Guide |url=http://www.arastan.com/journey/carpet-motifs-beginners-guide |publisher=Arastan&lt;!--was a shop, now closed--&gt; |accessdate=22 January 2016 |date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An especially widely used motif is the ''{{lang|tr|[[Elibelinde]]}}'', a stylized female figure, symbolizing motherhood and [[fertility]].&lt;ref name=kilimElibelinde&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kilim.com/about_kilims/motifs/hands_on_hips.asp | title=Hands on Hips - Elibelinde | accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Unal&gt;{{cite web |last1=Unal |first1=Sahika |title=Symbolic Meanings and Characteristics of Anatolian Kilims |url=http://www.crystallography.fr/mathcryst/pdf/istanbul/Unal.pdf |accessdate=22 January 2016 |date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other motifs express the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves with the wolf's mouth or the wolf's foot motif ({{lang-tr|Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi}}), or for safety from the sting of the [[scorpion]] ({{lang-tr|Akrep|links=no}}).&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt; Several protective motifs, such as those for the [[dragon]] ({{lang-tr|Ejder|links=no}}), scorpion, and spider (sometimes called the crab or tortoise by carpet specialists) share the same basic diamond shape with a hooked or stepped boundary, often making them very difficult to distinguish.&lt;ref name=Arastan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anquetil&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anquetil |first1=Jacques |title=Carpets Techniques Traditions and History |date=2003 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=978-1-84430-012-9 |pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several motifs hope for the safety of the weaver's family from the [[evil eye]] ({{lang-tr|Nazarlık|links=no}}, also used as a motif), which could be divided into four with a cross symbol ({{lang-tr|Haç|links=no}}), or averted with the symbol of a hook ({{lang-tr|Çengel|links=no}}), a human eye ({{lang-tr|Göz|links=no}}), or an [[amulet]] ({{lang-tr|Muska|links=no}}; often, a triangular package containing a sacred verse).&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kilim&gt;{{cite web |title=Kilim Motifs |url=https://www.kilim.com/kilim-wiki/kilim-motifs |publisher=Kilim.com |accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpet expert Jon Thompson explains that such an amulet woven into a rug is not a theme: to the weaver, it actually is an amulet, conferring protection by its presence. In his words, to people in the village and tribal cultures that wove kilims, "the device in the rug has a materiality, it generates a field of force able to interact with other unseen forces and is not merely an intellectual abstraction."&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Jon |title=Carpets from the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia |date=1988 |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |isbn=0-7126-2501-1 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Azeri carpet (Sirvan group).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Similar motifs are sometimes used in pile carpets, such as the rows of Solomon's seal stars, rows of hooks, ram's horns, and elibelinde motifs in this [[Shirvan]] carpet from Azerbaijan.]]

Other motifs symbolised fertility, as with the [[trousseau chest]] motif ({{lang-tr|Sandıklı|links=no}}), or the explicit fertility ({{lang-tr|Bereket|links=no}}) motif. The motif for running water ({{lang-tr|Su Yolu|links=no}}) similarly depicts the resource literally.&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt; The desire to tie a family or lovers together could be depicted with a [[fetter]] motif ({{lang-tr|Bukaǧı|links=no}}). Similarly, a tombstone motif may indicate not simply death, but the desire to die rather than to part from the beloved.&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt; Several motifs represented the desire for good luck and happiness, as for instance the bird ({{lang-tr|Kuş|links=no}}) and the star or [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]] ({{lang-tr|Yıldız|links=no}}). The oriental symbol of [[Yin/Yang]] is used for love and unison ({{lang-tr|Aşk ve Birleşim|links=no}}).&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt; Among the motifs used late in life, the [[Tree of Life]] ({{lang-tr|Hayat Aǧacı|links=no}}) symbolizes the desire for immortality. Many of the plants used to represent the Tree of Life can also be seen as symbols of fruitfulness, fertility, and abundance. Thus the [[pomegranate]], a tree whose fruits carry many seeds, implies the desire for many children.&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt;

Symbols are often combined, as when the feminine elibelinde and the masculine ram's horn are each drawn twice, overlapping at the centre, forming a figure (some variants of the ''{{lang|tr|Bereket}}'' or fertility motif&lt;ref name=Arastan/&gt;) of the sacred union of the principles of the sexes.&lt;ref name=Dervish&gt;{{cite web |last1=Özyurt |first1=Üzeyir |title=The Language of Kilim of Anatolia |url=http://www.dervishbrothers.com/kilimsymbology/Kilimingilizce.pdf |publisher=Dervish Brothers |accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motifs==
All the motifs can vary considerably in appearance according to the weaver. Colours, sizes and shapes can all be chosen according to taste and the tradition in a given village or tribe; further, motifs are often combined, as illustrated in the photographs above.&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt; To give some idea of this variability, a few alternative forms are shown in the table.

The '''LINPACK [[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]]''' are a measure of a system's [[floating point]] computing power. Introduced by [[Jack Dongarra]], they measure how fast a computer solves a dense ''n'' by ''n'' [[system of linear equations]] ''Ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'', which is a common task in [[engineering]].

The latest version of these benchmarks is used to build the [[TOP500]] list, ranking the world's most powerful supercomputers.&lt;ref name="top500"/&gt;

The aim is to approximate how fast a computer will perform when solving real problems. It is a simplification, since no single computational task can reflect the overall performance of a computer system. Nevertheless, the LINPACK benchmark performance can provide a good correction over the peak performance provided by the manufacturer. The peak performance is the maximal theoretical performance a computer can achieve, calculated as the machine's frequency, in cycles per second, times the number of operations per cycle it can perform. The actual performance will always be lower than the peak performance.&lt;ref name="hplpaper"/&gt; The [[Computer performance|performance of a computer]] is a complex issue that depends on many interconnected variables. The performance measured by the LINPACK benchmark consists of the number of 64-bit floating-point operations, generally additions and multiplications, a computer can perform per second, also known as [[FLOPS]]. However, a computer's performance when running actual applications is likely to be far behind the maximal performance it achieves running the appropriate LINPACK benchmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of these benchmarks comes from the [[LINPACK]] package, a collection of algebra [[Fortran]] subroutines widely used in the 1980s, and initially tightly linked to the LINPACK benchmark. The [[LINPACK]] package has been since then replaced by other libraries.

==History==
The LINPACK benchmark report appeared first in 1979 as an appendix to the [[LINPACK]] user's manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LINPACK was designed to help users estimate the time required by their systems to solve a problem using the [[LINPACK]] package, by extrapolating the performance results obtained by 23 different computers solving a matrix problem of size 100.

This matrix size was chosen due to memory and CPU limitations at that time:

* 10,000 floating-point entries from -1 to 1 are randomly generated to fill in a general, dense matrix,
* then, [[LU decomposition]] with partial pivoting is used for the timing.

Over the years, additional versions with different problem sizes, like matrices of order 300 and 1000, and constraints were released, allowing new optimization opportunities as hardware architectures started to implement matrix-vector and matrix-matrix operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel processing was also introduced in the LINPACK Parallel benchmark in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name = "hplpaper"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
solving problems of arbitrary size, enabling [[supercomputer|high performance computers]] (HPC) to get near to their asymptotic performance.

Two years later this benchmark was used for measuring the performance of the first [[TOP500]] list.

==The benchmarks==

===LINPACK 100===
LINPACK 100 is very similar to the original benchmark published in 1979 along with the [https://books.google.com/books?id=AmSm1n3Vw0cC&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;ots=EDFdqJhr8x&amp;dq=info%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fs3da3171290b34600.scholar.google.com%2F0&amp;lr&amp;pg=SL2-PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false LINPACK users' manual].
The solution is obtained by [[Gaussian elimination]] with [[pivot element|partial pivoting]], with 2/3n³ + 2n² floating point operations where ''n'' is 100, the order of the dense matrix ''A'' that defines the problem. Its small size and the lack of software flexibility doesn't allow most modern computers to reach their performance limits. However, it can still be useful to predict performances in numerically intensive user written code using compiler optimization.&lt;ref name="hplpaper"/&gt;

===LINPACK 1000===
LINPACK 1000 can provide a performance nearer to the machine's limit because in addition to offering a bigger problem size, a matrix of order 1000, changes in the algorithm are possible. The only constraints are that the relative accuracy can't be reduced and the number of operations will always be considered to be 2/3n³ + 2n², with n = 1000.&lt;ref name="hplpaper"/&gt;

===HPLinpack===
The previous benchmarks are not suitable for testing parallel computers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the so-called Linpack's Highly Parallel Computing benchmark, or HPLinpack benchmark, was introduced. In HPLinpack the size n of the problem can be made as large as it is needed to optimize the performance results of the machine. Once again, 2/3n³ + 2n² will be taken as the operation count, with independence of the algorithm used. Use of the [[Strassen algorithm]] is not allowed because it distorts the real execution rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/faq-linpack.html#_Can_I_use
|title = LINPACK FAQ - Can I use Strassen’s Method when doing the matrix multiples in the HPL benchmark or for the Top500 run?
|accessdate = 2015-02-10 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The accuracy must be such that the following expression is satisfied:

&lt;math&gt;{\lVert Ax-b\rVert\over \lVert A\rVert \lVert x\rVert n \epsilon} \leq O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the machine's precision, and ''n'' is the size of the problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/faq-linpack.html#_Toc27885722
|title = LINPACK FAQ - To what accuracy must be the solution conform?
|accessdate = 2015-02-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lVert \cdot \rVert&lt;/math&gt; is the [[matrix norm]] and &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the [[big-O notation]].

For each computer system, the following quantities are reported:&lt;ref name="hplpaper"/&gt;

* R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;: the performance in GFLOPS for the largest problem run on a machine.
* N&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;: the size of the largest problem run on a machine.
* N&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;: the size where half the Rmax execution rate is achieved.
* R&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;: the theoretical peak performance GFLOPS for the machine.

These results are used to compile the [[TOP500]] list twice a year, with the world's most powerful computers.&lt;ref name="top500"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Linpack Benchmark, TOP500 Supercomputing Sites

|accessdate = 2015-02-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LINPACK benchmark implementations==
The previous section describes the ground rules for the benchmarks. The actual [[implementation]] of the program can diverge, with some examples being available in [[Fortran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2015-02-10
|url = http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/linpackjava
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HPL===
HPL is a portable implementation of HPLinpack that was written in C, originally as a guideline, but that is now widely used to provide data for the TOP500 list, though other technologies and packages can be used. HPL generates a linear system of equations of order n and solves it using LU decomposition with partial row pivoting. It requires installed implementations of [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] and either [[BLAS]] or [[VSIPL]] to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = HPL - A Portable Implementation of the High-Performance Linpack Benchmark for Distributed-Memory Computers
|accessdate = 2015-02-10
|url = http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coarsely, the algorithm has the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/algorithm.html

However, soon after its release, the LINPACK benchmark was criticized for providing performance levels "generally unobtainable by all but a very few programmers who tediously optimize their code for that machine and that machine alone",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Jack Dongarra]], the main driving force behind the LINPACK benchmarks, said that, while they only emphasize "peak" CPU speed and number of CPUs, not enough stress is given to local bandwidth and the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thom Dunning, Jr.]], director of the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]], had this to say about the LINPACK benchmark: "The Linpack benchmark is one of those interesting phenomena -- almost anyone who knows about it will deride its utility. They understand its limitations but it has mindshare because it's the one number we've all bought into over the years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/mimssbits/25981/

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dongarra, "the organizers of the Top500 are actively looking to expand the scope of the benchmark reporting" because "it is important to include more performance characteristic and signatures for a given system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One of the possibilities that is being considered to extend the benchmark for the TOP500 is the [[HPC Challenge Benchmark]] Suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of [[Petascale computing|petascale computers]], [[traversed edges per second]] have started to emerge as an alternative metric to FLOPS measured by LINPACK. Another alternative is the [[HPCG benchmark]], proposed by Dongarra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/06/26/development-pushes-ahead-new-hpc-benchmark/#|title=New HPC Benchmark Delivers Promising Results|last=Hemsoth|first=Nicole|date=June 26, 2014|publisher=HPCWire|accessdate=2014-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The running time issue===
According to [[Jack Dongarra]], the running time required to obtain good performance results with HPLinpack is expected to increase. At a conference held in 2010, he said he expects running times of 2.5 days in "a few years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''Lassen Fragment''', is a [[parchment]] page from c. 1275. It is one of the four fragments remaining of the original, or early copy of, [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]'s [[Gesta Danorum]]. Size is 40x27 cm. It consists of one page with two written sides.

==History==
It was found 1860 in the [[literary remains]] of library-secretary ''G. F. Lassen'', and is now owned by the [[Danish Royal Library|Royal Library]] of [[Copenhagen]]. It has Royal Library signature of ''Ny kgl. Saml. Fol. 570''.

Correspond to page 275-282 in [[Peter Erasmus Müller]] Latin version of ''Gesta Danorum'' from 1839 or page 152.29 – 156.14 in [[Jørgen Olrik]] &amp; H. Ræder's Latin version of ''Gesta Danorum'' from 1931.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14265">The [[dramatist]] and author [[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote approximately 80 dramatic works during his career, as well as light verse, short stories and other works.  He is best remembered for his series of 14 libretti for his [[Gilbert and Sullivan|joint operatic works]] with the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]], but many of his other dramatic works were popular successes.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33400 "Gilbert, Sir William Schwenck (1836–1911)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, online edition, May 2008, accessed 10 January 2010 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==
In the following list, the title of each work appears in the first column, along with any further information (such as the source of an adaptation).  The genre appears in the second column, and if the piece had music, the composer's name is listed in parentheses.  The theatre and date of first performance appear in the third and fourth columns.  All theatres were in London, unless otherwise stated.  The works are listed in the approximate order of composition. (In a few cases, the first performance was many years after the work was first published.)

Museums have been created from many former jails and prisons.

Some old jails converted into museums are listed under the original name of the jail, especially if listed on the US [[National Register of Historic Places]].  For example, see [[Old St. Johns County Jail]] in [[St Augustine, Florida]]. 

Museums with a main purpose not associated with the jail or prison in which they are located are listed separately, below the main list.

'''Nabi Shu'ayb''' (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] '''Neby Shoaib''' or '''Nabi Shuaib''', meaning "the Prophet Shu'ayb") is a [[Druze]] religious prophet, traditionally identified with the biblical [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], whose possible shrine/tomb is believed to be located near [[Kfar Zeitim]], not far from [[Tiberias]], [[Israel]]. The identification of Shu'ayb with Jethro, however, is a Druze tradition rather than historical fact (see [[Shuaib]]). Prophet shu'ayb is the 14th prophet.
  
Nabi Shuayb was an object of traditional veneration by Druze through Palestine. The shrine figured down to [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Israeli-Arab war of 1948]] as a place where Druze took vows (''nidhr'') and made   ''[[ziyarat]]'' ("pilgrimages"). After the 1948 war, Israel placed the [[Maqam (shrine)]] under exclusive Druze care.&lt;ref name="Yazbak 237-9" &gt;Mahmoud Yazbak, 'Holy shrines (''maqamat'') in modern Palestine/Israel and the politics of memory,' in Marshall J. Breger, Yitzhak Reiter, Leonard Hammer (eds.),[https://books.google.com/books?id=nROPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237 ''Holy Places in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Confrontation and Co-existence,''] Routledge 2010 pp.231-246 p.241.&lt;/ref&gt; A central figure in the [[Druze]] religion, the tomb of Nabi [[Shuaib]], has been a site of annual pilgrimage for the Druze for centuries.&lt;ref name="Dana"&gt;Dana, Nissim. (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2nCWIsyZJxUC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22hittin%22+village&amp;lr=#PPA28,M1 ''The Druze in the Middle East: Their Faith, Leadership, Identity and Status,''] [[Sussex Academic Press]], pp. 28&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shrines dedicated to Nabi [[Shuaib]] are common throughout the [[Levant|Greater Syria]] region.&lt;ref name="Firro" &gt;Kais Firro [https://books.google.com/books?id=owhg2R8Ndy8C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=nabi+shu%27ayb&amp;lr= ''The Druzes in the Jewish State: A Brief History,''] BRILL, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 6935 In the holy place of jethro.jpg|thumb|260px|The courtyard of the complex]]
[[File:Nabi-shurayb.jpg|thumb|260px|Another courtyard view]]

In [[Druze]] tradition, it is believed that towards the end of his life, [[Shuaib|Shu'ayb]] took refuge in a cave outside [[Hittin]] (a village just west of [[Tiberias]]), where he would die in old age. His followers buried him at the site and placed a tombstone at his grave.&lt;ref name="Dana"/&gt; Another Druze tradition holds that the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] sultan [[Saladin]] had a dream the night prior to the [[Battle of Hittin]] in which an angel promised him victory on the condition that after the battle, he would ride his horse westward; then, where the horse would stop, the angel said he would find the burial site of Shu'ayb. The tradition holds that when Saladin's dream was realized, the Druze built a shrine for Shu'ayb at the site.

Nabi Shu'ayb has been expanded and renovated over time.&lt;ref name="Dana"/&gt; The older section of the existing structure was built in the 1880s, under the direction of Sheikh Muhanna Tarif, the ''shaykh al-aql'' (Druze spiritual leader) of [[Julis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Firro|first1=Kais|title=A History of the Druzes, Volume 1|date=1992|publisher=Brill|page=315|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usEUXYnYWxAC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314|isbn=9004094377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheikh Muhanna summoned an assembly of religious leaders in the community to discuss and collaborate on its construction. A delegation of high-ranking community members traveled to [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] in order to collect funds for new construction and renovations and the local Druze of the [[Galilee]] and [[Mount Carmel]] also made considerable contributions.

After [[Israel]]'s establishment in 1948, and the total depopulation of Hittin which had been a predominantly Muslim village, the Druze were granted full custodianship over the tomb, and an additional 100 [[dunam]]s surrounding it. Under the leadership of Sheikh [[Amin Tarif]], the shrine was then renovated and numerous rooms were added for the hosting of pilgrims. The Israeli government also paved the road leading to Nabi Shu'ayb and provided electricity and water infrastructure services there.&lt;ref name="Dana"/&gt;

The first mention of the tomb dates back to the 12th century CE, and the Druze have held religious festivals there for centuries. According to Druze tradition, the imprint of Shuaib's left foot (''da'sa'') can be seen on the grave. Pilgrims visiting the site pour oil into the imprint, and then rub the oil over their body in order to be blessed with good fortune.&lt;ref name="Dana"/&gt;

The Druze customarily had no fixed date for their annual pilgrimage, which generally occurred sometime in the spring. When the Israeli government granted official recognition of the pilgrimage as a Druze religious holiday, the dates were standardized, such that the event now takes place between April 25 and April 28.&lt;ref name="Firro" /&gt; During the festivities, mass celebrations are held at Nabi Shu'aib, and Druze religious leaders gather there for ritual purposes and to discuss religious questions. Prior to Israel's establishment, Druze from [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] also used to participate in the festival, but are no longer able to do so today.&lt;ref name="Dana"/&gt;

The '''Pelican files''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Pelikan dosyası'') refer to an unattributed list of 27 different items released in April 2016 detailing points of conflict between the [[Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] and President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], two politicians from the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] of [[Turkey]] who assumed their respective offices on 28 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/527768/_Pelikan_dosyasi__dogru_cikti.html|title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi - 'Pelikan dosyası' doğru çıktı|date=4 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released by unnamed Erdoğan supporters as a [[WordPress.com]] blog, the files heavily criticised Davutoğlu for disobeying Erdoğan's political agenda. The release of the files were widely attributed to sparking the events that would eventually lead to Davutoğlu being ousted as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/gundem/davutogluna-darbe-uzerine-darbe-1209712/|title=Davutoğlu’na darbe üzerine darbe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Pelican files" is a reference to the 1993 political thriller ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/turkey-rift-between-erdogan-davutoglu.html#|title=How mysterious new Turkish blog exposed Erdogan-Davutoglu rift|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]| accessdate =6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP), founded by the current President and former Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], has been in power ever since winning the [[Turkish general election, 2002|2002 general elections]] by a landslide. In the [[Turkish presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], Erdoğan ran as the AKP's candidate and was elected President with 51.79% of the vote, naming Davutoğlu as his successor as party leader and Prime Minister. Many commentators claimed that Davutoğlu would take a submissive approach as Prime Minister while Erdoğan continued pursuing his political agenda as President, including the establishment of an executive presidency that would boost his powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-turkish-cabinet-shows-continuity-with-erdogan-legacy-1409312847|title=New Turkish Cabinet Shows Continuity With Erdogan Legacy|author=Yeliz Candemir|date=29 August 2014|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/08/21/turkey-davutoglu-expected-to-be-docile-prime-minister-with-erdogan-calling.html|title=Turkey's Davutoglu expected to be a docile prime minister _ with Erdogan calling the shots|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pelican files released in April 2016 detailed disagreements between Erdoğan and Davutoğlu on several issues concerning both national and inner-party political developments.
==Items==
The 27 items detailed in the Pelican files are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pelikandosyasi.wordpress.com/2016/05/|title=Mayıs 2016 – pelikandosyasi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Erdoğan opposed and stopped the enacting of a 'transparency law', a piece of legislation that Davutoğlu had wanted to implement shortly after becoming Prime Minister.
#Davutoğlu was allegedly in favour of the four former AKP government ministers, namely [[Egemen Bağış]], [[Zafer Çağlayan]], [[Muammer Güler]] and [[Erdoğan Bayraktar]], being sent to the Supreme Court for their role in the [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|2013 government corruption scandal]]. AKP Members of Parliament later voted against the motion to send the four ministers to the Supreme Court after Erdoğan instructed them to block the motion.
#Davutoğlu was responsible for the parliamentary candidacy of [[Hakan Fidan]], Undersecretary of the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organisation]] (MİT) for the [[Turkish general election, June 2015|June 2015 general election]], which was overturned by Erdoğan and resulted in Fidan being re-instated as MİT Undersecretary after he withdrew his candidacy.
#Davutoğlu allowed the Dolmabahçe Statement, a result of negotiations during the [[Solution process]] with Kurdish rebels, to be released in public. Following public criticism by Erdoğan, an important section of the Statement which established an 'Oversight Committee' was abandoned, followed shortly after by the entire solution process altogether.
#Davutoğlu supported Deputy Prime Minister [[Bülent Arınç]], who publicly criticised Erdoğan over interfering with the Dolmabahçe Statement. 
#Relations also allegedly soured due to Davutoğlu giving press statements and interviews to media and news outlets that had been known for criticising Erdoğan.
#Tensions between the two politicians after the June elections rose after Davutoğlu claimed that the people had rejected Erdoğan's call for an executive presidency.
#It was alleged that Davutoğlu supported [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP) leader [[Devlet Bahçeli]] after the June 2015 election resulted in a [[hung parliament]], who had claimed that the MHP's precondition for a coalition agreement with the AKP would be for Erdoğan's family (and in particular his son, [[Bilal Erdoğan]]) to go on trial for alleged corruption.
#A general disagreement between Davutoğlu and Erdoğan over whether the AKP should have pushed for a coalition agreement or early elections after the inconclusive June 2015 vote was also included in the files.
#Davutoğlu was accused of establishing his own media network, including a newspaper, that would be supportive of him. 
#Davutoğlu was also accused of censoring some pro-Erdoğan media material.
#It emerged that the establishment of the pro-Davutoğlu news outlets would be financed by an undisclosed allowance paid to the Office of the Prime Minister directly from the national budget. 
#It was further alleged that Davutoğlu and Erdoğan had argued over who would stand for election to the AKP's Central Executive Decision Committee (MKYK) in the party's [[5th Justice and Development Party Ordinary Congress|5th Ordinary Congress]] in September 2015. Erdoğan supporter [[Binali Yıldırım]] had been collecting signatures for a potential leadership bid up until Davutoğlu backed down to Erdoğan's demands.
#Disagreements over Davutoğlu's attempts to lift political immunities from prosecution, as well as his decision to consult the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP) on the proposals resulted in tensions with Erdoğan to increase further.
#Erdoğan allegedly strongly protested Davutoğlu for claiming that his government could restart the [[Solution process]] if the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) reverted to the situation in 2013.
#Furthermore, Davutoğlu was criticised for not opposing an AKP MP who claimed that 'everything would be alright if the [[Parallel state]] ([[Gülen Movement]]) reverted to its factory values.'
#Davutoğlu allegedly did not voice criticism over [[European Parliament]] President [[Martin Schulz]] calling Erdoğan 'authoritarian' in response to Erdoğan's calls for a German video criticising him to be censored.
#Similarly, Erdoğan blamed Davutoğlu for not speaking up for the Presidency when Schulz claimed that Davutoğlu, as Prime Minister, would be recognised as the official representative of the Turkish Government in negotiations with the [[European Union]]
#The Presidency alleged that it was not consulted by Davutoğlu during the [[European migrant crisis]] negotiations for visa-free entry by Turkish nationals to the European Union. Davutoğlu was also accused of not criticising European media outlets that had voiced scepticism of Erdoğan.
#Competition between Davutoğlu and Erdoğan had been reported over who would get to meet US President [[Barack Obama]] during an official visit to the [[United States]]
#Davutoğlu allegedly attempted to recruit some of the AKP's most notorious social media trolls (known as 'AK Trolls') to support him against Erdoğan
#Advisors and journalists close to Davutoğlu were accused of supporting the restarting of negotiations with the PKK. 
#Davutoğlu and Erdoğan allegedly disagreed on whether arrested journalists [[Can Dündar]] and [[Erdem Gül]] should be tried while in custody.
#Davutoğlu invited Arınç to a 'public opening' rally in [[Manisa]] shortly before the June 2015 vote.
#Davutoğlu's relations with Erdoğan further deteriorated after he visited the ''[[Taraf]]'' newspaper, known to be critical of Erdoğan
#Erdoğan allegedly blocked some of Davutoğlu's preferred appointments to high-ranking bureaucratic positions.
#Davutoğlu allegedly angered Erdoğan when he claimed that the 1,100 academics arrested for signing a resolution calling for peace in the south-east of Turkey should not have been taken into custody.
==Aftermath==
The release of the Pelican files were seen as proof of several earlier media reports of growing rifts between Davutoğlu and Erdoğan, though the Presidency denied any involvement with its release. In early May, the AKP's Central Executive Decision Committee (MKYK) voted to revoke the leader's ability to appoint provincial and district party representatives and instead delegated that power to the MKYK as a whole. On 3 May, Davutoğlu gave a speech at an AKP parliamentary group meeting that was interpreted by the press as a 'resignation speech' due to its short length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/gundem/akp-grup-toplantisi-12-1213961/|title=AKP grup toplantısı|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours emerged that Davutoğlu had submitted his resignation to the Presidency earlier. 

On 4 May 2016, Davutoğlu met with Erdoğan at the [[Presidential Complex]], a day earlier than the usual Thursday weekly meeting. The meeting lasted for 1 hour and 40 minutes, after which neither the Presidency or the Prime Minister's Office made a statement, although the Presidency claimed that the meeting was 'routine'. Shortly after, it was declared that Davutoğlu would assemble the party MKYK before making a public speech at another parliamentary group meeting of AKP MPs. At the same time, it was reported that the party had taken the decision to call an [[2nd Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|Extraordinary Congress]]. Davutoğlu would not stand for re-election as party leader and commentators claimed that a pro-Erdoğan would become the AKP's next leader.

A '''personal wiki''' is [[wiki]] software that allows individual users to organize information on their [[Desktop environment|desktop]] or [[Mobile computing|mobile computing devices]] in a manner similar to [[wiki#Communities|community wiki]]s, but without [[collaborative software]] or multiple users.

Personal wiki software can be broadly divided into two categories:

* Multi-user applications with personal editions (such as [[MoinMoin]] or [[TWiki]]), installed for standalone use and inaccessible to outside users, which may require additional software such as a [[web server]], [[database management system]] and/or [[WAMP]]/[[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] bundle&lt;ref&gt;Trapani, Gina, [http://lifehacker.com/126052/geek-to-live-how-to-host-a-personal-wiki-on-your-home-computer?tag=softwarefeature Geek to Live: How to host a personal wiki on your home computer], lifehacker.com, 2005-9-16. Accessed 2012-4-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Applications designed for single users, not dependent on a database engine or web server

Some personal wikis are public but password-protected, and run on dedicated web servers or are [[Web hosting service|hosted]] by third parties.

==Multi-user wiki software==
Multi-user wiki applications with personal editions include:
* [[MoinMoin]] desktop edition (written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]])&lt;ref&gt;Zukerman, Erez, [http://www.pcworld.com/article/252482/roll_your_own_wiki_with_open_source_moinmoin.html Editorial Review of MoinMoin], PCWorld, pcworld.com, 2012-3-23. Accessed 2012-4-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[TWiki]] for Windows Peronal and Certified TWiki (both written in [[Perl]])
* [[DokuWiki]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;on a Stick (written in [[PHP]]), which utilizes plain text files (and thus does not need a database) and a syntax similar to [[MediaWiki]]

==Single-user wiki software==
There are also wiki applications designed for personal use,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikimatrix.org/search.php?sid=2034 WikiMatrix search for personal wiki software], wikimatrix.org.

Accessed 2012-4-17.&lt;/ref&gt; They often include more features than traditional wikis, including:
* Dynamic tree views of the wiki
*[[Drag and drop|Drag-and-drop]] support for images, text and video, mathematics
* Use of [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] or Linkback to allow wikis to act as relational superstructures for multiple desktop-type documents
* Multimedia embedding, with links to internal aspects of movies, soundtracks, notes and comments
* Macros and macro scripting

'''Peter Sauer''' (February 2, 1900 - September 11, 1949), was an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestler]], better known by the ring name '''Ray Steele'''. He was born and raised in Norka, a [[Germans|German]] colony in [[Russia]], in 1900 before immigrating to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] in 1906.

Steele worked a [[catch wrestling]] style in his early career. 16 May 1934 he wrestled [[Orville Brown]] to a 30-minute draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/OrvilleBrown.html LoW Orville Brown Wrestling History]: "A second thirty-minute draw was the final result of a match against Ray Steele in St. Louis on May 16th."&lt;/ref&gt; He gained some notoriety in 1936 when he faced heavyweight [[boxing]] contender [[Kingfish Levinsky]] in a mixed match, which Steele won in 35 seconds. Steele's biggest accomplishment in the sport was winning the [[National Wrestling Association]]'s [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|World Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Bronko Nagurski]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on March 7, 1940. Steele would hold the belt for over a year before losing it back to Bronko Nagurski on March 11, 1941 in [[Houston, Texas]].

Sauer served as a mentor to many young stars, including [[Lou Thesz]] before his death of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]&lt;ref&gt;Wray, J. G. "Wrestling Mourns Ray Steele" ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' (Sept. 13, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1949.

[[File:Congressional Districts map (South Florida - 2004).gif|thumb|350px|A map of Congressional districts in South Florida, from Psephos: Adam Carr's Electoral Archive]]

'''Psephos: Adam Carr's Electoral Archive''' is an online archive of election statistics, and claims to be the world's largest online resource of such information. Psephos is maintained by Dr Adam Carr, of [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], a historian and former aide to Australian MP [[Michael Danby]] and Senator [[David Feeney]]. It includes detailed statistics for presidential and legislative elections from 182 countries, with at least some statistics for every country that has what Carr considers to be genuine national elections. 

"Psephos" is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "pebble", a reference to the Ancient Greek method of voting by dropping pebbles into urns, and is the root of the word [[psephology]], the study of elections. 

Carr began accumulating Australian election statistics in the mid-1980s, with the intention of publishing a complete print edition of Australian national elections statistics dating back to 1901. With the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], Carr abandoned this idea and began to place election statistics at his personal website. In 2001 he founded Psephos, and began to include statistics from other countries. He has also included historical statistics, such as figures for all [[U.S. presidential elections]] and for [[British House of Commons]] elections since 1900. 

In 2015 Carr added a complete archive of election statistics for the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], dating back to 1843.

Psephos is more noted, however, for locating less easily accessible statistics and placing them online. These include constituency-level figures for [[Japan]]ese legislative elections, which are not available in English anywhere else on the internet, and figures from countries as obscure as [[Andorra]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Tuvalu]]. These figures are obtained from a variety of sources, including government election websites, media websites and political party websites. Increasingly, statistics are sent directly to Carr by psephologists, academics and political activists in the countries concerned.

The archive also includes Carr's original electoral maps at constituency level for a number or countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]] and the [[United States|U.S.]]. 

Matthew M. Singer, a specialist in election studies at [[Duke University]], wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Psephos: Adam Carr's Electoral Archive is maintained by Australian journalist Adam Carr and contains election results for 163 countries as well as many sub-national entities. While not all the results are at the district level, in many cases the Psephos archive is the only online source for electoral data (especially for small countries). Another strength of the Psephos archive is that while many national-sources remove the links to previous election results as the new elections approach, the Psephos archive does not delete old-election results. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This archive, however, has two small drawbacks. First, small parties are often compiled into an "Other" category that for some studies, especially those interested in representation, political fragmentation, or the success of ethnic or gender parties, is a potential problem. Second, like the [[University of Essex]] data, the results in the Psephos archive are presented with each candidate/party in a given district presented in a unique row. As a result, scholars must convert the data to a spreadsheet and then data manipulation, often a considerable amount, is required to make analysis of trends at the district level possible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite these drawbacks, the Psephos archive is an invaluable source of electoral data cross-sectionally and over time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sequence==
Baldev Mehra (Vishwa Mohan Badola) is an elderly [[Hindu]] man in [[Delhi]], [[India]], and Yusuf ([[M. S. Sathyu|Mysore Shrinivas Sathyu]]) is an elderly [[Muslim]] man in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. One day Baldev shows his granddaughter Suman (Auritra Ghosh) an old, dated photograph of two children. He tells her that it is himself and his best friend Yusuf when they lived in Lahore prior to the [[Partition of India]] in 1947. In front of his house there was a park with a gate made in the stone age and each evening he and Yusuf would fly kites there and "steal"  [[Jhajariya]]s from Yusuf's [[South Asian sweets|family sweet shop]]. When Partition came, however, [[Partition of India#Independence.2C population transfer.2C and violence|Baldev and his family had to leave for India overnight]]. Many decades later, Baldev still thinks of Yusuf and misses him.

Using details of her grandfather's story, Sumon is able to locate Yusuf's sweet shop in Lahore via her laptop and Google. She connects with his grandson Ali (Syed Shabahat Ali) who helps her to plan a surprise visit from Yusuf on Baldev's birthday.

==Production==
According to Sukesh Kumar Nayak, Group Creative Director of Ogilvy Mumbai, Google had stated in their brief that "the only thing they wanted was to see [...] how meaningful the search engine is in real life." Nayak also stated that they wanted to make "the connection between real life and Google, magical."&lt;ref name="IE"/&gt; ''Reunion'' was filmed "in different areas in [[Delhi]], including an old [[Haveli]] in [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place]], [[Red Fort]], [[India Gate]], and a small scene in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]."&lt;ref name="IE"/&gt; Singer [[Clinton Cerejo]] composed the music for the spot.&lt;ref name="IE"/&gt;

==Reception==
''[[The Star (Malaysia)]]'' notes that ''Reunion'' has "gone viral online, reflecting demands in the two countries for closer people-to-people ties [....] Internet users left thousands of comments on social networking sites describing how the advert had brought them to tears and renewed their hopes for improved relations between the two neighbours."&lt;ref name="starma"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Fisher of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' states that "if you are from [[South Asia]], have family from South Asia, or are merely friends on Facebook with someone who has ties to the subcontinent, you've already seen this video posted to social media in the 48 hours since it went up. In case you haven't, it's a Google advertisement, about three and a half minutes, well worth your time. Yes, it's an ad, meant to prod people in one of the world's largest markets into using Google services. And in that context it can be a bit syrupy. But take a step back for a moment, and try to appreciate what makes this video so powerful that it's already been viewed 1.8 million times."&lt;ref name="why"&gt;{{cite web

[If only] the visa regime between both the countries was as easy as Google search."&lt;ref name="ibt"/&gt; Ritu Singh of ''[[Zee News]]'' states that ''Reunion'' struck "an emotional chord with its viewers not only in India but also in Pakistan" as it "depicts the pain of partition which still haunts the mind of people who got separated from their loved ones and places." She also states, "this heart warming ad is sure to overwhelm you."&lt;ref name="zee"&gt;{{cite web

It shows an aging Hindu Indian man waxing nostalgic to his granddaughter about his Muslim childhood friend in Lahore before the partition [....] The ad, created by Ogilvy, has struck a particularly emotional chord by refusing to take India and Pakistan’s historically adversarial relationship as a given."&lt;ref name="quartz"&gt;{{cite web

== Ideology ==
Ideals of Serbian Action are largely based on teachings of [[Nikolaj Velimirović|saint Nikolaj Velimirović]] and Serbian politician [[Dimitrije Ljotić]], leader of pro-Italian and pro-Nazi fascist movement [[Yugoslav National Movement]]. Orthodox Christianity is seen as one of the main pillars of society and they are strongly against secularism, advocating for the restoration of Orthodox monarchy that would be "''expressed through the testamental Serbian vertical: God - King – Homekeeper''". Greater cooperation between Christian Orthodox nations are presented as alternative to EU integrations. Serbian Action also holds strong anti-democratic views and expresses the idea of Parliament made up of representatives of professions rather than representatives of political parties. Considering themselves as pan-European and anti-Zionist, their actions are against multiculturalism, promotion of LGBT rights and drug legalization and for preservation of Serbian people and their biological survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SA:English|url=http://www.srb-akcija.org/arhiva/268/serbian-action/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:U-slavu-ucitelja-1.jpg|thumbnail|left|Activists of Serbian Action honoring with torchlight 70 years since the death of Serbian ideologist Dimitrije Ljotić.]]
Activists of Serbian Action are encouraged to improve themselves spiritually and physically, all in purpose to become a "''[[Political Soldier|political soldier]]''".

== History ==
Serbian Action became more known to the public in late 2014, when authorities arrested some of their members for hate speech, for distributing flyers against illegal settlements of Romani people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://novinenovosadske.rs/uhapsen-aktivista-grupe-srbska-akcija-zbog-poziva-na-linc-roma/ | title=Novine novosadske: Uhapšen aktivista "Srbska Akcija" zbog poziva na linč roma | language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outbreak of civil unrest in Ukraine, a couple of activists from Serbian Action volunteered and fought in Donbass. They have criticized the Serbian government for tolerating the volunteering of people to ISIS, but persecuting volunteers from [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SA:Правда за новоруске добровољце!|url=http://www.srb-akcija.org/komentar/7970/pravda-za-novoruske-dobrovoljce/ | language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dobrovoljci-sa-novorus.jpg|thumbnail|right|Serbian Action volunteers in Ukraine]]

In 2014, Serbian Action members attended a yearly Polish march in support of the Serbian claim on Kosovo, named "''Kosowo jest serbskie''" (Kosovo is Serbia).
 
In May 2014, during the large floods, activists of Serbian Action volunteered with supplies and men to help people that were affected by the tragedy.

On the 11th of July, Serbian Action published a text on their site, "Ђенерале, хвала ти!" ("General, thank you!"), giving thanks to [[Ratko Mladić]] for the liberation of [[Srebrenica]], where they say that the [[Srebrenica massacre|massacre of 5.000 Bosniaks]] is Western anti-Serbian propaganda.

On the 22nd of March 2015, Serbian Action attended a Russian international conservative forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SA: Велики националистички конгрес у Русији|url=http://www.srb-akcija.org/komentar/7817/ruski-kongres-2015/ | language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian Action is also active on universities, organizing meetings and protests. The authority banned their meetings on the subject of Communist crimes, in response to which Serbian Action claimed that the Communists and their repressions are still present in universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blic:Tribina|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/507736/Srbska-akcija-otkazala-tribinu-studenti-strazare-ispred-Filozofskog | language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 they organized a student march to mark 20 years since [[Operation Storm]], and to protest Croatian celebration of it. Thousands attended the march.

During the peak of the immigrant crisis in Europe, Serbian Action called for a racist protest against immigration and asylum seekers. The protest was banned by Serbian police, who prevented anyone from attending.

On the 19th of September, Serbian Action organized a march with the slogan "''For healthy Serbia''". It was a counter-march to an LGBT parade. Around one thousand people attended.

They are known for glorification of [[Milan Nedić]], the leader of the Serbian puppet government during [[World War II]], who
collaborated with the Germans and was responsible for [[The Holocaust in Serbia|prosecution of Jews]] and Serbian communists during war.

== International cooperation ==

Serbian Action has strong cooperation with Greek nationalist party [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]]. They have exchanged visits on marches and supported each other. In 2013 activists of Serbian Action demonstrated and distributed propaganda material in support of persecuted members of Golden Dawn. In the same year, Golden Dawn representative joined and supported march of Serbian Action. In 2015, Serbian Action congratulated Golden Dawn on their result of 7,5% vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srb-akcija.org/komentar/8074/novi-uspeh-zlatne-zore/|title=SA:Нови успех грчих другова! | language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ethnikismos.net|url=http://ethnikismos.net/2013/12/24/%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%83-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CF%87%CF%81%CF%85%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B1%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%B7/| language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
Silesian speakers currently live in the region of [[Upper Silesia]], which is split between southwestern [[Poland]] and the northeastern [[Czech Republic]]. At present Silesian is commonly spoken in the area between the historical border of Silesia on the east and a line from [[Syców]] to [[Prudnik]] on the west as well as in the [[Rawicz]] area. Until 1945 Silesian was also spoken in enclaves in [[Lower Silesia]].

[[Silesian German|Lower Silesian]], a variety of [[Central German]], was spoken by the ethnic German majority population of that region. The German speaking populace was either evacuated en masse by German forces towards the end of the war or deported by the new administration upon the [[Recovered Territories|Polish annexation of Silesia]] after [[World War II]]. Before the war, most [[Slavic Languages|Slavic speakers]] also spoke German and, at least in eastern Upper Silesia, many German-speakers were acquainted with Slavic Silesian. 

According to the last [[Polish census of 2011|official census in Poland in 2011]], about 509,000&lt;ref name="GUS2011"/&gt; people declared Silesian as their [[first language|native language]] (in [[Polish census of 2002|census 2002]], about 60,000&lt;ref name="sprecher"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_nsp2002_tabl5.xls |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606034606/http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_nsp2002_tabl5.xls |archivedate=2011-06-06 |format=XLS |title=Ludność według języka używanego w kontaktach domowych i deklaracji narodowościowej w 2002 roku |trans-title=Population by language used at home and declarations of nationality in 2002 |publisher=Main Statistical Office of the Polish Government: report of [[Polish census of 2002]] |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in the censuses in Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, nearly 0.9 million people declared [[Silesians|Silesian nationality]].&lt;ref name="GUS2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://notes2.czso.cz/cz/sldb2011/cd_sldb2011_11_12/index_html_files/PVCR062.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131022340/http://notes2.czso.cz/cz/sldb2011/cd_sldb2011_11_12/index_html_files/PVCR062.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-31 |format=PDF |title=Obyvatelstvo podle národnosti podle krajů |publisher= [[Czech Statistical Office]] |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvvm.cas.cz/upl/nase_spolecnost/100023s_Samanova-narodnost.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613165802/http://www.cvvm.cas.cz/upl/nase_spolecnost/100023s_Samanova-narodnost.pdf|archivedate=2006-06-13 |title=Národnost ve sčítání lidu v českých zemích |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/bhr/english/special_issues/CEDIME-unwgm2001/un%20wgm%20slovakia%20appendix%20on%20minorities%203a%2015-5-01.doc National Minorities in the Slovak Republic] - Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
Although the morphological differences between Silesian and Polish have been researched extensively, other grammatical differences have not been studied in depth. One example is that, in contrast with Polish, Silesian retains separate past conditional ({{lang|szl|jo bych śe była uobaliyła}} — "I would have slipped").

Another major difference is in question-forming. In Polish, questions that do not contain [[interrogative word]]s are formed either by using intonation or the interrogative particle {{lang|pl|czy}}. In Silesian, questions that do not contain interrogative words are formed by using intonation (with a markedly different intonation pattern than in Polish) or inversion (e.g. {{lang|szl|je to na mapie?}}); there is no interrogative particle.

== Example ==

According to [[Jan Miodek]], standard Polish has been always used by Upper Silesians as a language of prayers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dziennikzachodni.pl/artykul/384010,jan-miodek-dyskusja-o-jezyku-slaskim-w-pismie-jest-zenujaca,id,t.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politicization===
Opinions are divided among [[linguistics|linguists]] regarding whether Silesian is a distinct language, a dialect of Polish, or in the case of [[Lach dialects|Lach]], a variety of Czech. The issue can be contentious, because some Silesians consider themselves to be a distinct nationality within Poland. When Czechs, Poles, and Germans each made claims to substantial parts of Silesia as constituting an integral part of their respective [[nation-state]]s in the 19th and 20th centuries, the language of Slavic speaking Silesians became politicized. 

Some, like [[Óndra Łysohorsky]], a poet and author in the [[Czechoslovakia]], saw the [[Silesians]] as being their own distinct people, which culminated in his effort to create a [[literary standard]] he called the "Lachian language." Silesian inhabitants supporting the cause of each of these ethnic groups had their own robust network of supporters across Silesia's political borders which shifted over the course of the 20th century prior to the large-scale [[ethnic cleansing]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]].

== Writing system ==
There have been a number of attempts at codifying the language spoken by Slavophones in Silesia. Probably the most well-known was undertaken by Óndra Łysohorsky when codifying the [[Lachian dialects]] in creating the Lachian literary language in the early [[20th century]].

Ślabikŏrzowy szrajbōnek is the relatively new [[alphabet]] created by the [[Pro Loquela Silesiana]] organization to reflect the sounds of all Silesian dialects. It was approved by Silesian organizations affiliated in [[Rada Górnośląska]]. [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] translation is in this alphabet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-szl |title="Silesian Ubuntu Translation" team |publisher=Launchpad.net |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the [[Silesian Wikipedia]]. It is used in a few books, including the Silesian [[alphabet book]].&lt;ref name="slabikorz"&gt;Mirosław Syniawa: Ślabikŏrz niy dlŏ bajtli. Pro Loquela Silesiana. {{ISBN|978-83-62349-01-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Letters: [[A]], [[Ã]], [[B]], [[C]], [[Ć]], [[D]], [[E]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[I]], [[J]], [[K]], [[L]], [[Ł]], [[M]], [[N]], [[Ń]], [[O]], [[Ŏ]], [[Ō]], [[Ô]], [[Õ]], [[P]], [[R]], [[S]], [[Ś]], [[T]], [[U]], [[W]], [[Y]], [[Z]], [[Ź]], [[Ż]].&lt;ref name="slabikorz" /&gt;

One of the first [[alphabet]]s created specifically for Silesian was ''Steuer's Silesian alphabet'', created in the [[Interwar period]] and used by [[Feliks Steuer]] for his poems in Silesian. The alphabet consists of 30 [[grapheme]]s and eight [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]:

: Letters: [[A]], [[B]], [[C]], [[Ć]], [[D]], [[E]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[I]], [[J]], [[K]], [[L]], [[Ł]], [[M]], [[N]], [[Ń]], [[O]], [[P]], [[R]], [[S]], [[Ś]], [[T]], [[U]], [[Ů]], [[W]], [[Y]], [[Z]], [[Ź]], [[Ż]]
: Digraphs: [[Au (digraph)|Au]], [[Ch (digraph)|Ch]], [[Cz (digraph)|Cz]], [[Dz (digraph)|Dz]], [[Dź (digraph)|Dź]], [[Dż (digraph)|Dż]], [[Rz (digraph)|Rz]], [[Sz (digraph)|Sz]]

Based on the Steuer alphabet, in 2006 the ''Phonetic Silesian Alphabet'' was proposed:&lt;ref&gt;[[:szl:Ślůnski alfabyt fůnetyčny|Ślůnski alfabyt fůnetyčny]]&gt; Phonetic Silesian Alphabet described on Silesian Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

: Letters: [[A]] [[B]] [[C]] [[Ć]] [[Č]] [[D]] [[E]] [[F]] [[G]] [[H]] [[I]] [[J]] [[K]] [[L]] [[M]] [[N]] [[Ń]] [[O]] [[P]] [[R]] [[Ř]] [[S]] [[Ś]] [[Š]] [[T]] [[U]] [[Ů]] [[W]] [[Y]] [[Z]] [[Ź]] [[Ž]].

Silesian's phonetic alphabet replaces the digraphs with single letters ([[Sz (digraph)|Sz]] with [[Š]], etc.) and does not include the letter [[Ł]], whose sound can be represented phonetically with [[U]]. It is therefore the alphabet that contains the fewest letters. Although it is the (phonetically) most logical and hence the most intuitive writing of Silesian, it did not become popular with Silesian organizations, with the argument that it contains too many [[caron]] diacritics and hence resembles the [[Czech alphabet]]. Large parts of the Silesian Wikipedia, however, are written in Silesian's phonetic alphabet.

Sometimes other alphabets are also used, such as the "Tadzikowy muster" (for the ''National Dictation Contest of the Silesian language'') or the Polish alphabet, but writing in this alphabet is problematic as it does not allow for the differentiation and representation of all Silesian sounds.&lt;ref name="slabikorz" /&gt;

== Culture ==
Silesian has recently seen an increased use in culture, for example:
* online news and information platform (founded in January 2018): [https://wachtyrz.eu Wachtyrz.eu]
* TV and radio stations (for example: TV Silesia, Sfera TV, TVP Katowice, Slonsky Radio,&lt;ref&gt;{{szl icon}} [http://www.slonskyradio.eu/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Piekary, Radio Silesia, Radio Fest);

In 2003, the National Publishing Company of Silesia ({{lang|pl|Narodowa Oficyna Śląska}}) commenced operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narodowaoficynaslaska.friko.pl/|title=Narodowa Oficyna Śląska|trans-title=National Publishing Company of Silesia|language=szl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904145609/http://www.narodowaoficynaslaska.friko.pl/|archivedate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publisher was founded by the Alliance of the People of the Silesian Nation ({{lang|pl|Związek Ludności Narodowości Śląskiej}}) and it prints books about Silesia and books in Silesian language.

In July 2007, the Slavic Silesian language was given the [[ISO 639-3]] code &lt;code&gt;szl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="SIL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=szl |title=ISO documentation of Silesian language |publisher=[[SIL International]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2007, 23 politicians of the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Polish parliament]] made a statement about a new law to give Silesian the official status of a [[regional language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://katowice.naszemiasto.pl/wydarzenia/865999.html |title=Śląski wśród języków świata |trans-title=Silesian Among the Languages of the World |author=[[Dziennik Zachodni]] |year=2008 |publisher=Our News [[Katowice]] |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official National [[Dictation (exercise)|Dictation Contest]] of the Silesian language ({{lang|pl|Ogólnopolskie Dyktando Języka Śląskiego}}) took place in August 2007. In dictation as many as 10 forms of writing systems and orthography have been accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{szl icon}} / {{pl icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.dyktando.org |title=National Dictation contest of the Silesian language }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ortography: diacritic, Czech, phonetic, Hermannowa, Polish, Polish plus, Steuer's, Tadzikowa, Wieczorkowa, multisigned.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2008 and in June 2008, two organizations promoting Silesian language were established: [[Pro Loquela Silesiana]] and {{lang|szl|Tôwarzistwo Piastowaniô Ślónskij Môwy "Danga"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dz.com.pl/?tekst,2484 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620224607/http://www.dz.com.pl/?tekst,2484 |archivedate=2008-06-20 |title=Śląski wśród języków świata |trans-title=The Silesian language is a foreign language |work=[[Dziennik Zachodni]] |year=2008 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2008, the [[Silesian Wikipedia]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://technologie.gazeta.pl/technologie/1,82008,5248211,Slaska_Wikipedia_juz_dziala.html |title=Śląska Wikipedia już działa |trans-title=Silesian Wikipedia already operating |work=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]-Gospodarka |year=2008 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2008 in the edifice of the [[Silesian Parliament]] in [[Katowice]], a conference took place on the status of the Silesian language. This conference was a forum for politicians, linguists, representatives of interested organizations and persons who deal with the Silesian language. The conference was titled "Silesian — Still a Dialect or Already a Language?" ({{lang|pl|Śląsko godka — jeszcze gwara czy jednak już język?}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[File:Wikinews-logo.svg|16px|alt=|link=]] {{cite web |url=http://pl.wikinews.org/wiki/Katowice:_konferencja_dotycz%C4%85ca_statusu_%C5%9Bl%C4%85skiej_mowy |title=Katowice: konferencja dotycząca statusu śląskiej mowy |trans-title=Katowice: Conference concerning the status of the Silesian language |work=Polish [[Wikinews]] |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Ministry of Administration and Digitization (Poland)|Ministry of Administration and Digitization]] registered the Silesian language in Annex 1 to the Regulation on the state register of geographical names;&lt;ref name="MoAaD"&gt;[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20120000309 Dz.U. 2012 nr 0 poz. 309] - Internet System of Legal Acts&lt;/ref&gt; however, in a November 2013 amendment to the regulation, Silesian is not included.&lt;ref&gt;Dz.

'''''Série noire''''' is a [[France|French]] [[publishing]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], founded in 1945 by [[Marcel Duhamel]]. It has released a [[Collection (publishing)|collection]] of [[crime fiction]] of the [[hardboiled|hardboiled detective thrillers]] variety published by [[Gallimard]].

[[Anglosphere|Anglo-American]] literature forms the bulk of their collection: it features especially [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Horace McCoy]], [[William R. Burnett]], [[Evan Hunter|Ed McBain]], [[Chester Himes]], [[Lou Cameron]], [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], [[James Hadley Chase|Rene Brabazon Raymond]] (under his pseudonym James Hadley Chase) and Peter Cheney. Books from the series were adapted into episodes on the 1984 television series [[Série noire (TV series)|of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/quel-polar-litteraire-choisir-sur-petit-ecran_898458.html |title=Quel polar littéraire choisir sur petit écran? |last1=Liger |first1=Baptiste |date=11 June 2010 |work=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |language=French |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This name became a generic term for works of detective, and is considered having inspired the French critic [[Nino Frank]] to create in 1946 the phrase [[Film noir]], which describes [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[Crime film|crime dramas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeculture.com/Contents/1945-70.htm|title=1945-70|publisher=Crimeculture.com|accessdate=30 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309034524/http://www.crimeculture.com/Contents/1945-70.htm|archivedate=9 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commentfaiton.com/fiche/voir/9582/comment-definir-le-film-noir|title=Comment définir le film noir ?|work=commentfaiton.com|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdbuzz.com/?le-film-noir|title=Le Film Noir|publisher=Kdbuzz.com|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common parlance, today, the term also means a series of dramatic events with similarities, or affecting the same victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/monde/fukushima-la-serie-noire-continue-03-10-2013-1738518_24.php|title=Fukushima : la série noire continue|author=Le Point, magazine|work=Le Point.fr|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marianne.net/Serie-noire-chez-JP-Morgan_a232318.html|title=Série noire chez JP Morgan|author=Adrien Francius|work=Marianne|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The English Schoole-Maister: Teaching all his schollers, the order of distinct reading, and true writing our English tongue''''' is a [[dictionary]] compiled by [[Edmund Coote]], former Headmaster of [[King Edward VI School, Bury St Edmunds|King Edward VI School]], Bury St Edmunds, and first published in [[London]] in 1596. At least 40 editions were published between its first publication and the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Fenton&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenton|first=Mary C.|title=Milton's Places of Hope: Spiritual And Political Connections of Hope With Land|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=9780754657682|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It went through several editions, with later editions having slightly different subtitles.

The publishing of the book most likely lead to him losing his job as headmaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8995">'''Thomas Edvard ''"Tom"'' Krogh''', [[Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]] (1936 &amp;ndash; April 29, 2008) was a [[Geochronology|geochronologist]] and a former [[curator]] for the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]. He revolutionized the technique of [[Radiometric dating|radiometric]] [[uranium-lead dating]] with the development of new laboratory procedures and analytical methodologies. His discoveries have yielded an unprecedented level of precision in the dating of [[Precambrian]] rocks. Krogh's techniques have become the international de facto standard. The application of these techniques has provided a detailed understanding of the evolution of the Earth's Precambrian shield areas.

==Education==
Krogh was born in [[Peterborough, Ontario]]. Between 1955 and 1959, he studied geological engineering at [[Queen's University]] and held several jobs. For the first two summers he worked as a Geological Assistant at [[Noranda (mining company)|Noranda Mines]] and [[Triana Explorations]], respectively. Between 1957 and 1959, he worked as a Teaching Assistant at the university. In 1958, he supported the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] as a Geological Assistant. In 1959, he was a Senior Assistant for the Ontario Department of Mines. Krogh obtained a [[Master's degree|MSc]] in geology from the university in 1960. He left Canada to study at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he continued to work whenever he was not studying. His first job was as a Teaching Assistant in Mineralogy, then as a [[Geology|Geologist]] at [[Teck Cominco|Cominco]], then as a Research Assistant in [[Geochronology]]. In 1964, he obtained his [[Doctorate|PhD]] in geochronology.

==Career==
Between 1964 and 1975, Krogh worked at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He was a post-doctoral fellow in [[isotope|isotopic]] [[geochemistry]] until 1964 when he became a Scientific Staff Member.  From 1964 to 1970, he specialized in [[Rubidium]]–[[Strontium]] dating of minerals and rocks. In 1970, he switched to specializing in the Uranium-Lead dating of [[zircon]]s and other minerals.

In 1975, Krogh returned to Canada to work as the Associate Curator/Director of the Royal Ontario Museum's Geochronology Laboratory. In 1976, he became a Professor in the Geology Department of the [[University of Toronto]]. In 1978, he shifted to be Graduate Faculty Member with the university.

In 1979, he returned to the Royal Ontario Museum to be their Full Curator.

He worked on the [[Lithoprobe]] project between 1991 and 1996.

==Discovery==
Krogh's main focus of research has been geochronology, an effort which has long involved the integration of field work (particularly in high-grade gneisses of the Grenville Province) with clean-laboratory isotope dilution techniques. With uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating he developed a simple, yet innovative air-abrasion technique for removing exterior portions of minerals that may have suffered Pb-loss, which, combined with improved magnetic separation methods, greatly improved the accuracy and precision of [[zircon geochronology]].  In addition, Krogh's laboratory methods for the dissolution of minerals and the subsequent chemical separation of trace quantities of uranium and lead resulted in a significant reduction of environmental Pb contamination (blank) to ultra-low levels, and permitted increasingly small quantities of mineral grains and sub-grain domains to be analyzed. In the mid-1980s, he was instrumental in producing a synthetic 205Pb isotopic tracer (spike) that was distributed for use in U-Pb geochronology laboratories worldwide. The application of Krogh's novel and innovative techniques has revolutionized U-Pb geochronology and permitted the ages of rocks to be determined with unprecedented accuracy and precision. Most of what is known of the Earth's 4.5 billion-year history has been placed in precise geological sequence using these dating methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8590">'''Tu'er Shen''' ({{zh|c=兔兒神}}, '''The Leveret Spirit''') or '''Tu Shen''' ({{zh|c=兔神}}, '''The Rabbit God'''), is a [[Shen (Chinese religion)|Chinese deity]] who manages the love and sex between homosexual people. His name literally means "[[rabbit]] deity".

In a folk tale from 17th century [[Fujian]], a soldier is in love with a provincial official, and spies on him to see him naked. The official has the soldier tortured and killed, but he returns from the dead in the form of a leveret (a rabbit in its first year) in the dream of a village elder. The leveret demands that local men build a temple to him where they can burn incense in the interest of "affairs of men". The story ends:
{{quote|According to the customs of Fujian province, it is acceptable for a man and boy to form a bond [''qi''] and to speak to each other as if to brothers.  Hearing the villager relate the dream, the other villagers strove to contribute money to erect the temple.  They kept silent about this secret vow, which they quickly and eagerly fulfilled.  Others begged to know their reason for building the temple, but they did not find out.  They all went there to pray.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch, Bret.  (1990).  ''Passions of the Cut Sleeve''.  University of California Press.  p.133&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legends==
According to ''[[What the Master Would Not Discuss]]'' ({{zh|t=子不語}}),  a book written by [[Yuan Mei]] during the [[Qing dynasty]], Tu'er Shen was a man called Hu Tianbao (胡天保). Hu was originally a man who fell in love with a very handsome imperial inspector of Fujian Province. One day he was caught peeping on the inspector through a bathroom wall, at which point he confessed his reluctant affections for the other man. The imperial inspector had Hu Tianbao sentenced to death by beating. One month after Hu Tianbao's death, he is said to have appeared to a man from his hometown in a dream, claiming that since his crime was one of love, the underworld officials decided to right the injustice by appointing him the god and safeguarder of homosexual affections.&lt;ref&gt;Szonyi, Michael "The Cult of Hu Tianbao and the Eighteenth-Century Discourse of Homosexuality." Late Imperial China - Volume 19, Number 1, June 1998, pp. 1-25, The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

After his dream the man erected a shrine to Hu Tianbao, which became very popular in Fujian, so much so that in late Qing times, the cult of Hu Tianbao was targeted for extermination by the Qing government.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The deity can be seen as an alternative to [[Yue Lao]], the matchmaker god, for heterosexual relations.

==Cults==
A slang term for homosexuals in late imperial China was "rabbits"&lt;ref&gt;Kang, Wenqing, 2009, "Obsession: Male Same-Sex Relations in China, 1900–1950", Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, pp 19, 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; which is why Hu Tianbao is referred to as the rabbit deity, though in fact he has nothing to do with rabbits and should not be confused with [[Tu'er Ye]], the rabbit on the moon.

===Government suppression===
Images of Hu Tianbao show him in an embrace with another man. The sense that the villagers must keep the reason for the temple secret in the story may relate to pressure from the central Chinese authorities to abandon the practice.  Qing official Zhu Gui (1731-1807), a grain tax circuit intendant of Fujian in 1765, strove to standardize the morality of the people with a "Prohibition of Licentious Cults".  One cult which he found particularly troublesome was the cult of Hu Tianbao. As he reports,
{{quote|The image is of two men embracing one another; the face of one is somewhat hoary with age, the other tender and pale. [Their temple] is commonly called the small official temple. All those debauched and shameless rascals who on seeing youths or young men desire to have illicit intercourse with them pray for assistance from the plaster idol. Then they make plans to entice and obtain the objects of their desire. This is known as the secret assistance of Hu Tianbao. Afterwards they smear the idol's mouth with pork intestine and sugar in thanks.&lt;ref&gt;Szonyi, Michael. "The Cult of Hu Tianbao and the eighteenth-Century Discourse of Homosexuality." ''Late Imperial China'' (Volume 19, Number 1, June 1998): 1&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modern interpretations===
Although Tu'er Shen is popularly revered by some temples, some Taoist schools may have considered homosexuality as sexual misconduct through history, probably deeming it is outside marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Ultra Supreme Elder Lord's Scripture of Precepts(太上老君戒經), in "The Orthodox Tao Store" (正統道藏).&lt;/ref&gt; Though many Taoism scriptures do not mention anything against same-gender relations, mostly maintaining neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Seven Slips of Cloudy Satchel volume 38-40(雲笈七籤.說戒部), in "The Orthodox Tao Store" (正統道藏).&lt;/ref&gt;

The story may be an attempt to mythologize a system of [[same-sex marriage|male marriages]] in Fujian attested to by the scholar-bureaucrat Shen Defu and the writer [[Li Yu (author)|Li Yu]].  The older man in the union would play the masculine role as a ''qixiong'' or "adoptive older brother", paying a "bride price" to the family of the younger man- it was said virgins fetched higher prices- who became the ''qidi'', or "adoptive younger brother".  Li Yu described the ceremony, "They do not skip the three cups of tea or the six wedding rituals- it is just like a proper marriage with a formal wedding."&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch, Bret.  (1990).  Passions of the Cut Sleeve.  University of California Press.  p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''qidi'' then moved into the household of the ''qixiong'', where he would be completely dependent on him, be treated as a son-in-law by the ''qixiong''s parents, and possibly even help raise children adopted by the ''qixiong''.  These marriages could last as long as 20 years before both men were expected to marry women in order to procreate.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch, Bret.  (1990).  Passions of the Cut Sleeve.  University of California Press.  p. 131- 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Stevens reports seeing images like these in [[Hokkien]]-speaking communities in Taiwan island, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Keith. "The wrestling princes". Journal of the Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society - Volume 42, 2002, pp.431-434&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens refers to these images as 'brothers' or 'princes' and calls them Taibao (太保), which is probably a perversion of Tianbao. Stevens was usually told that the two figures in an embrace were brothers, and only in one temple in Fujian was he told that they were homosexuals. A photo of an image from a temple in Kaohsiung is provided by Stevens on p.&amp;nbsp;434 of his article.

The history of Hu Tianbao has been largely forgotten even by the temple keepers. However, there is a temple in [[Yonghe District]], [[Taiwan]] that venerates Hu Tianbao in his traditional guise. The temple is known as the Hall of Martial Brilliance (威明堂).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weimingtang.url.tw/ 威明堂兔兒神殿]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
In 2006,Lu Wei-ming founded a temple for Tu'er Shen in [[Yonghe District]] in the [[New Taipei City]] in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/people/2015/01/26/praying-for-a-soul-mate-at-rabbit-temple/&lt;/ref&gt; About 9000 gay pilgrims visits the temple each year for praying to get a suitable partner&lt;ref&gt;https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_6499210&lt;/ref&gt; The Wei-ming temple also performs a love ceremony for gay couples.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newnownext.com/taiwanese-rabbit-temple-drawing-gay-pilgrims/01/2015/&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world's only religious shrine for Homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/taiwan-gay-temple/taiwans-gays-pray-for-soul-mates-at-rabbit-temple-idINKBN0KS0R120150119&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two Women Beside a Linen Chest, with a Child''''' (c. 1663) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]], it is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Amsterdam Museum]], on loan to the [[Rijksmuseum]].

This painting by Hooch was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1908, who wrote; "25. THE GOOD HOUSEWIFE. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm.]] Suppl. 38. ; de G. 13.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/569/mode/1up Comparative table] of catalog entries between John Smith's first [[Catalogue raisonné]] of Hooch and Hofstede de Groot's first list of Hooch paintings published in [[Oud Holland]]&lt;/ref&gt; A woman is putting away linen in a great oak press, inlaid with ebony, which stands to the right in a room. A girl, who, to judge from her fine clothes, is the woman's daughter, is helping her and taking the linen from a large basket. At the back are a high window and an open door, at which stands a child playing with a stick and a ball. A winding staircase and a cushioned chair are seen to the left of the room. 

"Although this picture does not possess the brilliant and luminous effect which is so much coveted in this master's works, yet it has the charm of such truth and reality in appearance that it may justly be reckoned among his best works ; the drawing and finishing are singularly 
perfect" (Sm.). Signed "P. de Hoogh, 1663" ; canvas, 30 inches by 28 inches.

Circuit]] that refused to recognize a [[common law]] [[affirmative defense]] of addiction in a criminal prosecution for the possession of [[heroin]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, R.J. et al.  ''Criminal Law, Second Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York: 2004, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The defendant Moore was charged with the possession of heroin, and in his defense sought to introduce psychiatric testimony that because of his heroin [[Substance dependence|addiction]] he lacked substantial capacity to conform his behavior to the standards of the criminal law.  The court refused to recognize Moore's proposed common law defense of addiction because of difficulties in administration and inconsistency with the [[Model Penal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, p. 590&lt;/ref&gt;

A dissenting opinion by [[Judge J. Skelly Wright]] advocated for the recognition of the common law defense.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viracocha''' is the great [[creator deity]] in the pre-Inca and [[Inca mythology]] in the [[Andes]] region of South America.  Full name and some spelling alternatives are '''Wiracocha''',&lt;ref name=Salazar/&gt; '''Apu Qun Tiqsi Wiraqutra''', and '''Con-Tici''' (also spelled '''Kon-Tiki''', the source of the name of [[Kon-Tiki|Thor Heyerdahl's raft]]).  Viracocha was one of the most important deities in the [[Inca]] pantheon and seen as the creator of all things, or the substance from which all things are created, and intimately associated with the sea.&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{cite book

Viracocha was worshipped as god of the [[sun god|sun]] and of storms. He was represented as wearing the sun for a crown, with thunderbolts in his hands, and tears descending from his eyes as rain.

==Cosmogony according to Spanish accounts==
According to a myth recorded by [[Juan de Betanzos]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/ancient_religion/pages/viracocha.html Alan Kolata's Valley of the Spirits: a Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara] (1996), pages 65-72&lt;/ref&gt; Viracocha rose from Lake [[Titicaca]] (or sometimes the cave of [[Paqariq Tampu]]) during the time of darkness to bring forth light.&lt;ref name="Nature Myths"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Tamra |title=Dictionary of Nature Myths|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|pages=216|isbn=0-19-513677-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA216}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made the sun, moon, and the stars. He made mankind by breathing into stones, but his first creation were brainless giants that displeased him. So he destroyed it with a flood and made a new, better one from smaller stones.&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/2121372|title=Viracocha|year=1996|work=Bloomsbury Dictionary of Myth|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd., London|accessdate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viracocha eventually disappeared across the Pacific Ocean (by walking on the water), and never returned. He wandered the earth disguised as a beggar, teaching his new creations the basics of civilization, as well as working numerous miracles. He wept when he saw the plight of the creatures he had created.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} It was thought that Viracocha would re-appear in times of trouble. [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]] wrote that Viracocha was described as "a man of medium height, white and dressed in a white robe like an [[alb]] secured round the waist, and that he carried a staff and a book in his hands."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/inca/inca01.htm Viracocha and the Coming of the Incas] from "History of the Incas" by Pedro Sarmiento De Gamboa, translated by Clements Markham, Cambridge: The Hakluyt Society 1907, pp. 28-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one legend he had one son, [[Inti]], and two daughters, [[Mama Killa]] and [[Pachamama]]. In this legend, he destroyed the people around Lake Titicaca with a [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]] called [[Unu Pachakuti]] lasting 60 days and 60 nights, saving two to bring civilization to the rest of the world, these two beings are [[Manco Cápac]], the son of Inti (sometimes taken as the son of Viracocha), which name means "splendid foundation", and [[Mama Ocllo|Mama Uqllu]], which means "mother fertility".  These two founded the Inca civilization carrying a golden staff, called 'tapac-yauri'. In another legend, he fathered the first eight civilized human beings. In some stories, he has a wife called [[Inca mythology|Mama Qucha]].

In another legend,&lt;ref name="first nation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpeople.us/glossary/native-american-gods-south-america-inca.html|title=Glossary, Inca Gods|publisher=First People of America and Canada - Turtle Island|accessdate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viracocha had two sons, Imahmana Viracocha and Tocapo Viracocha. After the Great Flood and the Creation, Viracocha sent his sons to visit the tribes to the northeast and northwest to determine if they still obeyed his commandments. Viracocha himself traveled North. During their journey, Imaymana and Tocapo gave names to all the trees, flowers, fruits, and herbs. They also taught the tribes which of these were edible, which had medicinal properties, and which were poisonous. Eventually, Viracocha, Tocapo and Imahmana arrived at Cusco (in modern-day Peru) and the Pacific seacoast where they walked across the water until they disappeared. The word "Viracocha" literally means "Sea Foam."&lt;ref name="first nation" /&gt;

==Etymology==
''Tiqsi Huiracocha'' may have several meanings.  In the [[Quechuan languages]], ''tiqsi'' means foundation or base, ''wira'' means fat, and ''qucha'' means lake, sea, or reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Acopa, Diccionario Bilingüe, Iskay simipi yuyay k'ancha, Quechua – Castellano, Castellano – Quechua&lt;/ref&gt;
Viracocha's many epithets include ''great'', ''all knowing'', ''powerful'', etc.
Some people state that ''Wiraqucha'' could mean ''"Fat (or foam) of the sea"''.&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt;&lt;ref name=Damian&gt;{{cite book

However, linguistic, historical and archaeological evidence suggest that the name could be a borrowing of Aymara ''Wila Quta'' (''wila'' "blood"; ''quta'' "lake"), due to the sacrifices of [[camelid]]s that were celebrated at Lake Titiqaqa by pre-Incan Andean cultures that spoke Aymara &lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino, Las lenguas de los incas: el puquina, el aimara y el quechua&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over "White God"==

Spanish chroniclers from the 16th century claimed that when the [[conquistadors]] led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] first encountered the Incas they were greeted as gods, "Viracochas", because their lighter skin resembled their god Viracocha.&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Spanish America: a documentary history'', Kenneth R. Mills, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This story was first reported by [[Pedro Cieza de León]] (1553) and later by [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]]. Similar accounts by Spanish chroniclers (e.g. [[Juan de Betanzos]]) describe Viracocha as a "white god", often with a beard.&lt;ref&gt;''Pre-Columbian America: Myths and Legends'', Donald. A. Mackenzie, Senate, 1996, p.268-270&lt;/ref&gt; The whiteness of Viracocha is however not mentioned in the native authentic legends of the Incas and most modern scholars therefore had considered the "white god" story to be a post-conquest Spanish invention.&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: encyclopedia of Pseudoscience'', "white god legends", Michael Shermer, ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MocheBeardedMen.jpg|right|thumb|Moche ceramic vessels depicting bearded men]]
Similarly to the [[Inca Empire|Incan]] god Viracocha, the [[Aztec]] god [[Quetzalcoatl]] and several other deities from Central and South American pantheons, like the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] god [[Bochica]] are described in legends as being bearded.&lt;ref name="Siemens, William L 1979"&gt;Siemens, William L. "Viracocha as God and Hero in the Comentarios Reales." Hispanic Review 47, no. 3 (1979): 327-38. doi:10.2307/472790.&lt;/ref&gt; The beard, once believed to be a mark of a prehistoric European influence and quickly fueled and embellished by spirits of the colonial era, had its single significance in the continentally insular culture of Mesoamerica. The ''Anales de Cuauhtitlan'' is a very important early source which is particularly valuable for having been originally written in Nahuatl. The ''Anales de Cuauhtitlan'' describes the attire of Quetzalcoatl at Tula:
{{quote|Immediately he made him his green mask; he took red color with which he made the lips russet; he took yellow to make the facade; and he made the fangs; continuing, he made his beard of feathers...&lt;ref&gt;Anales de Cuauhtitlan., 1975, 9.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this quote the beard is represented as a dressing of feathers, fitting comfortably with academic impressions of Mesoamerican art. The story, however, does not mention whether Viracocha had facial hair or not with the point of outfitting him with a mask and symbolic feathered beard being to cover his unsightly appearance because as Viracocha said "If ever my subjects were to see me, they would run away!"&lt;ref&gt;http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/ReadingQuetzalcoatl.html&lt;/ref&gt; While descriptions of Viracocha's physical appearance are open to interpretation, it should be noted that men with beards were frequently depicted by the Peruvian [[Moche culture]] in its famous pottery, long before the arrival of the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/30203/Portrait_Vase_of_Bearded_Figure_Black Portrait Vase of Bearded Figure], Brooklyn Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Modern advocates of theories such as a [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories|pre-Columbian European migration]] to Peru cite these bearded ceramics and Viracocha's beard as being evidence for an early presence of non-Amerindians in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;''Fingerprints of the Gods'', Graham Hancock, Mandarin, 1996, pp.50-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''In Quest of the Great White Gods'', Robert F.

==Representation of Wiracochan or Tunupa at Ollantaytambo==
[[File:Ollantaytambo, Tunupa monument.jpg|thumb|upright|Face in stone of Wiracochan or Tunupa at [[Ollantaytambo]]]]
A representation of the messenger of Viracocha named Wiracochan or Tunupa is shown in the small village of [[Ollantaytambo]], southern Peru. Ollantaytambo located in the [[Cusco Region]] makes up a chain of small villages along the Urubamba Valley. Known as the [[Sacred Valley]], it was an important stronghold of the [[Inca Empire]]. Facing the ancient Inca ruins of Ollantaytambo in the rock face of ''Cerro Pinkuylluna'' is the 140 metre high figure of Wiracochan. The angry-looking formation of his face is made up of indentations that form the eyes and mouth, whilst a protruding carved rock denotes the nose. Inca ruins built on top of the face are also considered to represent a crown on his head. Artists' impressions of the rock face also include a heavy beard and a large sack upon his shoulders.

The face of Viracocha at Ollantaytambo can be captured as noted by Fernando and Edgar Elorrieta Salazar.&lt;ref name=Salazar&gt;Fernando E. Elorrieta Salazar &amp; Edgar Elorrieta Salazar (2005) Cusco and the Sacred Valley of the Incas, pages 83-91 {{ISBN|978-603-45-0911-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiracochan, the pilgrim preacher of knowledge, the master knower of time, is described as a person with superhuman power, a tall man, with short hair, dressed like a priest or an astronomer with tunic and a bonnet with four pointed corners.

==Conversion to Christianity==

Spanish scholars and chroniclers provide many insights regarding the identity of Viracocha.

# [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] states that viracocha means "creator of all things" &lt;ref name="Itier"&gt;Itier, César. ''Viracocha o El Océano: Naturaleza y Funciones De Una Divinidad Inca''. Lima: IFEA; IEP, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Juan de Betanzos]] confirms the above in saying that "We may say that Viracocha is God" &lt;ref name="Betanzos"&gt;Betanzos, Juan de, María del Carmen Martín Rubio, and Digitalia (Firm). ''[http://www.classicly.com/library &lt;nowiki&gt;Suma y narración De Los Incas [Electronic Resource]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503220044/http://www.classicly.com/library |date=3 May 2016 }}''.Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Polo, [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa|Sarmiento de Gamboa]], [[Blas Valera]] and Acosta all reference Viracocha as a creator&lt;ref name="Itier" /&gt;
# [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala|Guamán Poma]], an indigenous chronicler, considers the term "viracocha" to be equivalent to "creator"&lt;ref name="Poma"&gt;Guamán Poma de Ayala, Felipe, and Franklin Pease G. Y. ''Nueva crónica y Buen Gobierno;''. Lima,: Casa de la Cultura del Perú, 1969. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors such as [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso de la Vega]],&lt;ref name="Siemens, William L 1979"/&gt; Betanzos, and Pedro de Quiroga&lt;ref name="Quiroga"&gt;Pedro de Quiroga, El indio dividido. Fracturas de conciencia en el Perú colonial. Ana Vian Herrero (ed.). – Madrid/Frankfurt, Iberoamericana/Vervuert, 2009. 572 p. (colección : Parecos y australes 2) – {{ISBN|978-84-8489-393-6}} (Iberoamericana) ; 978386527 4137 (Vervuert)&lt;/ref&gt; hold that Viracocha wasn't the original name of "God" for the Incas.&lt;ref name="Itier" /&gt; According to Garcilaso, the name of God in the language of the Incas was "[[Pachamama]]", not Viracocha.&lt;ref name="Garcilaso"&gt;Vega, Garcilaso de la, and Ana Gerzenstein. ''Comentarios Reales.'' [Buenos Aires]: Plus Ultra, [1967]. Coleccion Clasicoshispanoamericanos, 10-11 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Spanish interpreters generally attributed the identity of supreme creator to Viracocha during the initial years of colonization.&lt;ref name="Itier" /&gt;

According to Antoinette Molinié Fioravanti, Spanish clergymen began to equate the "God of creation" with Viracocha in an attempt to combat the polytheistic worship of the Incas, which in their view was idolatrous. The existence of a "supreme God" in the Incan view was used by the clergy to demonstrate that the revelation of a single, universal God was "natural" for the human condition.&lt;ref name="Molinie"&gt;Molinié-Fioravanti, Antoinette. [http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/avistamientos_ovnis/El%20regreso%20de%20Viracocha,A.Molinie.pdf "El Regreso De Viracocha."] ''Bulletin de l'Institut francais d'études Andins'' 16.3-4 (1987)Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian scholars such as [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] held that philosophers of all nations had learned of the existence of a supreme God.&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. Bloomingdale, OH: Apostolate for Family Consecration John Paul II Holy Family Center, 1994. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church - The Revelation of God''. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, medieval European philosophy believed that without the aid of revelation, no one could fully understand such great truths such as the nature of “The Trinity”.&lt;ref name="Itier" /&gt;

The decision to use the term "God" in place of "Viracocha" is seen as the first step in the evangelization of the Incas.&lt;ref name="Itier" /&gt; The reasoning behind this strategy includes the fact that it was likely difficult to explain the Christian idea of "God" to the Incas, who failed to understand the concept. In addition, replacing reference to Viracocha with "God" facilitated the substitution of the local concept of divinity with Christian theology.&lt;ref name="Itier" /&gt;

'''''Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide''''' is a 2008 non-fiction book by Glenn Kay about [[zombie (fictional)|zombies in popular culture]], primarily [[zombie film]]s.  It was updated in 2012 to include television episodes and more films.

== Publication ==
The initial printing was in 2008.  A second edition was published on October 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37731/two-new-books-for-your-horror-library-the-coffee-table-book-of-doom-and-zombie-movies-the-ultimate-guide/|title=Two New Books for Your Horror Library: The Coffee Table Book of Doom and Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide|last=Moore|first=Debi|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2012-09-22|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
Kay traces the history of zombie films from ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' in 1932 to modern days.  The updated version has reviews of approximately 400 films and adds reviews of television shows, such as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]''.  Films are rated on a five-point scale, which includes a "so bad it's good" score.  Also included are interviews and [[film still]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/zombie-movies-the-ultimate-guide/Content?oid=1592070|title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide|last=Hoff|first=Al|work=[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]|date=2012-11-28|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Jeremy Martin of ''[[San Antonio Current]]'' wrote that Kay "most certainly makes some omissions" and has idiosyncratic inclusion criteria, but the writing is humorous.  Martin suggests that Kay's list of top films would make a "great start for beginners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacurrent.com/sanantonio/zombie-movies-the-ultimate-guide/Content?oid=2284749|title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide|last=Martin|first=Jeremy|work=[[San Antonio Current]]|date=2008-11-05|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Justin Dimos of [[PopMatters]] rated it 7/10 stars and called it "the zombie movie bible for the film student and horror moviegoer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/zombie-movies-by-glenn-kay/|title=Zombie Movies by Glenn Kay|last=Dimos|first=Justin|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2008-10-30|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewing the updated edition, Rod Lott of the ''[[Oklahoma Gazette]]'' wrote, "With hundreds of capsule reviews and nearly as many photos and posters, it’s something no self-respecting psychotronic film fan should be without ... especially now that it's grown even larger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://okgazette.com/2012/10/31/zombie-movies-the-ultimate-guide-second-edition-glenn-kay/|title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide: Second Edition — Glenn Kay|last=Lott|first=Rod|work=[[Oklahoma Gazette]]|date=2012-10-31|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doug Sarti of ''[[The Georgia Straight]]'' wrote, "With such a wealth of information, Kay's book is bound to keep any zombiephile entertained for days, reliving the thrill of favourite classics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/life/comprehensive-zombie-movie-guide-lives-again|title=Comprehensive zombie-movie guide lives again|last=Sarti|first=Doug|work=[[The Georgia Straight]]|date=2012-10-23|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ryan Daley of ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' wrote, "Kay is a knowledgeable writer with a dry sense of humor, and while he offers some genuinely keen observations regarding the evolution of the subgenre, some readers will vehemently disagree with his individual ratings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3200256/book-review-small-press-roundup-serial-killers-zombie-cats-and-more/|title=[Book Review] Small Press Roundup: Serial Killers, Zombie Cats, And More!|last=Daley|first=Ryan|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2012-10-31|accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Šauška''' or '''Shaushka''' ([[Hittite language|Hittite]]: ''Šauša'', &amp; later ''Šawuška''&lt;ref&gt;Beckman, Gary. "Ištar of Nineveh Reconsidered." JCS 50 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Hurrian]] goddess who was also adopted into the [[Hittites|Hittite]] pantheon. She is known in detail because she became the patron goddess of the Hittite king [[Hattusili III]] (1420–1400 BC) following his marriage to [[Puduhepa]], the daughter of the goddess' high priest. Her cultic center was [[Lawazantiya]] in [[Kizzuwatna]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sirkeli-project.info/en/research_sitename.html Sirkeli Höyük – Exploring an Ancient Hittite City in Cilicia]''. Accessed 11 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaushka is a goddess of fertility, war and healing. She is depicted in human form with wings, standing with a lion and accompanied by two attendants. She was considered equivalent to the Mesopotamian goddess [[Ishtar]] and is sometimes identified using Ishtar's name in Hittite cuneiform.&lt;ref&gt;Beckman, Gary. "Ištar of Nineveh Reconsidered." JCS 50 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaushka is interesting in that she uses her authority in matters of sexuality to mess around a little where she saw fit. Texts describe Shaushka as similar to Ishtar, as an ambiguous goddess who supervised [[conjugal love]] and harmonious relationships but, unpredictably, could turn love into a dangerous endeavor. Reliefs at [[Yazilikaya]] show the goddess twice: in one relief she is depicted with male gods and in another with the goddesses. According to Hittite texts about Shaushka of Lawazantiya: she is clothed like a man and like a woman, and has male attributes such as an axe and weapons. Sometimes this has been taken as a sign of her bisexual or [[androgynous]] character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karel van der Toorn |author2=Bob Becking |author3=Pieter Willem van der Horst |title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9004111190 | pages=758–759 |date=1999 | publisher=Brill | ISBN=90-04-11119-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amarna letters ''"Šauška"''==
In the [[1350 BC|1350]]-[[1335 BC]] [[Amarna letters]] [[Text corpus|correspondence]], (written mostly to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]]), one letter EA 23, ([[EA (el Amarna)|EA]] for 'el [[Amarna]]'), written to the pharaoh, has as its topic, the ''Loaning of a Statue'' to Egypt. It is presumed that it's due to the health of the Egyptian king, but there are other theories or explanations.

The title of the letter is: ''"A [[goddess]] travels to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]"''.

It is a short, 32-line letter, from [[Tushratta]], (letter no. 7 of 13), and the 2nd half of the letter states:
:''"Now, in the time, too, of my father ... ..went to this country, and just as earlier she dwelt there and they honored her, may my brother now honor her 10 times more than before. May my brother honor her, &amp;ndash;(then) at (his) pleasure let her go so that she may come back.''
:''May Šauška, the mistress of heaven, protect us, my brother and me, 100,000 years, and may our mistress grant both of us great joy. And let us act as friends.''
:''Is Šauška for me alone my god(dess), and for my brother not his god(dess)?"''

Black Egyptian script is also written on the reverse side of this letter, (in the open space remaining).
