{{DISPLAYTITLE:2009 United Kingdom ''E. coli'' outbreak}}

The '''2009 ''E. coli'' outbreak in the United Kingdom''' was an outbreak of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' in visitors to a farm in [[Surrey]] from August to September 2009.&lt;ref name=UKReport&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/342361/Review_of_major_outbreak_of_e_coli_o157_in_surrey_2009.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2016 |title=Review of the major outbreak of ''E. coli'' O157 in Surrey, 2009 |publisher=Public Health England, Independent Investigation Committee |date=June 2010 |pages=10–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 93 people were affected, most of whom were under 10 years of age. Of those affected, 27 were hospitalized and 17 developed [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]].&lt;ref name=UKReport/&gt;

Investigations by the [[Health Protection Agency]] implicated a petting barn at Godstone Farm as a possible source of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=UKReport/&gt; Fecal samples from several animals in the barn later tested positive for the strain of ''E. coli'' in the patients, again indicating that the barn may have been the source of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=UKReport/&gt; Godstone Farm voluntarily closed the barn in September 2009, after which there were no further cases.&lt;ref name=UKReport/&gt;

'''Actua Corporation''' was a [[venture capital]] firm. During the [[dot com bubble]], the company had a [[market capitalization]] of over $50 billion. The company was originally known as Internet Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Actua Corporation in September 2014. In 2018, the company underwent [[liquidation]].&lt;ref name=liquidation&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1085621/000119312518122202/d573879d8k.htm | title=Actua 8-K | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Incubator ===
In March 1996, [[Ken Fox]] and [[Walter Buckley (businessman)|Walter Buckley]] left Safeguard Scientifics to form Internet Capital Group (ICG), a [[venture capital]] firm focused on [[business-to-business]] e-commerce.&lt;ref name=following/&gt; They asked Safeguard Scientifics CEO [[Pete Musser]] for $5 million in funding, but he insisted on investing $15 million. In total, Buckley and Fox raised $40 million to start ICG, twice what they wanted. In addition to Safeguard Scientifics, major investors included [[Comcast]], [[Compaq]], BancBoston Ventures, and a dozen individuals.&lt;ref name=following&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/09/17/310278/index.htm | title=Following The Money Some 680 men, women, techies, and, yes, schools got pre-IPO shares of Internet highflier ICG. Here's how they became insiders and what they did as the stock crashed. | first=Andy | last=Serwer | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=September 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the company was organized as a [[limited-liability company]].&lt;ref name=following/&gt;

Following the "[[keiretsu]]" model used by Safeguard Scientifics, the company was heavily involved in the operations of the companies in which it invested and the start-ups would do business with each other, increasing the value of all parties.&lt;ref name=following/&gt; Its annual meetings were opportunities for CEOs of partner companies to share their experiences and cut new deals. One member CEO called it "a perfect way to manage chaos."&lt;ref name=one-stock/&gt; The work environment was casual, or as one partner company CEO called it, "almost like a fraternity".&lt;ref name=turks/&gt;

One of ICG's first investments was a website called Water Online. Under the guidance of ICG, in late 1997, Water Online hired [[Mark Walsh (businessman)|Mark Walsh]], head of AOL's B2B division, as CEO. The company changed its name to [[VerticalNet]], expanded into 47 different industries, and became one of the first B2B companies to become a [[public company]], albeit with limited revenue.&lt;ref name=one-stock/&gt;

Spurning opportunities to invest in online [[retail]]ers such as [[CDNow]] and [[AutoWeb]], ICG developed a reputation as "the VCs to see if you were an entrepreneur with a B2B idea."&lt;ref name=one-stock/&gt; In July 1998, [[GE Capital]] invested in the company in a financing round that generated $70 million. Early investments began to pay off and ICG generated additional funds by selling some of its positions.&lt;ref name=following/&gt; However, unlike traditional venture capitalists, Buckley and Fox envisioned that ICG would hold most of its investments for ten years or longer. The duo were ambitious, aiming to have a stake in 80% of the B2B market. In the fall of 1998, to support this goal, the company aggressively hired top talent from companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]], [[General Electric]], [[Cambridge Technology Partners]], [[Heidrick &amp; Struggles]], and [[Softbank]]. After much effort, Fox persuaded Sam Jadallah, Microsoft's chief of enterprise sales and marketing, to join the company.&lt;ref name=one-stock/&gt; In February 1999, the company converted to a [[C corporation]]. In May, $90 million of additional funding was raised via a [[convertible bond]] issue. 

=== Public Company ===
In August 1999, the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]], offering 14.9 million shares at $12 per share. The company sold another 7.5 million shares to [[IBM]], generating more than $200 million.&lt;ref name=following/&gt;&lt;ref name=roundup/&gt; [[Dell Computer]] bought 1 million of the shares in the IPO. High-profile investors now included [[Amerindo Investment Advisors]], the [[House of Saud]], the [[Penske]] family, and [[David Bonderman]].

Internet Capital has stakes in 36 hot B2B startups. | first=Erick | last=Schonfeld | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=September 27, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the IPO, ICG held stakes in 35 companies.&lt;ref name=roundup&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.cnet.com/IPO-Roundup-Internet-Capital-Group-flies-in-debut,-Mission-Critical-also-gains/2100-12_3-265295.html | title=IPO Roundup: Internet Capital Group flies in debut, Mission Critical also gains | work=[[CNET]] | date=August 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half the businesses aimed to create either an [[online marketplace]] or [[online community]], while the other half were engaged in [[software development]]. 

The stock doubled in price on its first day, and hit $50 per share in October 1999.&lt;ref name=following/&gt; Book value of the company, including stakes in VerticalNet and U.S. Interactive which had gone public, was only about $1 billion and Wall Street was betting on future success.&lt;ref name=one-stock/&gt; 

By December 1999, the stock was trading at over $200 per share. Buckley's stake of 10 million shares, or 3.5% of the company and Fox's stake of 12 million shares, or 4.5% of the company, were each worth over $2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB979079311344158702 | title=1. IPOs Will Make You Rich | first=Ruth | last=Simon | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=January 29, 2001}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was valued at nearly $60 billion, making it the 3rd largest Internet company by market capitalization behind [[AOL]] and [[Yahoo!]]. By then, the company had invested $300 million in 39 start-ups and had a staff of 29 people to manage and advise those companies. Operations were split into two locations with Buckley serving as CEO and working out of the Philadelphia area, while Fox managed West Coast operations in [[San Francisco]]. Three executives were hired in November to head a new European team.&lt;ref name=turks&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-10-31/internet-capitals-young-turks | title=Internet Capital's Young Turks | first=Amy | last=Barrett | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=November 1, 1999}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1999, the company raised over $1 billion in additional capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB945380302947799267 | title=Internet Capital Group Announces Massive Stock and Debt Offerings | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=December 16, 1999}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=following/&gt; During its first 9 months as a corporation, it realized only $14.8 million of revenue and lost $6.4 million. In 1998, it recorded a profit of $14 million on $3 million of revenue, with the profits coming from sales of companies.&lt;ref name=one-stock/&gt;

By February 1, 2000, the stock had declined nearly $100 per share in anticipation of insider selling at the expiration of the [[lock-up period]]. However, retail investors bought up insider shares, stabilizing the price.&lt;ref name=following/&gt; Meanwhile, the company continued to expand its investments. By early 2000, the company had invested $1.4 billion in 61 start-up firms, and was forging new partnerships with old economy leaders.&lt;ref name=buckley&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2000-05-15/walter-buckley-iii | title=Walter Buckley III | first=Amy | last=Barrett | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=May 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid expansion was motivated by what Fox called "the biggest wealth-creation opportunity the world has ever seen" – finding the promising e-commerce B2B companies before anyone else.&lt;ref name=turks/&gt;

The [[NASDAQ Composite]] [[stock market index]] peaked in March 2000 and the company was hurt by the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]]. By April 2000, its stock was down to $40 a share and GE Capital filed to sell nearly 1 million shares. By June 2000, the stock was down to $30 per share. Buckley, who sold very little of his own stock, remained optimistic.&lt;ref name=following/&gt; By November 2000, the stock was down to $11 per share&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/11/09/technology/overview/ | title=The $1.7 trillion dot.com lesson | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=November 9, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the [[September 11 attacks]] it traded for 70 cents per share.&lt;ref name=following/&gt; Two years after its peak in March 2000, the company had a [[market capitalization]] of $200 million, down 99.5%.&lt;ref name=new_name&gt;{{cite news | url=https://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/Actua-New-name-for-a-company-with-fresh-hopes-a-551806 | title=Actua: New name for a company with fresh hopes | first=Joseph N. | last=DiStefano | work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company survived the crash, and changed its business model. Instead of taking small stakes in many companies, it invested in a few "core" companies at a time, usually as majority owner. This allowed the company to have much greater control over the operations of its investments. Buckley refocused the company to find strategic partnerships with traditional industry leaders such as a joint venture with [[DuPont]] called CapSpan in early 2000.&lt;ref name=buckley/&gt; ICG sold Logistics.com to [[Manhattan Associates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sdcexec.com/home/press-release/10310040/manhattan-associates-acquires-logisticscom|title=Manhattan Associates Acquires Logistics.com|work=Supply &amp; Demand Chain Executive|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $20 million in 2003.

=== Winding down ===
In February 2013, the company sold its stake in Channel Intelligence to [[Google]] for $60 million in proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/06/google-acquires-channel-intelligence-to-boost-product-recommendations-and-e-commer-with-users/ | title=Google Acquires Channel Intelligence for $125 Million | first=Ingrid | last=Lundgren | work=[[TechCrunch]] | date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the company sold Procurian to [[Accenture]] for $375 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/12/05/594818/10060497/en/ICG-Group-Announces-Completion-of-Sale-of-Procurian-to-Accenture-for-375-Million.html | title=ICG Group Announces Completion of Sale of Procurian to Accenture for $375 Million | publisher=[[Globe Newswire]] | date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, when the company changed its name to Actua Corporation, its stock was trading around $20 per share and was worth approximately $700 million.&lt;ref name=new_name/&gt;

In October 2016, the company sold [[Govdelivery]] to [[Vista Equity Partners]] for $153 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/10/19/880875/0/en/Actua-Announces-Completion-of-Sale-of-GovDelivery-to-Investor-Group-Led-By-Vista-Equity-Partners-for-153-Million-in-Cash.html | title=Actua Announces Completion of Sale of GovDelivery to Investor Group Led By Vista Equity Partners for $153 Million in Cash | publisher=[[Globe Newswire]] | date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the company sold its interests in VelocityEHS and Bolt Solutions for $328 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/12/1253425/0/en/Actua-Announces-Successful-Completion-of-Sale-of-VelocityEHS-and-Bolt-Solutions.html | title=Actua Announces Successful Completion of Sale of VelocityEHS and Bolt Solutions | publisher=[[Globe Newswire]] | date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the company sold FolioDynamix for net proceeds of $166.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/01/02/1277273/0/en/Actua-Announces-Completion-of-Sale-of-FolioDynamix.html | title=Actua Announces Completion of Sale of FolioDynamix | publisher=[[Globe Newswire]] | date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the company underwent [[liquidation]].&lt;ref name=liquidation/&gt;

==Reactions and analysis==
Syria's president Bashar al-Assad said that the conflict had become a war by proxy between the Russian and US superpowers, who were still embroiled in a [[cold war|Cold War]]. According to him, the offensive was a necessary step towards pushing terrorists out of Syria and into Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKCN12D2FY|title=Syria's Assad says taking Aleppo from rebels key to pushing 'terrorists' back to Turkey|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=16 October 2016|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Reuters]]'' and ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' described the offensive as a possible turning point in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-idINKCN11Y1QM|title=Warplanes knock out Aleppo hospitals as Russian-backed assault intensifies|date=28 September 2016|author=Ellen Francis, Tom Perry|publisher=Reuters|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="turning"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-syria-aleppo-20160928-snap-story.html Why the fight for Aleppo is a turning point in the Syrian war].

{{Politics of Algeria}}

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Algeria]] on 26 February 1987. The country was a [[one-party state]] at the time, with the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) as the sole legal party. The FLN nominated 885 candidates for the 295 seats, with voters asked to express their preference by crossing out names on the ballot. Only 67 of the 132 incumbents who ran for re-election were successful.

Voter turnout was over 87%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/ALGERIA_1987_E.PDF Algeria] Inter-Parliamentary Union&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7562">'''Anna Eleonora Ekelöf''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1765), was a [[Swedes|Swedish]] serial [[impostor]]. She committed fraud with a series of [[false identity|false identities]], posing as [[mamsell]], [[noblewoman]], [[officer]], Count and the [[Gustav III of Sweden|Crown Prince of Sweden]] before her arrest in 1765.

==First fraud==
In June 1765, Anna Ekelöf was arrested dressed in male clothing in [[Värmland]] near the Swedish-Norwegian border. Being put on trial for investigation, she was revealed to have committed a serial of [[identity fraud]]s. Witnesses testified that she was first encountered in the border area dressed as a [[mamsell]], claiming to be on the run to marry her beloved, who was not approved by her parents. After this, she dressed herself as a nobleman with a white wig and introduced herself as Count Carl Ekeblad, who had merely been forced to escape Sweden dressed as a woman after having been exiled from Stockholm due to an incident, and who was merely awaiting the King's forgiveness to return.

As Count Ekeblad, she had recruited a retinue of Swedes and Norwegians, among them the runaway Swedish farmer Olof Persson, the runaway Swedish baker Schutlz, who acted as servants, as well as the wife of Police officer Istmin, Emerentia Schröder, "To dance and ammuse himself with". She was housed at the Löfsnäs manor in Norway, belong to the sister of Emerentia. During her time as Count, Ekelöf lived a "debauched life with drinking, foul language, foolhardily riding and a never ending use of tobacco", and was also known to threaten and struck people who opposed her. She defended herself by saying that she had only acted in such a way to be trustworthy in her role as a man.

==Second fraud==
At the customary office of [[Magnebro]], she then had rumors spread which let it be known that she was in fact the Swedish Crown Prince in disguise who, in a conflict with [[riksråd]] Count [[Carl Gustaf Tessin]] and the nobility party of the parliament, had come to  prepare a [[coup d'etat]] to depose the government. This was in fact not an unlikely rumor, as there was at the time many serious rumors circulating about planned uprisings against the government since the [[Coup of 1756]] by [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Queen Louisa Ulrika]]. The actual Crown Prince was in the same age and with the same fragile built as Ekelöf, and Anna Ekelöf was furthermore equipped with a vast and up to date knowledge about the current political situation.

When rumors reached the Danish-Norwegian authorities in [[Oslo]] that someone alleged to be the Swedish heir to the throne was present at the border, Ekelöf was taken captive and brought to Oslo, where her identity as a woman was discovered. She was apparently allowed to return to the border, but was soon after arrested by the Swedish authorities, who subjected her to a physical examination to establish her gender.

==Trial==
Anna Ekelöf admitted posing as a Count, but denied to have ever posed as the heir to the throne, and if so, only under the intoxication of alcohol. She stated that she was the 20-year-old daughter of a diseased sea captain in Gothenburg, and that she had run away from home to elope    and meet her beloved, sergeant Magnus Sandberg, in Norway, where they could marry without the approval of his disapproving parents. She had not intended to pose as a man, she had merely put the clothes on, after having been provided them by a runaway Swedish baker on the way, because her own clothes had been damaged during the trip and the nobleman clothes was nearer to her social class as a mamsell. The whole posing as a count was merely an innocent play while she awaited to be united with her beloved.

The authorities, furthermore, suspected her to have eloped over the border with the purpose of performing an abortion, and suggested that her relationship with Magnus Sandberg was in fact incestuous. During the trial, it was discovered that she on several previous occasions had left a trace of false identities: she had, on various occasions, posed as a runaway girl, fleeing from an arranged marriage to marry her true love. The story of a girl eloping for love dressed as a man was a popular motive in contemporary novels, a story she apparently used often in past deceptions.

The only testimony that may give a suggestion to her real identity, was a testimony given a previous trial, in which she had been imprisoned at [[Halmstad Castle]]. At that occasion, care taker Emanuel Bergman from [[Borås]] pointed her out to be the same person as a certain ”Passannicka” ('Pass Port-Annicka'), who had previously been subjected to physical punishment for crimes committed in Borås and exiled from that city.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Liliequist: "'Att inte kunna förställa sig är att inte kunna leva' - om personlighet, identitet och kön i 1600- och 1700-talens Sverige" i Tom Eriksson &amp; Agneta, Guillemot (red) Individ och struktur i historisk belysning. Festskrift till Sune Åkerman (Umeå 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The true identity of Anna Ekelöf was never established, as she managed to escape custody and was never caught again. On her way to court to hear her verdict, the prison carriage broke down, and the party was forced to spend the night on the farm of the peasant Nils Amundsson. She managed to convince him that she was indeed the crown prince in disguise, and that he would be richly rewarded if he assisted her escape. The night of 12–13 June 1765, Amundsson knocked on her window, and she climbed out and mounted a horse he provided her, rode of toward the Norwegian border and was never seen again. Amundsson claimed that he had been so "intoxicated" by her talk that he had become "prepared to sacrifice his life and property" for her.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Liliequist: "'Att inte kunna förställa sig är att inte kunna leva' - om personlighet, identitet och kön i 1600- och 1700-talens Sverige" i Tom Eriksson &amp; Agneta, Guillemot (red) Individ och struktur i historisk belysning. Festskrift till Sune Åkerman (Umeå 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Ekelöf was not the only female criminal posing as a man in early modern Sweden. Kerstin Pedersdotter ran away from her abusive husband dressed as a man under the name Christopher and took refuge with her stepbrother, with whom she made a theft tour through the countryside, and was, similar to Ekelöf, accused of having dressed as a man to hide an incestuous relationship. Gunilla Harberg, known as ”Tjuv-Gunnil” (Gunnil the Thief), had escaped to [[Karlskrona]] dressed as a man under the name Gunnar after a burglary in [[Kalmar]].

The '''Battle of Spilia''' was fought on 12 December 1955 in the [[EOKA]] campaign against the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;The Memoirs of General Grivas, edited by Charles Foley, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting on information provided by an informant,&lt;ref name="foley57"&gt;The Memoirs of General Grivas, edited by Charles Foley, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 700 soldiers of the British Army&lt;ref name="foley57"/&gt; attempted to encircle the headquarters of EOKA General [[Georgios Grivas]] on the [[Troodos mountains]] near the village of [[Spilia, Cyprus|Spilia]].&lt;ref name="foley56"&gt;The Memoirs of General Grivas, edited by Charles Foley, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; As they ascended the mountain, EOKA guerrillas spotted them. Grivas divided his troops in two, keeping half with himself to fight the units coming from the north side while sending his second-in-command [[Grigoris Afxentiou]] to fight the rest of the British who were ascending on the south side. Both EOKA units retreated to the summit of the mountain after engaging the enemy and then proceeded, in heavy fog, to escape towards the west. Soon, the British units from the north and the ones from the south reached the summit and, unable to see clearly in the fog, and in the belief that they were surrounded by EOKA fighters, started shooting and calling in airstrikes at each other for eight hours&lt;ref name="foley56"/&gt; with 50 casualties — 4 deaths and 46 injuries.

This was a renowned battle in the EOKA campaign to unite Cyprus with [[Greece]] (1955–1959). It was significant in that a British victory at Spilia would have ended the campaign in its very first year since General Grivas had concentrated his [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla fighters]], nearly thirty of them, there.&lt;ref&gt;The Memoirs of General Grivas, edited by Charles Foley, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the struggle went on and led, if not to union (''[[Enosis]]''), to the independence of Cyprus.

The '''Battle of the 300 Champions''', known since  Herodotus' day as the '''Battle of the Champions''', was a battle fought in roughly 546 BC between [[Argos]] and [[Sparta]]. Rather than commit full armies both sides agreed to pitting 300 of their best men against each other. 

According to [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.82&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 Herodotus, The Histories 1.82]&lt;/ref&gt; Sparta had surrounded and captured the plain of Thyrea. When the Argives marched out to defend it, the two armies agreed to let 300 champions from each city fight, with the winner taking the territory. Presumably the idea was to reduce the total number of casualties.  Both armies marched home, so as to prevent either side from helping their champions and escalating the duel into a full battle. 

Neither side would allow for any injured men to be taken. The day called for complete destruction of the enemy force for victory. The two armies were evenly matched and neither could gain the upper hand. They fought until nightfall, and after a bloody battle only three men remained, two Argives and one Spartan. The Argives, Alcenor and Chromius, believing that they had killed all of the Spartans, left the battlefield racing home to Argos to announce their victory. However, they had made one mistake: Othryades, an injured Spartan had survived. As he was technically the last man standing on the battlefield from either army, he too claimed victory. He survived long enough to tell his baggage handlers of this, and then he committed suicide. By tradition, Othryades was ashamed to be the only man in his unit to live, and so he killed himself on the field of battle rather than return to Sparta. The reason for the suicide is up for debate, but the act is of great importance. Othryades did not die by an Argive sword, and the Spartans could always claim that he survived the battle and killed himself in shame, thus gaining an upper hand due to this act of honor.

Both sides were able to claim victory: the Argives because more of their champions had survived, and the Spartans because their single champion held the field. Argos did not take too kindly to the Spartans claiming victory and sent their entire [[hoplite]] army which was met by a Spartan force of equal magnitude. The Spartans won a decisive victory and as a result gained control of [[Thyrea, Greece|Thyreatis]].

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] adds that the battle was foretold by the [[Sibyl]], and that the Argives considered themselves the victors and dedicated a bronze sculpture of the Trojan horse at Delphi to commemorate the victory. However, Pausanias says that the sculptor of this horse was [[Antiphanes of Argos]], who dates to ca. 400 BC. Therefore, either Pausanias is mistaken, or he is confusing this with a battle at Thyrea in 424 BC. 

Years later, in 420 BC during a lull in the [[Peloponnesian War]], Argos challenged Sparta to a rematch of the Battle of the 300 Champions. Sparta declined.

The '''Blancpain GT World Challenge Europe''', formerly the '''FIA GT Series''' in 2013 and the '''Blancpain Sprint Series''' in 2014 and 2015, and ''Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup'' from 2016 to 2018, is a [[sports car racing]] series organized by the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation]] (SRO) with the approval of the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA). The championship now exclusively races in [[Europe]], but had in previous years visited other continents including [[Asia]]. The series continues the sprint format for GT-cars carried out by the defunct [[FIA GT1 World Championship]].&lt;ref name= "GO2013"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://gt1world.com/news/details/fia-gt-series-is-go-for-2013| title= FIA GT SERIES IS GO FOR 2013 | accessdate= 2013-01-10| date= 2013-01-10|work=gt1world.com| publisher=Stéphane Ratel Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
The Blancpain GT World Challenge Europe is contested with [[Group GT3|GT3]]-spec cars. Each event consists of two races over a weekend with two drivers per car and a mandatory pit stop.

==Races==
The schedule of the Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup consists of races in Europe and Asia. The majority of the races are held on mid-size European circuits.

==History==
In 2013, the FIA GT Series was created after the demise of the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]] and the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]]. The series was supposed to form the ''FIA GT World Series'' in conjunction with the [[Blancpain Endurance Series]]. This plan was abandoned before the start of the 2013 season.

The name of the FIA GT Series resembles the [[FIA GT Championship]] (1997-2009) that was known for its endurance races all over the world. Except for the mandatory driver changes the two championships differ highly in sporting and technical regulations.

In 2014, the competition changed the name for Blancpain Sprint Series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blancpain-gt-series.com/news/details/blancpain-watches-extends-partnership-to-the-sro-promoted-gt-sprint-series&lt;/ref&gt;

After developing their partnership, [[Blancpain]] and the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO]] have decided that 2016 will see both the Sprint and Endurance Series further integrated into the Blancpain GT Series, putting the emphasis on the prestigious overall drivers' and manufacturers' titles causing the Sprint Series name to change from Blancpain Sprint Series to Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About Blancpain GT Series|url=http://www.blancpain-gt-series.com/about/blancpain-gt-series|publisher=[[Blancpain GT Series]]|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2018, the SRO acquired promotional rights to the [[Pirelli World Challenge]], a North American GT series sanctioned by the [[United States Auto Club]]. On 29 September 2018, the SRO changed the names of the Blancpain GT Asia and Sprint Cup, to adopt the World Challenge name used in North America. The three series together will be known as the Blancpain GT World Challenge, with each series adding their region to the series name (America, Asia, Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.blancpain-gt-series.com/news/1424/stephane-ratel-outlines-exciting-2019-season-plans-for-sro-motorsports-group?filter_season_id=8&amp;filter_series_id=0&amp;filter_team_news=0|title=Stephane Ratel outlines exciting 2019 season plans for SRO Motorsports Group|date=29 September 2018|website=blancpain-gt-series.com|publisher=[[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO Motorsports Group]]|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Child abduction''' or '''child theft''' is the unauthorized removal of a [[Minor (law)|minor]] (a child under the age of [[Age of majority|legal adulthood]]) from the [[Child custody|custody]] of the child's [[Parent|natural parents]] or [[Legal guardian|legally appointed guardians]].
 
The term child abduction conflates two legal and social categories which differ by their perpetrating contexts: abduction by members of the child's family or abduction by strangers:

* [[Parental child abduction]]: unauthorized custody of a child by a family relative (usually one or both parents) without parental agreement and contrary to family law ruling, which may have removed the child from the care, access and contact of the other parent and family side. Occurring around parental [[Legal separation|separation]] or [[divorce]], such parental or familial child abduction may include [[parental alienation]], a form of child abuse seeking to disconnect a child from targeted parent and denigrated side of [[family]].
* [[Kidnapping|Abduction or kidnapping]] by strangers (from outside the family, natural or legal guardians) who steal  a child for criminal purposes which may include:
** [[extortion]], to elicit a [[ransom]] from the guardians for the child's return
** illegal [[adoption]], a stranger steals a child with the intent to rear the child as their own or to sell to a prospective adoptive parent
** [[human trafficking]], a stranger steals a child with the intent to exploit the child themselves or by trade in a list of possible abuses including [[child slavery|slavery]], [[child labor|forced labor]], [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], or even [[Organ trade#Illegal organ trading|illegal organ trading]]
** [[murder]]

Neonatal "infant abduction" and prenatal [[fetal abduction]] are the earliest ages of child abduction as defined by a viable child through the age of majority. In addition, "embryo theft" and even "oocyte misappropriation" in reproductive medical settings have been legalistically construed as child abduction.&lt;ref name="pmid9242390"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lehrman S| title=University settles with patients over trade in 'stolen' embryos. | journal=Nature | year= 1997 | volume= 388 | issue= 6641 | pages= 411 | pmid=9242390 | doi=10.1038/41181 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=9242390  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Judith D.|title=Misappropriation of Human Eggs and Embryos and the Tort of Conversion: A Relational View|journal=Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review|date=1999|volume=32|issue=381|url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol32/iss2/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Karen T.|title=Embryo Theft: The Misappropriation of Human Eggs at an Irvine Fertility Clinic Has Raised a Host of New Legal Concerns for Infertile Couples Using New Reproductive Technologies|journal=Southwestern University Law Review|date=1997|volume=26|issue=1133|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/swulr26&amp;div=31&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abductions by strangers ==
The stereotypical version of child abduction by a stranger is the classic form of "[[kidnapping]]," exemplified by the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], in which the child is detained, transported some distance, held for ransom or with intent to keep the child permanently. These instances are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/nismart2_nonfamily.pdf |title=NISMART National Non-Family Abduction Report October 2002 (A study commissioned by the US Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention found that there were only approximately 115 stereotypical stranger abductions in 1999) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child abduction for ransom: United States ===
[[File:2007 report child plane.jpg|thumb|left|Image from the [[United States Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports]] on the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]]]]

The earliest nationally publicised kidnapping of a child by a stranger for the purpose of extracting a ransom payment from the parents was the Pool case of 1819, which took place in Baltimore, Maryland. Margaret Pool, 20-months-old, was kidnapped on May 20 by Nancy Gamble (19-years-old) and secreted with the assistance of Marie Thomas. On May 22, the parents, James and Mary Pool, placed an ad in the ''Baltimore Patriot'' newspaper offering a $20 reward for Mary's return. When the child was recovered on May 23—through the efforts of members of the community who conducted a search—it was revealed that the child had been badly whipped by Gamble and bore bloody wounds. Both Gamble and Thomas were tried for the crime of kidnapping and found guilty. The motive for the crime was demonstrated to be financial. She had kidnapped the child with the intention of waiting for a reward to be offered, then would return the child and collect the money. This is a technique favored by many ransom child kidnappers before the use of written ransom demands became the favored method.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Nancy Gamble's crime and subsequent trial were reported in detail in ''Baltimore Patriot'' (June 26, 1819). The June 26 article, as well as others on the case that had appeared in the ''Patriot'', were reprinted in newspapers in other states including: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and Washington D.C.

=== Children abducted for slavery ===
{{Main|Child slavery}}
In 1597, [[Elizabeth I of England]] licensed the abduction of children for use as chapel choristers and theatre performers.&lt;ref name=bbc130617&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22938866 | title = Elizabethan child actors 'kidnapped and whipped' | first = Sean | last = Coughlan | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports that abduction of children to be used or sold as [[slavery|slaves]] is common in parts of Africa.

The [[Lord's Resistance Army]], a rebel paramilitary group operating mainly in northern [[Uganda]], is notorious for its abductions of children for use as [[child soldier]]s or [[sex slave]]s. According to the [[Sudan Tribune]], {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, more than 30,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA and their leader, Joseph Kony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/article.php3?id_article=11792 |title=Time may be running out for Uganda's LRA warlord – Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan |publisher=Sudan Tribune |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By stranger to raise ===
A very small number of abductions result from - in most cases - women who kidnap babies (or other young children) to bring up as their own. These women are often unable to have children of their own, or have [[Miscarriage|miscarried]], and seek to satisfy their unmet psychological need by abducting a child rather than by [[adoption|adopting]]. The crime is often premeditated, with the woman often [[simulated pregnancy|simulating pregnancy]] to reduce suspicion when a baby suddenly appears in the household.

Historically, a few states have practiced child abduction for [[indoctrination]], as a form of punishment for political opponents, or for profit. Notable cases include the [[kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany]] (400,000 children kidnapped for possible [[Germanization]]),&lt;ref name=Sereny&gt;[[Gitta Sereny]], [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/children.html "Stolen Children"], rpt. in ''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]'' ([[American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise]]). Accessed September 15, 2008. (Reprinted by permission of the author from ''Talk'' [November 1999].)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[lost children of Francoism]], during which an estimated 300,000 children were abducted from their parents.&lt;ref name=bbc111018&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15335899 | title = Spain's stolen babies and the families who lived a lie | first = Katya | last = Adler | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 18 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guard110127&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/27/spain-alleged-stolen-babies-network | title = Victims of Spanish 'stolen babies network' call for investigation | first = Giles | last = Tremlett | work= [[The Guardian]] | date = 27 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the about 500 "Children of the Disappeared (Desaparecidos)" who were adopted by the military in the [[Dirty War|Argentine Dirty War]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Project Disappeared|title=La Sombra de Campo de Mayo Hospital militar -- Partos de desaparecidas| year= 2015 |url=http://www.desaparecidos.org/nuncamas/web/investig/saydom/lasombra/lasombr3_2.htm|language=Spanish|quote=Dos Partos - cesárea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of Conadep  - 1984  The Campo de Mayo Hospital|url=http://www.desaparecidos.org/nuncamas/web/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_215.htm|website=Nunca Más (Never Again)|language=English|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia the 'stolen generation' is the term given to native Aboriginal children who were forcibly abducted or whose mothers gave consent under duress or misleading information so the government could assimilate the black population into the white majority.

Some other abductions have been to make children available by [[child-selling]] for adoption by other people,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/china/21570762-curb-widespread-trafficking-abducted-children-officials-and-parents-are-turning-social ''Child Trafficking: A Cruel Trade'', in ''The Economist'', January 26, 2013], as accessed July 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; without adopting parents necessarily being aware of how children were actually made available for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Barbara Bisantz, ''The Baby Thief: The Untold Story of Georgia Tann, the Baby Seller Who Corrupted Adoption'' (New York: Union Square Press, 1st ed. 2007 ({{ISBN|978-1-4027-5863-8}})), p.&amp;nbsp;245.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parental child abduction ==
{{Main|Parental child abduction}}
By far the most common kind of child abduction is parental child abduction (200,000 in 2010 alone)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maureen|first=Dabbagh|title=Parental Kidnapping in America|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=US|isbn=978-0-7864-6533-0|page=1|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and often occurs when the parents separate or begin divorce proceedings. A parent may remove or retain the child from the other seeking to gain an advantage in expected or pending child-custody proceedings or because that parent fears losing the child in those expected or pending child-custody proceedings; a parent may refuse to return a child at the end of an ''[[contact (law)|access]] visit'' or may flee with the child to prevent an access visit or fear of domestic violence and abuse.

Parental child abductions may be within the same city, within the state region or within the same country, or may be international. Studies performed for the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention]] reported that in 1999, 53% percent of family abducted children were gone less than one week, and 21% were gone one month or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/nismart2_familyabduction.pdf |title=NISMART National Family Abduction Report, October 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International child abduction ===
{{Main|International child abduction}}

International child abduction occurs when a parent, relative or acquaintance of a child leaves the country with the child or children in violation of a custody decree or visitation order. Another related situation is retention where children are taken on an alleged vacation to a foreign country and are not returned.

While the number of cases which is over 600,000 a year consists of international child abduction is small in comparison to domestic cases, they are often the most difficult to resolve due to the involvement of conflicting international jurisdictions.  Two-thirds of international parental abduction cases involve mothers who often allege domestic violence. Even when there is a treaty agreement for the return of a child, the court may be reluctant to return the child if the return could result in the permanent separation of the child from their primary caregiver. This could occur if the abducting parent faced criminal prosecution or deportation by returning to the child's home country.

The [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] is an international human rights treaty and legal mechanism to recover children abducted to another country. The Hague Convention does not provide relief in many cases resulting in some parents hiring private parties to recover their children. Covert recovery was first made public when Don Feeney, a former Delta Commando, responded to a desperate mother's plea to locate and recover her daughter from Jordan in the 1980s. Feeney successfully located and returned the child. A movie and book about Feeney's exploits lead to other desperate parents seeking him out for recovery services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;#8250 Donya Al-Nahi |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671769340 |title=Rescue My Child: The Story of the Ex-Delta Commandos Who Bring Home Children Abducted Overseas: Neil C. Livingstone: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, both the United States, European authorities, and NGO's had begun serious interest in the use of mediation as a means by which some international child abduction cases may be resolved. The primary focus was on Hague Cases. Development of mediation in Hague cases, suitable for such an approach, had been tested and reported by REUNITE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reunite.org/ |title=Reunite International |publisher=Reunite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a London Based NGO which provides support in international child abduction cases, as successful. Their reported success lead to the first international training for cross-border mediation in 2008, sponsored by NCMEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com |title=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children |publisher=Missingkids.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held at the University of Miami School of Law, Lawyers, Judges, and certified mediators interested in international child abduction cases, attended.

International child abduction is not new. A case of international child abduction has been documented aboard the Titanic. However, the incidence of international child abduction continues to increase due to the ease of international travel, increase in bi-cultural marriages and a high divorce rate. Parental abduction has been defined as child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm |title=Parental Child Abduction is Child Abuse |first=Dr. Nancy |last=Faulkner |publisher=Prevent-abuse-now.com |date=June 9, 1999 |accessdate=September 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926135211/http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Missing Children's Network==
Launched in 1998 as a [[joint venture]] of the [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] (ICMEC) and NCMEC, the Global Missing Children's Network (GMCN) is a network of countries that connect, share [[best practices]], and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations.&lt;ref name=ncmissing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/GMCN|title=Global Missing Children's Network|publisher=NCMEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cyber&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0rVfRwcIPYgC&amp;pg=SA11-PA31&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg&amp;q=icmec%20children|title=Computer Forensics: Investigating Network Intrusions and Cyber Crime|author= EC-Council|publisher= Cengage Learning|pages=11–26, 11–31 to 11–33|year= 2009|ISBN=1435483529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=more/&gt;  The Network has 22 member countries: Albania, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the US.&lt;ref name=more&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/activities-in-more-than-22-countries-around-the-globe-will-remember-missing-children-on-may-25-2013-05-22|title=Activities in More than 22 Countries around the Globe will Remember Missing Children on May 25|date=May 22, 2013|work=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country can access a customizable website platform, and can enter missing children information into a centralized, multilingual database that has photos of and information about missing children, which can be viewed and distributed to assist in location and recovery efforts.&lt;ref name=ncmissing/&gt;&lt;ref name=cyber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/31680 "New Zealand Police joins Global Missing Children's Network"], [[New Zealand Police]].

The parents of [[Madeleine McCann]], a three-year-old girl who disappeared from her bed in a hotel in Portugal in 2007, approached ICMEC to help them publicize her case. ICMEC's YouTube channel, "Don'tYouForgetAboutMe," which lets people post videos, images, and information about their missing children, was launched that year as a part of these efforts, and {{as of|2014|November|lc=y}} had 2,200 members.&lt;ref name=peo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20051149,00.html|title=Madeleine McCann's Parents Create Missing Kids Site on Youtube|work=People|author=Ellen Tumposky|date=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/DontYouForgetAboutMe|title=DontYouForgetAboutMe|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/10/ukcrime.madeleinemccann|title=You have to blank out the dark thoughts|newspaper= ''The Guardian''|date=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ICMEC reviews the postings to ensure that any child in a posted video is in fact missing, that authorities are aware that the child is missing, and that the images are not inappropriate.&lt;ref name=peo/&gt;

A '''common year''' is a [[calendar year]] with 365 [[day]]s.  More generally, a common year is one without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]].  The [[Gregorian calendar]], (like the earlier [[Julian calendar]]), employs both common years and leap years to keep the calendar aligned with the [[tropical year]], which does not contain an exact number of days.

The common year of 365 days has 52 [[week]]s and one day, hence a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week (for example, January 1 and December 31 fell on a Sunday in 2017) and the year following a common year will start on the subsequent day of the week. In common years, February has four weeks, so March will begin on the same day of the week. November will also begin on this day.

In the Gregorian calendar, 303 of every 400 years are common years. By comparison, in the [[Julian calendar]], 300 out of every 400 years are common years, and in the [[Revised Julian calendar]] (used by Greece) 682 out of every 900 years are common years.

The '''consequences of the Black Death''' are the short-term and long-term effects of the [[Black Death]] on human populations across the world. They include a series of various biological, social, economic, political and religious upheavals which had profound effects on the course of [[world history]], especially [[History of Europe|European history]]. Often referred to as simply "The Plague", the Black Death was one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, peaking in Eurasia between 1331 and 1350 with an estimated one-third of the continent's population ultimately succumbing to the disease. Historians estimate that it reduced the total [[world population]] from 450&amp;nbsp;million to between 350 and 375&amp;nbsp;million. In most parts of Europe, it took nearly 80 years for population sizes to recover, and in some areas more than 150 years.

From the perspective of many of the survivors, however, the effect of the plague may have been ultimately favorable, as the massive reduction of the workforce meant their labor was suddenly in higher demand. R.H. Hilton has argued that those English peasants who survived found their situation to be much improved. For many Europeans, the 15th century was a [[golden age]] of prosperity and new opportunities. The land was plentiful, wages high, and [[serfdom]] had all but disappeared. A century later, as [[population growth]] resumed, the lower classes again faced deprivation and famine.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Hanawalt, "Centuries of Transition: England in the Later Middle Ages," in Richard Schlatter, ed., ''Recent Views on British History: Essays on Historical Writing since 1966'' (Rutgers UP, 1984), pp 43–44, 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reference"&gt;R.H.

==Death toll==
{{See also|Medieval demography}}

Figures for the [[infectious disease#Historic pandemics|death toll]] vary widely by area and from source to source, and estimates are frequently revised as historical research brings new discoveries to light. Most scholars estimate that the Black Death killed between 75 and 200 million people in the 14th century, at a time when the entire world population was still less than 500 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm |title=Black death 'discriminated' between victims |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |first=Will |last=Dunham |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1576875.stm |title=De-coding the Black Death |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=3 October 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kristen |last=Philipkoski |url=https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2001/10/47288 |title=Black Death's Gene Code Cracked |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=3 October 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even where the historical record is considered reliable, only rough estimates of the total number of deaths from the plague are possible.

===Europe===

Europe suffered an especially significant death toll from the plague. Modern estimates range between roughly one-third and one-half of the total European population in the five-year period of 1347 to 1351, during which the most severely affected areas may have lost up to 80 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;"The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45% to 50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe and Italy, the South of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75% to 80% of the population. In Germany and England, it was probably closer to 20%." [[Philip Daileader]], ''The Late Middle Ages'', audio/video course produced by [[The Teaching Company]], 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-59803-345-8}}.
Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n° 310, June 2006, pp.45–46, say "between one-third and two-thirds"; Robert Gottfried (1983). "Black Death" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', volume 2, pp.257–67, says "between 25 and 45&amp;nbsp;percent".
Daileader, as above; Barry and Gualde, as above, Gottfried, as above. 
Norwegian historian Ole J. Benedictow ('The Black Death: The Greatest Catastrophe Ever', ''History Today'', Volume 55 Issue 3 March 2005 (http://www.historytoday.com/ole-j-benedictow/black-death-greatest-catastrophe-ever); cf. Benedictow, ''The Black Death 1346–1353: The Complete History'', Boydell Press (7 Dec. 2012), pp. 380ff.) suggests a death rate as high as 60%, or 50 million out of 80 million inhabitants.&lt;/ref&gt;
Contemporary chronicler [[Jean Froissart]], incidentally, estimated the toll to be one-third, which modern scholars consider less an accurate assessment than an allusion to the [[Book of Revelation]] meant to suggest the scope of the plague.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Froissart, ''Chronicles'' (trans. Geoffrey Brereton, Penguin, 1968, corrections 1974), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths were not evenly distributed across Europe, with some areas affected very little while others were all but entirely depopulated.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Patrick Byrne (2004). ''The Black Death''. {{ISBN|0-313-32492-1}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Death hit the culture of towns and cities disproportionately hard, although rural areas (where most of the population lived at the time) were also significantly affected. Larger cities were the worst off, as population densities and close living quarters made disease transmission easier. Cities were also strikingly filthy, infested with [[Louse|lice]], [[flea]]s, and [[rat]]s, and subject to diseases caused by malnutrition and poor [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Kelly (2005), "[w]oefully inadequate sanitation made medieval urban Europe so disease-ridden, no city of any size could maintain its population without a constant influx of immigrants from the countryside". The influx of new citizens facilitated the movement of the plague between communities and contributed to the longevity of the plague within larger communities. Kelly, John. ''The Great Mortality, an Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time''. NY: HarperCollins, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence]]'s population was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 to 50,000 in 1351. Between 60 and 70 percent of [[Hamburg]]'s and [[Bremen]]'s populations died. In [[Provence]], [[Dauphiné]], and [[Normandy]], historians observe a decrease of 60 percent of fiscal hearths. In some regions, two-thirds of the population was annihilated. In the town of [[Givry, Saône-et-Loire|Givry]], in the [[Bourgogne]] region of France, the local friar, who used to note 28 to 29 funerals a year, recorded 649 deaths in 1348, half of them in September. About half of [[Perpignan]]'s population died over the course of several months (only two of the eight physicians survived the plague). Over 60 percent of Norway's population died between 1348 and 1350.&lt;ref name = "Forskning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/juli/1090833676.68 |title=Svartedauden Enda verre enn antatt |publisher=Forskning.no |author=Harald Aastorp |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London]] may have lost two-thirds of its population during the 1348–49 outbreak;&lt;ref name=guardian811&gt;{{cite news | URL = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/black-death-rats-off-hook | title = Black Death study lets rats off the hook | last = Kennedy | first = Maev |date = 17 August 2011 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; England as a whole may have lost 70 percent of its population, which declined from 7&amp;nbsp;million before the plague to 2&amp;nbsp;million in 1400.&lt;ref&gt;Barry and Gualde 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few rural areas, especially in [[Kingdom of Poland|Eastern Poland]] and [[Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], had such low populations and were so isolated that the plague made little progress there. Other places, including parts of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] region, [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and [[Limbourg]] (in modern Belgium), as well as [[Santiago de Compostela]], were unaffected for unknown reasons. Some historians&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, "The Smallest Thing  of History" (''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'', in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°310, June 2006, pp.45–46&lt;/ref&gt; have assumed that the presence of resistant [[blood group]]s in the local population helped them resist infection, although these regions were touched by the second plague outbreak in 1360–63 (the "little mortality") and later during the numerous resurgences of the plague (in 1366–69, 1374–75, 1400, 1407, etc.). Other areas which escaped the plague were isolated in mountainous regions (e.g. the [[Pyrenees]]).

All social classes were affected, although the lower classes, living together in unhealthy places, were most vulnerable. [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] was the only European monarch to die of the plague, but [[Peter IV of Aragon]] lost [[Eleanor of Portugal, Queen of Aragon|his wife]], his daughter, and a niece in six months. [[Joan of England (1335–1348)|Joan of England]], daughter of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], died in [[Bordeaux]] on her way to Castile to marry Alfonso's son, [[Peter of Castile|Pedro]]. The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] lost his son, while in the [[France in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of France]], [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan of Navarre]], daughter of [[Louis X of France|Louis X ''le Hutin'']] and [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]], was killed by the plague, as well as [[Bonne of Bohemia|Bonne of Luxembourg]], the wife of the future [[John II of France]].

===Asia===

Estimates of the demographic effect of the plague in Asia are based on population figures during this time and estimates of the disease's toll on population centers. The most severe outbreak of plague in the Chinese province of [[Hubei]] in 1334 claimed up to 80 percent of the population.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} China had several [[List of epidemics|epidemics]] and [[famine]]s from 1200 to the 1350s and its population decreased from an estimated 125&amp;nbsp;million to 65&amp;nbsp;million in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Joseph J. |last=Spengler |jstor=177771 |title=Review (''Studies on the Population of China, 1368–1953'' by Ping-Ti Ho) |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |date=October 1962 |volume=5 |pages=112–114 |issue=1 |doi=10.1017/s0010417500001547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1999-02/919734037.Mi.r.html |title=Re: How many people recovered from Black Death (Bubonic Plague) |publisher=MadSci Network |date=22 February 1999 |first=Michael |last=Maguire |at=ID: 918741314.Mi |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Asia-Tsunami/Worlds-long-dance-with-death/2005/01/07/1104832310525.html |title=World's long dance with death |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |first=Jonathan |last=King |date= 2005-01-08|accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise demographic effect of the disease in the [[Middle East]] is very difficult to calculate. Mortality was particularly high in rural areas, including significant areas of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Syria]]. Many rural people fled, leaving their fields and crops, and entire rural provinces are recorded as being totally depopulated. Surviving records in some cities reveal a devastating number of deaths. The 1348 outbreak in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] left an estimated 10,000 people dead, while [[Aleppo]] recorded a death rate of 500 per day during the same year. In [[Damascus]], at the disease's peak in September and October 1348, a thousand deaths were recorded every day, with overall mortality estimated at between 25 and 38 percent. Syria lost a total of 400,000 people by the time the epidemic subsided in March 1349. In contrast to some higher mortality estimates in Asia and Europe, scholars such as John Fields of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin believe the mortality rate in the Middle East was less than one-third of the total population, with higher rates in selected areas.

==Social, environmental, and economic effects==

Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause of the Black Death, many Europeans ascribed supernatural forces, earthquakes and malicious conspiracies, among other things, as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.&lt;ref name=Bennett-329&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Europe: A Short History |author1 =Judith M. Bennett |author2 =C. Warren Hollister |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |page=329 |isbn=0-07-295515-5 |oclc=56615921}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one in the 14th century considered rat control a way to ward off the plague, and people began to believe only God's anger could produce such horrific displays of suffering and death. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], an Italian writer and poet of the era, questioned whether it was sent by God for their correction, or that it came through the influence of the heavenly bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.vt.edu/Burr/Sources.html|title=Boccaccio on the Plague|last=Boccaccio|first=Giovanni|date=|website=Virginia Tech|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians accused Jews of poisoning public water supplies in an effort to ruin European civilization. The spreading of this rumor led to complete destruction of entire Jewish towns, and was simply caused by suspicion on part of the Christians, who noticed that the Jews had lost fewer lives to the plague due to their hygienic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newhhealthguide.org/Where-Did-The-Black-Death-Start|title=Where Did the Black Death Start|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1349, 2,000 Jews were murdered in [[Strasbourg]]. In August of the same year, the Jewish communities of [[Mainz]] and [[Cologne]] were exterminated.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Hollister, 329–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where government authorities were concerned, most [[monarchy|monarchs]] instituted measures that prohibited exports of foodstuffs, condemned [[underground economy|black market]] [[speculators]], set [[price controls]] on grain, and outlawed large-scale fishing. At best, they proved mostly unenforceable. At worst, they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad from France because of the prohibition and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by [[piracy|pirates]] or [[looters]] to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their [[treasury]] and exacerbating [[inflation]]. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Malnutrition, poverty, disease and hunger, coupled with war, growing inflation and other economic concerns made Europe in the mid-14th century ripe for tragedy.

Europe had been [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://voices.yahoo.com/the-devastating-impact-black-death-marriage-376886.html?cat=9&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] contends that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers. He states that "the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations." This leveling effect was reversed by a "demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292–293 &amp; 304}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1357, a third of property in London was unused due to a severe outbreak in 1348–49.&lt;ref name=guardian811/&gt; However, for reasons that are still debated, population levels declined after the Black Death's first outbreak until around 1420 and did not begin to rise again until 1470, so the initial Black Death event on its own does not entirely provide a satisfactory explanation to this extended period of decline in prosperity. See [[Medieval demography]] for a more complete treatment of this issue and current theories on why improvements in living standards took longer to evolve.

===Effect on the peasantry===

The great population loss brought favourable results to the surviving peasants in England and Western Europe. There was increased social mobility, as depopulation further eroded the peasants' already weakened obligations to remain on their traditional holdings. [[Seigneurialism]] never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay O'Brien|author2=William Roseberry|title=Golden Ages, Dark Ages: Imagining the Past in Anthropology and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Is3mtuIZ9cC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1991|publisher=U. of California Press|page=25|isbn=978-0-520-07018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As population growth resumed, however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine.&lt;ref name="reference" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Hanawalt, "centuries of Transition: England in the Later Middle Ages," in Richard Schlatter, ed., ''Recent Views on British History: Essays on Historical Writing since 1966'' (Rutgers UP, 1984), pp 43–44, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Europe]], by contrast, renewed stringency of laws tied the remaining peasant population more tightly to the land than ever before through [[serfdom]]. Sparsely populated Eastern Europe was less affected by the Black Death and so peasant revolts were less common in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, not occurring in the east until the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries.

Furthermore, the plague's great population reduction brought cheaper land prices, more food for the average peasant, and a relatively large increase in per capita income among the peasantry, if not immediately, in the coming century.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; Since the plague left vast areas of farmland untended, they were made available for pasture and put more meat on the market; the consumption of meat and dairy products went up, as did the export of beef and butter from the Low Countries, Scandinavia and northern Germany. However, the upper class often attempted to stop these changes, initially in Western Europe, and more forcefully and successfully in Eastern Europe, by instituting [[sumptuary law]]s. These regulated what people (particularly of the peasant class) could wear, so that nobles could ensure that peasants did not begin to dress and act as a higher class member with their increased wealth. Another tactic was to fix prices and wages so that peasants could not demand more with increasing value. In England, the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]] was enforced, meaning no peasant could ask for more wages than in 1346.&lt;ref&gt;http://spartacus-educational.com/YALDstatute.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This was met with varying success depending on the amount of rebellion it inspired; such a law was one of the causes of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England in the Middle Ages|England]].

The rapid development of the [[Use (law)|use]] was probably one of the consequences of the Black Death, during which many landowning nobility died, leaving their realty to their widows and minor orphans.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Effect on urban workers===

In the wake of the drastic population decline brought on by the plague, wages shot up and labourers could move to new localities in response to wage offers. Local and royal authorities in Western Europe instituted wage controls.&lt;ref name=penn-356-357&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penn|first1=Simon A. C.|last2=Dyer|first2=Christopher|title=Wages and Earnings in Late Medieval England: Evidence from the Enforcement of the Labour Laws|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=43|issue=3|pages=356–357|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1990.tb00535.x|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; These governmental controls sought to  freeze wages at the old levels before the Black Death.&lt;ref name=penn-356-357/&gt; Within England, for example, the [[Ordinance of Labourers]], enacted in 1349, and the [[Statute of Labourers]], enacted in 1351, restricted both wage increases and the relocation of workers.&lt;ref name=penn-356-357/&gt; If workers attempted to leave their current post, employers were given the right to have them imprisoned. The Statute was poorly enforced in most areas, and farm wages in England on average doubled between 1350 and 1450,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Clark, "The long march of history: Farm wages, population, and economic growth, England 1209–1869," ''Economic History Review''  60.1 (2007): 97–135.

Cohn, comparing numerous countries, argues that these laws were not primarily designed to freeze  wages. Instead, he says the energetic local and royal measures to control labor and artisans' prices was a response to elite fears of the greed and possible new powers of lesser classes that had gained new freedom. Cohn says the laws reflect the anxiety that followed the Black Death's new horrors of mass mortality and destruction, and from elite anxiety about manifestations such as the flagellant movement and the persecution of Jews, Catalans, and beggars.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Cohn, "After the Black Death: Labour Legislation and Attitudes Towards Labour in Late-Medieval Western Europe," ''Economic History Review'' (2007) 60#3 pp. 457–485 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4502106 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour-saving innovation===
By 1200, virtually all of the Mediterranean basin and most of northern Germany had been deforested and cultivated. Indigenous flora and fauna were replaced by domestic grasses and animals and domestic woodlands were lost. With depopulation, this process was reversed. Much of the primeval vegetation returned, and abandoned fields and pastures were reforested.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/&gt;

The Black Death encouraged innovation of labour-saving technologies, leading to higher productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plagued by dear labour|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/economic-history-1|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=5 August 2014|location=London|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a shift from grain farming to animal husbandry. Grain farming was very labor-intensive, but animal husbandry needed only a shepherd and a few dogs and pastureland.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/&gt;

Plague brought an eventual end of Serfdom in Western Europe. The manorial system was already in trouble, but the Black Death assured its demise throughout much of western and central Europe by 1500. Severe depopulation and migration of the village to cities caused an acute shortage of agricultural labourers. Many villages were abandoned. In England, more than 1300 villages were deserted between 1350 and 1500.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottfried|first=Robert S.|title=The black death: natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe|year=1983|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-912630-4 |edition=1. Free Press paperback|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wages of labourers were high, but the rise in nominal wages following the Black Death was swamped by post-Plague inflation, so that real wages fell.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

Labor was in such a short supply that Lords were forced to give better terms of tenure. This resulted in much lower rents in western Europe. By 1500, a new form of tenure called copyhold became prevalent in Europe. In copyhold, both a Lord and peasant made their best business deal, whereby the peasant got use of the land and the Lord got a fixed annual payment and both possessed a copy of the tenure agreement. Serfdom did not end everywhere. It lingered in parts of Western Europe and was introduced to Eastern Europe after the Black Death.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/&gt;

There was change in the inheritance law. Before the plague, only sons and especially the elder son inherited the ancestral property. Post plague all sons as well as daughters started inheriting property.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/&gt;

===Persecutions===
{{See also|Black Death Jewish persecutions}}

Renewed religious fervor and fanaticism came in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted "groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims",&lt;ref name=nirenberg&gt;David Nirenberg, ''Communities of Violence'', 1998, {{ISBN|0-691-05889-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lepers&lt;ref name=nirenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Moore ''The Formation of a Persecuting Society'', Oxford, 1987 {{ISBN|0-631-17145-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Romani people|Romani]], thinking that they were to blame for the crisis.

Differences in cultural and lifestyle practices also led to persecution. As the plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]], in part because better hygiene among Jewish communities and isolation in the ghettos meant that Jews were less affected.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi E. Pasachoff, Robert J. Littman ''A Concise History Of The Jewish People'' 2005 – Page 154 "However, Jews regularly ritually washed and bathed, and their abodes were slightly cleaner than their Christian neighbors'. Consequently, when the rat and the flea brought the Black Death, Jews, with better hygiene, suffered less severely ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P Byrne, ''Encyclopedia of the Black Death'' Volume 1 2012 – Page 15 "Anti–Semitism and Anti–Jewish Violence before the Black Death ... Their attention to personal hygiene and diet, their forms of worship, and cycles of holidays were off-puttingly different."&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations spread that Jews had caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Foa ''The Jews of Europe After the Black Death'' 2000 Page 146 "There were several reasons for this, including, it has been suggested, the observance of laws of hygiene tied to ritual practices and a lower incidence of alcoholism and venereal disease"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy ''Antisemitism'' 2005 Page 763 "Panic emerged again during the scourge of the Black Death in 1348, when widespread terror prompted a revival of the well poisoning charge. In areas where Jews appeared to die of the plague in fewer numbers than Christians, possibly because of better hygiene and greater isolation, lower mortality rates provided evidence of Jewish guilt."&lt;/ref&gt; European mobs attacked Jewish settlements across Europe; by 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed, and more than 350 separate massacres had occurred.

According to Joseph P. Byrne, women also faced persecution during the Black Death. Muslim women in [[Cairo]] became scapegoats when the plague struck.&lt;ref name=byrne&gt;Joseph P. Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2004), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Byrne writes that in 1438, the sultan of Cairo was informed by his religious lawyers that the arrival of the plague was Allah's punishment for the sin of [[fornication]] and that in accordance with this theory, a law was set in place stating that women were not allowed to make public appearances as they may tempt men into sin. Byrne describes that this law was only lifted when "the wealthy complained that their female servants could not shop for food."&lt;ref name=byrne/&gt;

===Religion===

The Black Death hit the [[monastery|monasteries]] very hard because of their proximity with the sick who sought refuge there. This left a severe shortage of clergy after the epidemic cycle. Eventually the losses were replaced by hastily trained and inexperienced clergy members, many of whom knew little of the rigors of their predecessors. New colleges were opened at established universities, and the training process sped up.&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Epstein, ''An Economic and Social History of Later Medieval Europe, 1000–1500'' (2009) p 182&lt;/ref&gt;  The shortage of priests opened new opportunities for laywomen to assume more extensive and more important service roles in the local parish.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine L. French, ''The Good Women of the Parish: Gender and Religion After the Black Death'' (U of Pennsylvania Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flagellants.png|thumb|Woodcut of flagellants ([[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493)]]
[[Flagellants]] practiced self-flogging (whipping of oneself) to atone for sins. The movement became popular after the Black Death. It may be that the flagellants' later involvement in hedonism was an effort to accelerate or absorb God's wrath, to shorten the time with which others suffered. More likely, the focus of attention and popularity of their cause contributed to a sense that the world itself was ending and that their individual actions were of no consequence.

Reformers rarely pointed to failures on the part of the Church in dealing with the catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p 182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural effect==
{{Main|Black Death in medieval culture}}
[[File:Trionfo della morte, già a palazzo sclafani, galleria regionale di Palazzo Abbatellis, palermo (1446) , affresco staccato.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Triumph of Death (Palermo)|The Triumph of Death]]'' (1446)]]

The Black Death had a profound effect on art and literature. After 1350, [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] in general turned very morbid. The general mood was one of pessimism, and contemporary art turned dark with representations of death. The widespread image of the "dance of death" showed death (a skeleton) choosing victims at random. Many of the most graphic depictions come from  writers such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peire Lunel de Montech]], writing about 1348 in the [[lyric poetry|lyric style]] long out of fashion, composed the following sorrowful ''[[sirventes]]'' "Meravilhar no·s devo pas las gens" during the height of the plague in [[Toulouse]]:

{{quote|They died by the hundreds, both day and night, and all were thrown in ... ditches and covered with earth. And as soon as those ditches were filled, more were dug. And I, [[Agnolo di Tura]] ... buried my five children with my own hands ... And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~afutrell/w%20civ%2002/plaguereadings.html |title=Plague readings |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Boccaccio wrote:

{{quote|How many valiant men, how many fair ladies, breakfast with their kinfolk and the same night supped with their ancestors in the next world! The condition of the people was pitiable to behold. They sickened by the thousands daily, and died unattended and without help. Many died in the open street, others dying in their houses, made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies. Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies, which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches, like goods in a ship's hold and covered with a little earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spignesi |first1=Stephen |title=Catastrophe!: The 100 Greatest Disasters Of All Time |date=2002 |publisher=Kensington Publishing Corp |location=New York |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Medicine===

Although the Black Death highlighted the shortcomings of medical science in the medieval era, it also led to positive changes in the field of medicine. As described by David Herlihy in ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West,'' more emphasis was placed on “anatomical investigations” following the Black Death.&lt;ref name=herlihy&gt;David Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; How individuals studied the human body notably changed, becoming a process that dealt more directly with the human body in varied states of sickness and health. Further, at this time, the importance of surgeons became more evident.&lt;ref name=herlihy/&gt;

A theory put forth by Stephen O'Brien says the Black Death is likely responsible, through [[natural selection]], for the high frequency of the [[CCR5|CCR5-Δ32]] genetic defect in people of European descent. The gene affects [[T cell]] function and provides protection against [[HIV]], [[smallpox]], and possibly plague,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Jefferys | first1= Richard | author2= Anne-christine d'Adesky | title = Designer Genes | journal = [[LPI Media#HIV Plus|HIV Plus]] | date=March 1999 | url = http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html | accessdate = 2006-12-12 |issn=1522-3086 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214110211/http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html |archivedate=14 February 2008 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; though for the last, no explanation as to how it would do that exists. This, however, is now challenged, given that the CCR5-Δ32 gene has been found to be just as common in [[Bronze Age]] tissue samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='Ground truth' for selection on CCR5-Δ32 |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Genetics]] |date=June 2006 |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=293–6 |author1=Philip W. Hedrick |author2=Brian C. Verrelli |pmid=16678299 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===

The Black Death also inspired European architecture to move in two different directions: (1) a revival of Greco-Roman styles, and (2) a further elaboration of the [[Gothic style]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Hollister, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Late medieval churches had impressive structures centred on verticality, where one's eye is drawn up towards the high ceiling. The basic Gothic style was revamped with elaborate decoration in the late medieval period. Sculptors in Italian city-states emulated the work of their Roman forefathers while sculptors in northern Europe, no doubt inspired by the devastation they had witnessed, gave way to a heightened expression of emotion and an emphasis on individual differences.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Hollister, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; A tough realism came forth in architecture as in literature. Images of intense sorrow, decaying corpses, and individuals with faults as well as virtues emerged. North of the Alps, painting reached a pinnacle of precise realism with [[Early Dutch painting]] by artists such as [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390– by 1441). The natural world was reproduced in these works with meticulous detail whose realism was not unlike photography.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Hollister, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Duck-baiting.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Duck-baiting by [[Henry Alken]] circa 1820]]
'''Duck-baiting''' is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[Bait (dogs)|baiting]] of [[duck]]s.

==Overview==
Duck-baiting involved releasing a [[Pinioning|pinioned]] duck on to a [[duck pond|pond]].  The dog dived into the pond [[coursing]] the duck, which was unable to fly.  A spectacular [[Underwater diving|diving]] exhibition ensued, as the duck dived the dog dived to pursue.  Inevitably, the dog could not match the duck's speed underwater and would surface in rage.  Spectators would [[gamble]] and joined in the noise to encourage their animal of choice.  Those who backed the dog might throw stones at the duck in an attempt to disable it, which caused fights among the spectators. The dogs would take turns catching the duck.  Prizes would be awarded to the dogs that caught the duck in the least amount of time.&lt;ref name="Homan"&gt;Homan, M. (2000). ''A Complete History of Fighting Dogs'' pp 109–110 Howell Book House Inc. {{ISBN|1-58245-128-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strutt's ''Sports and Pastimes'' says of duck-baiting:

:"another barbarous pastime and for the performance it is necessary to have recourse to a pond of water sufficiently extensive to give the duck plenty of room for making her escape from the dogs, when she is closely pursued; which she does by diving as often as any of them come near to her."&lt;ref&gt;Strutt, Joseph (1810) ''Glig-Gamena Angel-Deod, Or Sports and Pastimes of the People of England'' (2nd edition) White and Company, London, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nSKFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA251 pages 251–252], {{OCLC|2552476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a favourite [[spectator sport]] for [[Charles II of England]].&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Tony and Vamplew, Wray (2002) ''Mud, Sweat and Beers: A cultural history of sport and alcohol'' Berg, Oxford, England, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IdZJaM5oUgcC&amp;pg=PA8 page 8], {{ISBN|1-85973-553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the weekends, families, friends and their fighting dogs would frequent these locations.

==Decline==
The rowdy assemblies associated with the activity caused public alarm.&lt;ref&gt;"Have you seen in the neighbourhood of the church or churchyard duck-hunting or dogfighting?"-"There is scarcely a Sunday there is not.  I have gone out with the greatest anxiety when my wife and family were going to church to protect them." James May, vestry clerk of St Matthew's Bethnal-Green, 1817: quoted in ''The Times'', 25 August 1834, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Duck-baiting declined in the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt; and eventually ceased altogether due to rioting and damage incurred to the inns.{{Citation needed|reason=inartfully worded or overbroad|date=December 2010}}

'''Estonian Restoration of Independence''' (juridically defined as the Restoration of the [[Republic of Estonia]]) is celebrated on the 20th of August as on that day, in 1991 at 11:02 pm &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estonica.org/et/Augustiput%C5%A1_ja_Eesti_iseseisvumine_1991/ Estonica]&lt;/ref&gt; local time, the Estonian Supreme Soviet, in agreement with the Estonian Committee (the executive organ of the Estonian Congress) proclaimed Estonian independence from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13071519&lt;/ref&gt; August 20 is a [[Public holidays in Estonia|public holiday]] in Estonia.

==The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt==

[[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|The August Coup]] or August Putsch lasted between 19–22 August 1991 and was an attempt by members of the Soviet Union’s government to take control of the country from the Soviet President and General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Mikhail Gorbachev.]]

==August 19th, 1991==

As the coup attempt was taking place in Moscow and with that the military and political attention of the Soviet Union otherwise occupied, various republics of the Soviet Union took the opportunity to declare their independence. On the evening of the 19th of August, delegates from the Estonian Supreme Soviet and the Estonian Committee started negotiations to declare the independence of the Republic of Estonia. The main debate was a crucial one: should Estonia declare independence as a new Republic or continue with the juridical continuation of the Republic of Estonia established in [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|1918]] and occupied in 1940.

==August 20th, 1991==

At 11:02 pm on the evening of August 20, 1991, during a live broadcast carried out by Estonian Television, the Estonian Supreme Soviet voted on the declaration of its Restoration of Independence. Out of the 105 delegates of the Estonian Supreme Soviet 70 were present, 69 voted in favour of the restoration. Two delegates,  [[Klavdia Sergij]] and [[Kaido Kama]], did not register to vote and walked out before voting began. Those who voted in favour of the restoration were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pealinn.ee/index.php?pid=132&amp;lang=5&amp;nid=7754 19. august 1991: kelamlaste-enamlaste uus liit iseseisvumise vastu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==August 21st, 1991==

On the morning of August 21, 1991, Soviet paratroopers were taking charge of the Tallinn’s TV tower, while the television broadcast was cut off for a while, the radio signal was strong as a handful of Estonian Defence League (the unified paramilitary armed forces of Estonia) members barricaded the entry into signal rooms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.estonica.org/en/The_August_coup_and_Estonian_independence_1991/&lt;/ref&gt;
By the afternoon of the same day it was clear that the coup in Moscow had failed and the paratroopers released the tower and left Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.estonica.org/en/The_August_coup_and_Estonian_independence_1991/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Falles''' ({{lang-ca-valencia|Falles}}, [[grammatical number|sing.]] ''Falla''; {{lang-es|Fallas}}) is a traditional celebration held in commemoration of [[Saint Joseph]] in the city of [[Valencia]], Spain. The term ''Falles'' refers to both the celebration and the [[Falla monument|monuments]] burnt during the celebration.&lt;ref name=Martin1973&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Charles B.|title=The Fallas: A Folk Festival of Valencia|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=March 1973|volume=6|issue=4|page=854|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1973.00854.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0022-3840.1973.00854.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of towns in the [[Valencian Community]] have similar celebrations inspired by the original Falles de València celebration. The Falles festival was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[intangible cultural heritage]] of humanity list on 30 November 2016.&lt;ref name="EPA2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Valencia Fallas festivity included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list |url=http://www.epa.eu/arts-culture-and-entertainment-photos/customs-traditions-photos/valencia-fallas-festivity-included-in-unesco-s-intangible-cultural-heritage-list-photos-53141867 |accessdate=1 December 2016 |work=EPA European Pressphoto Agency b.v. |agency=European Pressphoto Agency |date=November 30, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201033534/http://www.epa.eu/arts-culture-and-entertainment-photos/customs-traditions-photos/valencia-fallas-festivity-included-in-unesco-s-intangible-cultural-heritage-list-photos-53141867 |archivedate=December 1, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each neighbourhood of the city has an organised group of people, the ''Casal faller'', that works all year long holding fundraising parties and dinners, usually featuring the noted dish, [[paella]],&lt;ref name="AndrewsLeopold2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hazel Andrews|author2=Teresa Leopold|title=Events and the Social Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMBhsx_NadYC&amp;pg=PA11|date=8 February 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-60560-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; a specialty of the region. Each ''casal faller'' produces a construction known as a ''falla'' which is eventually burnt.  A ''casal faller'' is also known as a ''comissió fallera'' and currently there are approximately 400 registered in Valencia.&lt;ref name="Martí1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gil-Manuel Hernàndez i Martí|title=Falles i franquisme a València|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzTgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22comissi%C3%B3%20fallera%22|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Afers|isbn=978-84-86574-36-9|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fallas.com/index.php/es/main-jcf-es/main-comisiones-es/827-numero-de-falla|title=Fallas - Comisiones por número de censo|date=16 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name of the festival is the plural of the [[Valencian language|Valencian]] word ''falla''.  The word's derivation is as follows:
:[[Latin]] {{smallcaps|fax}} "torch" → [[Latin]] {{smallcaps|facvla}} (diminutive) → [[Vulgar Latin]] *{{smallcaps|facla}} → [[Valencian language|Valencian]] ''falla''.

==''Falles'' and ''ninots''==
[[File:Maeztu Lleons 2015 12.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Ninots'' representing [[Barack Obama]] and [[Vladimir Putin]] (parodying ''[[The Nutcracker]]'') in 2015]]
Formerly, much time would be spent by the ''casal faller'' preparing the ''ninots'' ([[Valencian]]  for puppets or dolls).&lt;ref name="ArweckKeenan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xavier Costa|editor1=Elisabeth Arweck|editor2=William J. F. Keenan|title=Materializing Religion: Expression, Performance and Ritual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXt2s8XhoBcC&amp;pg=PA65|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5094-2|pages=64–65|chapter=Festivity and the Sacred: The Symbolic Universe in the Festival of the 'Fallas' of Saint Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the four days leading up to 19 March, each group takes its ''ninot'' out for a grand parade, and then mounts it, each on its own elaborate [[firecracker]]-filled [[Paperboard|cardboard]] and [[paper-mâché]] artistic monument in a street of the given neighbourhood.  This whole assembly is a ''[[Falla monument|falla]]''.

The ''ninots'' and their ''falles'' are constructed according to an agreed-upon theme that has traditionally been a satirical jab at whatever draws the attention of the ''fallers'' (the registered participants of the ''casals'').&lt;ref name="ArweckKeenan2006" /&gt; In modern times, the two-week-long festival has spawned a substantial local industry, to the point that an entire suburban area has been designated the ''Ciutat fallera'' (Falles City). Here, crews of artists and artisans, sculptors, painters, and other craftsmen, all spend months producing elaborate constructions of paper and wax, wood and [[polystyrene|polystyrene foam]] tableaux towering up to five stories, composed of fanciful figures, often caricatures, in provocative poses arranged in a gravity-defying manner.&lt;ref name="El País2014"&gt;{{cite news|title=El atractivo turístico de la Ciutat Fallera|url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/03/05/valencia/1362506634_651316.html|work=El País|issue=València|publisher=Ediciones El País, S.L.|date=5 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031180703/http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/03/05/valencia/1362506634_651316.html|archivedate=October 31, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of them is produced under the direction of one of the many individual neighbourhood ''casals fallers'' who vie with each other to attract the best artists, and then to create the most outrageous allegorical monument to their target. There are about 750 of these neighbourhood associations in Valencia,&lt;ref name="ArweckKeenan2006" /&gt; with over 200,000 members, or a quarter of the city's population.&lt;ref name="Richards2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Richards|editor=Greg Richards|title=Cultural Tourism: Global and Local Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZfhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA271|date=7 March 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-79234-2|page=271|chapter=The Festivalization of Society or the Socialization of Festivals?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Falles, many people wear their ''casal faller'' dress of regional and historical costumes from different eras of València's history. The ''[[dulzaina|dolçaina]]'' (an oboe-like reed instrument) and ''[[drum|tabalet]]'' (a kind of Valencian drum) are frequently heard,&lt;ref name="Villarroya1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Ariño Villarroya|title=La ciudad ritual: la fiesta de las Fallas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUzLVON2UdMC&amp;pg=PA13|date=1 January 1992|publisher=Anthropos Editorial|isbn=978-84-7658-368-5|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; as most of the different casals fallers have their own traditional bands.

Although the ''Falles'' is a very traditional event and many participants dress in medieval clothing, the ''ninots'' for 2005 included such modern characters as [[Shrek]] and [[George W. Bush]], and the 2012 ''Falles'' included characters like [[Barack Obama]] and [[Lady Gaga]].

==Events during ''Falles''==
[[Image:Fallers marching band.jpg|thumb|''La despertà'': a band of wind instruments marches through a small street in the early morning.]]
[[Image:Falleres despertà.jpg|thumb|Falleres in their costumes march with the band.]]
The five days and nights of ''Falles'' might be described as a continuous street party. There are a multitude of processions: historical, religious, and comedic. Crowds in the restaurants spill out into the streets. Explosions can be heard all day long and sporadically through the night. Everyone from small children to elderly people can be seen throwing fireworks and noisemakers in the streets, which are littered with pyrotechnical debris. The timing of the events is fixed, and they fall on the same date every year, though there has been discussion about holding some events on the weekend preceding the Falles, to take greater advantage of the tourist potential of the festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/20120320/sociedad/rc-fiesta-unas-fallas-perfectas-201203200131.html Fin de fiesta de unas Fallas perfectas], ABC.es, 20 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; or changing the end date in years where it is due to occur in midweek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levante-emv.com/fallas/2012/03/20/hosteleros-quieren-fallas/891058.html Los hosteleros quieren ´más´ Fallas], ''Levante'', 20 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Despertà===
Each day of Falles begins at 8:00 am with ''La Despertà'' ("the wake-up call").&lt;ref name="García2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Encarnación Galindo García|title=Las fallas de Valencia: Mucho más que un sueño|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqyTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date=30 July 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-84-9848-049-8|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brass bands appear from the casals and begin to march down every street playing lively music. Close behind them are the ''fallers'', throwing large firecrackers in the street as they go.[[File:Falleras.jpg|thumb|Falleras during the "replegà"]]
[[Image:mascleta 2004a.jpg|thumb|The crowd gathers.]]
[[Image:Mascleta 2004b.JPG|thumb|Mascletà in [[Valencia]]]]

===La Mascletà===
{{main|Mascletà}}
The ''Mascletà'', an explosive barrage of coordinated firecracker and [[fireworks]] displays, takes place at 2:00 pm every day of the festival;&lt;ref name="García2014" /&gt; the main event is the municipal Mascletà in the ''Plaça de l'Ajuntament'' where the pyrotechnicians compete for the honour of providing the final Mascletà of the ''festes'' (on 19 March). At 2:00 pm the clock chimes and the Fallera Major, dressed in her ''fallera'' finery,  will call from the balcony of [[City Hall]], ''Senyor/a pirotècnic/a, pot començar la mascletà!'' ("Mr./Ms. Pyrotechnic, you may commence the Mascletà!"), and the Mascletà begins.

The Mascletà is almost unique to the [[Valencian Community]], and very popular with the Valencian people. Smaller neighbourhoods often hold their own mascletà for saint's days, weddings and other celebrations.

A nighttime variant runs in the evening hours by the same pyrotechnicans that were present in the afternoon.

===La Plantà===
{{main|Plantà}}
On the day of the 15th, all of the ''falles'' infantils are to be finished being constructed, and later that night all of the ''falles majors'' (big Falles) are to be completed.&lt;ref name="García2014" /&gt; If not, they face disqualification.

===L'Ofrena de flors===
[[File:xaraguell.jpg|thumb|200px|''Saragüells'', a traditional Valencian costume for the men]]
In this event, the flower offering, each of the casals fallers takes an offering of flowers to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] as ''Our Lady of the Forsaken.''&lt;ref name="García2014" /&gt; This occurs all day during 17–18 March. A statue of the Virgin Mary and its large pedestal are then covered with all the flowers.

===Els Castells and La Nit del Foc===
On the nights of the 15, 16, 17, and 18th there are firework displays in the old riverbed in València. Each night is progressively grander and the last is called ''La Nit del Foc'' (the Night of Fire).&lt;ref name="García2014" /&gt;
[[File:Bomber faller.jpg|thumb|La cremà, 2002]]

===Cavalcada del Foc===
On the final evening of Falles, at 7:00 pm on March 19, a parade known in Valencian as the ''Cavalcada del Foc'' (the Fire Parade) takes place along Colon street and Porta de la Mar square. This spectacular celebration of fire, the symbol of the fiesta’s spirit, is the ''grand finale'' of Falles and a colourful, noisy event featuring exhibitions of the varied rites and displays from around the world which use fire; it incorporates floats, giant mechanisms, people in costumes, rockets, gunpowder, street performances and music.

===La Cremà===
{{main|Cremà}}
On the final night of Falles, around midnight on March 19,&lt;ref name="CarvajalHorwood2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carol Styles Carvajal|author2=Jane Horwood|author3=Nicholas Rollin|title=Concise Oxford Spanish Dictionary: Spanish-English/English-Spanish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ukvQmgbs_yYC&amp;pg=PA293|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860977-3|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; these ''falles'' are burnt as huge bonfires. This is known as ''La Cremà'' (the Burning), the climax of the whole event,&lt;ref name="Ariño1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Ariño|title=El Teatre en la festa valenciana|url=https://books.google.com/books?iahttps://books.google.com/books?id=uo5dAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22La%20Crem%C3%A0%22%20%22falles%22d=uo5dAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Generalitat Valenciana|isbn=978-84-482-2333-5|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reason why the constructions are called ''falles'' ("torches").  Traditionally, the falla in the ''Plaça de l'Ajuntament'' is burned last.

All ''casals'' have a ''falla infantil'' (a children's ''falla'', smaller and without satirical themes), which is held a few metres away from the main one. This is burnt first, at 10:00 pm. The main neighbourhood ''falles'' are burnt closer to midnight; the burning of the ''falles'' in the city centre often starts later. For example, in 2005, the fire brigade delayed the burning of the Egyptian funeral ''falla'' in ''Carrer del Convent de Jerusalem'' until 1:30 am, when they were sure all safety concerns were addressed.

Each ''falla'' is laden with fireworks which are lit first. The construction itself is lit either after or during the explosion of these fireworks. ''Falles'' burn quite quickly, and the heat given off is felt by all around. The heat from the larger ones often drives the crowd back a couple of metres, even though they are already behind barriers that the fire brigade has set several metres from the construction. In narrower streets, the heat scorches the surrounding buildings, and the firemen douse the fronteres, window blinds, street signs, etc. with their hoses to stop them catching fire or melting, from the beginning of the ''cremà'' until it cools down.

Away from the ''falles'', people frolic in the streets, the whole city resembling an open-air dance party, except that instead of music there is the incessant (and occasionally deafening) sound of people throwing fireworks around randomly. There are many stalls selling trinkets and snacks such as the typical fried ''porres'', ''churros'' and ''bunyols'', as well as roasted chestnuts.

While the smaller fallas dotted around the streets are burned at approximately the same time, the last falla to be burned is the main one, which is saved until last so that everybody can watch it. This main falla is found outside the ''Ajuntament'' – the town hall. People arrive a few hours before the scheduled burning time to get a front row view.

==History==
There are different conjectures regarding the origin of the Falles festival. One suggests that the Falles started in the [[Middle Ages]], when artisans disposed of the broken artefacts and pieces of wood they saved during the winter by burning them to celebrate the [[spring equinox]]. Valencian carpenters used planks of wood called ''parots'' to hang their candles on during the winter, as these were needed to provide light to work by. With the coming of the spring, they were no longer necessary, so they were burned.&lt;ref name="RodgersRodgers2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eamonn Rodgers|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Spanish Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KKFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174|date=11 March 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-78858-3|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, and with the intervention of the Church, the date of the burning of these ''parots'' was made to coincide with the celebration of the festival of [[Saint Joseph]], the patron saint of carpenters.&lt;ref name="AltmanLow2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irwin Altman|author2=Setha M. Low|title=Place Attachment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-nvBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA217|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4684-8753-4|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition continued to evolve. The ''parot'' was dressed with clothing so that it looked like a person; features identifiable with some well-known person from the neighbourhood were often added as well. To collect these materials, children went from house to house asking for ''una estoreta velleta'' (an old rug) to add to the ''parot''. This became a popular song that the children sang as they gathered all sorts of old flammable furniture and utensils to burn in the bonfire with the ''parot''. These ''parots'' were the first ''ninots''. Over the years, people of the neighbourhoods began to organise the building of the ''falles'', and thus the typically intricate constructions, including their various figures, were born.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, the ''falles'' were tall boxes with three or four wax dolls dressed in fabric clothing. This changed when the creators began to use cardboard. The fabrication of the ''falles'' continues to evolve in modern times, when the largest displays are made of [[polystyrene]] and soft cork easily molded with hot saws. These techniques have allowed the creation of ''falles'' over 30 metres high.

The origin of the pagan festival is similar to that of the [[Bonfires of Saint John]] celebrated in the [[Alicante|Alacant]] region, in the sense that both came from the Latin custom of lighting fires to welcome spring. In València, this ancient tradition led to the burning of accumulated waste, particularly wood, at the end of winter on the feast day of Saint Joseph. Given the reputed humorous character of Valencians, it was natural that the people began to burn figurines depicting persons and events of the past year. The burning symbolised liberation from living in servitude to the memory of these events or else represented humorous and often critical commentary on them. The festival thus evolved a more satirical and ironic character, and the wooden castoffs gradually came to be assembled into progressively more elaborate 'monuments' that were designed and painted in advance.

In the early 20th century, and especially during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the monuments became more anti-clerical in nature and were often highly critical of the local or national governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Valencia de los años 30: entre el paraíso y el infierno|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XOtDJje3qiwC&amp;pg=PA207|year=1999|publisher=Carena Editors, S.l.|isbn=978-84-87398-35-3|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tried to ban the Falles many times, without success. Under the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] the celebration lost much of its satirical nature because of government censorship, but the monuments were among the few fervent public expressions allowed then, and they could be made freely in València. During this period, many religious customs such as the offering of flowers to ''Mare de Déu dels Desamparats'' (Our Lady of the Forsaken) were taken up, which today are essential parts of the festival, even though they were unrelated to the original purpose of the celebration.

With the restoration of [[democracy]] and the end of government censorship, the critical ''falles'' reappeared, and obscene satirical ones with them. Despite thirty years of freedom of expression, the world view of the ''fallero'' can still be socially conservative, is often sexist and may involve some of the amoralism of Valencian politics. This has sometimes led to criticism by certain cultural critics, environmentalists, and progressives. Yet there are celebrants of all ideologies and factions, and they have different interpretations of the spirit of the celebration. Although recent initiatives such as the [[Pilota valenciana|pilota]] championships, literary competitions and other events have broadened its cultural expression, the city still embraces such ancient traditions to express its own singular identity.&lt;ref&gt;"Villarroya 1992, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secció Especial ==
The Secció Especial is a group of the largest and most prestigious ''falles'' commissions in the city of Valencia.  In 2007, the group consisted of 14 commissions.  This class of ''falles'' was first started in 1942 and originally included the ''falles'' of Barques, Reina-Pau and Plaça del Mercat.  Currently, none of these are still in the group.  The commission that has most often participated in this group as of 2015 was Na Jordana, with 62 times. The Secció Especial awards the prizes with the exception of the one awarded by the town hall; winning the first prize in the Secció Especial is the most prestigious prize any falla can win. All other ''falles'' fall into different classes (18 as of 2017) determined by the amount of money invested in each ''falla''.&lt;gallery mode="packed-hover" caption="Recent winners of Secció Especial"&gt;

'''Farewell Yellow Brick Road''' is an ongoing [[tour]] by British musician [[Elton John]]. It began in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] on 8 September 2018. The tour will consist of more than 300 concerts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Farewell Yellow Brick Road' tour announcement|url=https://www.eltonjohn.com/stories/farewell-yellow-brick-road|website=EltonJohn.com|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2018, it was announced that John would be retiring from touring and would soon embark on a three-year tour. The first concert was announced to take place at the PPL Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania on 8 September 2018 followed by an extensive tour of the United States and Canada before moving on to Europe. John cited spending time with his children as the reason for his retirement.

'''''Fatal Attraction''''' is a 1987 American [[psychological]]  [[erotic thriller|erotic thriller film]] directed by [[Adrian Lyne]] from a screenplay written by [[James Dearden]], based on his 1980 short film ''[[Diversion (1980 film)|Diversion]]''. Starring [[Michael Douglas]], [[Glenn Close]] and [[Anne Archer]], the film centers on a married man who has a weekend affair with a woman who refuses to allow it to end and becomes obsessed with him.

''Fatal Attraction'' was released on September 18, 1987 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received generally positive critical response and generated controversy at the time of its release. The film became a huge box office success, grossing $320.1 million against a $14 million budget, becoming the [[1987 in film|highest grossing film of 1987 worldwide]].

At the [[60th Academy Awards]], it received six nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Close), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Archer), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].

==Plot==
Dan Gallagher is a successful, happily married [[Manhattan]] lawyer whose work leads him to meet Alexandra "Alex" Forrest, an editor for a [[Publishing|publishing company]]. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Though it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex starts clinging to him.

Dan spends a second unplanned evening with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan tries to leave, she cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He helps her bandage the cuts and then leaves. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She waits at his office one day to apologize and invites him to a performance of ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'', but he politely turns her down. She then continues to call him until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. Alex then phones his home at all hours, claiming that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.

Dan moves his family to [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid on his car, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard; the sight of their content family literally makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a [[restraining order]] against Alex (claiming that it is "for a client"). The lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without [[probable cause]], and that the "client" has to own up to his [[adultery]].

At one point, while the Gallaghers are not home, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit, and puts it on their stove to boil. After this, Dan tells Beth of the affair and Alex's supposed pregnancy. Enraged, she demands that Dan leave. Before he goes, Dan calls Alex to tell her that Beth knows about the affair. Beth gets on the phone and warns Alex that she will kill her if she persists. Without Dan and Beth's knowledge, Alex picks up Ellen from school and takes her to an amusement park. Beth panics when she realizes that she does not know where Ellen is. She drives around frantically searching and rear-ends a car stopped at an intersection. Beth gets injured and is then hospitalized. Alex later takes Ellen home, asking her for a kiss on the cheek. Following Beth's release from the hospital, she forgives Dan and they return home.

Dan barges into Alex's apartment and attacks her, choking her and coming close to strangling her. He stops himself, but as he does, she lunges at him with a kitchen knife. He overpowers her but decides to put the knife down and leave, while Alex is leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. The police begin to search for her after Dan confronts them about having her arrested.

Beth prepares a bath for herself when Alex suddenly appears, again with the kitchen knife. She starts to explain her resentment of Beth, nervously fidgeting (which causes Alex to cut her own leg) and then attacks Beth. Dan hears the screaming, rushes in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub, and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife. Beth, who went searching for Dan's gun, shoots Alex in the chest, killing her. The final scene shows police cars outside the Gallaghers' house. As Dan finishes delivering his statement to the police, he walks inside, where Beth is waiting for him. They embrace and proceed to the living room as the camera focuses on a picture of them and Ellen.

==Production==
===Writing===
The film was adapted by [[James Dearden]] (with some help from [[Nicholas Meyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url =https://books.google.com/?id=WW3on1yWkPoC&amp;pg=PT139&amp;q=nicholas%20meyer%20the%20making%20of%20fatal%20attraction|title=The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood|isbn=9781101133477|last1=Meyer|first1=Nicholas|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from ''[[Diversion (1980 film)|Diversion]]'', an earlier 1980 short film by Dearden for British television. In Meyer's book "The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood", he explains that in late 1986 producer [[Stanley R. Jaffe]] asked him to look at the script developed by Dearden, and he wrote a four-page memo making suggestions for the script including a new ending for the movie. A few weeks later he met with director [[Adrian Lyne]] and gave him some additional suggestions. Ultimately Meyer was asked to redraft the script on the basis of his suggestions, which ended up being the shooting script.

===Casting===
Producers Sherry Lansing and Stanley Jaffe both had serious doubts about casting Glenn Close because they didn't think she could be sexual enough for the role of Alex.&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt; Close was persistent, so that after meeting with Jaffe several times in New York, she was asked to fly out to Los Angeles to read with Michael Douglas in front of Adrian Lyne and Lansing. Before the audition, she let her naturally frizzy hair "go wild" because she was impatient at putting it up, and she wore a slimming black dress she thought made her look "fabulous" to audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/07/reunion-fatal-attraction/| title=From the archives: Fatal Attraction’s Glenn Close, Michael Douglas reunite| author=Jess Cagle| publisher=Entertainment Weekly| date=2011-10-07| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impressed Lansing, because Close "came in looking completely different...right away she was into the part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ivSI9tY2OI&amp;t=815s| title=Fatal Attraction (1987) The Making Of Part 1 &amp; 2| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2017-09-05| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close and Douglas performed a scene from early in the script, where Alex flirts with Dan in a café, and Close came away "convinced my career was over, that I was finished, I had completely blown my chances."&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt; Lansing and Lyne, however, were both convinced that she was right for the role; Lyne stated that "an extraordinary erotic transformation took place. She was this tragic, bewildering mix of sexuality and rage—I watched Alex come to life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-dark-side-of-love-vol-28-no-17/| title=The Dark Side of Love| author=James S. Kunen| publisher=People Magazine| date=1987-10-26| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for her role, Glenn Close consulted several psychologists, hoping to understand Alex's psyche and motivations. She was uncomfortable with the bunny boiling scene, which she thought was too extreme, but she was assured on consulting the psychologists that such an action was entirely possible and that Alex's behavior corresponded to someone who had experienced incestual sexual abuse as a child.&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt;

===Alternate ending===
Alex Forrest was originally scripted slashing her throat at the film's end with the knife Dan had left on the counter, so as to make it appear that Dan had murdered her. After seeing her husband being taken away by police, Beth finds a revealing cassette tape that Alex sent Dan in which she threatens to kill herself. Upon realizing Alex's intentions, Beth takes the tape to the police, which acquits Dan of the murder. The last scene shows, in flashback, Alex taking her own life by slashing her throat while listening to ''Madame Butterfly''.

After doing test screenings, Joseph Farrell (who handled the test screenings) suggested Paramount to reshoot a new ending.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/business/joseph-farrell-dies-at-76-used-market-research-to-shape-films.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/07/magazine/tm-30884&lt;/ref&gt; Alex was killed by a gunshot during the three-week reshoot of the action scene. Alex's murder by Beth juxtaposes the relationship between the two characters; with Alex being victimized and Beth violently protecting her family.&lt;ref name = autogenerated1 /&gt;

In the 2002 Special Edition [[DVD]], Close comments that she had doubts about re-shooting the film's ending because she believed the character would "self-destruct and commit suicide".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Close eventually gave in on her concerns, and filmed the new sequence after having fought against the change for two weeks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Close has described how protective she was of her character, whom she "never thought of as a villain",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IY8lxuo_yA&amp;t=1s| title=Fatal Attraction Reunion Interview| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2010-03-06| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that: "I wasn't playing a generality, I wasn't playing a cliché. I was playing a very specific, deeply disturbed, fragile human being, whom I had grown to love."&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt; However, though the ending made Alex into a "psychopath" against Close's wishes, she has also acknowledged that the film would not have experienced the enormous success it did without the new ending, because it gave the audience "...a sense of catharsis, a hope, that somehow the family unit would survive the nightmare." &lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt;

The film was initially released in Japan with the original ending. The original ending also appeared on a special edition [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] release by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1992, and was included on the film's DVD release a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition) (1987)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Attraction-Special-Collectors-Michael-Douglas/dp/B00003CXA0/|website=[[Amazon (website)|Amazon]] (United States)|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles===
In the earlier phase of the film, when it was under the title ''Diversion'', Alex committed suicide in the end. After showing this version to a test audience, they felt this was not a good enough way for Alex to go. Instead, the producers decided to shoot the last scene as a more vengeful and violent death for Alex.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bromley |first=Susan |last2=Hewitt |first2=Pamela |title=Fatal Attraction: The Sinister side of Women's Conflict about Career and Family |journal=The Journal of Popular Culture |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=17–23 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1992.2603_17.x |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Close has spoken of the decision to change the ending as "a terrible betrayal of the character that I created...I desperately wanted to remind the audience that this character was more self-destructive than destructive."

After spending $1.3 million, Alex's death and Beth's survival was determined to be the official ending of the film. However, this presented a more traditionalist message to the audience. This new ending gave the idea that a professional woman and a wife/mother are two very divided choices. With Alex being shot by Beth, in the official ending of the film, this is viewed as death to the bad woman (a career woman), and a win for the good woman (a wife/mother).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Close insisted on adding the shot in the confrontation scene where Alex mutilates her own leg with a kitchen knife to show that she was "as self-destructive as she was aggressive".&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt; However, according to Close, "the image of Alex wielding that knife was too horrifying for any subtle nuance, and it transformed her into a psychopath as a result. And she became the most hated woman in America."&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDWDhntzc-w| title=Glenn Close Full Address &amp; Q&amp;A Oxford Union| author=Oxford Union| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2018-05-04| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Anchor|Reaction|Reception}} 
After its release, ''Fatal Attraction'' engendered much discussion of the potential consequences of infidelity. Some [[Feminism|feminists]], meanwhile, did not appreciate what they felt was the depiction of a strong career woman who is at the same time [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]].&lt;ref name = autogenerated1&gt;Remembering Fatal Attraction 2002 DVD Special Features&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist [[Susan Faludi]] discussed the film in ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', arguing that major changes had been made to the original plot in order to make Alex wholly negative, while Dan's carelessness and the lack of compassion and responsibility raised no discussion, except for a small number of fundamentalist men's groups who said that Dan was eventually forced to own up to his irresponsibility in that "everyone pays the piper".&lt;ref&gt;See "Fatal and Foetal Visions: The Backlash in the Movies", Chapter 5 of ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', published by Chatto &amp; Windus, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist scholars have also stated that in many ways the film has used its correlation of career woman to psychopathy in order to create its horror element. As described by Deborah Jermyn, the use of the "monstrous-feminine" as a tool in the 1980s horror genre was a way to portray a man's worst fears', where a woman has rejected familial values and reverted to hysteria, questioning the true values of woman and what it means to be feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/screen/37.3.251 |title=Rereading the bitches from hell: A feminist appropriation of the female psychopath |journal=Screen |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=251–67 |year=1996 |last1=Jermyn |first1=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many ways that Alex (Close) portrays womanhood in a more traditional light, with the character befriending her lover's wife and drinking tea in their home, while contrastingly, his wife slowly turns more assertive and violent. The fluidity of these female characters' monstrous and fearful tendencies is what makes the "fear" more real, according to feminist study. The fact that a woman who rejects traditional womanhood for a more career-based lifestyle can swap in just a matter of moments to the "housewife", and vice-versa provides the horror that this movie begs. Women feared both becoming this career-driven "monster" and being the oblivious housewife, while men feared that their companion could in fact be both of these things at once.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The film has left an indelible impression on male viewers. Close was quoted in 2008 as saying, "Men still come up to me and say, 'You scared the shit out of me.' Sometimes they say, 'You saved my marriage.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Close says boiling that bunny saved marriages | url = http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article79973.ece | work = [[The Times]] | date = 2008-01-06 | accessdate = 2010-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film spent eight weeks at #1 in the U.S. and eventually grossed $156.6 million domestically, making the film the second-highest-grossing film of 1987 in the U.S. behind ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''. It also grossed $163.5 million overseas for a total gross of $320.1 million, making it the biggest film of 1987 worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1987&amp;p=.htm | title = ''Fatal Attraction'' | publisher = ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' | accessdate = 2007-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn led to several similarly-themed psychological thrillers being made throughout the late 1980s and 1990s.

Overall, the film received positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 78% based on reviews from 46 critics, with the site's consensus "A potboiler in the finest sense, ''Fatal Attraction'' is a sultry, juicy thriller that's hard to look away from once it gets going."&lt;ref name=Tomatoes&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatal Attraction (1987)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1007141-fatal_attraction/|website=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On [[Metacritic]], the film has a rating of 67/100 based on reviews from 16 critics.&lt;ref name=Metacritic&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatal Attraction Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fatal-attraction|website=Metacritic|date=18 September 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic analysis===
The character of Alex Forrest has been discussed by psychiatrists and film experts, and has been used as a film illustration for the condition [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="RobinsonFG"&gt;{{cite book | last = Robinson | first = David J. | title = The Field Guide to Personality Disorders | publisher = Rapid Psychler Press | year = 1999 | pages = 113 | isbn = 0-9680324-6-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The character displays the behaviors of impulsivity, emotional lability, frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, frequent severe anger, [[self-harm]]ing, and changing from idealization to devaluation; these traits are consistent with the diagnosis, although generally aggression to the self rather than others is a more common feature in borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name="illness"&gt;{{cite book | title = Movies and Mental Illness: Using Films to Understand Psychopathology |vauthors=Wedding D, Boyd MA, Niemiec RM | year = 2005 | publisher = Hogrefe | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-88937-292-6 | page = 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have instead considered the character to be a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].&lt;ref name = autogenerated1/&gt;

As referenced in Orit Kamirs' ''Every Breath You Take: Stalking Narratives and the Law'', "Glenn Close's character Alex is quite deliberately made to be an [[erotomania]]c. Gelder reports that Glenn Close 'consulted three separate shrinks for an inner profile of her character, who is meant to be suffering from a form of obsessive condition known as de Clérambault's syndrome' (Gelder 1990, 93—94)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kamir | first = Orit | title = Every Breath You Take: Stalking Narratives and the Law | publisher = University of Michigan Press | year = 2001 | pages = 256 | isbn = 978-0-472-11089-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular term "bunny boiler", often used to describe an obsessive, spurned woman, derives from the scene where it is discovered that Alex has boiled the pet rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Anita|title=Fatal Attraction: My sympathy for the bunny-boiler|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/10712272/Fatal-Attraction-My-sympathy-for-the-bunny-boiler.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Bunny boiler|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/bunny-boiler.html|website=phrases.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health and gender===
As Alex Forrest is portrayed as a psychotic, love-obsessed woman seeking revenge, behaviors that represent [[stalking]] are present. According to a study of 148 people conducted by Randy and Lori Sansone, over half of the people who were found guilty of stalking-related incidents also experienced [[borderline personality disorder]] among other [[mental health]] concerns. It can be noted that Alex Forrest's femininity was seen as toxic and fearful to the people in the film that she interacted with, which is a crucial representation of women as possessive and psychotic when it comes to dominance over a man. People who experience borderline personality disorder can also have higher risks of issues like [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=pmid20532158&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20532158 |pmc=2882283 |year=2010 |author1=Sansone |first1=R. A |title=Fatal attraction syndrome: Stalking behavior and borderline personality |journal=Psychiatry |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=42–6 |last2=Sansone |first2=L. A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, most stalking situations occur from people who were previously involved in relationships with the person who is being stalked, according to research by Spitzberg and Vekslet.&lt;ref name=pmid17619634&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17619634 |year=2007 |author1=Spitzberg |first1=B. H |title=The personality of pursuit: Personality attributions of unwanted pursuers and stalkers |journal=Violence and victims |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=275–89 |last2=Veksler |first2=A. E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Alex Forrest, her obsession was for a man that she could not have due to other circumstances in his life. These circumstances, Beth and Ellen, are his family, and though Alex and Dan did not have a deep or meaningful relationship, Alex's clinginess caused assumptions of mental health issues.

Alex's representation of poor mental health in this film shows exactly the clinginess and attachment that people with stalking behaviors present. Slitting her wrists and pretending to be pregnant are manipulative techniques that someone with a personality and attachment disorder would use to regain the desired intimacy with a former partner. Women tend to stalk former partners as well as the women associated with those former partners, much like one can see in the 1992 film ''[[Single White Female]]''.&lt;ref name=pmid11729025&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2056 |pmid=11729025 |title=A Study of Women Who Stalk |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=12 |pages=2056–60 |year=2001 |last1=Purcell |first1=Rosemary |last2=Pathé |first2=Michele |last3=Mullen |first3=Paul E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[paleontology]], a '''fern spike''' is the occurrence of abundant [[fern]] [[spore]]s in the [[fossil record]], usually immediately (in a [[Geologic time scale|geological]] sense) after an [[extinction event]].  The spikes are believed to represent a large, temporary increase in the number of ferns relative to other terrestrial [[plant]]s after the [[extinction]] or [[thinning]] of the latter, probably because fern [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] is more rapid over large geographic areas, since single-celled fern spores are more easily distributed by the wind than are seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plants: Evolution and Diversity|author1=Ingrouille, M. |author2=Eddie, B. |page=163|isbn=113945546X|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fern spikes are most associated with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0963:CTCIAA&gt;2.3.CO;2 | last1 = Schultz | first1 = P.H. | last2 = D'Hondt | first2 = S. | year = 1996 | title = Cretaceous-Tertiary (Chicxulub) impact angle and its consequences | url = http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/11/963 | journal = Geology | volume = 24 | issue = 11| pages = 963–967 |bibcode = 1996Geo....24..963S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1064706 | last1 = Vajda | first1 = V. | last2 = Raine | first2 = J.I. | last3 = Hollis | first3 = C.J. | year = 2001 | title = Indication of global deforestation at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary by New Zealand fern spike | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5547/1700 | journal = Science | volume = 294 | issue = 5547| pages = 1700–1702 | pmid = 11721051 |bibcode = 2001Sci...294.1700V }}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have been found at other events such as at the [[Triassic]]-[[Jurassic]] boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0040-1951(93)90359-R | last1 = Fowell | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Olsen | first2 = P.E. | year = 1993 | title = Time calibration of Triassic-Jurassic microfloral turnover, eastern North-America | url = | journal = [[Tectonophysics (journal)|Tectonophysics]] | volume = 222 | issue = 3–4| pages = 361–369 |bibcode = 1993Tectp.222..361F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1065522 | last1 = Olsen | first1 = P.

[[File:SegellSempringham.jpg|thumb|Seal of the Master of the Order of Sempringham]]
The '''Gilbertine Order''' of [[Canons Regular]] was founded around 1130 by [[Gilbert of Sempringham|Saint Gilbert]] in [[Sempringham]], [[Lincolnshire]], where Gilbert was the [[parish priest]].  It was the only completely [[England|English]] [[religious order]] and came to an end in the 16th century at the time of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Modest Gilbertine revivals have taken place in the late 20th and early 21st centuries on three continents.

==Founding==
[[File:GilbertSempringham.jpg|thumb|Gilbert of Sempringham flanked by two nuns]]
Gilbert initially established a community for enclosed contemplative nuns. He accepted seven women whom he had taught in the village school and in 1131 founded an order of [[nun]]s based on the [[Rule of St Benedict|Cistercian Rule]].&lt;ref name=butler&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06556b.htm Butler, Richard Urban. "Order of Gilbertines." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 12 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert set up buildings and a cloister for them against the north wall of the church, which stood on his land at Sempringham, and gave them a rule of life, enjoining upon them chastity, humility, obedience, and charity. Their daily necessaries were passed to them through a window by some girls chosen by Gilbert from among his people.&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;

As the serving maids requested that they too might have a dress and rule of life, on the advice of William, abbot of [[Rievaulx]], he decided to add [[lay sisters]] to the community.&lt;ref name=Page/&gt; Eventually Gilbert added [[lay brothers]] to work the fields. In 1139 the small order opened its first new foundation on the island of [[Haverholme Priory|Haverholm]], a gift from [[Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln]]. Each Gilbertine house now practically consisted of four communities, one of nuns, one of canons, one of lay sisters, and one of lay brothers.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; Over the years, more and more new foundations were established.

In 1147 he left [[England]] for [[Continental Europe]] to seek assistance, and approached the [[Cistercian]] Order at its major house in [[Cîteaux]] to take on the running of his foundations. The Cistercians declined, apparently because they felt unable to administer houses for both men and women, but [[Pope Eugene III]], himself a Cistercian, intervened to ask the abbot, [[Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]], to assist Gilbert in drawing up Institutes for a new Order, which combined Benedictine and Cistercian influences. Pope Eugene then appointed Gilbert as the first Master of the Order of Sempringham or Gilbertines. Gilbert returned to England in 1148, and completed the order, by appointing canons, who lived according to variant of the Augustinian rule, to serve his community as priests, and to help him in the work of administration.&lt;ref name=Page/&gt;

==Habits==
The '''Nuns''' wore a black tunic and a black scapular for work. They also wore a black lamb's wool head-dress with a coarse black cloth veil.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sisters''' wore a dark tunic without the scapular. They also wore a sheepskin cloak and a long hood.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canons Regular''' wore a black [[cassock]] with a white hooded cloak&lt;ref&gt;Monasticon Vol.2 p.791&lt;/ref&gt; (lined with lamb's wool)&lt;ref&gt;English Monastic Life, Gasquet, Francis Aidan, 1904, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; with shoes of red leather.&lt;ref&gt;S. Gilbert of Sempringham and the Gilbertines, Graham, Rose, 1901, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; When labouring, they would use the scapular. In choir, they wore white copes.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''Brothers''' wore a dark tunic with a dark cloak lined with rough skins. They wore a cloth [[cope]] to the heels to wear in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
Each Gilbertine priory had one [[Church (building)|church]], divided unequally by a wall.  The nuns had the larger part, and the canons the smaller.  The latter would join the nuns only to celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]].  From the church, the nunnery normally stood to the north and the canons' lodgings to the south.

==Scandals==

In the mid-twelfth century, a girl was brought to [[Watton Priory]] as a child, but had no real [[religious vocation]].  This [[Nun of Watton]] became pregnant by a lay brother, who fled, but he was brought back for punishment.

Towards the end of Gilbert's life, when he was around 90 years old, some of the lay brothers at Sempringham rose up against him, complaining of too much work and too little food. The rebels, led by two skilled craftsmen, received money from both religious and secular supporters and took their case to Rome.  [[Pope Alexander III]] ruled in Gilbert's favour, but the living conditions of the lay brothers were improved thereafter.&lt;ref name=Malton&gt;[http://www.stmarysmalton.org.uk/gilbertines.html "The Gilbertine Order", St. Mary's Priory Church, Old Malton]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Middle Ages==
The Gilbertine order was always popular in England and Wales. Its houses were the final homes of the last of the [[Wales|Welsh]] royal family, young daughters, after the rest had been defeated and killed in the 1280s. Principal among these was [[Gwenllian of Wales|Gwenllian]] who was sent to [[Sempringham Priory]] and a monument commemorating her was placed near the Priory site in the 1990s. Many English kings gave the order generous [[charter]]s, and yet it always had financial problems.  By the end of the 15th century, the Order was greatly impoverished, and [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] exempted all of its houses from paying taxes and from any other sort of payment.  He could not  force his successors to do the same.

==Dissolution==
[[File:Malton Priory, West front.JPG|thumb|Malton Priory, West front]]
By the time of the Dissolution, there were twenty-six houses of Gilbertines, but only four of these were ranked as "greater houses", having annual incomes above £200.  Following the [[Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act]] of 1536, these houses gave in to [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1538 without a fight, surrendering "of their own free will".  Each nun and canon then received a pension for the rest of their lives. 

The last [[Master of the Gilbertine Order|Master of the Order]], [[Robert Holgate]] is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. [[Malton Priory]], one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last to surrender in December 1539,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36278 Gilbertine houses: Priory of Malton]. ''A History of the County of York'': Volume 3 (1974), pp. 253-254 ([[Public domain]] text), accessed via [[British History Online]].&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Sempringham Priory]], worth more than £200 a year, surrendered in 1538.&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;Page, William, 'Houses of the Gilbertine order: The priory of Sempringham', A History of the County of Lincoln: Volume 2 (1906), pp. 179–187, ([[Public domain]] text), accessed via [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38029 British History online]&lt;/ref&gt; Holgate was already the [[Bishop of Llandaff]] but translated to become [[Archbishop of York]] in 1545.

The Gilbertines were the only purely English order (except for one house in [[Scotland]]), therefore the Dissolution marked their permanent end.

==Legacy==
The Gilbertine legacy is fairly small; only fifteen extant manuscripts are associated with the Order, originating from only five of the Gilbertine houses. Four additional works ascribed to Gilbertines, but not surviving in Gilbertine copies, include the ''Vita'' of Gilbert of Sempringham, the Gilbertine Rule, the so-called 'Sempringham Continuation' to ''Le Livere de Reis Engleterre'', and the works of [[Robert Mannyng]].

The remains of one Gilbertine monastery, [[Malton Priory]], have been incorporated into the parish church at [[Malton, North Yorkshire|Malton]] in [[North Yorkshire]]. The original monastery was established around 1150, and, though it has suffered considerable abuse, the surviving fragment remains impressive. Although the [[Sempringham Priory|Priory at Sempringham]] was destroyed, the adjacent and contemporary parish church of St Andrew remains and some evidence of mediaeval decoration is still to be found.

When the Time Team Came to Chicksands. http://www.chicksandspriory.co.uk/page1/page9/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Time Team. Season 09, Episode 04. Originally aired on 27 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; excavated a Gilbertine monastery in [[Chicksands Priory|Chicksands]], Bedfordshire. The programme was shown in 2002 as part of [[Time Team (series 9)|series 9 of ''Time Team'']].

==Gilbertine Revivals==
===Oblates of St Gilbert===

In 1983, following celebrations of the 900th anniversary of Gilbert's birth, a number of lay people in the [[East Midlands]] undertook to sustain the memory and work of Gilbert and the Gilbertine Order by establishing a new secular Order. The Oblates of St Gilbert exist to promote the Gilbertine contemplative spirit and to foster interest in the study of Gilbert and his Order. They are supported by the Cistercian monastery of [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]] in Leicestershire.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

In about 1998 a priest of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Paulo]] in Brazil, Carlos Aparicido Marchesani, visited the Gilbertine Oblates as he had had a devotion to Saint Gilbert since a seminarian in the United States.

The [[Great Depression]] affected '''France''' from about 1931 through the remainder of the decade. The crisis affected France a bit later than other countries, hitting around 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Laufenburger, "France and the Depression," ''International Affairs'' (1936) 15#2 pp. 202–224 {{JSTOR|2601740}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the 1920s grew at the very strong rate of 4.43% per year, the 1930s rate fell to only 0.63%.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dormois, ''The French Economy in the Twentieth Century'' (2004) p 31 &lt;/ref&gt;  The depression was relatively mild: unemployment peaked under 5%, the fall in  production was at most 20% below the 1929 output; there was no banking crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, "The French Depression in the 1930s," ''Review of Economic Dynamics'' (2002) 5:73–99 {{doi|10.1006/redy.2001.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depression had some effects on the local economy, which can partly explain the [[6 February 1934 crisis]] and even more the formation of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], led by [[Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière|SFIO socialist leader]] [[Léon Blum]], who won the election of 1936.

== Economic crisis of the 1920s ==
Like the United Kingdom, France had initially struggled to recover from the devastation of World War I, trying without much success to recover war [[World War I reparations|reparations]] from Germany. Unlike Britain, though, France had a more self-sufficient economy. In 1929, France seemed an island of prosperity, for three reasons. First, it was a country traditionally wary of [[trusts]] and big companies. The economy of France was above all founded in small and medium-sized businesses not financed by shares. Unlike the English-speaking world and particularly Americans, the French invested little on the stock exchange and put their confidence into gold, which in the crisis of 1929 was a currency of refuge. Gold had played the same role in the first world war, which explained French attachment to it. Finally, France had had a positive balance of payments&lt;ref name="Eichengreen, Barry 1992 pp 213-239"&gt;Eichengreen, Barry (May 1992), 'The Origins and Nature of the Great Slump Revisited', ''The Economic History Review'' pp 213-239&lt;/ref&gt; for some years thanks{{POV-Statement|date=May 2012}} mainly to invisible exports such as tourism. French investments abroad were numerous.

The German reparations decided by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919 brought in large amounts of money which served principally to repay war loans to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen, Barry (May 1992), 'The Origins and Nature of the Great Slump Revisited', ''The Economic History Review'' p 220&lt;/ref&gt; Reparations payments ended in 1923. In January of that year, Germany defaulted on its payments and the French president, [[Raymond Poincaré]], invoked a clause of the Versailles Treaty and sent troops to [[occupation of the Ruhr|occupy the Ruhr valley]] in the hope of enforcing payment. Germany responded by flooding the area with inflated money, ruining its currency and denying France any hope of full reparations. Poincaré accepted an agreement mediated by the United States in which it received smaller payments, but Poincaré's government fell soon afterward.

While the United States experienced a sharp rise in unemployment, France had almost none. Much of that was due to a simple lack of manpower; at the end of the war, France had 1,322,000 dead and three million wounded, almost 4,000,000 casualties. One in four of the dead was younger than 24. That in turn lowered the birth rate, so that by 1938 France still had only half the number of 19- to 21-year-olds it would have had had the war not happened.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Robert (1996); Traveler's History of France, Windrush Press, UK&lt;/ref&gt;  But whatever the causes of full employment, confidence in the government was high. The French economy was stronger than those of its neighbors, notably because of the solidarity of the franc. The introduction of the US economic model, inspired particularly by Ford, ended suddenly and, with it, the modernization of French businesses. Everything seemed to favour the French; production didn't weaken before 1930, particularly in primary materials, and the country was the world's leading producer of iron in 1930. France felt confident in its systems and proud of its ''vertu budgétaire'', in other words the balancing of the budget, which France had managed more or less for nearly a decade.

In 1927, France gained from the world crisis in becoming the world's largest holder of gold, its reserves growing from 18 billion francs in 1927 to 80 billion in 1930.

[[Le Figaro]] said: "For our part let us rejoice in our timid yet prosperous economy as opposed to the presumptuousness and decadent economy of the Anglo-Saxon races."&lt;ref&gt;''Le Figaro'', France, 7 October 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems of financial policy ==
There was a further contrast in the way France and Anglo-Saxon nations viewed their economies. The Anglo-Saxon model encouraged growth of the money stock; in France, the Depression was seen as a necessary evil, to "purge" the excess liquidity in the world economy and to push over-indebted companies into failure.&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen, Barry (May 1992), 'The Origins and Nature of the Great Slump Revisited', ''The Economic History Review'' p 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Successive governments maintained restrictive policies into 1934 and interest rates were kept high to maintain the attractiveness of the franc. The absence of contra-cyclical policies kept the state budget in balance.

In 1934-35, the Pierre-Étienne Flandin government allowed a less restrictive policy allowing short-term indebtedness. The Banque de France lost 15 percent of its reserves and the government was replaced by one led by [[Pierre Laval]], who installed a provisionally deflationist policy before himself accepting a public deficit. The franc ran into a new crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen, Barry (May 1992), 'The Origins and Nature of the Great Slump Revisited', ''The Economic History Review'' p 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Laval tried in 1935 to reduce salaries in an effort to lessen unemployment. He ran into the resistance of unions in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen, Barry (May 1992), 'The Origins and Nature of the Great Slump Revisited', ''The Economic History Review'' p 228&lt;/ref&gt;

The inability of French production to take off was in contrast to the experience of the United Kingdom, which had devalued in 1931. Devaluation was something France didn't want and it happened only in 1936.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen, Barry 1992 pp 213-239"/&gt;

== The Depression strikes ==
:"The winter I spent on the streets - the winter of '32-33 - was no milder nor harder than any other winter; the winter cold is like labour pains - whether it lasts for a longer or shorter period of time there is always the same amount of pain. That particular winter, it snowed and it froze; thousands of young men, forced out of their jobs by the crisis, struggled on to their last penny, to the end of their tether then, in despair, abandoned the fight...

:On street benches and at métro entrances, groups of exhausted and starving young men would be trying not to die. I don't know how many never came round. I can only say what I saw. In the rue Madame one day I saw a child drop a sweet which someone trod on, then the man behind bent down and picked it up, wiped it and ate it."&lt;ref&gt;Lebesque, Morvan (1960), ''Chroniques du Canard'', Éditions J-J Pauvert&lt;/ref&gt;

== From depression to war ==
The distress of the population had political consequences. A riot on 6 February 1934 led to the fall of the government and a nation which had traditionally leaned to the right{{fact|date=January 2016}} elected the socialist [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government in 1936.

The Popular Front, an alliance of Socialists and Radicals with support outside the government of the Communists, was led by [[Léon Blum]]. The Popular Front introduced many measures such as the 40-hour working week and holidays with pay, but Blum felt handicapped in introducing more than limited changes to the economy because of his dependence on the more right-wing Radicals. This did little to placate a population anxious for change and a wave of strikes broke involving two million workers &lt;ref&gt;Price, Roger (1999); A Concise History of France, Cambridge University Press, UK, p242&lt;/ref&gt; Factories were occupied and membership of the Communist party rose to 300,000 in 1937.

On the night of 7–8 June 1936, employers and unions signed the [[Matignon Agreements (1936)|Matignon Agreements]] by which they raised wages by 7 to 15 percent to increase workers' buying power, to stimulate the economy and to bring an end to the strikes. Blum brought in measures to control cereal prices, to insist that the Banque de France place the national interest above that of the shareholders, and nationalized the armaments industry. That upset the Left, which saw too much legislation,{{clarify|date=January 2016}} and did nothing to please the Right, which believed that state involvement in a capitalist economy would bring about disaster.

The Radicals would not accept currency controls and the result of the unrest was that capital fled abroad. That weakened the economy and employers tried to minimize the results of the Matignon agreement, which created more social tension and in turn a further flight of capital.

Devaluation of the franc by thirty per cent became inevitable, despite government assurances that it would not happen. In January 1937, Blum went further and announced "a pause" to social reforms. The Senate refused to give him emergency powers to cope with the recession and he resigned on 20 June 1937 and the first Popular Front began to fall apart. A second had even less success.

The [[President]], Lebrun, called on the Radical leader [[Édouard Daladier]] to form a new government without the Socialists. Daladier relied on liberal economics to rescue, or at any rate keep afloat the economy on a worldwide sea of financial difficulties. Employers and police acted harshly against strikers and determined to root out "troublemakers". In 1938 the Senate gave Daladier the emergency powers that Blum had been denied and the government favored employers over workers in industrial disputes, particularly in companies which had come close to coming under the control of their workers.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Roger (1999); A Concise History of France, Cambridge University Press, UK, p245&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Daladier, economic conditions slightly improved, to a backdrop of growing, increasingly vocal communist and fascist movements. These gains, however, were due as much as anything to the growth of the armaments industry. On 3 September 1939, following the illegal attack against its Polish ally by Germany, France declared war on Germany.

'''Hetacillin''' is a [[beta-lactam antibiotic]] that is part of the [[aminopenicillin]] family.

==Administration==
Hetacillin can be administered orally.&lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt; The [[potassium]] salt, hetacillin potassium, is administered by [[Injection (medicine)|injection]], either intravenously or intramuscularly.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} It is sold under the trade name '''Hetacin''' for [[Mammary gland|intramammary]] injection in veterinary use.&lt;ref&gt;Hetacin-K Intramammary Infusion for {{Drugs.com|vet|hetacin-k-intramammary-infusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hetacillin was removed from the market for human use when the discovery was made that it is actually cleaved in the gastrointestinal tract to formaldehyde and had no advantages over ampicillin.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Chemistry==
Hetacillin is prepared from ampicillin and acetone. In aqueous solutions it is unstable, with a half life of 15 to 30 minutes at {{convert|37|°C|°F}} and pH&amp;nbsp;7, quickly releasing acetone again.&lt;ref name="DrugBank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Faine"&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Hillside Strangler''', later the '''Hillside Stranglers''', is the media epithet for one, later two [[United States|American]] [[serial killers]] who terrorized [[Los Angeles]] between October 1977 and February 1978, with the nicknames originating from the fact that many of the victims' bodies were discovered in the hills surrounding greater Los Angeles. The police, however, knew because of the positions of the bodies that two individuals were killing together, but withheld this information from the press. These two individuals were discovered to be cousins [[Kenneth Bianchi]] and [[Angelo Buono, Jr.|Angelo Buono]], who were later convicted of [[kidnap]]ping, [[rape|raping]], [[torture|torturing]], and [[murder]]ing 10 women and girls ranging in age from 12 to 28 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/West/09/22/strangler.death.ap |title='Hillside Strangler' dies in prison |publisher=cnn.com |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116004300/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/West/09/22/strangler.death.ap |archivedate=January 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vronsky187"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Vronsky|title=Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters|isbn=0-425-19640-2|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hillside Strangler murders began with the deaths of three sex workers who were found strangled and dumped naked on hillsides northeast of Los Angeles between October and early November 1977, but it was not until the deaths of five young women who were not sex workers, but girls who had been abducted from middle-class neighborhoods, that the media attention and subsequent "Hillside Strangler" [[moniker]] came to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/rampage_1.html |title=The Rampage Begins |first=Marilyn |last=Bardsley |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209235058/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/rampage_1.html |archivedate=February 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two more deaths in December and February before the murders abruptly stopped, an extensive investigation proved fruitless until the arrest of Bianchi in January 1979 for the murder of two more young women in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] and the subsequent linking of his past to the Strangler case. The most expensive trial in the history of the [[California]] legal system at that time followed, with Bianchi and Buono eventually being found guilty of these crimes and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

==Background==
{{Main article|Kenneth Bianchi|Angelo Buono}}
[[File:KennethBianchi 1979.jpg| right | thumb | Kenneth Bianchi mugshot in 1979]]
[[File: Angelo Buono.jpg | right | thumb | upright | Angelo Buono mugshot]]

In January 1976, [[Kenneth Bianchi]] left [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to live with his cousin, [[Angelo Buono, Jr.]].&lt;ref name="historylink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=8613|title=After he murders two Bellingham women, police arrest serial killer Kenneth A. Bianchi on January 12, 1979.|publisher=historylink.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buono provided a strong [[role model]] for the docile Bianchi, and, when Bianchi was short of money, Buono came up with the idea of getting some girls to work for them as [[prostitutes]].&lt;ref name="cl13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/13.html |title=Killing Cousins |first=Marilyn |last=Bardsley |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210032556/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/13.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two teenage runaways, Sabra Hannan and Becky Spears, met Bianchi and Buono and, once under their control, were forced to prostitute themselves. Eventually, Spears happened to meet lawyer David Wood, who was appalled at her situation and arranged for her to escape from the city. Encouraged by Spears' escape, Hannan ran away from Bianchi and Buono a short time later. With their [[pimp]]ing income gone, they had to find more teenage girls. Impersonating police officers, they eventually found another young woman and installed her in the previous girl's bedroom. Also, they bought from a prostitute named Deborah Noble a supposed "trick list" with names of men who frequented prostitutes. Deborah and her friend, Yolanda Washington, delivered the trick list to Buono in October 1977.&lt;ref name="cl13"/&gt;

==Murders==

===Yolanda Washington===
Yolanda happened to mention to Buono that she always worked on a certain stretch of [[Sunset Boulevard]]. When Bianchi and Buono found that Deborah had deceived them about the list but were unable to find her, they decided to take out their rage on Yolanda. Her naked body was found on October 18, 1977, on a hillside near the [[Ventura Freeway]], and Detective Frank Salerno of the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]] was called to the scene.&lt;ref name="cl5"/&gt; It was determined that the corpse was cleaned before being dumped; faint marks were visible around the neck, wrists, and ankles where a rope had been used; and that the victim had been [[rape]]d.&lt;ref name="vronsky187"/&gt;

===Judy Miller===

On November 1, 1977, police were called to Alta Terrace Drive in La Crescenta, a neighborhood 12 miles north of [[downtown Los Angeles]], where the body of a teenage girl was found naked, face up on a parkway in a middle-class residential area. The homeowner had covered her with a tarp in the early morning hours to prevent the neighborhood children from viewing her on their way to school.&lt;ref name="cl5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/victims_2.html |title=Early Victims |first=Marilyn |last=Bardsley |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210032548/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/victims_2.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligature marks were on her neck, wrists and ankles, indicating to police she was bound and strangled; and the body had been dumped, indicating she was killed elsewhere; Det. Salerno also found a small piece of light-colored fluff on her eyelid and saved it for the [[forensic]] experts. A coroner's report further detailed that she had been raped and [[sodomy|sodomized]].&lt;ref name="cl5"/&gt; The girl, who was described as being "small and thin, weighing about 90 pounds and appearing to be about 16 years old",&lt;ref name="cl5"/&gt; was eventually identified as 15 year old Judith Lynn Miller, a former student of Hollywood High School, runaway and occasional sex worker. Judith was last seen alive on October 31, 1977 talking to a man driving a large two-tone sedan on Sunset Blvd next to Carneys Express Limited. The stranglers told her they were undercover Police officers, handcuffed her, and took her to Buonos Upholstery Shop on Colorado Blvd in Glendale where she was murdered.

===Lissa Kastin===
Five days later, on November 6, 1977, the nude body of another woman was discovered near the Chevy Chase Country Club, in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]]. Like Miller, she bore five-point (neck, wrists and ankles) ligature marks and of having been strangled and brutally raped, but not sodomized.&lt;ref name="cl5"/&gt; The woman was identified as twenty-one-year-old waitress Elissa Teresa "Lissa" Kastin, who was last seen leaving the restaurant where she worked the night before her body was discovered. Kastin was also a professional dancer for The L.A. Knockers and unlike the two previous victims was not a prostitute, drug user or runaway. The stranglers followed Kastin after she was seen driving home from work, pulled her over on the street she lived on, presented a fake police badge, and told her that they were detectives. They then handcuffed her and told her they needed to take her in for questioning. &lt;ref name="vronsky188"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Vronsky|title=Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters|isbn=0-425-19640-2|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aborted murder of Catharine Lorre Baker===
At some point in early November 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19791117&amp;id=O3gsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zPoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6965,284812&amp;hl=en|title=Peter Lorre's daughter was near-victim of Hillside Strangler|access-date=September 11, 2016|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|date=November 17, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two men approached 24-year-old Catharine Lorre Baker, the daughter of actor [[Peter Lorre]] — famous for his role as a serial killer in [[Fritz Lang]]'s film [[M (1931 film)|''M'']] — with the intent of [[Kidnapping|abducting]] and killing her. However, when they found a picture of her sitting on her father's lap among her identification, they let her go without incident. She did not realize who the men were until they were arrested, at which point she recalled that two men flashing L.A. police badges had approached her in the past.&lt;ref name="vronsky191"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Vronsky|title=Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters|isbn=0-425-19640-2|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dolly Cepeda and Sonja Johnson===
On Sunday November 13, 1977, two girls, 12-year-old Dolores Ann "Dolly" Cepeda and 14-year-old Sonja Marie Johnson, boarded a RTD bus in front of The Eagle Rock Plaza and headed home. The last time they were seen was getting off the bus on York Blvd and Ave 46 and approaching a two-tone sedan which reportedly had two men inside. The two corpses were found by a nine-year-old boy who had been treasure hunting in a trash heap on a hillside near [[Dodger Stadium]], on November 20, 1977.&lt;ref name="cl3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/3.html |title=Two Killers |first=Marilyn |last=Bardsley |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210032543/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/3.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the girls' bodies had already begun to [[decomposition|decompose]], but it was still determined that they had been strangled and raped.&lt;ref name="vronsky188"/&gt;

===Kristina Weckler===
Earlier that same day, November 20, 1977, hikers found the naked body of twenty-year-old Kristina Weckler, a quiet honors student at the [[Art Center College of Design]] deemed by Detective Bob Grogan of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] to be a "loving and serious young woman who should have had a bright future ahead of her",&lt;ref name="cl3"/&gt; on a hillside between Glendale and Eagle Rock. When found by Grogan, ligature marks were on her wrists, ankles and neck, and when he turned her over, bruises on her breasts were obvious and blood oozed from her rectum. Unlike the first three victims however, there were two puncture marks on her arm, but no signs of the [[needle track]]s that indicated a drug addict.&lt;ref name="cl2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/2.html |title=The 'Hillside Strangler' |first=Marilyn |last=Bardsley |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210032542/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/2.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that Weckler had been injected with [[Windex]], a [[hard-surface cleaner]].&lt;ref name="vronsky188"/&gt;

===Jane King===
On November 23, 1977, the badly decomposed body of 28-year-old Evelyn Jane King, an actress who had gone missing around November 9, was found near the [[Los Feliz]] off-ramp of the [[Golden State Freeway]].&lt;ref name="cl3"/&gt; The severity of decomposition prevented determination as to whether she had been raped or [[torture]]d but she had been strangled like the others and in response authorities created a task force — initially composed of 30 officers from the LAPD, the Sheriff's Department and the [[Glendale Police Department]] — to catch the predator now dubbed the "Hillside Strangler".&lt;ref name="cl3"/&gt;

===Lauren Wagner===
On November 29, 1977, police found the body of eighteen-year-old Lauren Rae Wagner, a business student who lived with her parents in the [[San Fernando Valley]],&lt;ref name="vronsky188"/&gt; in the hills around Glendale's [[Mount Washington, Los Angeles|Mount Washington]]. She had ligature marks on her neck, ankles and wrists; but there were also burn marks on her hands indicating she was tortured.&lt;ref name="cl4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/4.html |title=A Witness |first=Marilyn |last=Bardsley |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210032547/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/4.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren's parents had expected her to come home before midnight, and the next morning when they found her car parked across the street with the door ajar, her father questioned the neighbors. He found that the woman who lived in the house where Lauren's car had been parked saw her abduction. This woman stated that she saw two men: one was tall and young; the other one was older and shorter with bushy hair.&lt;ref name="cl4"/&gt; She also stated that she heard Wagner cry out, "You won't get away with this!", during her abduction.&lt;ref name="cl4"/&gt;

===Kimberly Martin===
On December 14, 1977, the body of 17-year-old prostitute Kimberly Diane Martin, which was naked and showed signs of torture, was found on a deserted lot near [[Los Angeles City Hall]]. Martin had previously joined a [[call girl]] agency because she feared exposing herself on the streets with the Strangler on the loose, but, unfortunately, the killers happened to place a call to her agency from a Hollywood Public Library pay phone and she was the call girl who was dispatched. When the police investigated the apartment she had been dispatched to, they found it vacant and broken into.&lt;ref name="cl6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/6.html |title=Three More |first=Marilyn |last=Bardsley |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210032549/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stranglers/6.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cindy Hudspeth===
The final victim was discovered in Los Angeles on February 17, 1978, when a helicopter pilot spotted an orange [[Datsun]] abandoned off a cliff on the [[Angeles Crest Highway]].&lt;ref name="vronsky188"/&gt; Police responded to the scene and found the body of the car's owner, twenty-year-old Cindy Lee Hudspeth - a student and part-time waitress - in the trunk. Her corpse again showed ligature marks, and she had been raped and tortured. It appeared she had been strangled and put in the trunk of her car, which was then pushed off the cliff above.&lt;ref name="cl6"/&gt;

==Investigation and trial==
In January 1979, after intensive investigation, police charged Bianchi and Buono with the crimes. Bianchi had fled to [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], where he was soon arrested for raping and murdering two women he had lured to a home for a house-sitting job. Bianchi attempted to set up an [[insanity defense]], claiming that he had [[dissociative identity disorder]] and that a personality separate from himself committed the murders. Court psychologists, notably [[Martin Theodore Orne|Dr. Martin Orne]], observed Bianchi and found that he was faking, so Bianchi agreed to plead guilty and testify against Buono in exchange for leniency.

At the conclusion of Buono's trial in 1983, [[Presiding Judge]] [[Ronald M.

In 1980, Bianchi began a relationship with Veronica Compton. During his trial, she testified for the defense. She was later convicted and imprisoned for attempting to strangle a woman she had lured to a motel in an attempt to have authorities believe that the Hillside Strangler was still on the loose and the wrong man was imprisoned. Bianchi had given her some smuggled [[semen]] to use to make it look like a rape/murder committed by the Hillside Strangler. She was released in 2003.

The '''''Ingham'' Incident''', or the '''''Montezuma'' Affair''', was a [[naval battle]] fought in 1835, the first between [[First Mexican Republic|Mexico]] and the [[United States]]. The Mexican warship ''Montezuma'' patrolled the coast of Texas to prevent the smuggling of [[contraband]] into the territory. During the cruise, the Mexicans captured the American [[merchant ship]] ''Martha'' and later the Texan ship ''Columbia'' which led to a response by the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|Revenue Service]] cutter [[USRC Ingham (1832)|USRC ''Ingham'']]. A bloodless engagement was fought on June 14, and ended when the ''Montezuma'' was purposely run aground to prevent capture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070329153309/http://www.aug.edu/~libwrw/Articles/EveryProtection.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The conflict began at [[Galveston]] on May 7 of 1835 before the outbreak of fighting between the Texans and the Mexicans. That day the [[Mexican Navy]] [[schooner]] ''Montezuma'', under the command of [[Lieutenant]] [[Juan Calvi]], seized the American schooner ''Martha'' for "''customs violations''" and because the passengers were not carrying [[passport]]s, they were arrested and put in the [[brig (prison)|brig]]. Two of the passengers, Thomas J. and Francis S. Early, were the sons of the former [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor]] [[Peter Early]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The brothers recalled that on previous encounters in Mexico the authorities did not ask for passports so they assumed they didn't need one. Ten days later Calvi captured the Texan ship ''Columbia'' for similar infractions. Both incidents sparked anger in Texas and a debate on whether the seizures were legal. The smuggling of contraband into Texas had become a major concern to the Mexicans by 1835, according to author William R. Wells II, most American and Texan ships were involved in the illegal trade and openly defiant of the Mexican laws against such activities. Mill equipment owned by [[Robert Wilson (Missouri)|Robert Wilson]] was part of the cargo aboard the ''Martha'' when she was taken. Wells sent a message about the outrage to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[William B. Travis]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Travis responded with a letter dated July 7, informing Wilson that the revenue cutter USRC ''Ingham'' had been dispatched by [[United States Customs|Customs Agent]] [[James W. Breedlove]], as she was the only armed American naval ship in the western [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The ''Ingham'' was cruising the [[Mississippi River]] south of [[New Orleans]] when her commander, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Ezekiel Jones]], received orders to sail to Texas. Though the seizures of the two ships were deemed legal by the Texans and the Americans, a critical press, politics, and the "''unofficial urging''" of the use of force by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Jackson]] eventually resulted in the operation and a subsequent naval battle. Due to an incident at [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], sometime before, Agent Breedlove attempted to establish an American naval force in the western Gulf by claiming that a slave ship was sailing from Havana to Texas but his scheme was thwarted by [[Secretary of the Navy|Assistant Navy Secretary]] John Boyle. One vessel was dispatched, the [[USS St. Louis (1828)|USS ''St. Louis'']], which sailed for Cuba where her commander discovered that the so-called slave ship was carrying free negroes to [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Because Captain Jones lacked [[just cause]], his official report states that he was sailing the ''Ingham'' on a twenty-five-day cruise for an anti-slavery operation though his real intentions were to liberate the captured ships and the American citizens. Upon reaching the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]], Jones patrolled the area for a few days for slavers before crossing into Mexican waters disguised as a merchantman. First the captain sailed past Galveston for [[Matagorda, Texas|Matagorda]], Texas, but heavy seas prevented him from entering so Jones headed for the [[Brazos River]], where on June 3 he was informed by a local pilot that "several Acts of [[Piracy]]" had been committed by the ''Montezuma'' and that there were no slave ships in the area. Captain Jones sent a landing party ashore to uncover the truth of these claims and he ordered that the three vessels in port be examined, none of which were found to be carrying slaves. Following that the Americans cruised back to Matagorda and crossed the bar on June 5; two more ships were boarded but they were found to be legal. At the same time a crewman from one of the merchant ships informed the Americans that a vessel with 100 slaves on board was expected to arrive at Matagorda shortly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Jones dismissed this rumor and continued on to search the bay for the ''Montezuma'' which was suspected of being in the area. Another shore party was landed with the mission of investigating various rumors about the ''Martha'' affair and to recruit spies to report on the ''Montezuma''{{'}}s presence. Ultimately USRC ''Ingham'' would sail the Texas coast for another two weeks without finding the Mexican schooner. Jones used the time to board suspected slavers and to drill his men for a possible encounter with the ''Montezuma''. Eventually Jones decided to head for [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] on June 12 "''with the avowed intention of seeking the Montezuma.''"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Incident==
[[File:Revenue cutter.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A [[Morris-Taney class cutter]], possibly the USRC ''Ingham'']]
On June 13, the ''Ingham'' passed the bar at Passo Cabello where she struck the ground several times, so a pilot was hired to take the ship to [[Brazos Santiago]] which was reached on July 14. While six miles off the port, Jones proceeded with caution by having "all hands preparing grape shot &amp; getting the Battery in fighting order &amp; exercising the great guns &amp; [[small arms]]." At 5:00 pm Jones tacked toward shore and a lookout sighted a vessel anchored off Brazos Santiago. An hour later the vessel was identified as a "[[clipper ship|clipper]] built Schooner" and at 6:30 the vessel hoisted sails and "bore down" on the ''Ingham''. Ten minutes after that the Mexicans opened fire on the Americans with one shot and at 7:40 her crew raised their ensign, revealing that the vessel was a warship. According to Captain Jones, he returned the Mexican's fire only after receiving it, though it remains unknown as to who fired the first shots. The former master of the captured Texan ship ''Colombia'' was on board the ''Montezuma'' throughout the incident and he claimed that the Mexicans opened fire after the ''Ingham'' discharged a lee gun as a signal to communicate. Jones reported that Lieutenant Calvi must have thought the ''Ingham'' was a merchant ship due to the disguise and as soon as he realized that the American ship was armed, he "hauled his wind &amp; made all sail from us." The Americans were now chasing the ''Montezuma'' and they opened fire with a 9-pounder chaser to prevent the Mexicans from moving into position for a broadside.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

After that Lieutenant Calvi had his men open fire again, making Jones believe that a battle had begun in earnest so he slowed his ship to allow the ''Ingham''{{'}}s broadside guns to be brought into action. Calvi exploited this opportunity to disengage and he headed for the shore, jettisoning gear and weapons along the way to lighten the schooner, increase her speed, and to shorten the vessel's draft in order to cross the bars of the [[Rio Grande]]. Calvi, for unknown reasons, did not sail into port; instead he anchored with his broadside facing the ''Ingham''. The alarm was also raised and [[Mexican Army]] troops reinforced the ''Montezuma''. Soon after that the Mexicans were back in sail and they resumed their firing on the American cutter. Calvi stayed close to shore so the remainder of the engagement was a long range gunnery duel. Captain Jones attempted to cut the Mexicans off by getting in between the ''Montezuma'' and the harbor's entrance but Calvi was "too far to the leeward" for that to be done. By 12:00 the Mexicans were unable to escape the pursuing ''Ingham'' so Clavi chose to run his ship "into the Breakers &amp; on the Bar" which caused heavy damage to the ''Montezuma''. Jones considered shelling the wreck but he later decided against this and broke off the action now that the enemy was no longer a threat.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

American forces discharged only thirteen shots during the entire battle according to Jones' report; he did not mention how many rounds the Mexicans had fired. In the following months, an anonymous person claimed that the ''Ingham'' had purposely remained out of the ''Montezuma''{{'}}s range; this was contested by a sailor named Harby, who commanded the ship's guns. Harby said that the Mexican schooner was within "easy reach" of his last six shots and that Captain Jones had ordered that the ''Montezuma'' should not be struck but, if possible, intimidated. There were no casualties on either side. After the battle, Jones sailed back for New Orleans where he prepared for another expedition with the objective of capturing the Mexican warship ''Correo de Mexico''. However, hostilities broke out in Texas first and the rebels [[San Felipe Incident (1835)|engaged]] and captured the ''Correo de Mexico'' on September 1 off Brazoria. The American prisoners captured by Lieutenant Calvi were all released on June 15 and the cruise of the ''Ingham'' was declared a success. A [[newspaper]] called the ''Ingham'' "''[[Semper Paratus]]''" for her response to the ''Martha'' affair and the term would eventually become the [[motto]] of the [[United States Coast Guard]]. The ''Ingham'' was later sold to the [[Texas Navy]] and renamed [[Texan schooner Independence|''Independence'']].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The '''Intermovement''' ''(International Movement of Workers in the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]])'' ({{lang-et|Interliikumine}}, {{lang-ru|Интердвижение}}, [[Transliteration|translit.]]&amp;nbsp;Interdvizhenie) was a political movement and organisation in the [[Estonian SSR]]. It was founded on 19 July 1988&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/pdf/120-4-279.pdf An Annotated Survey of Independent Movements in Eastern Europe]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 13 June 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed by different sources 16,000 - 100,000 members.&lt;ref name="survey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958633-1,00.html Soviet Union Look Who's Feeling Picked On] - [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] - September 25, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The original name of the movement was '''[[Interfront]]''' (International Front of Workers in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic), which was changed to Intermovement in autumn 1988.

The movement was aligned with the conservative (that is, pro-Soviet) wing of [[Estonian Communist Party]], and opposed the [[Estonian independence movement]] led by the [[nationalistic]] [[Rahvarinne|Popular Front of Estonia]] and the liberal wing of the CPE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cog.kent.edu/lib/TerkEMPLOYEEOWNERSHIPINTRANSITIONALECONOMIESESTONIA.pdf Employee Ownership and the Political Debate in Estonia 1987-1994.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901213128/http://cog.kent.edu/lib/TerkEMPLOYEEOWNERSHIPINTRANSITIONALECONOMIESESTONIA.pdf |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE ANATOMY OF INDEPENDENCE"&gt;[http://kripta.ee/anatomy_of_independence/book_eng.pdf THE ANATOMY OF INDEPENDENCE], Kripta, Tartu, Sankt Petersburg 2004, {{ISBN|5-98451-007-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="here"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/21/world/estonia-nationalists-begin-to-challenge-moscow-dominance.html?n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Estonia here]&lt;/ref&gt; The Intermovement was not perceived as an organisation built on nationalist principles but it gathered almost exclusively supporters from ethnic [[Russians in Estonia|non-Estonians]]. The main leader of the movement was [[Jevgeni Kogan]] ({{lang-ru|Евгений Коган}}, sometimes transliterated as Evgeny Kogan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/290307/esileht/siseuudised/252502.php Suri endine Interrinde liider Jevgeni Kogan], Postimees 29 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Kogan was also one of the leaders of the hardline [[Soyuz (faction)|Soyuz]] faction in the USSR legislature. Other leaders of the Intermovement included [[Vladimir Jarovoi]] ({{lang-ru|Владимир Яровой}}, also transliterated as Vladimir Yarovoi), Arnold Sai,&lt;ref name="survey"/&gt; Vladimir Lebedev ({{lang-ru|Владимир Лебедев}}) and economist [[Konstantin Kiknadze]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956384-1,00.html Estonia] - [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] - November 28, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intermovement functioned at factories, mainly, at military plants and those factories that had an [[all-union]] importance. A large part of Estonian heavy industry was part of the integrated production chain providing their production to the industries in other Soviet regions. These included e.g. the engine factory ''[[Dvigatel]]'', Kalinin's and Pöögelmann's electrotechnical plant ''[[Tondi Elektroonika]]'', and the (especially but not only [[phosphorite]]) mining industry in Northern Estonia. It was feared that Estonian independence would lead to the loss of jobs. In fact, after independence the industries were forced to restructure their production and re-orient to new markets, which in most of cases drastically reduced production and forced lay off many people, a large number of whom were Soviet-era immigrants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

According to critics, the movement's aim was to protect the conservative Soviet values and make everything possible to block the actions of the Popular Front. According to the former KGB general [[Oleg Kalugin]] ({{lang-ru|Олег Калугин}}) it was established in Estonia as also in other parts of the USSR on the initiative of the [[KGB]], as a counterbalance to the [[Popular Front]]s, perceived as [[nationalism|nationalist]] organizations.&lt;ref name="THE ANATOMY OF INDEPENDENCE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; Despite the stereotyping of the [[Russophone]]s as a force opposing an Estonian independence movement, the Interfront organizations were never mass movements and their membership was largely confined to members of the Party apparat and plant managers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/sem01/ Estonia: Nation Building And Integration.

'The Ethnic Democracy Thesis and the Citizenship Question in Estonia and Latvia'. Nationalities Papers, 24, 2, pp. 199-216.&lt;/ref&gt; One of initiators of foundation of the Popular Front R. Grigorjan afterwards gave the following evaluation:

{{quote|One cannot say that everything in the ideas and slogans of the Intermovementians was wrong. Their concerns that Estonian language will be introduced and people will be fired for not speaking it, fulfilled completely. Or, that the Russian-speakers will be deprived of political rights (citizenship) and turn into second-class people, that Russian schools will be closed etc. But, if the leaders of the Intermovement cared really about human rights, one could find common language with them. However, what they thought about weren't people. For them, as well as for the radical nationalists, people were means, not aim. They'd cared about destiny of the CPSU, Soviet Empire, red flag, marxism-leninism etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kripta.ee/anatomy_of_independence/book_rus.pdf Iseseisvuse anatoomia. Анатомия независимости. The anatomy of independence], Kripta, Tartu, Sankt Petersburg 2004, {{ISBN|5-98451-007-3}}. p. 173{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In elections for the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1989 pro-Intermovement candidates won 6 seats out of Estonia's 36, against 27 won by the Popular Front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vvk.ee/english/overview.html#2603 ELECTIONS AND REFERENDUMS IN ESTONIA 1989-1999 - Elections to the Congress of the USSR People's Deputies 26.03.1989]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 29 August 1990 to 21 August 1991 the Intermovement ran the radio station Nadezhda ({{lang-ru|Надежда}}, meaning 'Hope'), which contrary to the ordinary procedure got its license from the central authorities of the Soviet Union without informing local authorities in Estonia. Following an order by the [[Soviet Defense Minister]] [[Dmitry Yazov]], the radio station was installed at the territory of the Soviet military base in [[Keila]], near Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eesti Ekspress]] August 15, 2006: [http://www.ekspress.ee/viewdoc/B7AB714AC4E2E72EC22571CB002BA584 Raadiohääl Keila tankipolgust] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Estonian state adopted a [[Estonian nationality law|law on citizenship and residency]], based on ''[[Jus sanguinis]]''. Under the new law, former Soviet citizens who had neither held Estonian citizenship nor were descended from citizens (including approximately 500,000 ethnic Russians) were to be regarded foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/estonias-russians-threaten-breakaway-1494791.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Some raised concerns that the new foreigners would face possible expulsion from Estonian territory; however, these concerns were not based in fact and in general, Soviet-era non-citizen immigrants were furnished with long-term [[residence permit]]s.

Ostensibly in response to the government's actions, [[Juri Mišin]] &lt;ref&gt;{{lang-ru|Юрий Мишин}}, also transliterated as Yury Mishin,&lt;/ref&gt; and a few other former activists of the Intermovement made demands of regional autonomy for Estonia's Russian minority, seeking [[autonomy]] of the ethnic Russian dominated areas in North-East Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978873-1,00.html Aliens in a Land They Call Home] - [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] - July 19, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists held an unconstitutional plebiscite on this matter in the [[Narva]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Kansalaisuuskiistojen ei uskota vievän sijoittajia Virosta - ''[[Kauppalehti]]'' July 9, 1993 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some raised concerns that the central government might use force to prevent the plebiscite, but these concerns were not based in fact, and it tookplace on July 16–July 17, 1993. According to the activist commissions in [[Narva]] and [[Sillamäe]], 53.2% percent of voters participated and 98% in total (97.2% in Narva). However, the central government determined the majority of the population did not participate, and demanded the Narva city council, which had provided material support to separatists, to disband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nc.ee/?id=489]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crismart.org/templates/Page____571.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intermovement was not built on ethnic principles and had some ethnic Estonian supporters.

An '''Internationale Bauausstellung''' ('''IBA''') or International Architecture Exhibition is a [[Germany|German]] tool for [[urban engineering]] and [[architecture]], in order to show new concepts in terms of social, cultural and ecologic ideas.

== History ==
* The first one dates to 1901 and was held in [[Darmstadt]].
* [[Interbau|IBA '57 ]] was organised in Berlin.
* 1979-87 [[International Building Exhibition Berlin|IBA Berlin]] was an urban renewal project which followed the strategies of "careful urban renewal" and "[[critical reconstruction]]". The program inspired the formation of the group [[Feministische Organisation von Planerinnen und Architektinnen]] (Feminist Architects and Planners Organisation or FOPA), who objected to its failure to adequately address women-specific issues and involve female designers. 
* 1989-99 [[Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park|IBA Emscher Park]] aimed at restructuring a former industrial region, the [[Ruhr]], by sparking urbanistic, architectural, cultural, and economic incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief English Info IBA Emscher Park|url=http://www.iba-emscherpark.de/pageID_2507086.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current ==
* 2012-20 [[International Building Exhibition Parkstad|IBA Parkstad]] is the first IBA to be held completely outsite of Germany, in the former mining region of [[Parkstad Limburg]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Currently at least 39 projects have been chosen to develop further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website of IBA Parkstad|url=http://www.iba-parkstad.nl/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The railway operates from a station through the woods, returning via a [[balloon loop]]. This line is home to former [[Bord na Móna]] steam locomotive No. 2 (later No. LM44) which had been built by [[Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co.]] (2264 of 1949). Several diesel locomotives also work on the line, Notably the oldest working diesel locomotive in Ireland (Planet WN 2014 of 1936) "Nippy" and Ruston and Hornsby ESB No 4 "Rusty".

'''''Kelly''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book and lyrics by [[Eddie Lawrence]] and music by [[Mark Charlap]]. It was inspired by [[Steve Brodie (bridge jumper)|Steve Brodie]], who in 1886 claimed to have jumped off the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and survived.  The story centers around Hop Kelly, a daredevil busboy. Some Bowery gamblers try to prevent him from surviving a jump from the Brooklyn Bridge.

The 1965 musical is notable for having closed after its opening night performance on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], becoming one of the biggest flops in Broadway history.

==Background==
Inspired by the 1880s tale of [[Brooklyn Bridge]]-jumper [[Steve Brodie (bridge jumper)|Steve Brodie]], the musical features period characters [[Diamond Jim Brady]], [[Frank James|Frank]] and [[Jesse James]], [[Tony Pastor]], [[Lillian Russell]] and [[John L. Sullivan]].

Of the show's origins, Eddie Lawrence, lyricist and librettist, recalled that: "Moose Charlap had finished doing his songs for [[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|''Peter Pan'']], starring [[Mary Martin]], and a couple of one-acts of mine were being performed while I toured late night TV plugging my comedy album. During the afternoons, we worked on ''Kelly''. It was a labour of love."&lt;ref&gt;Sleeve notes for CD ''Kelly''.  Original Cast Records OC8802 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; At that early stage, the show was titled ''Never Go There Anymore''.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;Stewart, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=spQ751Sv7TUC&amp;pg=PT2182&amp;lpg=PT2182&amp;dq=Hop+kelly+musical+%22brooklyn+bridge%22+bowery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B0cx78nZAG&amp;sig=4FZyBoJy_HEpkw8h9bUuo7xnl2E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix6uLs0u_QAhWm0FQKHUE4Cz0Q6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hop%20kelly%20musical%20%22brooklyn%20bridge%22%20bowery&amp;f=false ''Broadway Musicals, 1943–2004'', McFarland, 2006] {{ISBN|1476603294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence further recalls that "we ran into some producers who said they'd been waiting for this show all their lives and wanted to present it on Broadway."  The show's original producer was Broadway stalwart [[Edward Padula]] (in association with January Productions), whose deal included a motion picture adaptation.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1980"&gt;Sleeve notes for LP ''Eddie Lawrence and Moose Charlap sing their Songs from Kelly''.  Original Cast Records OC8025 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  Toward the end of 1963, it was reported that the budget had been set at $350,000, with $100,000 to be invested by Roulette Records.  At this early stage, a number of actors were named as possible leads. Impressionist [[Frank Gorshin]] and film actor [[Richard Harris]] were both considered for the lead male role, while Mark Charlap's wife, pop singer Sandy Stewart, was considered for the lead female role.  Lindsey Anderson was engaged as the show's director.  Rehearsals were scheduled to start on 27 January 1964, with a Broadway opening planned for March. None of this, however, came to pass.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

By April of that year, the show had been taken up by new producers, [[David Susskind]], [[Daniel Melnick]], and [[Joseph E. Levine]] of [[Embassy Pictures]]. Levine financed $250,000 of the $400,000 budget, with the balance coming from [[Columbia Records]] and six other investors. The sponsors acquired the motion picture rights by placing a down payment of $500, with the ultimate cost rising to a maximum of $650,000 based on a percentage of ticket sales for each of the show's profitable weeks.&lt;!-- What does this last sentence mean?  It hardly seems relevant to the musical. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Zolotow|Zolotow, Sam]].

Accessed October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before its Broadway opening, the show was presented for three weeks in [[Philadelphia]] and half a week in [[Boston]]. While ''Kelly'' was in tryouts, roles played by [[Ella Logan]], [[Jack Creley]], and [[Avery Schreiber]] were cut by show doctors Leonard Stern and [[Mel Brooks]].&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt; Pre-Broadway promotion for the show included an event on the Brooklyn Bridge with a series of chorus girls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/10/26/archives/city-lends-the-brooklyn-bridge-to-show-girls-and-press-agent.html "City Lends the Brooklyn Bridge to Show Girls and Press Agent"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 28, 1964, accessed October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Directed and choreographed by [[Herbert Ross]], the musical began previews at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] on February 1, 1965 and opened (and closed) on February 6 after seven previews and one performance. The cast included [[Wilfrid Brambell]], [[Don Francks]], [[Anita Gillette]], [[Mickey Shaughnessy]], [[Eileen Rodgers]], and [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]]. Scenic design was by [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]], costume design by [[Freddy Wittop]], and lighting design by [[Tharon Musser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3225 ''Kelly'' at the Internet Broadway Database]&lt;/ref&gt;  The show's logo, which featured on posters and playbills (and, much later, on the LP and CD covers) was designed by French-born illustrator [[Tomi Ungerer]], who was then (and remains) best known for his children's picture books.

Industry representatives quoted in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated they "could not recall any other Broadway musical representing such a comparable expenditure that became a casualty so quickly." Costs had ballooned to $650,000, with the biggest loser being Levine, followed by Melnick and Susskind, who had invested a total of $150,000. There had been increasing arguments between the producers and writers, with Susskind complaining that the authors were unwilling to make changes per the recommendations of the investors. Charlap and Lawrence were so upset with changes that they filed suit in [[New York Supreme Court]] seeking an injunction to prevent the play from opening.  While the judge urged that the parties pursue arbitration, lawyers representing Charlap and Lawrence were threatening to sue for damages that had been caused through "unauthorized changes, omissions and additions" made to the musical.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotow, Sam.

Levine Principal Loser on Musical"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 9, 1965. Accessed October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''The New York Times'', critic [[Howard Taubman]] opened by noting that "Ella Logan was written out of ''Kelly'' before it reached the Broadhurst Theater Saturday night.  Congratulations, Miss Logan," and continued to describe what he saw as a production for which there were "ample critical, if not legal, grounds for an injunction," lampooning the legal wrangling that had gone on about the production.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Taubman|Taubman, Howard]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/1965/02/08/archives/theater-kelly-opens-at-broadhurst-musical-comedy-about-old-new-york.html "Theater: 'Kelly' Opens at Broadhurst; Musical Comedy About Old New York"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 8, 1965. Accessed October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The play's brief life was later described by Melnick's son as "not his [father's] favorite moment in history," but nonetheless one he wore with grace.&lt;ref name=Melnick&gt;Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/movies/17melnick.html "Daniel Melnick, Hollywood Producer, Dies at 77"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 16, 2009. October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, there were reports of an off-Broadway revival of the show, to be produced by David Rubinson of Columbia Records.  This was intended to present the show in its original form, as conceived by Lawrence and Charlap, as opposed to the much-revised and re-written version that finally opened on Broadway.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1980"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
In 1880s New York, teenage busboy Hop Kelly, an Irish immigrant, is a sentimental daredevil who wants to make a successful jump from the Brooklyn Bridge and become a hero. He has chickened out of three attempts already.  A group of Bowery gamblers are betting against him surviving the jump, and they don't like the suspense.  They decide to throw a dummy off the bridge in his place, but Hop really wants to make the jump, and eventually he successfully does so.

==Original recordings==
Although Columbia Records were one of the show's original backers, no cast album was ever commercially recorded.  As was typical at the time,  a demonstration recording of the show's score was recorded by its composer and lyricist/librettist at an early stage in its inception.  Produced by Frank Military in 1964, the recording was performed by Charlap and Lawrence themselves, and included thirteen songs from the score.  Because the show subsequently underwent considerable revision, this demo recording included several songs that were eventually cut from the show, or otherwise went unused in the produced version.

The demo recording, which was only ever intended as a limited edition for private circulation amongst potential backers and so on, was finally commercially released in 1980, fifteen years after the showed closed.  The LP, simply entitled ''Eddie Lawrence and Moose Charlap sing their songs from the Musical Kelly'' formed part of a series of albums on the [[Original Cast (record label)|Original Cast]] label, founded in 1975 by Bruce Yeko and Doris Chu Yeko, which specialised in obscure musical theatre recordings.  The album's executive producers were the Yekos and Eddie Lawrence.  It was dedicated to the memory of Moose Charlap, who died in 1974.

Moose Charlap's wife, Sandy Stewart, who was a cabaret and jazz vocalist, released her own pop version of the song "Never Go There Anymore" in 1965, with a lush arrangement by [[Don Costa]].  The song subsequently become something of a standard.  In 2000, it was described by [[Stephen Sondheim]] as one of the songs that he wishes that he'd written, at least in part.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank. [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000312mag-sondheim.html "Conversations With Sondheim"], ''The New York Times Magazine'', March 12, 2000, accessed December 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concert recording==
In 1998, the York Theatre Company in New York City presented a concert version of ''Kelly'' as part of its "musicals in mufti" series spotlighting neglected Broadway scores. Performers included [[Brian D'Arcy James]], [[Jane Connell]], [[George S. Irving]], [[John Schuck]], [[Marcia Lewis]], and Sandy Stewart, who was in the original production. Interest in the concert among theatre buffs resulted in sold-out performances and a cast recording.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/flops3.htm#Kelly "Flops on CD: I to M"], Musicals101.com, 2003, accessed December 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The concert recording was released by Original Cast records, the same label that had released the demo recording in 1980.  Eddie Lawrence was credited as 'artistic director', and Sandy Stewart as 'musical advisor'.  This recording, which reflected the original score before all the revisions took place on the road, included a number of songs were later cut from the show or had not otherwise been used in the Broadway production.  It also included, as a bonus track, Sandy Stewart's 1965 pop version of the song "Never Go There Anymore."

According to the NCIS website,&lt;blockquote&gt;The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) launched the Law Enforcement Information Exchange (LInX) initiative in 2003.  LInX is designed to enhance information sharing between local, state, and federal law enforcement in areas of strategic importance to the Department of the Navy.

The development of the [[steam engine]] propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the world. The steam engine was created to [[pump]] water from [[coal mine]]s, enabling them to be deepened beyond [[groundwater]] levels.]]

The term '''revolution''' is used to denote trends which have resulted in great social changes outside the political sphere, such as changes in mores, culture, philosophy or technology. Many have been global, while others have been limited to single countries. Such revolutions include:

* The Agricultural Revolutions, which include:
** The [[Neolithic Revolution]] (perhaps 13000 years ago), which formed the basis for human civilization to develop. It is commonly referred to as the 'First Agricultural Revolution'.
** The [[Green Revolution]] (1945&amp;ndash;): The use of industrial fertilizers and new crops greatly increased the world's agricultural output. It is commonly referred to as the 'Second Agricultural Revolution'.
** The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] (18th century), which spurred urbanisation and consequently helped launch the [[Industrial Revolution]].
** The [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution]] (18th century), which led to the [[Lowland Clearances]].
* The [[Commercial Revolution]]: A period of European economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and [[mercantilism]] which lasted  from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century.
* The [[Counterculture of the 1960s]] (approximately 1960&amp;ndash;1973) was a social revolution that originated in the United States and United Kingdom, and eventually spread to other western nations. The themes of this movement included the [[anti-war movement]], civil rights for African-Americans, rebellion against conservative norms, drug use, and the [[sexual revolution]] (see below).
** The [[Sexual revolution]]: A change in sexual morality and sexual behavior throughout the Western world, mainly during the 1960s and 1970s.
* The Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]]: A struggle for power within the [[Communist Party of China]], which grew to include large sections of Chinese society and eventually brought the People's Republic of China to the brink of civil war, and which lasted from 1966 to 1976.
* The Iranian [[Cultural Revolution]]: A struggle for power within Iran after the return to Tehran February 1, 1979 of Ayatolla Khomeini after a 15-year exile, who was declared ruler for life in December of the same year, and which lasted from 1980 to 1983.
* The [[Digital Revolution]]: The sweeping changes brought about by [[computing]] and [[communication technology]], starting from circa 1950 with the creation of the first general-purpose [[electronic computer]]s.
* The [[Industrial Revolution]]: The major shift of technological, socioeconomic and cultural conditions in the late 18th century and early 19th century that began in Britain and spread throughout the world.
** The [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (1871–1914).
* The [[Price revolution]]: A series of economic events from the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th, the price revolution refers most specifically to the high rate of inflation that characterized the period across [[Western Europe]].
* The [[Quiet Revolution]]: A period of rapid change in [[Quebec]], Canada, in the 1960s. This leads to the separatist movement for Quebec sovereignty and two referendums.
* The [[Scientific revolution]]: A fundamental transformation in scientific ideas around the 16th century.
* The [[Upper Paleolithic Revolution]]: The emergence of "high culture", new technologies and regionally distinct cultures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7274">This is a '''list of notable people assassinated by the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]]''' (JVP). JVP is a Sri Lankan [[Marxist-Leninist]], [[communist]] party which was involved in two armed uprisings against the ruling governments in 1971 (SLFP) and 1987–89 (UNP). Later it entered democratic politics by participating in the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 1994|1994 parliamentary election]].

The failure or fracture of a product or component as a result of a single event is known as '''mechanical overload'''. It is a common [[failure mode]], and may be contrasted with [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], [[rupture (engineering)|rupture]], or [[stress relaxation]]. The terms are used in [[forensic engineering]] and [[structural engineering]] when analysing product failure. Failure may occur because either the product is weaker than expected owing to a [[stress concentration]], or the applied load is greater than expected and exceeds the normal [[tensile strength]], [[shear strength]] or [[compressive strength]] of the product.

==Examples==
{{Mechanical_failure_modes}}

Examples include the many components which fail in [[car crash]]es, [[train crash]]es, and [[airplane crash]]es as a result of [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] loading. The problem for the investigator is to determine which failures have been caused by the crash, and which may have caused the crash. It usually involves examining the broken parts for signs of [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] crack growth or other damage to the part which cannot be attributed to the crash itself. For very large [[structural failure]]s such as the collapse of bridges, it is necessarily a long and tedious process of sifting through the broken parts.

'''Morris Richard Jeppson''' (June 23, 1922 &amp;ndash; March 30, 2010) was a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. He served as assistant weaponeer on the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', which dropped the first [[atomic bomb]] on the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|city of Hiroshima]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] on August 6, 1945.

==Early life==
Jeppson was born in [[Logan, Utah]], and studied physics at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]]. After enlisting in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in 1942 at the age of 19 and basic training in [[Florida]], he received electrical engineering training at [[Yale University]], [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. He then worked on bomb firing mechanisms with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] scientists at [[Wendover Air Force Base]], Utah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hofferthistoryclass.com/Mr._Hofferts_Class_Website/Morris_Jeppson.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  Mr Hofferts Class. Retrieved 28 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hiroshima mission==
Second Lieutenant Jeppson, along with then [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[William Sterling Parsons|William "Deak" Parsons]] of the U.S. Navy were responsible for arming the atomic bomb "[[Little Boy]]" on the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bomber during the flight from [[Tinian]] to Japan. The bomb was protected from premature in-flight detonation by inserting three safety plugs into the electrical connection from its internal battery to the firing mechanism. This was designed to prevent a firing voltage from reaching the mechanism. Each plug was about the size and shape of a car cigarette lighter (approximately three inches in length), with a green cap for the safety plug and a red cap for the arming plug. Jeppson's role was to climb into the bomb bay and remove the three green safety plugs from the bomb and to replace them with the three red plugs just before the aircraft climbed to high altitude close the target area, a job that later caused controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hiroshima: BBC History of World War II]], [[BBC]] Television/Tokyo Broadcasting Inc/Discovery Channel 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and career==
In September 1945, Jeppson was awarded the [[Silver Star]] in recognition of his service to his country. During the 1950s he worked as a scientist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[California]] developing hydrogen [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Later in his career, he helped develop several key technological breakthroughs including [[microwave]] technology as well as stabilizers used on helicopters. After retiring from his work as a physicist, Jeppson lived in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with his second wife Mollie.

[[File:Jeppson Tibbets Van Kirk.jpg|thumbnail|300px|left|Left to right: Morris Jeppson, Colonel [[Paul Tibbets]], [[Theodore Van Kirk]] at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F Udvar-Hazy Center on October 23, 2004]]

For many years, Jeppson refused to speak publicly about the Hiroshima mission for fear of reprisal against himself and his family. Starting in 1985, he became more willing to speak about it. On the 40th anniversary of the dropping of the bomb, Jeppson granted an interview and recounted his part in the mission.

In June 2002, a controversy over the sale of a set of safety plugs Jeppson had kept since the mission occurred. After the mission Jeppson had kept one of each in his possession. The plugs were offered for sale in an auction, however the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] tried to halt the sale, claiming they were classified secret material. [[United States District Court|U.S. District Court]] Judge Susan Illston rejected the claim by the government clearing the way for the sale. The plugs were eventually sold to retired physicist Clay Perkins for $167,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2046382.stm Hiroshima bomb parts cleared for sale], June 15, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A reunion for the 60th anniversary in 2005 which was supposed to take place on the island of [[Guam]] had been in the planning stages, but never materialized. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' Magazine]] published an in-depth issue commemorating the 60th anniversary of the dropping of the bombs on Japan.  Jeppson and other crew members gave accounts of their experiences. Jeppson also gave an account of his role in the mission in the BBC drama documentary ''[[Hiroshima: BBC History of World War II|Hiroshima]]'' in 2005 and his removal of the safety plugs was portrayed by an actor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hiroshima: BBC History of World War II]], [[BBC]] Television/Tokyo Broadcasting Inc/Discovery Channel 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Jeppson died on March 30, 2010 in Las Vegas. He is survived by his wife, brother, three children, five grandchildren and three great grandchildren. With Jeppson's death, [[Theodore Van Kirk]] became the last surviving ''Enola Gay'' crew member (Van Kirk died on July 28, 2014).

== Discovery of the body ==
Regeni's mutilated and half-naked [[Cadaver|corpse]] was found in a ditch alongside the [[Cairo–Alexandria desert road|Cairo-Alexandria highway]] on the outskirts of [[Cairo]] on February 3, 2016. His recovered body showed signs of extreme torture: [[contusion]]s and [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]]s all over from a severe beating; extensive bruising from kicks, punches, and assault with a stick; more than two dozen bone fractures, among them seven broken ribs, all fingers and toes, as well as legs, arms, and shoulder blades; multiple stab wounds on the body including the soles of the feet, possibly from an ice pick or [[wikt:awl|awl]]-like instrument; numerous cuts over the entire body made with a sharp instrument suspected to be a razor; extensive cigarette burns; a larger burn mark between the shoulder blades made with a hard and hot object; a brain hemorrhage; and a broken cervical vertebra, which ultimately caused death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/24019/giulio-regeni_scattered-facts |title=Giulio Regeni: Scattered Facts |author1=Ahmed Ragab |author2=Mustafa al-Marsafawi |date=7 March 2016 |publisher=[[Jadaliyya]] |access-date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/04/europe/italian-student-dead-in-egypt/index.html |title=Italian student who went missing in Cairo found battered and dead |author1= Greg Botelho |author2=Sarah Sirgany |date=4 February 2016 |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
Italian and Egyptian officials conducted separate autopsies on Regeni's corpse with an Egyptian forensic official reporting on March 1, 2016, that he was interrogated and tortured for up to seven days at intervals of 10{{ndash}}14 hours before he was finally killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Italian killed in Egypt was interrogated for days - forensics expert|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-italian-interrogation-exclusive-idUSKCN0W33ZU|newspaper = Reuters|date = 1 March 2016|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian autopsy findings have still not been made public. A 300-page report of the Italian autopsy findings has been handed over to the public prosecutor's office in Rome and denies earlier reports of signs of electric shocks administered to Regeni's genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Nuove torture e vecchie bugie.

On March 24, 2016, Egyptian police killed in a shoot out four men who were allegedly responsible for kidnapping Regeni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Egyptian police claim to shoot dead gang that killed Giulio Regeni|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/25/egypt-police-shoot-dead-suspects-giulio-regeni|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|date = 25 March 2016|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Facebook post from the official page of the Ministry of the Interior,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MoiEgy/posts/1056819944361668:0|title=الصفحة الرسمية لوزارة الداخلية|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the gang specialized in kidnapping foreigners and stealing their money. In a raid on the flat of one of the gang members, the Egyptian police claim they found various items that belonged to Regeni including his passport and student photo IDs. However, witnesses told [[Declan Walsh (journalist)|Declan Walsh]] and other journalists that the "gang" members had been executed, not shot while riding in the van: "One was shot as he ran, his corpse later positioned inside the van". Their link to Regeni was also suspect: "Italian investigators used phone records to show that the supposed gang leader, Tarek Abdel Fattah, was 60 miles north of Cairo the day he supposedly kidnapped Regeni", according to Declan Walsh.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The New Cairo prosecutor's office later denied that the criminal gang was involved in his murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Egypt Prosecutor Says Killed ‘Gang Members’ and Giulio Regeni ‘Not Connected’|url = http://egyptianstreets.com/2016/03/24/egypt-prosecutor-says-killed-gang-members-and-giulio-regeni-not-connected/|newspaper = Egyptian Streets|date = 24 March 2016|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regeni's passport and the other documents were handed over to Italian prosecutors on November 1, same year, during a "positive" meeting in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Egypt hands over Regeni documents (2) |url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2016/11/02/egypt-hands-over-regeni-documents-2_0bcd05ee-fd03-4e88-b0ee-7c56fa05d963.html |newspaper=ANSA |location=Rome |date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2016, Italian news agency [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] reported that Regeni's tutors at Cambridge University had declined to collaborate with the inquest into his murder, to the disappointment of investigators and Regeni's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Regeni family disappointed by Cambridge teachers|url = http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/06/08/regeni-family-disappointed-by-cambridge-teachers-3_bd6cc3d4-2ad4-494a-9b59-deed577ebc87.html|newspaper = ANSA|date = 8 June 2016|access-date = 2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had been anticipated by coverage in the Italian weekly ''[[L'Espresso]]'' on June 7, 2016, which reported that Regeni's tutor Maha Abdelrahman had followed advice from University lawyers not to collaborate with the inquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Caso Regeni, anche la facoltà di Cambridge sceglie di non collaborare alle indagini|url = http://espresso.repubblica.it/inchieste/2016/06/07/news/caso-regeni-anche-la-facolta-di-cambridge-sceglie-di-non-collaborare-1.269973|newspaper = [[L'Espresso]]|date = 7 June 2016|access-date = 2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Cambridge strongly rejected the claims in a statement released to Varsity, the Cambridge student newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/10457|title=Exclusive: Cambridge University ‘fully committed’ to assisting Giulio Regeni investigation|website=Varsity.co.uk|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations against the Egyptian government==
Due to Regeni's research activities and left-wing political leanings, the Egyptian police is strongly suspected of involvement in his murder in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspicion falls on Egypt's security forces after the violent death of a young Egyptian |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21693171-egyptian-authorities-show-little-appetite-solve-case-murdered|accessdate=18 February 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Egypt's media and government deny this, alleging secret undercover agents belonging to the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt]] carried out the crime in order to embarrass the Egyptian government and destabilize relations between Italy and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt: Italian's killers may have had criminal or revenge motive|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35650418|accessdate=25 February 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt: Egypt president suggests his political enemies murdered Italian student|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/16/egypt-president-political-enemies-murdered-italian-student-abdel-fatah-al-sisi-giulio-regeni|accessdate=20 March 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2016, Reuters reported three Egyptian intelligence officials and three police sources independently claiming Regeni was in police custody at some time before his death. According to these sources he was picked up by plainclothes police officers near Gamal Abdel Nasser metro station together with another Egyptian man on the evening of January 25. Both men were then taken in a white minibus with police license plates to Izbakiya police station in downtown Cairo.&lt;ref name="reuters-21april2016"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-regeni-exclusive-idUKKCN0XI1YU|title=Exclusive: Egyptian police detained Italian student before his murder - sources| editor1=Simon Robinson |editor2=Sara Ledwith |date=21 April 2016 |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadowing foreigners was later dismissed by a Homeland Security official and the Interior Ministry as day-to-day work bearing no implications,&lt;ref name="reuters-21april2016"/&gt; and Egyptian general prosecutor Nabeel Sadek confirmed that Cairo police had received a report on Giulio Regeni on January 7, 2016,&lt;ref name="reuters-9sep2016"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-regeni-italy-idUSKCN11F28B |title=Egyptian union head reported Italian student to police before murder| author=Steve Scherer |date=9 September 2016 |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Egyptian [[National Security Agency (Egypt)|National Security Agency]] had been monitoring Regeni.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On December 7, 2016, a joint statement of Egyptian and Italian prosecutors, released following a two-day summit in Rome, stated that Egyptian prosecutors had questioned the policemen who investigated Regeni's death in January, as well as those who killed the four gang members in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Egypt police questioned as part of Regeni probe |date=December 8, 2016 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2016/12/8/egypt-police-questioned-as-part-of-regeni-probe |journal=TheNewArab |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2017, journalist [[Declan Walsh (journalist)|Declan Walsh]] collected in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article the statement of an anonymous [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration official who revealed that, in the weeks after Regeni's death, the United States acquired "explosive proof that Egyptian security officials had abducted, tortured and killed Regeni" and that "Egypt's leadership was fully aware of the [death] circumstances".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite article|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/magazine/giulio-regeni-italian-graduate-student-tortured-murdered-egypt.html|title=Why Was an Italian Graduate Student Tortured and Murdered in Egypt?|author=[[Declan Walsh (journalist)|Declan Walsh]]|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Walsh writes that Italian investigators working in Egypt "were hindered at every turn. Witnesses appeared to have been coached. Surveillance footage from the subway station near Regeni’s apartment had been deleted; requests for metadata from millions of phone calls were refused on the grounds that it would compromise the constitutional rights of Egyptian citizens."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the article, the Italian government denied that the Americans provided any actionable proof;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2017/08/16/no-explosive-evidence-on-regeni-3_f273bc33-07f9-4a55-b9f9-f10c2352a2c6.html |work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|title=No 'explosive' evidence on Regeni (3) |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agenzia informazioni e sicurezza esterna|AISE]] told the hint from the USA was of little benefit, since it came when the autopsy and investigation had already persuaded Italian investigators of Egypt's involvement, and Americans refused to reveal anything more specific, like names of involved people or institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2017/08/18/regeni-e-la-pista-degli-007-gli-usa-ci-informarono-ma-noi-sapevamo-gia08.html|author=Carlo Bonini, Giuliano Foschini|title=Regeni e la pista degli 007.

On December 21, 2017, the Italian investigators led by Giuseppe Pignatone flew to Cairo to meet the Egyptian prosecutor Nabel Sadek and his team. The Egyptian team submitted new reports, including the progress on the recovery of surveillance cameras footage. The Italians had carefully examined and cross linked all the evidence available to them until then, and provided a detailed explanation for the facts.

For kidnapping, they reiterated and pinpointed the allegations against major Magdi Ibrqaim Abdlaal Sharif, captain Osan Helmy, and three other people of Egyptian National Security Agency. For red herring, which included the killings on March 24, 2016, they blamed captain Mahmud Hendy and other people of the local police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-12/22/c_136843650.htm |author=Yan |title=Egypt's prosecution provides Rome with investigation reports on Italian national's murder |date=December 22, 2017 |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|新華社]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20171222/egypt-submits-new-evidence-in-giulio-regeni-murder-investigation |title=Egypt submits new evidence in Giulio Regeni murder investigation |date=December 22, 2017 |publisher=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |url=http://www.corriere.it/esteri/17_dicembre_22/giulio-regeni-nuova-verita-inquirenti-fu-pedinato-fino-sua-scomparsa-10-egiziani-coinvolti-a6f0eaa8-e6e1-11e7-9bc3-c44cfbe0d3dd.shtml |author=Giovanni Bianconi|authorlink=Giovanni Bianconi (journalist) |title=Giulio Regeni, la nuova verità degli inquirenti: fu pedinato fino alla sua scomparsa, 10 egiziani coinvolti |date=December 22, 2017 |language=Italian |trans-title= Giulio Regeni: new prosecutors' statement: he was being tailed until disappearance, 10 Egyptians involved |publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/2017/12/21/news/caso-regeni-la-procura-di-roma-consegna-agli-egiziani-i-nomi-dei-responsabili-del-sequestro-1.316337 |author=Floriana Bulfon |title=Caso Regeni, la procura di Roma consegna agli egiziani i nomi dei responsabili del sequestro |date=December 21, 2017 |language=Italian |trans-title=Regeni case, Roman prosecutor hands the guilty parties' names to the Egyptians |publisher=[[L'espresso]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2016, the [[European Parliament]] in Strasbourg passed a motion for a resolution condemning the torture and killing of Giulio Regeni and the ongoing human rights abuses of the [[al-Sisi]] government in Egypt. The resolution was passed with an overwhelming majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = European parliament condemns killing of Giulio Regeni in Egypt|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/european-parliament-condemns-killing-of-giulio-regeni-in-egypt|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|date = 10 March 2016|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Italy recalled its ambassador to Egypt due to a lack of co-operation, during the investigation, from the Egyptian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When Egypt investigates tragedy, don’t expect results|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21699716-tourism-dependent-nation-rarely-provides-clarity-cases-murdered|accessdate=31 May 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Italian weekly magazine ''[[L'Espresso]]'' set up a secure platform based on [[GlobaLeaks]] technology to collect testimonials about torture and human rights abuse from Egyptian whistleblowers – and to seek justice for Giulio Regeni and for every Regeni in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/inchieste/2016/05/10/news/regenileaks-exposing-the-lies-of-al-sisi-s-regime-1.264699 |title=RegeniLeaks, exposing the lies of al Sisi's regime |author=Marco Pratellesi |date=16 May 2016 |work=[[L'Espresso]] |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Film Festival for Talented Youth''' ('''NFFTY'''- pronounced nifty), held annually in Seattle, Washington, showcases work by filmmakers 24 and under from across the U.S. and the world.  It was created in 2007 with the goal of becoming the most influential youth-oriented film festival in North America. The festival includes film screenings, filmmaking workshops and panels, concerts by youth bands, and a gala opening night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nffty.org/PR_031608_NFFTY_08.pdf|title=Young Filmmaker Festival Coming to Seattle March 28–30|date=March 1, 2008|publisher=NFFTY|accessdate=2009-01-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===2007===
The National Film Festival for Talented Youth (NFFTY) and its non-profit parent organization, The Talented Youth, were founded by Jesse Harris, Jocelyn R.C., and Kyle Seago.  Harris wrote and directed the feature film "Living Life" when he was 17, which obtained theatrical and television distribution. This resulted in young filmmakers around the globe seeking his advice including R.C., who expressed her interest in helping to form a creative youth organization. Harris and R.C. teamed up with Seago, establishing the non-profit and holding a one night "Kick Off" festival April 26, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Nifty' youth film fest sees phenomenal growth|last=Chansanchai|first=Athima|date=March 27, 2008|work=The Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
NFFTY was expanded to a three-day festival.  NFFTY Earth, a campaign to promote the power of film to bring positive changes to the environment and support social justice and encourage peace and partnership with other countries, was added to festival programming.  Year round young artist and community education activities were added through the program NFFTY 365.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nffty.org/programs.html |title=Other Programs |publisher=NFFTY |accessdate=2008-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120032312/http://www.nffty.org/programs.html |archivedate=January 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFFTY 2008 included 73 film screenings, 9 industry panels and workshops over a three-day period.  There were 1,800 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nffty.org/2008.html |title=NFFTY 2008 Festival |publisher=NFFTY |accessdate=2008-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120034219/http://www.nffty.org/2008.html |archivedate=January 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one film screened at the event, "March Point", received wider distribution through PBS.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Svete|first=Irene|date=April 18, 2008|title=Tomorrow’s Spielbergs get a film festival of their own|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0418/p12s06-almo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
NFFTY continued as a three-day festival, increasing its screenings from 73 to 113, including international entries for the first time. As part of its NFFTY Earth Campaign, NFFTY 2009 was certified as a carbon neutral event by carbonfund.org. A NFFTY Earth Benefit CD was produced, featuring 13 new songs from contemporary youth bands.

===Allonyms and pseudonyms===

Since 1996 Turovsky has signed his musical works as ''Sautscheck'', a German [[transliteration]] of the second part of his surname as an [[allonym]]. Turovsky used a variety of  constructions, such as Joachim Peter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicaviva.com/encyclopedia/display.html?phrase=sautscheck-joachim-peter Musica Viva Encyclopedia: Sautscheck, Joachim Peter]. Musicaviva.com. Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Joachim, and Konradin Aemilius, for first names attached to Sautscheck.  He represented the works as newly discovered manuscripts by supposed 17th-, 18th- and 19th-century composers from several generations of the same family.

His works for lute achieved wide circulation under the [[allonym]] of Sautscheck and the pseudonyms "Ioannes Leopolita" and "Jacobus Olevsiensis".  Musicologist [[Douglas Alton Smith]] perceived these works as malicious [[hoax]]es and forgeries because of their ostensibly [[baroque]] or earlier styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serenestudios.co.uk/articles/musical_crimes "Musical Crimes: Forgery, Deceit, and Socio-Hermeneutics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918235901/http://www.serenestudios.co.uk/articles/musical_crimes |date=18 September 2008 }}, Serene Studios, accessed 13 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The controversy in 2000 over what some considered an outright hoax led to coinage of a new German word, ''Sautscheckerei'', which denoted a musical or literary hoax.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forumdaily.com/muzykalnye-mistifikacii/&lt;/ref&gt;

Turovsky published ''Mikrokosmos'', a collection of nearly 600 [[Renaissance]]-styled pieces based on Ukrainian folk melodies under the pseudonyms "Ioannes Leopolita" and "Jacobus Olevsiensis".

==Literary activities==

Turovsky's poetry translations (from Russian, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and other languages) have appeared in the literary almanacs [[Cardinal Points]],&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal Points, vol.7 (September 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Germ'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://germspot.blogspot.com/2005/04/germ-67.html The Germ: Germ #6/7]. Germspot.blogspot.com (18 May 2005). Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and various web publications.

He also undertook research into the history of [[Torban]], a Ukrainian [[musical instrument]] of the [[lute]] family, and wrote the chapter on it for the 2011 edition of "Die Laute in Europa".&lt;ref&gt;"Geluit-Luthinerie" (The Belgian Lute Society Journal) No.&amp;nbsp;54, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Die Laute in Europa 2" A.Schlegel &amp; J.Lüdtke&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sergeant York''''' is a 1941 American biographical film about the life of [[Alvin York]], one of the most-decorated American soldiers of [[World War I]]. It was directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and was the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;FILM MONEY-MAKERS SELECTED BY VARIETY: ' Sergeant York' Top Picture, Gary Cooper Leading Star, New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 31 Dec 1941: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was based on the diary of Sergeant Alvin York, as edited by [[Tom Skeyhill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:43758~T1 |title=Sergeant York Review |publisher=[[Allmovie]] |accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted by Harry Chandlee, Abem Finkel, [[John Huston]], [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard E. Koch]], and Sam Cowan (uncredited).  York refused, several times, to authorize a film version of his life story, but finally yielded to persistent efforts in order to finance the creation of an interdenominational Bible school.  The story that York insisted on [[Gary Cooper]] for the title role derives from the fact that producer Jesse L. Lasky recruited Cooper by writing a plea that he accept the role and then signed York's name to the telegram.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Lee, ''Sergeant York: An American Hero'' (Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 1985), 105ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal. The film also won for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and was nominated in nine other categories, including Best Picture, Director (Hawks), Supporting Actor ([[Walter Brennan]]), and Supporting Actress ([[Margaret Wycherly]]). The [[American Film Institute]] ranked the film 57th in the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers|its 100 most inspirational American movies]]. It also rated Alvin York 35th in its list of the top [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains|50 heroes in American cinema]].

In 2008, ''Sergeant York'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
Alvin York, a poor young farmer from the rural area near [[Pall Mall, Tennessee]], lives a hardscrabble existence in a community whose poverty and isolation leave them with a lifestyle hardly different from people of a century earlier. He is an exceptional marksman, but a ne'er-do-well prone to drinking and fighting, which does not make things any easier for his long-suffering, widowed mother. 

Alvin's farm is on rocky land high in the mountains, which barely supports him and his siblings. He meets a sweet-natured local girl, Gracie Williams, and works night and day at strenuous odd jobs to accumulate the payment for a fertile "bottomland" farm so she'll marry him.  The owner, Tomkins, gives Alvin sixty days to raise the purchase price. On the day the last payment is due, Alvin wins the final needed amount at a target-shooting contest, but discovers Tomkins has reneged and sold the farm to Alvin's romantic rival, Zeb Andrews, keeping all of the partial payments Alvin had made. Alvin drinks heavily and swears revenge.
 
That night, en route to attack Tomkins and Andrews, the rifle Alvin is holding is struck by lightning, splitting the barrel in two and knocking him off his mule. Similar to [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|the biblical conversion of Paul]], York survives the lightning strike and undergoes a religious awakening when he joins a revival meeting at the nearby church, vowing never to get drunk or angry again.  He makes amends with the men who cheated him out of the land, while Gracie points out that her love is tied to him and not the bottomland.

When the U.S. enters [[World War I]] and York is drafted into the army, he tries to avoid induction into the Army as a [[conscientious objection|conscientious objector]], but is denied since his church has no official standing. He reluctantly reports to [[Fort Gordon|Camp Gordon]] for [[basic training]], where he is harassed because of his objector status, but his superiors eventually discover that he is a phenomenal marksman and decide to promote him to [[Corporal#United States|corporal]].

York still wants nothing to do with the Army and killing. Major [[G. Edward Buxton Jr.|Buxton]], his sympathetic commanding officer, tries to change York's mind, citing sacrifices made by others throughout the history of the United States. He gives York a leave to go home and think it over. He promises York a recommendation for his exemption as a conscientious objector if York remains unconvinced.

While York is fasting and pondering, the wind blows his Bible open to the verse "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." York reports back for duty and tells his superiors that he can serve his country, despite not having everything figured out to his satisfaction, leaving the matter in [[God]]'s hands.

His unit is shipped out to Europe and participates in an attack during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]] on October 8, 1918. Pinned down by deadly machine gun fire, the lieutenant orders Sergeant Early to take some men and try to attack the machine gun nests from behind. York suddenly finds himself the last remaining unwounded [[non-commissioned officer]] in the detachment, and is placed in command by Early.

Seeing his comrades being shot down all around him, his self-doubt disappears. He works his way to a position flanking the main enemy trench and, as a sniper, fires individual rifle shots with such devastating effect that the Germans surrender. Then, York forces a captured officer at gunpoint to order the Germans still fighting in another section of the line to also surrender. He and the handful of other survivors end up with 132 prisoners. York becomes a national hero and is awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. When Major Buxton asks him why he did what he did, York explains that he was trying to save the lives of his men.

Arriving in New York City in early 1919, York receives a ticker tape parade and a key to the city.  He is impressed with the [[Waldorf-Astoria hotel]] and its indoor electricity.  Congressman [[Cordell Hull]] guides him through the city and informs him that he has been offered opportunities to commercialize on his fame, all totaling around $250,000 (for context, ${{Inflation|US|0.25|1919|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). York mentions the bottomland he wanted and Hull responds he could buy it with the money. York rejects the offers, however, saying that he was not proud of what he did in the war, but it had to be done, and he will not profit from his fame. He tells Hull he wants to go home. He returns to [[Tennessee]] greeted by Gracie and his family. To his surprise, the people of his home state have bought him the bottomland farm he wanted and built him a house on the land.

==Reception==
''Sergeant York'' was a spectacular success at the box office and became the [[1941 in film|highest-grossing film of 1941]]. It remains one of the highest-grossing films of all time when adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm All Time Box Office Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation.] [[Box Office Mojo]]. Retrieved February 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It benefited from the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], which occurred while the film played in theaters. The film's patriotic theme helped recruit soldiers; young men sometimes went directly from the movie theater to military enlistment offices.&lt;ref name="kennett1985"&gt;{{cite book | title=For the duration... : the United States goes to war, Pearl Harbor-1942 | publisher=Scribner | author=Kennett, Lee | year=1985 | location=New York | isbn=0-684-18239-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|156–157}}  After its initial release, the film was frequently re-shown at theaters all over America during the war as a quick replacement for box office flops and as a theme program for bond sales and scrap drives.

At the [[14th Academy Awards]], the film won two Oscars:&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/43758/Sergeant-York/details |title=NY Times: Sergeant York |accessdate= 2008-12-14| work= NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swedish Touring Car Championship''' (STCC) was a [[touring car racing]] series based in [[Sweden]], but also with rounds in [[Norway]]. They began operating in 1996, heavily influenced by the [[British Touring Car Championship]] and the success of BTCC racing on Swedish television. There are also a number of support classes that compete with their races alongside STCC; [[Radical Sportscars|Radical]], the [[Camaro Cup]], [[Superkart]], Pro Superbike, the JTCC and the [[Porsche Carrera Cup Scandinavia]]. The final STCC season was in 2010, as the series merged with the [[Danish Touringcar Championship]] to form the [[Scandinavian Touring Car Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!-- Author Start --&gt;By Johan Meissner&lt;!-- Author End --&gt; |url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/news.php?id=5119 |title=DTC: New regulations confirmed for Scandinavian TC in 2012 |publisher=TouringCarTimes |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2010-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323232532/http://www.touringcartimes.com/news.php?id=5119 |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The cars are built according to the Super 2000 rules used in the [[FIA]] WTCC. A national counterpart, N2000, also exists to encourage teams to build their own cars without having to have them homologated by FIA. So far [[Audi]], [[Volvo]], [[Opel]], and [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes]] have constructed their own cars.

'''Points System''' (as of 2006)
{| class="wikitable"
! Position || 1st || 2nd || 3rd || 4th || 5th || 6th || 7th || 8th
|-
! Points || 10 || 8 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1
|}

'''Qualifying &amp; Race'''&lt;br&gt;
Every racing weekend consist of the following:
* '''Qualifying''': First, a 20-minute qualifying session open to all drivers is run. The eight fastest drivers in the 20 minute session go on to drive in the Super pole. Drivers from 9th quickest and backwards start in the qualifying order for the first race. The grid for the second race is reversed results of top eight from the results of the first race. The cars behind top eight start in the position they finished in race one.
* '''Super Pole''': Super pole is a one-lap shootout for the first eight grid positions of race one. The driver with the 8th fastest qualifying time is the first to run a Super Pole lap. Each of the remaining seven drivers run their Super Pole lap in order of slowest to fastest.  In the end, the driver with the fastest Super Pole lap starts the race from pole, or first, position.
* '''Race''': There are two races in a race weekend and each race is approximately 20 minutes in length. All races start using a rolling start.

==TV Coverage==
STCC was first aired in 1997 on [[Sveriges Television|SVT]], featured in the program called "Race" along with the [[British Touring Car Championship]]. BTCC was dropped by SVT at the end of the 1999 season and was replaced by [[Champ Car|CART]], while STCC stayed. When BTCC, which had been the main focus of Race, was dropped, STCC was upgraded to be the series which the program had its focus on. Previously when BTCC and STCC clashed, the STCC races were shown in-between the two BTCC races. This was changed for the 2000 season, and now CART was shown in-between the two STCC races. In 2002 VEIDEC Trophy, a motorcycle class that raced on the STCC-weekends, replaced CART on the program. All Race programs were either 30 or 45 minutes in length, depending on if one or two series were featured.&lt;br&gt;
In 2003 STCC coverage moved from SVT to [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]]. The program was now shown on TV4 Plus, a channel which not everyone had access to (at the time only SVT1, SVT2 and TV4 was available to all viewers for free). TV4 only kept STCC for a year, selling it to [[TV3 (Viasat)|TV3]]. The races appeared again in a highligts format on TV3 during 2004, but in 2005 the coverage was extended to include several hours of live coverage from each race weekend on the TV3-owned sports channel Viasat Sport.&lt;br&gt;
In 2006 STCC returned to SVT and Race, again being available to all viewers, but coverage was cut down to only a 30-minute highlight program.
Nowadays the competition is broadcast by another TV3-owned channel, Viasat Motor. 

==Car brands==
The cars competing in the STCC are (as of 2010): [[Alfa Romeo in motorsport|Alfa Romeo]], [[BMW]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Honda]], [[Opel]], [[Peugeot]], [[SEAT|Seat]], [[Volkswagen]] and [[Volvo]].

'''''The Realist''''' was a pioneering [[Humor magazine|magazine]] of "social-political-religious criticism and satire",&lt;ref&gt;Headline of the first issue: "social-political-religious criticism and satire", [http://www.ep.tc/realist/01/index.html ep.tc]&lt;/ref&gt; intended as a hybrid of a grown-ups version of [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] and [[Lyle Stuart]]'s anti-censorship monthly ''The Independent.'' Edited and published by [[Paul Krassner]], and often regarded as a milestone in the American [[underground press|underground]] or [[Counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] press of the mid-20th century, it was a nationally-distributed newsstand publication as early as 1958. Publication was discontinued in 2001.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Realist,+Krassner+call+it+quits-a076638325 Thefreelibrary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
First published in the spring of 1958 in [[New York City]] in the offices of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'',&lt;ref name=burnett/&gt; ''The Realist'' appeared on a fairly regular schedule during the 1960s and then on an irregular schedule after the early 1970s. In 1984, it was revived as a much smaller newsletter. Articles and cartoons from the magazine were collected in a book, ''The Best of the Realist'' (Running Press, 1984). The final issue of ''The Realist'' was #146 (Spring 2001).

''The Realist'' provided a format for extreme satire in its articles, cartoons and Krassner's editorials, but it also carried more traditionally serious material in articles and interviews. The magazine also published political commentary from [[Norman Mailer]], [[Ken Kesey]] and [[Joseph Heller]].&lt;ref name=burnett/&gt;

===Hoaxes and advertising===

====Masquerade Party====
The first hoax directed toward mainstream culture involved the 1960 edition of the NBC show ''[[Masquerade Party]]''.&lt;ref name="DooleyJuly2000"&gt;Michael DooleyJuly (2000) [http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/reflections-on-the-art-of-the-put-on Here Lies Paul Krassner], at ''AIGA Journal of Graphic Design'', vol.18, no. 2, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KrassnerStereoHoax"&gt;Paul Krassner (1960) ''[http://www.ep.tc/realist/18/05.html A Stereophonic Hoax]'', ''The Realist'' n.16 March 1960, pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KrassnerCaseHistory"&gt;Paul Krassner (1960) ''[http://www.ep.tc/realist/18/ Case History Of a TV Hoax]'', ''The Realist'' n.18 June 1960, pp.1, 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, television network executives would react swiftly and fearfully to viewer complaints, no matter how small or unjustified the viewer response.  Testing this premise, angry letters containing no specific complaints at all were sent in response to a particular episode of the innocuous game show.

====Bumper sticker====
Among the more successful productions issued by Krassner was a red, white, and blue automobile [[bumper sticker]], decorated with stars, which proclaimed "[[Fuck Communism]]". In advertising this item, Krassner advised that if anyone displaying the sticker received criticism, the critic should be told, "Go back to Russia, you Commie lover."
[[File:Disneyland Memorial Orgy.gif|thumb|300px|''The Disneyland Memorial Orgy'' poster, first published May, 1967.]]

===={{Anchor|Disney Memorial Orgy|Disneyland Memorial Orgy}}Disneyland Memorial Orgy poster====
His ''Disneyland Memorial Orgy'' poster, illustrated by [[Wally Wood]] and published in the May 1967 issue, was a highlight of the magazine, so successful that Krassner printed it as a [[poster]] that was widely [[pirated]]. The poster has been upgraded by Krassner into a new, digitally-colored version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulkrassner.com Paul Krassner Home Page] retrieved 6/29/2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a section of the image, on the left-hand side, that shows Snow White being harassed by five of the seven dwarfs, whilst the other two engage in anal sex nearby.  This scene has been printed (often modified to be more explicit) on t-shirts and worn by punks with the title ''Snow White and the Sir Punks'', which have caused some offence.&lt;ref&gt;http://rockpopfashion.com/blog/?p=60&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cartoonists featured in ''The Realist'' included Howard Shoemaker, [[Dick Guindon]], [[Mort Gerberg]], [[Bhob Stewart]] and [[Lou Myers]].

===="The Parts That Were Left Out of the Kennedy Book"====
Krassner's most successful prank was ''The Parts That Were Left Out of the Kennedy Book'', a [[grotesque]] article following the censorship of [[William Manchester]]'s book on the [[Kennedy assassination]], ''[[The Death of a President]]''.&lt;ref name="KennedyPrank"&gt;''[http://www.ep.tc/realist/74/01.html The Parts That Were Left Out of the Kennedy Book]'' - ''The Realist'', Issue No. 74 - May 1967, cover page and [http://www.ep.tc/realist/74/18.html page 18]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the short story, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] is on [[Air Force One]] sexually penetrating the bullet-hole wound in the throat of [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]]'s corpse.&lt;ref name="KennedyPrank"/&gt; Krassner acknowledged [[Marvin Garson]], editor of the ''[[San Francisco Express Times]]'' and husband of [[Barbara Garson]] (author of the notorious anti-Johnson play ''[[MacBird!]]''&amp;nbsp;), for coming up with that surreal image.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.researchpubs.com/books/prank2exc10.php Interview with Paul Krassner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021012646/http://www.researchpubs.com/books/prank2exc10.php |date=2006-10-21 }}'' from ''Pranks! 2''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Elliot Feldman, "Some members of the mainstream press and other Washington political wonks, including [[Daniel Ellsberg]] of Pentagon Papers fame, actually believed this incident to be true."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Paul_Krassner_and_The_Realist/ Paul Krassner and The Realist]'' by Elliot Feldman&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1995 interview for the magazine ''[[Adbusters]]'', Krassner commented: "People across the country believed – if only for a moment – that an act of presidential necrophilia had taken place. It worked because [[Jackie Kennedy]] had created so much curiosity by censoring the book she authorized – William Manchester's ''The Death Of A President'' – because what I wrote was a metaphorical truth about LBJ's personality presented in a literary context, and because the imagery was so shocking, it broke through the notion that the war in Vietnam was being conducted by sane men.".&lt;ref name="AdbustersInterview"&gt;''[http://members.aol.com/tedalvy/cat.htm Cat Simril Interviews Paul Krassner]'' by CAT SIMRILin from "[[Adbusters Quarterly]]" Journal of the Mental Environment (Winter 1995 Vol. 3 No. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the Canadian campus newspaper ''[[The McGill Daily]]'' published an excerpt from Krassner's story. The Montreal police confiscated the issue and Rocke Robertson, principal of [[McGill University]], charged student John Fekete, the supplement editor responsible for the publication, before the Senate Discipline Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2902/daily.htm Milestones] of ''[[The McGill Daily]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conspiracy theories===
''The Realist'' was the first [[satirical]] magazine to publish [[conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref name=burnett&gt;''[[Conspiracy Encyclopedia|Conspiracy Encyclopedia: The Encyclopedia of Conspiracy Theories]]'', [[Thom Burnett]], 2005, p. 86, {{ISBN|1-59609-156-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first magazine to carry [[Mae Brussell]]'s work on conspiracies,&lt;ref name=burnett/&gt; which covered the kidnapping of [[Patty Hearst]], the [[Watergate scandal]], the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of JFK]] and other conspiracy theories.

When the magazine ran into financial difficulties in the 1970s, it was the conspiracy theory element that attracted ex-Beatle [[John Lennon]]&lt;ref name=burnett/&gt; to donate; saying, "If anything ever happens to me...it won't be an accident."&lt;ref name=burnett/&gt;

==Cultural influence==
In 2003, Italian satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]], whose production company is called "Krassner Entertainment", wrote the short story ''[[Stanotte e per sempre]]'' (Eng.: ''Tonight and forever'') about the assassination of Italian politician [[Aldo Moro]]. In the climax scene, [[Giulio Andreotti]] penetrates the bullet wounds in [[Aldo Moro]]'s corpse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Enrico Deaglio|Deaglio, Enrico]] (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=JaByRJ3_BkAC ''Patria 1978-2008'']: Un racconto grottesco della vicenda si intitola "Stanotte e per sempre" ed e' a opera di Daniele Luttazzi che lo ha scritto per la rivista ''Pulp'' e presentato al Teatro Modena di Genova il 24 novembre 2003. La trama del racconto è un incubo di Andreotti, che sogna di penetrare sessualmente i fori di proiettile che hanno ucciso Moro, omaggio a Paul Krassner. (p.883)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luttazzi, Daniele [http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/291 ''Stanotte e per sempre'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lewis Black]] included an excerpt, precisely the final part, from Krassner's story in his 2005 book ''[[Nothing's Sacred (book)|Nothing's Sacred]]''.

Emerging from an informal agreement related to the 1941 [[Atlantic Charter]], the [[secret treaty]] was renewed with the passage of the [[1943 BRUSA Agreement]], before being officially enacted on 5 March 1946 by the United Kingdom and the United States. In the following years, it was extended to encompass Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  Other countries, known as "third parties", such as [[West Germany]], the Philippines, and several [[Nordic countries]] also joined the UKUSA community in associate capacities, although they are not part of mechanism for automatic sharing of intelligence that exists between the Five Eyes.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher 2014-06-18"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher |first= Ryan|title=How Secret Partners Expand NSA's Surveillance Dragnet|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/06/18/nsa-surveillance-secret-cable-partners-revealed-rampart-a|publisher=The Intercept|date=2014-06-19|accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the sharing of information is performed via the ultra-sensitive [[STONEGHOST]] network, which has been claimed to contain "some of the Western world's most closely guarded secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rob Gordon|title=Navy spy probe kept military in dark: documents|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/navy-spy-probe-kept-military-in-dark-documents-1.1856151|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=20 October 2013|quote=The military's fears were well-founded, given Delisle had access to terabytes of some of the Western world's most closely guarded secrets.

==History==

=== Origins (1940s–1950s) ===

{{Quote box
 |quote  =
The parties agree to the exchange of the products of the following operations relating to foreign communications:-

 |source =-- [http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/ukusa/new_ukusa_agree_10may55.pdf AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE APPENDICES TO THE UKUSA AGREEMENT (THIRD EDITION)], page 5
}}

The agreement originated from a ten-page 1943 British–U.S. Communication Intelligence Agreement, [[1943 BRUSA Agreement|BRUSA]], that connected the signal intercept networks of the U.K. [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) and the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) at the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. The document was signed on 5 March 1946 by Colonel Patrick Marr-Johnson for the U.K.'s London Signals Intelligence Board and Lieutenant General [[Hoyt Vandenberg]] for the U.S. State–Army–Navy Communication Intelligence Board. Although the original agreement states that the exchange would not be "prejudicial to national interests", the United States often blocked information sharing from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. The full text of the agreement was released to the public on 25 June 2010.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|title=Not so secret: deal at the heart of UK-US intelligence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/intelligence-deal-uk-us-released|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 June 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Five Eyes]]" term has its origins as a shorthand for a "AUS/CAN/NZ/UK/US EYES ONLY" classification level.&lt;ref name="fiveeyes1"/&gt;

=== Onset of the Cold War (1950s–1960s) ===
Under the agreement, the GCHQ and the NSA shared intelligence on the [[Soviet Union]], the People's Republic of China, and several eastern European countries (known as Exotics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aldrich|first=Richard|title=Allied code-breakers co-operate – but not always| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/24/intelligence-sharing-codebreakers-agreement-ukusa| work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 June 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network was expanded in the 1960s into the [[Echelon (signals intelligence)|Echelon]] collection and analysis network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardham|first=Duncan|title=Document that formalised 'special relationship' with the US|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7852136/Document-that-formalised-special-relationship-with-the-US.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=24 June 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty was extended to include Canada (1948), Australia (1956) and New Zealand (1956). In 1955, the agreement was updated to designate Canada, Australia and New Zealand as "UKUSA-collaborating [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries".&lt;ref name=norton5&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|title=Not so secret: deal at the heart of UK-US intelligence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/intelligence-deal-uk-us-released|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=27 January 2014|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries that joined as "third parties" were Norway (1952), Denmark (1954) and [[West Germany]] (1955).

=== Investigations (1970–90s) ===

In the aftermath of the [[1973 Murphy raids]] on the headquarters of the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), the existence of the UKUSA Agreement was revealed to Australia's Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]]. After learning about the agreement, Whitlam discovered that [[Pine Gap]], a secret surveillance station close to Alice Springs, Australia, had been operated by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ley|first=Jenny|title=Australia and America: a 50-year affair|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/31/1043804523405.html|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=1 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gill|first=Peter|title=Policing Politics: Security Intelligence and the Liberal Democratic State|year=1994|publisher=Cass|location=London u.a.|isbn=0-7146-3490-5|page=198|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leslie| first=Tim|title=Explained: Australia's involvement with the NSA, the US spy agency at heart of global scandal|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-08/australian-nsa-involvement-explained/5079786|quote=Its existence was allegedly so secret that prime ministers were unaware of the agreement until 1973 – the same year the Commonwealth raided ASIO|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=Michael C.|title=The ANZUS Crisis, Nuclear Visiting and Deterrence|year=1989|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-34355-0|page=46|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], the use and control of Pine Gap by the CIA was strongly opposed by Whitlam, who fired the chief of the ASIO before being dismissed as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|title=Australia first to admit "we're part of global surveillance system"|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/2/2889/1.html|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=28 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of several intelligence agencies of the [[Five Eyes]] was not revealed until the following years:
;1970s: In Canada, an investigative television report revealed the existence of the [[Communications Security Establishment Canada]] (CSEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeze|first=Colin|title=How CSEC became an electronic spying giant|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/how-csec-became-an-electronic-spying-giant/article15699694/?service=mobile|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1976: In Britain, an investigative article in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine revealed the existence of the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/21/surveillance-secrecy-gchq|title=Surveillance secrecy: the legacy of GCHQ's years under cover |work=The Guardian |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=30 November 2013 |author=Norton-Taylor, Richard |quote=GCHQ's cover was first blown in 1976 by an article, The Eavesdroppers, published by the London magazine, Time Out.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Australian government acknowledged that it "does co-operate with counterpart signals intelligence organisations overseas under the UKUSA relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Duncan Campbell  |author2=Mark Honigsbaum |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Britain and US spy on world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/23/duncancampbell.markhonigsbaum|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=23 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZ role with global spying alliance|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=7168|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=30 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the UKUSA Agreement, however, was not publicly revealed until 2005.&lt;ref name="timecoldwar" /&gt; The contents of the agreement were officially disclosed to the public on 25 June 2010. Four days later, the agreement was described by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the "most important documents in the history of the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref name="timecoldwar" /&gt;

=== Recent media leaks ===

In July 2013, as part of the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|2013 Edward Snowden revelations]], it emerged that the NSA is paying GCHQ for its services, with at least £100 million of payments made between 2010 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/01/nsa-paid-gchq-spying-edward-snowden NSA pays £100m in secret funding for GCHQ], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 August 2013. Retrieved 2 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' released a [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|leaked document provided by Edward Snowden]] which reveals a similar agreement between the NSA and Israel's [[Unit 8200]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras  |author2=Ewen MacAskill  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents |title=NSA shares raw intelligence including Americans' data with Israel &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Australia operates clandestine surveillance facilities at its embassies "without the knowledge of most Australian diplomats". These facilities are part of an international espionage program known as '''[[Stateroom (surveillance program)|STATEROOM]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Philip Dorling|title=Exposed: Australia's Asia spy network|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/exposed-australias-asia-spy-network-20131030-2whia.html|accessdate=22 December 2013|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security and intelligence agencies ==
Although the UKUSA alliance is often associated with the [[ECHELON]] system, processed intelligence is reliant on multiple sources of information and the intelligence shared is not restricted to [[signals intelligence]].

==Global coverage==
{{Main|Global surveillance}}
Although precise assignments are classified, it is generally known that each member of the UKUSA alliance takes lead responsibility for intelligence collection and analysis in different parts of the globe.

=== Five Eyes ===
{{main|Five Eyes}}
The '''"Five Eyes"''', often abbreviated as "'''FVEY'''", refer to an [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence]] alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are bound by the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, a treaty for joint cooperation in [[signals intelligence]].&lt;ref name="fiveeyes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=James|title=Canada and the Five Eyes Intelligence Community|url=http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|publisher=[[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]]|date=December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205220700/http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Eyes|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622|publisher=[[United States Army Combined Arms Center]]|accessdate=18 January 2014|archivedate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MicvdCtb?url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKI Interoperability with FVEY Partner Nations on the NIPRNet|url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978|publisher=United States Department of the Navy|accessdate=18 January 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Micdat2m?url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978|archivedate=18 January 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 9 Eyes, 14 Eyes, and other "third parties" ===

[[File:NSA Nato alliance.jpg|thumb|400px|This diagram depicts the relationship between the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and the so-called "second parties", which comprises the UKUSA community, and the "third parties" made up of members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and other [[Western allies]]:

&lt;br/&gt;
'''NSA and third parties'''—Signals intelligence is funelled to the NSA in exchange for surveillance technology and monetary compensation&lt;ref name="businesweeknsa"/&gt;
]]
The "Five Eyes" community is part of an extensive alliance of [[Western world|Western countries]] sharing [[signals intelligence]] with each other. These allied countries include [[NATO]] members, other European countries such as Sweden, and allies in the Pacific, in particular Singapore and South Korea.&lt;ref name="fiveeyes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher 2014-06-18" /&gt;

In the 1950s several Nordic countries joined the community as "third party" participants. They were soon followed by Denmark (1954) and [[West Germany]] (1955).&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher 2014-06-18" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan Campbell|title=Inside Echelon|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/6/6929/1.html|publisher=[[Heinz Heise]]|accessdate=25 July 2000|quote=The system was established under a secret 1947 "UKUSA Agreement," which brought together the British and American systems, personnel and stations. To this was soon joined the networks of three British commonwealth countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Later, other countries including Norway, Denmark, Germany and Turkey signed secret sigint agreements with the United States and became "third parties" participants in the UKUSA network.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edward Snowden]], the NSA has a "massive body" called the Foreign Affairs Directorate that is responsible for partnering with other [[Western allies]] such as Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Snowden Interview: The NSA and Its Willing Helpers|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html|publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]''|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the "second party" members (that is, the Five Eyes themselves), "third party" partners are not automatically exempt from intelligence targeting. According to an internal NSA document leaked by Snowden, "We (the NSA) can, and often do, target the signals of most 3rd party foreign partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach  |author2=Holger Stark |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ally and Target: US Intelligence Watches Germany Closely|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/germany-is-a-both-a-partner-to-and-a-target-of-nsa-surveillance-a-916029.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=29 August 2013|quote=The NSA classifies about 30 other countries as "3rd parties," with whom it cooperates, though with reservations. Germany is one of them. "We can, and often do, target the signals of most 3rd party foreign partners," the secret NSA document reads.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Eyes are cooperating with various 3rd Party countries in at least two groups:
* The "Nine Eyes", consisting of the Five Eyes plus Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Denmark is one of the NSA's '9-Eyes'|url=http://cphpost.dk/news14/international-news14/denmark-is-one-of-the-nsas-9-eyes.html|accessdate=10 April 2016|publisher=The Copenhagen Post|date=4 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "Fourteen Eyes", consisting of the same countries as the Nine Eyes plus Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen MacAskill and James Ball (2 November 2013), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-portrait-total-surveillance Portrait of the NSA: no detail too small in quest for total surveillance] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The actual name of this group is SIGINT Seniors Europe (SSEUR) and its purpose is coordinating the exchange of military signals intelligence among its members.&lt;ref&gt;Top Level Telecommunications, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2013/12/14-eyes-are-3rd-party-partners-forming.html 14-Eyes are 3rd Party partners forming the SIGINT Seniors Europe], 15 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany is reportedly interested in moving closer to the inner circle: an internal GCHQ document from 2009 said that the "Germans were a little grumpy at not being invited to join the 9-Eyes group."  Germany may even wish to join Five Eyes.&lt;ref&gt;David Sanger and Mark Mazzetti (24 October 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/world/europe/allegation-of-us-spying-on-merkel-puts-obama-at-crossroads.html Allegation of U.S. Spying on Merkel Puts Obama at Crossroads] ''[[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to Five Eyes, French President [[François Hollande]] has said that his country is "not within that framework and we don't intend to join."&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Waterfield (25 October 2013), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10405936/EU-leaders-warn-US-spying-could-harm-fight-against-terror.html EU leaders warn US 'spying' could harm fight against terror] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to a former top U.S. official, "Germany joining would be a possibility, but not France – France itself spies on the US far too aggressively for that."&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Peter Schmitz (28 October 2013), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/germany-impedes-eu-privacy-efforts-despite-outrage-at-nsa-spying-a-930488.html Appearances and Reality: Merkel Balks at EU Privacy Push] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{NSA surveillance}}
During the [[2013 NSA leaks]] Internet spying scandal, the surveillance agencies of the "Five Eyes" have been accused of intentionally spying on one another's citizens and willingly sharing the collected information with each other, allegedly circumventing laws preventing each agency from spying on its own citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa GCHQ taps fibre-optic cables for secret access to world's communications], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 June 2013. Retrieved July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett NSA 'offers intelligence to British counterparts to skirt UK law'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 June 2013. Retrieved July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/jun/10/cameron-speech-gchq-nsa-hague-live GCHQ-NSA revelations – Hague responds: politics blog], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 June 2013, Retrieved July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/uk-usa-security-britain-idUKBRE95K10620130621 British spy agency taps cables, shares with U.S. NSA – Guardian], ''[[Reuters]]'', 21 June 2013. Retrieved July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 NSA leaks are not entirely new, but rather, they are a confirmation of earlier disclosures about the UK-US espionage alliance. For example, the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' reported back in 1996 that the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] "taps UK phones" at the request of the British intelligence agency [[MI5]], thus allowing British agents to evade restrictive limitations on domestic telephone tapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Chris Blackhurst  |author2=John Gilbert |lastauthoramp=yes |title=US spy base 'taps UK phones for MI5'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/us-spy-base-taps-uk-phones-for-mi5-1364399.html|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=22 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutual surveillance and sharing of information between allies of the UK and US resurfaced again during the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]]. As described by the news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', this was done to circumvent domestic surveillance regulations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency can spy on anyone but British nationals, the NSA can conduct surveillance on anyone but Americans, and Germany's BND ([[Bundesnachrichtendienst]]) foreign intelligence agency can spy on anyone but Germans. That's how a matrix is created of boundless surveillance in which each partner aids in a division of roles.

They exchanged information. And they worked together extensively. That applies to the British and the Americans, but also to the BND, which assists the NSA in its Internet surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Fidelius Schmid, Holger Stark and Jonathan Stock|title=Cover Story: How the NSA Targets Germany and Europe|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/secret-documents-nsa-targeted-germany-and-eu-buildings-a-908609.html|publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]''|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the "Five Eyes" community is an exclusive club where new members "do not seem to be welcome":

{{quote|It does not matter how senior you are, and how close a friend you think you are to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] or London, your communications could easily be being shared among the handful of [[White people|white]], [[Anglosphere|English-speaking]] nations with membership privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Julian Borger|title=Merkel spying claim: with allies like these, who needs enemies?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/merkel-nsa-phone-allies-enemies|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In 2013, Canadian federal judge [[Richard Mosley]] strongly rebuked the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] ('''CSIS''') for outsourcing its surveillance of Canadians to overseas partner agencies. A 51-page ruling says that the CSIS and other Canadian federal agencies are illegally enlisting U.S. and British allies in [[global surveillance]] dragnets, while keeping domestic federal courts in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colin Freeze|title=Canada's spy agencies chastised for duping courts|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadas-spy-agencies-chastised-for-duping-courts/article16081238/|accessdate=27 December 2013|newspaper=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ian MacLeod|title=CSIS asked foreign agencies to spy on Canadians, kept court in dark, judge says|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/CSIS+asked+foreign+agencies+Canadians+kept+court+dark+judge+says/9312615/story.html|publisher=''[[Ottawa Citizen]]''|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=20 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222085228/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/CSIS%2Basked%2Bforeign%2Bagencies%2BCanadians%2Bkept%2Bcourt%2Bdark%2Bjudge%2Bsays/9312615/story.html|archivedate=22 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart Bell|title=Court rebukes CSIS for secretly asking international allies to spy on Canadian terror suspects travelling abroad|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/11/25/court-rebukes-csis-for-secretly-asking-international-allies-to-spy-on-canadian-terror-suspects/|publisher=''[[National Post]]''|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Warped Tour''' was a traveling [[Rock music|rock]] [[Concert tour|tour]] that had toured the [[United States]] (including 3 or 4 stops in [[Canada]]) annually each summer from 1995 to 2018.  It was the largest traveling music festival in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owens|first1=Paige|title=Vans Warped Tour Pittsburgh Welcomes Local Band to the Stage|url=http://maniacmagazine.com/culture/music/vans-warped-tour-pittsburgh-welcomes-local-band-to-the-stage/|website=ManiacMagazine.com|publisher=Maniac Magazine|accessdate=19 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819002041/http://maniacmagazine.com/culture/music/vans-warped-tour-pittsburgh-welcomes-local-band-to-the-stage/|archivedate=August 19, 2015 |date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the longest-running touring music festival in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Hiatt, Brian.

Warped Tour was conceived in 1995 as an eclectic [[alternative rock]] festival, but in 1996 began focusing on [[punk rock]] music.&lt;ref name=waddell /&gt; Although it has continued to be known primarily as a punk rock festival, it has included acts of diverse genres over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thenewfury.com/wordpress/wait-played-warped-10-surprising-warped-tour-alumni/ |title=Wait, They Played Warped? 10 Surprising Warped Tour Alumni |author=newfurymedia |date=2015-02-17 |website=thenewfury.com |publisher=The New Fury |access-date=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Crane |first=Matt |date=2015-01-23 |title=10 Reasons You Should Be Especially Excited For Warped Tour This Year |url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/10_reasons_you_should_be_especially_excited_for_warped_tour_this_year |magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]] |publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc. |access-date=2016-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connor |first=Christopher |date=1999-03-11 |title=Vans Warped Tour Goes Hip-Hop |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/512761/vans-warped-tour-goes-hip-hop/ |publisher=MTV |website=MTV.com |access-date=2016-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warped Tour founder [[Kevin Lyman]] stated that the 2018 Vans Warped Tour would be the final, full cross-country run.

== Overview ==
[[File:Warped Tour schedule 2010-08-10.jpg|thumb|right|The performance schedule for the August 10, 2010 stop in [[Chula Vista, California]], giving stages and set times for each act. Set times are determined on the day of the show and are posted for attendees on a large inflatable board.]]

The band times and sets were found on an inflatable lineup, or can be purchased from a stand.

Every year there was a "BBQ Band". In exchange for the privilege of playing on the tour, the BBQ Band prepared the post-show barbecue held for the bands and crew most evenings.  Past BBQ Bands have included [[Dropkick Murphys]], Art of Shock and "The Fabulous Rudies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleston.net/stories/?newsID=94008&amp;section=preview] {{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, one band, Animo (formerly DORK), has been permitted for the past four years to play on the tour in exchange for working on the setup crew. The "BBQ Band" for the 2016 tour was the band Reckless Serenade.

The tour started as a [[skate punk]] and [[third wave ska|third-wave ska]] tour, but later began to feature mostly [[pop punk]] and [[metalcore]] acts. There are also some [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] and [[street punk]] bands, such as [[the Casualties]], [[the Unseen (band)|the Unseen]] and [[Anti-Flag]], that still play Warped Tour, as well as older bands that have played the tour numerous times since its inception ([[Bad Religion]], [[NOFX]], etc.)

The tour wasn't set up in just one way; every show at every venue had a different layout. It was set up early in the morning during the set up crews' arrival and taken down usually during the last show of the day. When heading into Canada, there was a bus that loaded the supplies that headed into Canada while the other bus contains the equipment that stayed in the U.S. until the next show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3407256/?ref_=tt_ep_ep4|title=Oh. Canada.|date=January 1, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=September 24, 2016|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Kevin Lyman decided to allow parents free admission to the Warped Tour. Citing issues such as transportation problems for minors and the audience member demographic opening up to a younger crowd every year, Lyman determined that parents accompanying their children would be allowed into the tour for free. Parents have their own adult day care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/52019/warped-tour-offering-free-admission-for-parents |title=Warped Tour offering free admission for parents |publisher=Punknews.org |date=2013-06-20 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known as Reverse Day Care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minichino |first=Nick |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/07/warped_tour_reverse_daycare_parents.php |title=Scenes From Warped Tour's "Reverse Daycare": Blazing Saddles, Air Conditioning, And Parents' Memories Of Concerts Past &amp;#124; Village Voice |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grown-ups could spend the day waiting for their children in the Reverse Day Care tent. There was ample seating and often fans or cooling devices to keep the parents occupied during the festival.

==History==
[[File:Warped Tour stages 2010-08-10 02.jpg|right|thumb|The ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]''/Advent stage (left) and [[Glamour Kills]] stage (right) on the 2010 tour, an example of the tour's side-by-side stage setup. Acts play alternating 30-minute set times on the two stages.]]
The Warped Tour was created in 1995 by [[Kevin Lyman]], in production with the short lived Warp Magazine and [[Creative Artists Agency]]. The tour began June 21 at the Idaho Center in Boise, Idaho, and ended August 18 in Detroit.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waddell|first1=Ray|title=Venue Views: Warped Wrap|url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/docview/988641?accountid=8360|website=International Index to Music Periodicals Full Text|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour was usually held at outdoor venues, though on rare occasions it was held indoors. In 1996, due to problems with the venue where the event was to be held, the show was forced to be moved indoors to [[The Capitol Ballroom]] nightclub in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freewebs.com/44blinkingangels/tourarchives.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704084141/http://www.freewebs.com/44blinkingangels/tourarchives.htm |archivedate=July 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1996 was the first year for Vans as a sponsor and they have been the main sponsor ever since carrying their name in the title.

In 1998, the tour went international, including venues in Australia, Japan, Europe, Canada, and the United States.

In 1999, the tour started off in New Zealand, Australia and Hawaii in the New Year. It then started up again in the United States for the northern hemisphere summer before ending up in Europe.

The Vans Warped Tour has turned eco-friendly by using biodiesel for the production buses.&lt;ref&gt;Knopper, Steve. "Rock &amp; Roll: Fuel Crisis Hits Tours." Rolling Stone 27 July 2006: 15-16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the two main stages were condensed into one and bands were given 40-minute sets, as opposed to the traditional 30 minutes across the previous two stages. Despite this, the tour decided to bring back the two main stages concept with 35-minute sets instead for the 2012 tour and beyond.

In 2012, the Warped Tour traveled to London, the first time the tour has left North America since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediablasphemy.com/2012/other/vans-warped-tour-coming-to-the-uk/ |title=Vans Warped Tour Coming to the UK |publisher=Media Blasphemy |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016235421/http://mediablasphemy.com/2012/other/vans-warped-tour-coming-to-the-uk/ |archivedate=October 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK and Europe, Warped Tour is operated by English promoter [[Kilimanjaro Live]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.licklibrary.com/news/2012/3/3432-vans_warped_tour_to_return_to_the_uk_for_the_first_time_since_1999 "Vans Warped Tour to return to the UK for the first time since 1999"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009071516/https://www.licklibrary.com/news/2012/3/3432-vans_warped_tour_to_return_to_the_uk_for_the_first_time_since_1999 |date=October 9, 2016 }}, ''LickLibrary'', Fri, 30 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Warped Tour returned to London in 2015.

==Impact of Warped Tour==

==Legacy==

Warped Tour became a launching pad for many up and coming artists. The festival has been attributed to bringing unknown artists like [[Black Veil Brides]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Blink-182]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Paramore]], [[MGK]], [[Katy Perry]] and [[Yelawolf]] to the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Yehuda, Ayala. "Upfront Latin: Austin Goes Latin." Billboard 8 Mar. 2008: 18. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warped Tour gave artists like [[Will.i.am]] and the [[Black Eyed Peas]] a chance to perform. Black Eyed Peas were featured on the 1999 Vans Warped Tour.  According to Will.i.am, the Black Eyed Peas were the first group not categorized as "punk" to play at Warped Tour.&lt;ref&gt;Concepcion, Mariel. "NO E.N.D. TO Success." Billboard 31 July 2010: 25-27.

==Music lessons==

Musicians on the Vans Warped tour gave lessons. Percussive Marketing Council teamed up with the Vans Warped Tour and has given free drum lessons to the concert goers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Free Drum Lessons at Warped Tour." Music Trades Sept. 2014: 28. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The lessons were given at the Lesson Lab tent. These music lessons are for people who are learning to play drums for the first time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The lessons utilized electronic drumsets and acoustic drumsets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Rashidi, Waleed. "BACKBEATS: Street Drum Corps At Warped Tour." Modern Drummer Nov. 2005: 176. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to PMC Advisory Board Member Billy Cuthrell, having drum teachers from other percussion stores is the "key" to the free lessons program.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In 2005, the Vans Warped tour incorporated a multiple level stage that consisted of two levels for the band Street Drum Corps.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Music education was a big part of the Vans Warped Tour. Throughout the years, the Warped Tour utilized the John Lennon Bus to achieve this.&lt;ref name=Galante&gt;Block, Debbie Galante. "A Dream Studio on Wheels: Brian Roschild Describes the Vision Behind the Lennon Educational Tour Bus." Billboard 19 May 2007: 34-36. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The John Lennon Bus was started by Ben Roschild and Yoko Ono in 1968.&lt;ref name=Kenny&gt;Kenny, Tom. "Bringing Music to the People." Mix Jan. 2012: 18-20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the John Lennon Bus was to educate people about music who attended the Warped Tour. Brian Roschild is the executive director of the John Lennon Bus.  Essentially, the John Lennon Bus is a mobile studio. The demographic that the bus is trying to educate is the younger generation. Not only do people from the public participate, but artists do as well. Artists like Eminem and Bowling For Soup have visited the tour bus.&lt;ref name=Galante/&gt; Other celebrities to use the bus include Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas, Natasha Bedingfield, and John Legend.&lt;ref name=Kenny/&gt;

==Battle of the Bands==

The Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands took place at Warped Tour every year. Over 10,000 bands tried out for the battle of the bands in 2005. The bands perform at their local Warped tour date and are judged by professionals from the music industry. If the bands do well in the competition, they get to perform as a side stage act on the Ernie Ball Stage of the Vans Warped Tour.&lt;ref&gt;Molenda, Michael.

==Criticism and controversy==
[[File:Warped Tour merch tents 2010-08-10 04.jpg|right|thumb|Artist, record label, and sponsor tents occupy the central area of the tour stops, selling merchandise and holding autograph signings.]]
"Warped Tour is a place for teenage kids to go and hear all their favorite bands in one day," says Rob Pasalic, guitarist for the Saint Alvia Cartel. "It wouldn’t make sense for it to be the same tour in 2007 as it was in 1997. These are the bands that kids like, and the tour is smart enough to grow and adapt to that. You still get bands like [[Bad Religion]] playing, so it’s not like it’s lost all its roots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/warped-tour/125/|title=Warped Tour Keeps Skating Straight Ahead|accessdate=August 23, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725141733/http://music.aol.ca/article/warped-tour/125/|archivedate=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Queer]] of [[The Queers]] stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;You play music because there's something inside of you that says you have to play music. Now you get bands like [[Fall Out Boy]] that are basically created in the studio. The Warped Tour changed it. Fuck it. I just don't like that shit. All the guys in the bands remind me of the [[Jock (athlete)|jocks]] I hated in high school. To me a punk gig is a small sweaty club with the audience right in your face knocking over the mic stand and boogying off the energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wirenh.com/music-mainmenu-5/15-music-general/1597-joe-queer-the-face-of-punk.html |title=頭部外傷でお悩みの方へ充実のサポート &amp;#124; 高次脳機能障害は弁護士に相談｜弁護士法人たくみ法律事務所 |website=Wirenh.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201233541/http://wirenh.com/music-mainmenu-5/15-music-general/1597-joe-queer-the-face-of-punk.html |archivedate=December 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Keith Morris]] has stated "These kids that are on the Warped Tour, they should have no choice but to go into the military, and go off to some desert somewhere and spend some time in the desert, rather than having some big, ultra mega record company giving them lots of money and paying for their hotels and buses, making sure their hair is trendy, and that they are wearing the proper clothes that all the kids like and wear, and all that fun shit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=9241014431&amp;topic=4111]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris' band the [[Circle Jerks]] would later appear on the 2007 edition of the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_tours/circle_jerks_to_join_this_years_warped_tour.html |title= Circle Jerks To Join This Year's Warped Tour |date= June 21, 2007 |work= Ultimate-Guitar.com |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Oliver Sykes]], lead vocalist of [[Bring Me the Horizon]] took to Twitter to pronounce that he was no longer allowed to start a [[mosh pit]] or wall of death. Kevin Lyman took to Twitter as well to say that audience members can create mosh pits and wall of deaths but that someone in the audience has to be the initiator and not a band member because then they are taking responsibility for any injuries which can then lead to costly lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/52048/warped-tour-act-claims-ban-on-terms-like-mosh-pit-and-wall-of-death |title=Warped Tour act claims ban on terms like "mosh pit" and "wall of death" |publisher=Punknews.org |date=2013-06-24 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/52115/warped-tours-kevin-lyman-comments-on-mosh-pit-controversy |title=Warped Tour's Kevin Lyman comments on 'mosh pit' controversy |publisher=Punknews.org |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2015, it was announced that [[Front Porch Step]] would be playing the Nashville, TN tour stop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/musicians_react_to_front_porch_step_playing_warped_tour |title=Musicians react to Front Porch Step playing Warped Tour - News - Alternative Press |publisher=Altpress.com |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/front_porch_step_reportedly_playing_warped_tour_today |title=Front Porch Step reportedly playing Warped Tour today - UPDATED - News - Alternative Press |publisher=Altpress.com |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite allegedly sexually harassing numerous young girls through explicit text messages, nude photographs, and phone sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/everything_we_know_about_the_sexual_harassment_allegations_against_front_po |title=Everything we know about the sexual harassment allegations against Front Porch Step - News - Alternative Press |publisher=Altpress.com |date=2015-01-01 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bands, including [[The Wonder Years (band)|The Wonder Years]], [[Senses Fail]], [[Handguns]], and [[Beartooth (band)|Beartooth]] asked attendees to not go to McElfresh's set. The Wonder Years' lead singer Dan “Soupy” Campbell, who was supposed to perform after Front Porch Step on the Acoustic Basement Stage, asked fans to go see [[Man Overboard (band)|Man Overboard]] at 1:15pm, the time the acoustic set would take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/4mXWkenLqB/ |title=Instagram |publisher=Instagram |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyman responded by saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was only supposed to be here long enough to play his show but the weather today has been putting us behind schedule. He wasn't added to the tour, so those claims that he was ‘added to sell tickets’ are completely groundless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/warped_tours_kevin_lyman_responds_to_front_porch_step_controversy_exclusive |title=Warped Tour’s Kevin Lyman responds to Front Porch Step controversy (exclusive) - News - Alternative Press |website=Altpress.com |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also said because McElfresh had still not been formally charged with any misconduct, he agreed to have him perform. "If he was a danger to anyone, he simply would not have been here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/warped_tours_kevin_lyman_responds_to_front_porch_step_controversy_exclusive |title=Warped Tour’s Kevin Lyman responds to Front Porch Step controversy (exclusive) - News - Alternative Press |publisher=Altpress.com |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2016, Vans Warped Tour announced that Virginia pro-life organization [[Students for Life of America|Rock For Life]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentsforlife.org/national-summer-rock-for-life-tour-kicks-off/|title=National Summer Rock For Life Tour Kicks Off|publisher=Students for Life of America|date=2016-06-01|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be one of the vendors on their 41 tour dates.

On June 26, 2017, a video surfaced of the punk rock band [[The Dickies]] verbally abusing a crowd member after protests against the band, including signs that said "Our teenage girls don't need to be subjected to derogatory jokes by a disgusting old man" and "Punk isn't predatory" took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/a-warped-tour-band-have-been-criticised-for-inappropriate-behaviour|title=Former Warped Tour Band Verbally Abuses Crowd Member, Warped Tour Founder Kevin Lyman Responds - News - Rock Sound Magazine|website=Rock Sound Magazine|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/everyones_mad_at_the_dickies_after_they_verbally_abused_a_warped_tour_attendee|title=Everyone's Mad at the Dickies After They Verbally Abused a Warped Tour Attendee|publisher=|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Lyman did initially say that the band was no longer on the Warped Tour roster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=KevinLyman|author=KevinLyman|number=879430678173155328|date=26 June 2017|title=@johnothetree It was a very unfortunate incident and the tour does not condone this at all, they will no longer be on the tour.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he released a statement on July 1 that said the band was not kicked off of the tour and that the altercation was between the band's frontman, Leonard Graves Phillips, and a member of the touring party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/vans-warped-tour-founder-kevin-lyman-speaks-out-about-the-dickies-verbal-ab|title=Vans Warped Tour Founder Kevin Lyman Speaks Out About The Dickies Verbal Abuse Incident - News - Rock Sound Magazine|website=Rock Sound Magazine|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought it was time to put the facts out since I have watched false information floating around.  A video has been circulating of a confrontation between Leonard from the Dickies and a Fan. Fact- it was not a Fan, but a member of the touring party. The member of the touring party was standing next to the PA with a sign protesting some of the things they found offensive about the bands jokes, and props on stage.  During one of the last songs they went towards the barricade and directed the sign at the band. After a verbal barrage from Leonard, the member of the touring party threw the sign at Leonard, and left the area. I do not condone verbal or physical violence, whatsoever. The Dickies, last day of the tour was that Sunday, which had always been scheduled. These are the facts of what took place and this is why I ask anyone who has an issue with anyone else on tour, to come sit under my tent with me and express their views diplomatically. On this years tour we have many people who may not agree with each other, but as humans we should be able to express our points of view in a civil manner. If we have any hope to progress as a society, communication will be key in moving forward.&lt;ref name="Rocksound"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Band conflicts===
[[File:Warped Tour half-pipe 2010-08-10.jpg|right|thumb|Athletes perform exhibitions of skateboarding, BMX biking, and other sports on [[half-pipe]]s and other ramps during the tour. Attendees are often also permitted to participate.]]
A few bands have left the tour due to conflicts they had with the tour or with other bands:

* Both [[D12]] and [[Esham]] were kicked out of the 2001 tour. D12 allegedly attacked Esham because he mentioned [[Eminem]]'s daughter in his song "Chemical Imbalance". Eminem was not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dailybruin.com/index.php/article/2001/08/rappers-esham-d12-kicked-off-w |title=Rappers Esham, D12 kicked off Warped Tour after alleged attack |publisher=Daily Bruin |date=2001-08-12 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The band [[Guttermouth]] was supposedly removed from the [[Warped Tour 2004]] for insulting [[Simple Plan]]. The band later stated that they left themselves due to "that '10 or so' unnamed bands didn't jive with [[Guttermouth]]'s way of doing business, and in some cases, threatened them with violence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=2782] {{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The band Islander was kicked off the tour after Mikey Carvajal jumping into a backline drum kit onstage and damaging it during their live set in Denver on July 1st.

===Sponsorship===
The Vans Warped Tour was sponsored by Vans, and in the final years Journeys joined as sponsor. Kevin Lyman was offered sponsorship from Calvin Klein before eventually working with Vans.&lt;ref name=Whitmire&gt;Whitmire, Margo. "Music: Touring-Warped Success Based on Selective Sponsorship." Billboard 20 Nov. 2004: 20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The tour also was sponsored by Samsung, which allowed the bands and fans to interact with one another. The schedule for the day was sent out to the fans the day of their show. Samsung also sponsored a reverse day care for the Warped tour, which allows parents to cool off and their children to watch their favorite bands.&lt;ref name=Whitmire/&gt; Warped Tour also partnered with other technology companies like Cingular Wireless, Apple Computer and many others.&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;Banerjee, Scott. "Warped Wins Tech Sponsors: Cingular, Samsung, Others Sign On." Billboard 31 July 2004: 43+. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows these companies to reach to younger audiences. The communications manager from Memorex stated that Warped Tour allows them to reach a younger demographic due because of the music that these people are "passionate about."&lt;ref name=Banerjee/&gt; At one point in time, Warped Tour also provided the attendees internet service while at the festival. Chaos Mobile was formed by Kevin Lyman and John Reese of Freeze Artist Management.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, Antony. "Digital Entertainment: Mogul- Mobile-Chaos Theory." Billboard 18 Nov. 2006: 16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism===
Activism was a major component of the Vans Warped Tour. Warped Tour allowed for non-profit organizations such as Invisible Children, [[To Write Love On Her Arms]], Shirts for a Cure, [[Keep A Breast Foundation]], and [[Hope For The Day]] to advocate about their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thewilsonbillboard.com/2018/08/farewell-warped-tour-1995-2018-its-okay-not-to-be-okay/|title=Farewell, Warped Tour (1995-2018): “It’s Okay Not to be Okay”|website=thewilsonbillboard.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes that were represented at Warped Tour were [[Music Saves Lives]] and Earth Echo. Earth Echo promotes recycling. They also provide a solar powered stage.&lt;ref name=Waddell&gt;Waddell, Ray. "On the Road: Vans Warped Tour Founder Honored." Billboard 7 Nov. 2009: 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Keep A Breast is another organization on the Vans Warped Tour. Keep A Breast educates women about Breast Cancer and preventative measures against the disease. This organization worked in conjunction with the Girlz Garage on the Vans Warped Tour. People who donate to the cause are given T-shirts signed by artists on the tour to spread awareness of Breast Cancer.&lt;ref&gt;"Good Works." Billboard 7 July 2007: 93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, it was announced that Warped Tour would be teaming up with A Voice For The Innocent to address the issue of sex crimes in the music scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avoicefortheinnocent.org |title=Home |publisher=A Voice For The Innocent |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===

The Vans Warped Tour contributed 25 cents from every ticket sold to an organization called Hollywood Heart. Warped Tour also gave money to the relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina. Warped Tour and the Taste of Chaos, (a festival) worked together to contribute $500,000&lt;ref name=Waddell/&gt;

===Musical equipment===

The bands on the Warped Tour often brought their own musical equipment. However, Industrial Sound also provided equipment for bands to use while on the Vans Warped Tour. Daniel Bonneau, the lead sound engineer, stated that Industrial Sound is a company that he "relies" on to provide equipment for the festival. Bonneau also states that the bands are not able to do traditional soundchecks and bands have to do line checks.&lt;ref name=Billboard&gt;Benzuly, Sarah, and Breean Lingle. "Vans Warped Tour". ''Billboard'' Sept. 2003: 76–77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official compilation albums==

[[File:Warped Tour moshing 2010-08-10 03.jpg|right|thumb|Attendees [[moshing]] in a circle pit on the 2010 tour.]]
An official Warped Tour compilation CD was released annually by [[SideOneDummy Records]] to coincide with the start of the tour. Prior to 1998 the official releases were handled by Vans via Uni Distribution in 1996 and [[Epitaph Records]] in 1997 respectively. The compilation included songs by numerous artists performing on the tour that year. The first few compilations had varying titles, but since 2001 the series has used a standard title with the format "Warped Tour &lt;year&gt; Tour Compilation." In 2002 the compilation expanded onto 2 CDs totalling 50 artists, a format which the series has followed in all subsequent years. The Warped Tour compilation album in 2002 charted at number 55.&lt;ref&gt;Mayfield, Geoff. "Over the Counter: Fondly Remembered." Billboard 26 June 2004: 82. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Congress of Soil Science''' (WCSS) is a conference held every four years (although interrupted by [[World War II]]) under the guidance of the [[International Union of Soil Sciences]] (IUSS). The purpose of a congress is to: (i) ensure the advancement of [[soil science]] and its application, and (ii) to handle the business of the society. Of the 18 congresses, eight have been held in Europe, five in the Americas, three in Asia, one in Australia and one in Africa. The congresses are only open to society members. The number of members attending has steadily increased, with approximately 2000 members attending each congress since the 15th WCSS in [[Acapulco]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="van Baren et al 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0016-7061(99)00097-X |title=75 years the International Society of Soil Science |journal=Geoderma |volume=96 |pages=1–18 |year=2000 |last1=Van Baren |first1=Hans |last2=Hartemink |first2=A.E |last3=Tinker |first3=P.B |bibcode=2000Geode..96....1V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th WCSS was held in the week of 1 to 6 August 2010&lt;ref name="iuss.org"&gt;[http://www.iuss.org/bull110files/19thwcss.htm International Union of Soil Sciences&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] at the [[Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre]]. The congress theme was ”''Soil solutions for a changing world''”.&lt;ref name="iuss.org"/&gt; The conference was organised by the IUSS President ([[Roger Swift]]) and Vice-President ([[Neal Menzies]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iuss.org/bull104files/presidentelect.htm IUSS Bulletin 104 (June 2004)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th WCSS was the second congress held in Australia (the 9th WCSS was held in [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]], in 1968), and was held in conjunction with the [[Australian Society of Soil Science Incorporated]].
The 20th WCSS was held from 8 to 13 June 2014 on [[Jeju-do]] Island, [[South Korea]]
The 21st WCSS was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.21wcss.org/index.php Rio de Janeiro 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Brazil]]) in August 2018. The upcoming WCSS are 2022 in [[Glasgow]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.soils.org.uk/wcss2022 Glasgow 2022]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]]) and 2026 in [[Nanjing]] ([[China]]).
