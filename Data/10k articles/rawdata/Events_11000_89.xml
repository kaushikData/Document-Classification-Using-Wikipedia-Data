[[File:1989 CPA 6083.jpg|thumb|Soviet stamp promoting the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students]]

'''The 13th World Festival of Youth and Students''' (WFYS) was held from 1–8 July 1989 for 8 days, in [[Pyongyang]], the capital of [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korea]], and was organized by the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]]. During the 1960s, the United States accused [[socialist countries]], which mainly held these events, of using this event to spread [[communist propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Kang, Induk 2015"&gt;Kang, Induk. "The Aftermath of the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students." East Asian Review 1.3 (n.d.): n. pag. Odyssey. Web. 1 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event in 1989 took four years of preparation by the [[North Korean government]], which effectively spent a quarter of the country’s yearly budget (4.5 billion) on it. North Korea built elaborate stadiums, shipped in Mercedes-Benzes to tote around foreigners, and undertook other expensive architectural projects.  Ultimately declared as the largest ever [[World Festival of Youth and Students]], about 22,000 people from 177 countries took part in the festival, including 100 people from the United States. For eight days starting on 1 July 1989, the students participated in  political discussions, sports competitions, and other activities.&lt;ref name="Kong D 2015"&gt;Oh, Kong D. "North Korea's Response to the World: Is the Door Ajar?" (n.d.): 1-16. RAND. Web. 19 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many accounts described the festival as a reaction to [[Seoul]]’s hosting of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], which North Korea boycotted.&lt;ref name="Lankov, Andrei 2011"&gt;Lankov, Andrei. "Asia Times Online :: Korea News and Korean Business and Economy, Pyongyang News." Asia Times Online :: Korea News and Korean Business and Economy, Pyongyang News. Asia Times, 13 Aug. 2011. Web. 19 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leading up to the event ==
North Korea went through years of planning and building in preparation for its rare moment of worldwide prominence, building massive stadiums and shipping in luxury goods. For this event, [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korea]] constructed monumental architectural projects such as [[Rungrado 1st of May Stadium|Rungnado May Day Stadium]], the world's largest stadium, which seats 150,000 people. The stadium was commissioned into service on 1 May 1989, in time for the festival.&lt;ref name="worldstadiums"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rungnado May First Stadium (May Day Stadium) |url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/architecture/stadium_design/pyongyang_may_day.shtml|website=WorldStadiums.com|publisher=World Stadiums|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The North Korean government also worked with a South Korean student organization, the National Council of Student Representatives (Jeondaehyeop), which was organized on 19 August 1987. The organization concentrated its efforts on getting South Korean participation in order to express its anti-US and pro-reunification commitment.&lt;ref name="Choi, Hyaeweol 1991"&gt;Choi, Hyaeweol. “The Societal Impact of Student Politics in Contemporary South Korea”. Higher Education 22.2 (1991): 175–188. Web...&lt;/ref&gt; The group secretly sent one of its members, [[Lim Su-kyung]], to the festival&lt;ref name="Choi, Hyaeweol 1991"/&gt;

Also in preparation for the event, the North Korean regime prohibited all disabled and short people from the festival village. The scheme was attributed to Pyongyang's attempt to outdo the South's hosting of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;"North Korean Defector Says Capital "Purged" of Short People for 1989 Festival." BBC Monitoring Asia PacificAug 20 2008.ProQuest. Web. 14 Nov. 2015 .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==

On 1 July 1989, about 22,000 young people from 177 countries gathered in the [[Rungrado May Day Stadium|May Day Stadium]] to inaugurate the festival.&lt;ref name="PETER M 1989"&gt;PETER M. "N. Korea Opens Doors to Stage Youth Festival." The Gazette: E11. Jul 02 1989. ProQuest. Web. 14 Nov. 2015 .&lt;/ref&gt; For eight days, the participants took part in social, cultural, sports and political activities.  The slogan of the festival was "For Anti-Imperialist Solidarity, Peace and Friendship".&lt;ref name="PETER M 1989"/&gt;

The Thirteenth festival held in North Korea was the first festival held in Asia and the first time the United States Department of Treasury allowed a group to travel to North Korea since the Korean War.&lt;ref name="PETER M 1989"/&gt; Throughout this delegation’s and others’ time in Korea however, the North Korean government imposed boundaries and restrictions on foreigners’ movements and behavior, as well as constant surveillance over its own population.

Danish activists caused a stir during the opening ceremony of the festival when they unfurled a banner criticizing North Korea’s human rights abuses. Two of the three activists were taken into custody but soon released.&lt;ref name="PETER M 1989"/&gt;

At the festival, well over 1,000 events took place, from round-table political discussions, solidarity rallies, and plenary sessions, to sports matches, artistic performances, film showings and visits around Pyongyang and beyond.&lt;ref name="Van Mersbergen 1992"&gt;Van Mersbergen, Audrey. "The Rhetorical Reduction of the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students." ''The Internet Archive''. N.p., Oct. 1992. Web. 14 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The political events of the festival primarily focused on anti-imperialist discussions as well as subjects such as peace and disarmament, nonalignment, human rights, and rights for youth and others.&lt;ref name="Kang, Induk 2015"/&gt; There were also frequent bilateral meetings arranged for two countries at a time to talk over issues of economic and political concern.

Each of the eight days of the festival was devoted to a specific theme:
*Opening ceremonies
*Peace
*Independence and national liberation struggles
*Environmental crisis
*Friendship and international solidarity
*Rights of youth and students
*Day of the host country
*Closing ceremonies&lt;ref name="Kang, Induk 2015"/&gt;

Pyongyang declined Seoul’s offer to contribute resources to festival events, particularly electronic equipment for the opening ceremony at the May Day Stadium.&lt;ref name="Kang, Induk 2015"/&gt;

===[[Lim Su-kyung]]’s participation===

The North Korean government greatly publicized South Korean student [[Lim Su-kyung]]’s presence at the festival. The South Korean government, then dominated by hardline anti-communists, banned the trip but Lim Su-kyung’s student association ignored the ban. Upon her arrival in Pyongyang, and throughout her time in North Korea, the public treated Lim like a celebrity: asking her questions about her ideology and broadcasting her activities during and after the visit. Dubbed the “Flower of Reunification”, Lim was hailed by the North Korean government as a hero who sacrificed herself at the altar of Korean reunification.&lt;ref name="Lankov, Andrei 2011"/&gt;

However, Lim’s public appearance also revealed the positive elements of being a South Korean youth.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, S.-Y. "Documenting the "Flower of Reunification": Lim Su-gyeong and the Memories of Korean Border Crossing." Memory Studies 6.2 (2013): 204-17. Web. 14 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the North Koreans’ understanding that South Koreans lived a repressed life ridden with unhappiness and starvation under the colonial rule of the United States, they observed a healthy and well-spoken youth who expressed a willingness to give unscripted political statements to high officials.

After the festival, Lim Su-kyung crossed the border back into South Korea, and the Southern government, as forewarned, imprisoned her.&lt;ref name="Kong D 2015"/&gt; The North Korean government then broadcast an interview with Lim Su-kyung’s family in Seoul to its general population. Instead of portraying the harshness of the South Korean regime, the North Korean government showed the family in a nice home.&lt;ref name="Kong D 2015"/&gt; To the puzzlement of the North Korea viewers, the family of the political criminal was not imprisoned and even allowed to stay in their home and keep their jobs.&lt;ref name="Kong D 2015"/&gt; 

Some historians have concluded that North Korea failed to represent the superiority and popularity of its ideology through Lim Su-kyung.&lt;ref name="Lankov, Andrei 2011"/&gt; She interacted with North Koreans and gave her opinions on controversial matters, ultimately to the chagrin of North Korean officials, since she unexpectedly demonstrated the positive aspects of living in a US-backed nation.&lt;ref name="Lankov, Andrei 2011"/&gt;

==Reception==

Contemporary news reports in the Western world in general saw the Thirteenth Festival of Youth and Students as a failed effort on the part of Kim Il Sung, and the North Korean government, to increase their standing in the international community.&lt;ref name="PETER M 1989"/&gt; Through constant surveillance of the population and other restrictions, the North Korean government attempted to shield its population from foreign influence, but inevitably the festival had an external impact on the home population.&lt;ref name="Kong D 2015"/&gt;

Twenty journalists from the United States attended the festival.&lt;ref name="Van Mersbergen 1992"/&gt; Nicholas Kristof recounted that “native North Koreans seem willing and happy to talk to foreigners, but conversations often sound exceedingly unnatural and fake and that it is rare for a minute to pass without a Korean offering praise to the 77-year-old ‘great leader’.”&lt;ref&gt;Kristof, Nicholas D. "North Korea Bids Hello to the World." The New York Times. The New York Times, 30 June 1989. Web. 19 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians, however, posit that reporters rhetorically reduced the coverage of the Festival of Youth and Students to the North Korea / South Korea issue and the regime of North Korea, failing to discuss the actual content of the festival.&lt;ref name="Van Mersbergen 1992"/&gt; From this perspective, reporters reducing the festival to a mere manipulation device for North Korea were guilty of the same qualities they sought to criticize.&lt;ref name="Van Mersbergen 1992"/&gt; Some claim this journalistic bias gave a skewed international perception of the true meaning of the festival.

==Historical significance==
Hosting the Youth Festival had long lasting consequences for the North Korean government and its worldwide standing. After funneling billions of dollars into the festival’s production, North Korea ended up owing five billion dollars in foreign debt and was considered bankrupt by creditor nations.&lt;ref name="Van Mersbergen 1992"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2017}} This damaged the country’s economy and external status. The extravagant expenditures put North Korea into a hole it could not get out of, exacerbated by unfavourable economic conditions in the next decade with the fall of the Soviet Union and subsequent famine.

Also, Lim Su-kyung as well as other representations of the outside world had unintended effects on the North Korean public. Contrary to some Western predictions that the inflow of foreign influence would contribute to North Korea’s openness, after the festival Pyongyang tightened its control over its population in order to “wipe out all the remnants of ‘foreign culture’”.&lt;ref name="Kang, Induk 2015"/&gt; Historians such as Induk Kang believe North Korea reasserted its isolationism because its survival depended on the control of information into the country.&lt;ref name="Kang, Induk 2015"/&gt;

Historian Andrei Lankov has concluded that even though the country increased information control after the festival, “this was the beginning of major changes” in the infiltration of foreign influence into North Korea, which led to a negative impact on the regime's political legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Lankov, Andrei 2011"/&gt; In the subsequent decade, advances in media technology and loosening of border controls with China caused further change in North Koreans’ perception of the outside world.

The Pyongyang Youth Festival is widely considered North Korea’s competitive reaction to the Seoul Olympics games, and ultimately the festival strained relations with South Korea. Yet prior to the festival, the media portrayed an optimistic outlook on Korean relations, largely due to the 7 July (1988) Declaration in which the South Korea president regarded North Korea as a co-partner for achieving mutual prosperity.&lt;ref name="Kang, Induk 2015"/&gt; However, following the Pyongyang festival, “these confrontational feelings between the north and south began spreading widely among the masses of both sides," according to Induk Kang&lt;ref name="Kang, Induk 2015"/&gt; After the festival, the South Korean president increased the stakes for reconciliation by demanding that the North change its political structure as a precondition to reunification, something usually only presented by the northern side.&lt;ref name="Kang, Induk 2015"/&gt; Therefore, the festival undermined previous reconciliation efforts between North and South Korea and caused them both to raise more uncooperative demands.

"'''1913 Massacre'''" is a [[Protest song|topical ballad]] written by [[Woody Guthrie]], and recorded and released in 1941 for [[Moses Asch|Moses Asch's]] [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] [[Record label|label]]. The song originally appeared on ''[[Struggle (Woody Guthrie album)|Struggle]]'', an album of labor songs. It was re-released in 1999 on ''[[The Asch Recordings|Buffalo Skinners: The Asch Recordings, Vol. 4]]'' and other albums. The song is about the death of [[Strike action|striking]] copper miners and their families in [[Calumet, Michigan|Calumet]], Michigan, on Christmas Eve, 1913, in what is commonly known as the [[Italian Hall disaster]].

==Background and writing==
[[File:Calumetvictims-1913.jpg|thumb|The victims of the 1913 massacre in rough caskets.]]

Throughout the 1940s, Guthrie recorded hundreds of discs for [[Moses Asch]], the founder of [[Folkways Records]]. One was “1913 Massacre”. According to [[Pete Seeger]], Guthrie was inspired to write the song after reading about the [[Italian Hall disaster]] in ''We Are Many'' (1940), the autobiography of Ella Reeve Bloor,  also known as [[Ella Reeve Bloor|Mother Bloor]], a labor activist whose granddaughter was married to Hollywood actor and activist Will Geer who performed with Guthrie in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062451699/grown-up-anger|title=Grown-Up Anger - Daniel Wolff - Hardcover|last=Wolff|first=Daniel|website=HarperCollins US|language=en|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie's notes indicate that he got the idea for the song "from the life of Mother Bloor",&lt;ref name="masacre"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1913massacre.com/song.html | title=Woody Guthrie's song | publisher=The Center for Independent Documentary; Film/Video Arts; Main Street Calumet | accessdate=July 10, 2011 | author=Louis Galdieri| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707061215/http://www.1913massacre.com/song.html| archivedate= July 7, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; an eyewitness to the events at [[Italian Hall]] on Christmas Eve, 1913.

A socialist and labor organizer from the East Coast, Bloor was in Calumet working on the miners' behalf with the Ladies Auxiliary of the [[Western Federation of Miners]]. She was assisted by [[Anna Clemenc|Annie Clemenc]], also known as "Big Annie of Calumet" – the "lady" in Guthrie's song who hollers "'there's no such a thing! / Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing.'"&lt;ref name="masacre" /&gt; Bloor tells the story of the Calumet strike and the Italian Hall disaster in the first half of a chapter called "Massacre of the Innocents."  She devotes the second half of the chapter to events in Ludlow, Colorado in 1914, the subject of another Guthrie song  —  "Ludlow Massacre."&lt;ref name="masacre" /&gt;

Guthrie's song echoes the language of Bloor's account in many places. The historian Arthur W. Thurner has found  similar accounts in English and Finnish-language newspapers from the period; these accounts, he says, probably originated with Clemenc.&lt;ref name="masacre" /&gt; (Many Finnish miners settled and worked in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, including Calumet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folkstreams.net/context,127|title=Cultural Tracks: Finnish Americans in Michigan|last=Folkstreams|date=2005-07-11|website=www.folkstreams.net|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

There are conflicting stories about what happened that Christmas Eve and who yelled "fire" in Italian Hall. These conflicts may never be resolved. They are, according to Thurner, evidence of a "war between capital and labor" in the Copper Country in 1913. This war included a dispute about what transpired that Christmas Eve in Italian Hall.&lt;ref name="masacre" /&gt;

The debate over what the event means (or should mean) is ongoing. Guthrie's song counts as one of the more powerful —and certainly one of the best-known – interpretations of the tragedy.&lt;ref name="masacre" /&gt; While "1913 Massacre" never became a folk standard, the song has been recorded and performed by many artists, including Guthrie's son Arlo; Ramblin' Jack Elliot; Scottish folksinger Alex Campbell; and Bob Dylan.&lt;ref name="masacre" /&gt;

Dylan performed "1913 Massacre" at Carnegie Chapter Hall in 1961. Dylan set his tribute to Guthrie —"Song To Woody" released in early 1962 — to the tune of "1913 Massacre."&lt;ref name="masacre" /&gt;

== Italian Hall disaster ==
{{Main|Italian Hall disaster}}

The song revolves around a [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] that took place on the evening of December 24, 1913, in Calumet's Italian Hall when more than five hundred striking miners and their families gathered for a Christmas party. The hall was on the second story and was reached by climbing a steep set of stairs. The only other exit was a poorly marked [[fire escape]] which could be reached by climbing out the windows.

The trouble began when someone yelled "[[Shouting fire in a crowded theater|fire!]]". Even though there was no fire, people panicked and rushed toward the steep stairway which led to the street entrance. Seventy-three people were trampled to death, including fifty-nine children.

Dylan used the tune to "1913 Massacre" when he wrote "Song to Woody"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dylan|first=Bob|title=Bob Dylan: Song to Woody|url=http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/song-to-woody|publisher=Sony Music Entertainment|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed "his debt to this great balladeer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hampton |first=Wayne |title=Guerrilla Minstrels: John Lennon, Joe Hill, Woody Guthrie, and Bob Dylan |year=1986 |publisher=The University of Tennessee Press |location=Knoxville, Tennessee |isbn=0-87049-489-9 |pages=157 |url=http://utpress.org/ |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719122046/http://utpress.org/ |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guthrie's song also inspired the documentary film "1913 Massacre"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://1913massacre.com/|title=1913 Massacre|website=1913 Massacre|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, released in 2011.

More recently, both songs are central to a book released in June, "Grown-Up Anger: The Connected Mysteries of Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, and the Calumet Massacre of 1913"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062451699/grown-up-anger|title=Grown-Up Anger - Daniel Wolff - Hardcover|last=Wolff|first=Daniel|website=HarperCollins US|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by Daniel Wolff.

Guthrie, meanwhile, might have drawn the melody for "1913 Massacre" from traditional folk songs including the English ballad, "To Hear The Nightingale Sing" (sometimes called "One Morning In May").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fresnostate.edu/folklore/ballads/FSWB306A.html|title=1913 Massacre|website=www.fresnostate.edu|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.originals.be/en/originals/10339|title=The Originals © by Arnold Rypens - NIGHTINGALE, THE|website=www.originals.be|language=en|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://folkworks.org/columns/how-can-i-keep-from-talking-ross-altman/21-columns/how-can-i-keep-from-talking-ross-altman/116-woody-guthries-advice-to-bob-dylan|title=Woody Guthrie|website=FolkWorks|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each constellation creates two tracks by means of long-distance dialogue in cyberspace. After two days of rehearsal the tracks are performed live at [[Spot (music festival)|SPOT Festival]] (June 5, 2008, in [[Aarhus]]) and [http://www.stromcph.dk STRØM Festival] (August 14, 2008, in [[Copenhagen]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aswitchboxtale.dk Official site for A Switch Box Tale]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Switch Box Tale is carried out by ROSA - The Danish Rock Council in collaboration with Cirius – a part of the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark]].

== Participating artists ==
Pharfar &amp; Cali P.&lt;br /&gt;
DJ, producer and singer [[Pharfar]] from the Copenhagen reggae scene ([[Bikstok Røgsystem]], Djosos Krost, etc.) has invited Swiss [[Cali P.]], who has his roots in Guadeloupe.

Donna Cadogan &amp; Malik Adouane&lt;br /&gt;
Danish [[Donna Cadogan]] is an experienced and versatile singer on the Danish pop/rock/soul stage, who will here take on Algerian-born, French resident [[Malik Adouane]], who brings his entire music tradition to SPOT – not least rai. A household name on clubs around the world.

As In RebekkaMaria &amp; Tez&lt;br /&gt;
In the course of this last year [[RebekkaMaria]] has made the transition from indie rock singer to artful electro pop princess. With the French human beat boxer Tez she has a partner who attracts international attention with his body language – and justly so. 

Varano/Moussa Diallo &amp; Mama Draba&lt;br /&gt;
For this project the Danish electronica star [[Morten Varano]] has teamed up with bassist [[Moussa Diallo]], who grew up in Mali but now lives in Denmark, to work with [[Mamba Draba]] with the clear and sonorous voice.

Philip Morris hired APCO Worldwide, a communications consultancy with expertise in [[crisis management]], handling sensitive political issues, lobbying, media relations, coalition building, opinion research, market entry, [[corporate social responsibility]], and online communication. &lt;ref group=notes&gt;Many APCO executives were previously prominent government officials. APCO’s clientele consists of multi-national corporations, governments, associations and nonprofit organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;  APCO's designed strategies for TASSC aimed at establishing TASSC as "a credible source for reporters when questioning the validity of scientific studies" and to "Encourage the public to question – from the grassroots up – the validity of scientific studies".&lt;ref name=APCOsept1993&gt;{{cite report|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/eqa35e00/pdf|title=Proposed Plan for the Public Launching of TASSC|date=September 1993|series=Philip Morris, Bates |number=2024233709/3717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PR firm known as APCO began life as a real-estate investment subsidiary for the legal partners in the law-firm Arnold &amp; Porters. It was originally identified as A&amp;P Co, which was converted into a specialist PR front to service Philip Morris, the major client of Arnold &amp; Porters who serviced the cigarette company at the boardroom level.  A&amp;P then hired [[Margery Kraus]] to run the new company, and it expanded rapidly through its tobacco-funded activities, successively becoming APCo, APCO, then APCO &amp; Associates, and finally APCO Worldwide.

=== Philip Morris &amp; APCO ===

Tobacco document archives include a section on Philip Morris which is entitled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''Goals and objectives:'''
The overall goals of the media plan are to:
# raise the awareness level of the use of unsound science in public policy decision making among target audiences; 
# educate publics on the impact of this issue; and
# lay the groundwork and provide an environment for a successful grassroots mobilization effort to assist (the Tobacco Company) Philip Morris with its issues nationally and in target states.

The objectives of the media plan are to: 
* Establish TASSC as a credible source for reporters when questioning the validity of scientific studies. Encourage the public to question-from the grassroots up-the validity of scientific studies. 
* Mobilize support for TASSC through alliances with other organizations and third-party allies. 
* Develop materials, including news article reprints, that can be {{sic|"merchandized"}} to TASSC audiences. Increase membership in and funding of TASSC. Publicize and refine TASSC messages on an ongoing basis."&lt;ref name=ATCO1993/&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

TASSC's original goal was to become a "publicly known, respected and highly visible organization"&lt;ref name=ATCO1993/&gt; within months of its creation by using an "integrated program that combines a strategic, comprehensive media relations program.&lt;ref name=ATCO1993/&gt;

The strategies developed by APCO Worldwide (specifically for Philip Morris) and applied through '''The Advancement of Sound Science Center (TASSC)''', were highly effective and continue to be successfully used today by many organisations seeking to counter published peer-reviewed mainstream scientific research which might be used in formulating public policies. [[APCO Worldwide]] focused on unsettling the general public's confidence in the validity of mainstream scientific research in a series of well-planned public education campaigns.  They strategically targeted mainstream media with junk-science claims about scientific reports (for example,  claims about health and environmental risks that required regulatory policies).

===Astroturfing===
This methodology is now called [[astroturfing]] -- generally uses so-called "think-tanks", and it works through coordinated local activism, "information sharing" and the strategic creation by APCO and its associates of seeded grassroots organizations. Under APCO's advice, TASSC developed local coalitions, making them appear to be indigenous grass roots organizations, and used them to influence media, legislators, and the public, and in some cases, to recruit scientists and researchers to support Philip Morris's pro-smoking position. TASSC promoted itself as "a not-for-profit coalition advocating the use of sound science in public policy decision making."&lt;ref name=TASSCBates&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/zyh09e00/pdf|format=PDF|publisher=The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition|title=Untitled Information Sheet Describing TASSC|author=Bates|id=Bates Number: 2046989061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TASSC's links to the tobacco industry remained hidden for decades: APCO's strategy was for TASSC to appear to be an independent national grassroots coalition.&lt;ref name=Ong_Glantz2001/&gt;  To conceal this relationship, TASSC broadened the focus to question the validity of other scientific concerns, notably [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=Monbiot2007&gt;{{cite AV media|author=George Monbiot|title=''Mad Science'' interview by Brooke Gladstone |date=&lt;!-- 6 --&gt;July 2007|publisher=Media, WNYC, NPR Public Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monbiot2006&gt;{{cite news |work=The Guardian  | first = George | last = Monbiot | authorlink = George Monbiot | title = The Denial Industry | date= 19 September 2006 | accessdate =11 August 2010 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/19/ethicalliving.g2 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coopting the media===
Op-eds and other merchandised articles which targeted the lay reader (although written by academics), were circulated to the media  in a ready-to-scan/print form by the [[pro-tobacco lobby]].  These were circulated in apparent response to current issues that had attracted public attention, but they often cited similar mass media articles on [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], which was the fundamental motivation behind the duplicity.  Such material could be rapidly circulated to local media through affiliated associations, provided it appeared to be independent journalism. TASSC's role was to question the public acceptance of science in general, rather than risk being identified with the cigarette companies.

The concept of merchandised-article proofs being circulated for free to small newspapers is adopted by many groups to successfully question peer-reviewed science and professional scientific associations and institutions in areas such as [[environmental science]] on issues including [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[pesticide]]s, and [[global warming]]. This program was  operated most successfully by [[Steven Milloy]].&lt;ref name="tnr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freepress.net/news/print.php?id=13581 |title=Smoked Out: Pundit For Hire|last=Thacker|first=Paul D.|date=27 January 2006|work=The New Republic|publisher=The New Republic|page=1|accessdate=23 July 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060719211120/http://www.freepress.net/news/print.php?id=13581 |archivedate = 19 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
TASSC was created in 1993 by the [[APCO Worldwide]] public relations firm, and was funded by tobacco company Philip Morris (now [[Altria Group|Altria]]) to help fight against smoking regulations.&lt;ref name=Ong_Glantz2001/&gt; TASSC's links to the tobacco industry were minimized as part of APCO's strategy to "establish an image of a national grassroots coalition."&lt;ref name=Monbiot2006/&gt;

The group has been described as an effort by tobacco companies who "wanted to cast grave doubts on government scientists' capacity to produce fair research", and who "quietly formed a coalition of industries that would challenge every aspect of government science, from its studies of [[global warming]] to [[auto safety]]."&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Foer (2004 ) referred to top EPA officials quietly blocking "dissemination of a report in 2003 analyzing the efficacy of congressional legislation limiting the release of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. The administration quashed the report because it would have highlighted the necessity of imposing regulations it opposes."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewRepublic12july2004&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/closing-the-presidential-mind|title=Closing of the Presidential Mind|author=Franklin Foer|date=12 July 2004|publisher=[[The New Republic|New Republic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monbiot2006/&gt;

* [[Michael Fumento]] – advisory board member&lt;ref name=about/&gt;
* [[Bruce Ames]] – advisory board member&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
TASSC was parodied in the 2005 film ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'', in which the protagonist was a spokesperson for the "Academy of Tobacco Studies", an industry-funded lobby group dedicated to studying the effects of tobacco smoking with consistently inconclusive results.

In [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s novel ''[[Flight Behavior]]'' (2012), a scientist criticises a journalist (Tina Ultner) denying climate change and explains:&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Kingsolver]], ''[[Flight Behavior|Flight Behaviour]]'', Faber and Faber Limited, 2012, pages 508-509 ({{ISBN|978-0-571-29081-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Block quote|Convince me, Tina. You are letting public relations firm write your scripts for you. The same outfit that spent a decade manufacturing doubts for you about the smoking-and-cancer ''contention''. Do you people never learn' it's the same damned company, Tina, the Advancement of Sound Science. Look it up, why don't you. They went off the [[Altria|Phillip Morris]] payroll and into the [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]] pocket.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">'''Archaeological forgery''' is the manufacture of supposedly ancient items that are sold to the antiquities market and may even end up in the collections of museums. It is related to [[art forgery]].

A string of archeological forgeries have usually followed news of prominent [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]]s. Historically, famous excavations like those in [[Crete]], [[Valley of the Kings]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Pompeii]] have caused the appearance of a number of forgeries supposedly spirited away from the dig. Those have been usually presented in the open market but some have also ended up in museum collections and as objects of serious historical study.

In recent times, forgeries of pre-Columbian pottery from the South America have been very common. Other popular examples include Ancient Egyptian earthenware and supposed ancient Greek gold. There have also been paleontological forgeries like [[archaeoraptor]].

==Motivations==

Most archaeological forgeries are made for reasons similar to art forgeries&amp;nbsp;– for financial gain. The monetary value of an item that is thought to be thousands of years old is higher than if the item were sold as a souvenir.

However, archaeological or paleontological forgers may have other motives; they may try to manufacture proof for their point of view or favorite theory (or ''against'' a point of view/theory they dislike), or to gain increased fame and prestige for themselves. If the intention is to create "proof" for religious history, it is [[pious fraud]].

==Detection==

Investigators of archaeological forgery rely on the tools of archaeology in general. Since the age of the object is usually the most significant detail, they try to use [[radiocarbon dating]] or [[neutron activation analysis]] to find out the real age of the object.

==Criticisms of antiquities trade==

Some [[historian]]s and [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]s have strongly criticized the [[antiquities]] trade for putting profit and art collecting before the scientific accuracy and veracity. This, in effect, favours the archaeological forgery. Allegedly some of the items in prominent museum collections are of dubious or at least of unknown origin. Looters who rob archaeologically important places and supply the antiquities market are rarely concerned with exact dating and placement of the items. Antique dealers may also embellish a genuine item to make it more saleable. Sometimes traders may even sell items that are attributed to nonexistent cultures.

As is the case with art forgery, scholars and experts don't always agree on the authenticity of particular finds. Sometimes an entire research topic of a scholar may be based on finds that are later suspected as forgeries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''Bluegrass Beeg''' is an annual one-day music festival which was initially held in 2013 in the village [[Grevenbicht]], Netherlands.
This festival is held in October. Grevenbicht is a village in the far south of the Netherlands, near to the border of Belgium and Germany. Musicians from countries in Europe and around the world travel to meet and perform. During the festival about 10 bands or 40 musicians perform. Every year the Bluegrass Beeg attracts 500 to 600 visitors. Bluegrass Beeg is organized by ''Foundation AutiVriendelijk Limburg''.

== Format and design of the festival==
During the bluegrass festival there are stage performances that take place in the public room of the building 'Oos Hoes'. The bluegrass bands from Europe participate in a battle to win the Bluegrass Beeg award. The public votes to determine who is the best band and gave the best performance.

Parallel to the festival, workshops dealing with bluegrass are performed by renowned European and American bluegrass musicians. There are also activities and workshops for children of all ages. Bluegrass Beeg strives to be a family oriented bluegrass event as well.

Near the location is a public [[parking lot]] which can be used. Musicians and public use the parking lot to play together. Bluegrass Beeg supplies its attendees with around the clock first aid volunteers, security and a transportation system to and from the festival.

The festival is Autism-friendly organized. This means that necessary measurements are taken for people to be able to enter the festival safely as a visitor, a volunteer or as an artist. The format of the festival helps people with autistic qualities to participate active or passive in an international social society.

== Background ==
In the Netherlands there is a relative small group approximately 2000 persons busy with bluegrass music.
In the Autumn of 2013 the first autism friendly took place. In 2013 the next countries participated: [[Belgium]], [[Germany]] and [[Netherlands]]. In the first year ten Bluegrassbands performed one or more times. This festival sets an example for local 'Picking Parties' organized through the year.

Bluegrass originates from Northern America. Therefore the main language is English. Among others a few big names in the world of Bluegrass are [[Bill Monroe]], [[Earl Scruggs]] and [[Lester Flatt]]. More musicians can be found at the [[List of bluegrass musicians]].

In Europe there is a chain of Bluegrass festivals. An overview made by EBMA in 2011 can be found at [[List of European Bluegrass Festivals]].

{{Violence against Muslims in India}}
The '''Bombay riots''' usually refers to the riots in Mumbai, in December 1992 and January 1993, in which around 700 people died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/the-mumbai-riots-in-historic-context/article3395359.ece|title=The Mumbai riots in historic context}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/column/jyoti-punwani-why-theres-no-noise-about-the-mumbai-riots/20140204.htm|title=Why there's no noise about the Mumbai riots}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riots were mainly due to escalations of hostilities after large scale violent protests by Muslims in reaction to the 1992 [[Demolition of the Babri Masjid|Babri Masjid Demolition]] by Hindu Karsevaks in [[Ayodhya]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabrang.com/srikrish/vol1.htm|title=CHAPTER I|work=sabrang.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigative [[Srikrishna Commission|commission]] was formed under Justice [[B.N. Srikrishna]], but the recommendations of the Inquiry were not enacted.&lt;ref name="hindu"/&gt;

Many scholars stated that the riots were allegedly pre-planned, and that the Hindu rioters were allegedly granted access to information about the locations of Muslim homes and businesses through sources that were not public.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Ogden.

==History==
The riots started as a result of communal tension prevailing in the city after the [[Demolition of Babri Masjid|Babri Mosque demolition]] on 6 December 1992. The Shrikrishna Commission identified '''two phases''' to the riots. '''''The first''''' was mainly a Muslim backlash as a result of the Babri Masjid demolition in the week immediately succeeding 6 December 1992 led by political leaders representing Hindutva in the city of [[Ayodhya]]. '''''The second phase''''' was a Hindu backlash occurring as a result of the killings of Hindu Mathadi Kamgar (workers) by Muslim fanatics in Dongri (an area of South Bombay), stabbing of Hindus in Muslim majority areas and burning of six Hindus, including a physically handicapped girl in Radhabai Chawl. This phase occurred in January 1993, with most incidents reported between 6 and 20 January.

The Report asserted that the communal passions of the Hindus were aroused to fever pitch by the inciting writings in print media, particularly Saamna and Navaakal which gave exaggerated accounts of the Mathadi murders and the Radhabai Chawl incident; rumours were floated that there were imminent attacks by Muslims using sophisticated arms, though the possibility of it happening was very imminent.{{clarify|date=October 2014}} From 8 January 1993, many riots occurred between Hindus led by the Shiv Sena and the Muslims funded by the Mumbai underworld at that time. The communal violence and rioting triggered off by the burning  at Dongri and Radhabhai Chawl and then the retaliatory violence by Shiv Sena was hijacked by local criminal elements who saw in it an opportunity to make quick gains. By the time the right wing Hindu organization Shiv Sena realised that enough had been done by way of "retaliation", the violence and rioting was beyond the control of its leaders who had to issue an appeal to put an end to it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /

==The events as listed by the Srikrishna Commission==

===6 December 1992===
News of the demolition of [[Babri Masjid]] spread by 1430 hours on 6 December 1992. Muslims angered by this act felt that Islam was in imminent danger since proponents of the Hindu nation had been allowed to destroy, under the very nose of the armed forces, the Babri Masjid, despite assurances and undertakings by the Uttar Pradesh state Government and the Government of India that no harm would be permitted to be caused to the Babri Masjid during kar seva at Ayodhya on 6 December 1992. The extensive media coverage, particularly on television, of footage of file pictures of previous kar seva during which some of the kar sevaks were seen dancing on the dome of the Masjid, as well as the latest video shots showing actual demolition of the Babri Masjid, caused a sense of deep resentment. The demolition of the Babri Masjid provided enough fuel to excite, ignite and exploit the sentimentalities of Islamists. Muslims were proselytised by these exploitative elements that the Establishment and the Government had an active hand in the destruction, since it was not able to prevent the same.

Rumours abounded that alleged members of certain Hindutva parties were seen to be celebrating the demolition of Babri structure. Muslims protested violently on the streets. Large number of Muslims congregated near Minara Masjid in Pydhonie jurisdiction at about 2320 hours on 6 December 1992 and came out protesting frenziedly despite Mumbai being located in the unrelated state of Maharashtra. The first targets of the rioting mob became the municipal vans and the constabulary, both visible signs of the government.

Activists of Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena jumped into the fray, and escalated communal passion, as seen from their act of stopping the vehicles on roads in the jurisdiction of V.P. Road Police Station.

In Nirmal Nagar jurisdiction, a Ganesh idol in the Ganesh Mandir on Anant Kanekar Marg was found moved out from its place of installation though the lock on the grill surrounding the sanctum sanctorum was found intact. This was noticed at about 2345 hours. Though at the time the incident happened there were no immediate clues as to the identity of the miscreants, it was widely suspected that Muslim fanatics were behind it.

In the jurisdiction of Deonar, there was a sharp counter–reaction by Muslims who stoned the house of a local Bharatiya Janata Party leader. Tensions escalated.

===7 December 1992===
From 7 December 1992 onwards there was a qualitative transformation in the situation. Large mobs of Muslims came on the streets and there was recourse taken to violence without doubt. The Muslim mobs appeared to have come out with the intention of mounting violent attacks as noticed from their preparedness with weapons of offence. There were violent attacks on the policemen in Muslim dominated areas like Bhendi Bazar and its vicinity. The jurisdictional areas affected were mostly Muslim dominated or mixed localities. The situation further worsened when Hindu youth beat up the rioting Muslims, leading to a situation where the police found it difficult to restrain both sections; when the police did it by force, the police came to be attacked by both Hindu and Muslim mobs.

By this time the protest had degenerated into a full–scale communal riot between Hindus and Muslims.{{POV statement|date=May 2013}} Eleven Hindu houses in different jurisdictions were damaged, demolished or set on fire. The Hindus did not fall behind and damaged mosques and [[madrasas]] in different jurisdictions. BEST buses in the Bombay Central Bus Depot and BEST bus stops became easy targets for the Muslim mobs and were damaged and/or set on fire.

Two constables in Deonar jurisdiction were killed with choppers and swords by the rampaging Muslims. While one lay on the ground bleeding to death, the body of another was dragged and thrown into the garbage heap from where it was recovered seven days later. One constable was done to death in Byculla jurisdiction. Several police officers and policemen who bravely attempted to stem the tide sustained injuries in mob action.

In Mahim, two police personnel, HC Zarande of Crime Branch, CID, and Police Sub–Inspector Salunke of Juhu Police Station, were proceeding on a motorcycle when attacked by a Muslim mob of 400–500 with soda–water bottles and stones, resulting in injuries to them. The area around L.J. Road and nearby roads were strewn with shattered glass and stones with riotous Muslim mobs running around shouting "''Allah-hu-Akbar''"  and indiscriminately throwing stones in Kapad Bazar. To maintain law and order, police resorted to firing which resulted in injuries to two Muslims. Seven police personnel were injured in the riot and the motorcycle was completely damaged.

Jogeshwari area, which has been the hotbed of frequent communal riots saw serious riots at the junction of Pascal Colony and Shankar Wadi. A police officer on duty received a bullet injury in his head and died subsequently, though it cannot be said with certitude that it was a case of private firing. The police recovered large number of iron rods, sickles, choppers, knives and soda water bottles from different jurisdictions indicating that there was intention and preparations to carry on the communal riots.

A violent Muslim mob ransacked a Police chowky at Maulana Shaukat Ali Road and physically assaulted one Police constable, Pandit Malhari Ahire. Ahire was attacked with swords and choppers and suffered grievous injuries. At about the same time a huge Muslim mob of about 4,000–5,000 collected on Maulana Shaukat Ali Road and in the lanes and by–lanes of the area. The mob went on damaging and destroying the vehicles and public property and indulged in indiscriminate stone throwing. Ahire’s life was saved by prompt action by Senior Police Inspector Pawar along with other officers who carried on firing to restore peace.

===8 December 1992===
On 8 December 1992 communal rioting and communal violence spread to 33 jurisdictions, the number of clashes of rioting mobs with police as well as rioting mobs inter se increased alarmingly. Attacks on places of worship also continued. Shiv Sena systematically attacked Muslim men, women and children during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communal Violence and the Denial of Justice|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/India1.htm#P334_76340|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police had to resort to firing in 43 cases resulting in the death of 11 Hindus, 31 Muslims and three others. There were several cases of mob violence, stabbing and arson. One temple in Dharavi, one in Deonar, one in Park Site and one in Saki Naka were attacked. Simultaneously, two mosques in Dharavi, one madrasa in Mahim and Bhoiwada each and one dargah in Dadar were also attacked.

Though the police found their resources stretched, they were unwilling to take the help of army for carrying out operational duties. Army columns were used only to carry out flag marches which had little impact on the, by now hardened and emboldened, rioters. The imposition of curfew from the night of 7 December 1992 also did not appear to deter the clashing mobs in view of its effete enforcement. Police intervention came about by resort to fire on 72 occasions, killing 15 Hindus and 72 Muslims and injuring 131 Muslims and one Christian.

===9 December 1992===
The situation improved for better and the number of cases of mob violence, stabbing, arson and rioting showed a downward trend. The number of occasions when the police had to resort to firing dropped to 28. The police firing resulted in deaths of 17 persons (five Hindus and 12 Muslims) while 3 Hindus, 12 Muslims and six others sustained injuries. Thirty–four cases of arson resulting in loss of property and injuries to one Hindu and 10 Muslims were reported from different jurisdictions. One temple in Ghatkopar, 3 mosques in Trombay and one kabrastan in Jogeshwari were subjected to attack by violent mobs.

===10 December 1992===
The situation improved further with the number of police stations affected coming down to four, though serious communal riots occurred in Dharavi and Mahim police jurisdictions to control which the police had to fire on three and two occasions respectively. Two Muslims were injured in police firing within the jurisdiction of Mahim.

===11 December 1992===
On this day there was one case of private firing in Azad Maidan jurisdiction in which one Muslim died and four Muslims were injured. However, there was further improvement in overall situation. There was no occasion for police to resort to firing, though 23 different police stations appear to have been affected in varying degrees.

===12 December 1992===
The situation showed further improvement and the number of police stations affected came down to 14, though there also the occurrences were stray. There were three instances of police firing, one each in Ghatkopar, Bhandup and Dindoshi in which one Hindu and one Muslim were injured. Mob violence took the toll of one life. There were six cases of stabbing in which 1 Hindu and two Muslims died and one Hindu and one Muslim sustained injuries. There were eight stray cases of arson. Four dead bodies, all of Muslims, having multiple stab wounds on vital organs and in highly decomposed condition, were recovered from a gutter in Golibar area.

In yet another incident, one was found murdered with her throat slit and her body was dumped in the open compound of National Girls’ High School adjoining Behrampada.

The December phase of the rioting petered out by 12 December 1992. The police appeared to have regained grip on the law and order situation and peace appeared to have returned. However, beneath the surface there was simmering discontent and seething anger amongst the Muslims that unduly excessive police firing had resulted in large number of Muslim casualties. Media had criticised the police for having used unnecessary and excessive fire–power, going so far as to suggest that Muslims were intentionally targeted and selectively killed. This refrain was repeated by political leaders and ministers, past and current. The explanation of the commissioner of police that the aggressive and violent mobs in the initial stages comprised Muslims and therefore, Muslim casualties were higher. Considering it from all aspects, the Commission was not inclined to give serious credence to the theory that dis–proportionately large number of Muslim deaths in December 1992 was necessarily indicative of an attempt on the part of the police to target and liquidate Muslims because of bias.

===12 December 1992 to 5 January 1993===
On 20 December 1992, two Muslims were locked inside a room in Goregaon jurisdiction, and the room was set on fire as a result of which they suffered severe burns resulting in the death of one.

Two bodies, one of a male Hindu and another identified as that of a uniformed Muslim police constable attached to the Nasik Rural Police Headquarters, were recovered from the septic tank of the public latrine in Behrampada on 20 and 21 December 1992 respectively. These bodies bore multiple stab injuries. It would appear that there was a systematic attempt to stab and murder Hindus and the policeman, though a Muslim, became a victim of the anger of the Muslims directed against the uniform worn by him.

On 24/25 December 1992 one Mathadi worker was killed in Dongri area. Though subsequent investigation by police resulted in arrest of the accused who was an alcoholic and whose motive was far from communal, at the material time the immediate reaction was that the killing was done of a Muslim.

The fires under the simmering cauldron were continuously stoked by communal activities even after the active phase of the December 1992 riots was over. There was a sudden spurt in attendance at Friday namaaz in mosques, which was interpreted by the Hindu as ominous and evidencing intent to seek revenge on the part of Muslims. This was because it was alleged that the namaaz were used as occasions for delivering instigatory communal speeches. The Hindus replied with Maha aartis (Great Hindu worship of the God), in an ostensible response against the sudden spurt in namaaz on streets. The Maha aartis were started from 26 December 1992 were viewed as a direct challenge to the Muslims, and endangered the fragile peace which had been established, with allegations that participants of the Maha aartis indulged in rioting. The Maha aartis continued unabated throughout January 1993 and came to an end only by or about the first week of February 1993.

The last week of December 1992 and first week of January 1993, particularly between 1 and 5 January, saw a series of stabbing incidents in which both Hindus and Muslims were victims, though the majority of such incidents took place in Muslim dominated areas of South Bombay and a majority of victims were Hindus{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. The stabbings appeared to be executed with professional accuracy intended to kill the victims{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. The killers had not been then identified in several cases, though it was presumed, at least in the cases where the Hindus were victims, that the killers were Muslims and vice versa. The motive for the stabbings appears to have been to whip up communal frenzy between Hindus and Muslims. Some of the Muslim criminal elements operating in South Bombay, like Salim Rampuri and Firoz Konkani, have been identified as the brains behind the stabbing incidents{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. That they were Muslim criminals was publicised in the media, and it was general opinion that the Muslims were keen on resuming aggression.

On 25 December 1992 a pamphlet in Urdu language was distributed around Jama Masjid in Mahim area. This pamphlet was communally provocative and incited Muslims to fight against Hindus and calls upon the Muslims to the construct the Babri Masjid if necessary, with blood.

On 1 January 1993 there was an article in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Saamna under the caption "''Hindunni Akramak Vhayala Have''" (Hindus must be aggressive now), openly inciting Hindus to violence.

On 2 January 1993 a number of Muslim hutments in M.P. Mill Compound in Tardeo jurisdiction were set on fire. On the same day there was an incident in Dharavi jurisdiction in which two Muslims were assaulted with iron rods by Hindus.

On 4 January 1993 a big mob of Hindus led by Gajanan Kirtikar, Ramesh More and other Shiv Sena activists took a morcha to the Jogeshwari Police Station complaining of lack of security for Hindus. Some of the people in the morcha attacked Chacha Nagar Masjid and the Muslims in the vicinity and killed them. Several Muslim huts in Magdum Nagar in Mahim jurisdiction were set on fire by Hindus.

On the night of 5 January 1993 a worker employed in the godown of Vijay Transport Company who was sleeping in the godown went to the street to relieve himself. Suddenly, he was set upon by miscreants who stabbed him to death. Three more workers who came out of the godown to help him were also stabbed to death. The murders of the workers created tremendous tension in the area. The workers' Union called for a Bandh. Huge meetings were held which were addressed by leaders of Unions. Speeches were made during this meeting to condemn the police and Government for their ineffectiveness with exhortations that Hindus might have to pick up swords to defend themselves if the police failed to protect them. At the time when these murders of workers took place, neither the police, nor the public, had a clue as to the identity of the killers, which came to be established much later. Nonetheless, the Hindus spearheaded by the Shiv Sena kicked up a furore that the murders had been committed by Muslims, virtually giving a call for arms, killing 10 Muslims. On 5/6 January 1993 the workers gave a call for bandh of wholesale markets, which also gave immense publicity to the murders of the workers allegedly by Muslims.

===6 January 1993 to 20 January 1993===
On 6 January 1993 there were several cases of stabbing in Dongri, Pydhonie, V.P. Road and Nagpada jurisdictions in which the victims were innocent pedestrians who were stabbed. Cases of stabbing, arson, mob violence and attacks on private and Government properties occurred in Dongri, Pydhonie, V.P. Road, Nagpada, Tardeo, Mahim, Dharavi, Nirmal Nagar, Chembur and Kherwadi police stations. Most of the stabbing cases occurred in isolated lanes and bye–lanes and by the time police arrived on the scene, the miscreants would vanish. In all, 18 cases of stabbing were reported by the evening of this day of which were from Pydhonie, two from Dharavi, two from V.P. Road, two from Nagpada and one each from Nirmal Nagar, Kherwadi and Andheri. These stabbing cases resulted in one Hindu, one Muslim and two others being killed and 1 Hindu, one Muslim and one other being injured. Mob violence accounted for the deaths of one Hindu and one Muslim and injuries to nine Hindus and eighteen Muslims. Rumours of further imminent riots swept the city and the police were unable to scotch them. Despite repeated denials of such rumours by the police, the public did not believe them.

The situation in Mahim went out of control at 2100 hours. Hindus attacked Muslims in Muslim pockets in Mahim area and killed them, led by Shiv Sena Corporator, Milind Vaidya, and a police constable, Sanjay Gawade, openly carrying a sword. There were serious riots in which frenzied mobs of Hindus and Muslims attacked each other.

===7 January 1993===
The violence and riots spread to several parts of the city. There were more deaths and more stabbings and 16 police station areas (Pydhonie, Dongri, Agripada, Gamdevi, V.P. Road, Byculla, Bhoiwada, Nagpada, Kherwadi, Nehru Nagar, Kurla, Deonar, Trombay, Bandra, Vakola and Jogeshwari) were affected by serious riots. The stabbing incidents resulted in deaths of 16 Hindu and four Muslims and injured 3 Hindus and twelve Muslims.

Eleven cases of mob violence occurred in different jurisdictional areas, killing two Muslims and injuring two Hindus and two Muslims. Seven cases of arson were reported on that day in which, apart from huge property loss, two Muslims were killed; two Hindus and two Muslims were injured. The police resorted to firing on four occasions, resulting in injuries to 3 Hindus and 5 Muslims. Violent mobs of Hindus and Muslims kept attacking each other and the police when they tried to intervene.

The mobs also created roadblocks to prevent the police and fire-brigade from reaching the sites of incidents for rendering assistance. A taxi in which three Muslims were travelling was set on fire by Shiv Sena workers in Pratiksha Nagar, Antop Hill jurisdiction, resulting in the 2 Muslims being burnt alive.

===8 January 1993===
A gruesome incident occurred during the wee hours of 8 January 1993, at about 0030 hours, one of the Hindu residences in a chawl popularly known as Radhabai Chawl in Jogeshwari jurisdiction were locked from outside and set on fire by miscreants. One male and two female members of a Hindu family (Bane) were charred to death. One of the victims was a physically handicapped girl.

The Hindu backlash commenced. The communal riots spread to the jurisdictions of Pydhonie, Dongri, Jogeshwari, M.R.A. Marg, L.T. Marg, V.P. Road, D.B. Marg, Gamdevi, Nagpada, Agripada, Byculla, Kala Chowki, N.M. Joshi Marg, Worli, Bhoiwada, Dadar, Mahim, Dharavi, Kurla, Nehru Nagar, Trombay, Chembur, Bandra, Nirmal Nagar, Ghatkopar, Vikhroli, Parksite, Vakola, Oshiwara, D.N. Nagar, Jogeshwari and Aarey sub–police stations.

Sixty–six stabbing cases were reported from different jurisdictions, in which 3 Hindu, 37 Muslims and two others were killed and injuries caused to several Muslims. Forty–eight cases of mob violence occurred in which sixteen Muslims were killed and 4 Hindus and 17 Muslims and one other received injuries. Thirty–one cases of arson were reported which, apart from causing loss of property, resulted in deaths of two Muslims and injuries to five Muslims and one Hindu.

A dargah and mosque in Pydhonie jurisdiction, a kabrastan and a madrassa in Jogeshwari jurisdiction and a temple in Byculla jurisdiction were attacked and damaged. Police resorted to firing on 31 occasions in different jurisdictions resulting in the killing of six Hindus and 18 Muslims and injuries to 10 Hindus and 24 Muslims and one other. Several raids conducted by the police resulted in seizure of weapons of offence like broken tube lights, swords, petrol bombs and daggers.

That the rioters had become defiant and the authority of the police was considerably eroded, appeared clear when a crude bomb was hurled at the police commissioner's car from one of the buildings in Pydhonie jurisdiction and exploded on the road. The commissioner of police and his staff had a lucky escape, though the severity of the explosion caused a big dent on the road. Eleven army columns were deployed by the police to do Flag March in different areas. Curfew was imposed in areas where it was considered necessary.

===9 January 1993===
The riots continued unabated in 43 police station jurisdictions. Fifty–seven cases of stabbing resulting in death of five Hindus and 18 Muslims and injuries to 7 Hindus, 41 Muslims and one other, were reported. Ninety–seven cases of mob violence occurred in various parts of the city resulting in the death of one Hindu and sixteen Muslims and injures to 9 Hindus and 24 Muslims. Seventy-three cases of arson were reported from different jurisdictions which caused loss of property, death of a Hindu and six Muslims and injures to two Hindus and six Muslims.

In Pydhonie jurisdiction, few rounds were fired at a police picket from the Suleman Bakery rooftop. The policemen climbed to the terrace of the Taj Book Depot, a neighbouring building, and sighted 8 – 10 persons hiding behind the water tank on the bakery rooftop. Inspector Anant Ingale shouted warnings and fired a few shots from his service revolver, but his party was no match to the automatic weapon wielding group. Joint Commissioner of Police R. D. Tyagi arrived with the Special Operations Squad (SOS), and demanded the opening of the locked door of the Bakery. The inmates responded by throwing soda-water bottles and acid bulbs. The SOS stormed into the Bakery and were promptly attacked by about 15 people armed with choppers, knives and ironbars. There wasn't surrender or ceasement of attack, so the Police had to open fire. Totally, 78 Muslims were flushed out of the bakery dead, by the police.

Fifty–two cases of police firing occurred in different jurisdictions, killing 5 Hindus, 22 Muslims and one other. Police combing operations resulted in seizure of stocks of swords, iron bars, choppers, kerosene cans, acid bulbs and soda water bottles from different areas.

===10 January 1993===
Twenty–six army columns were deployed for carrying out flag marches and for the first time the Government issued instructions to the commissioner of police that the army personnel may be directed to do operational duties by resorting to firing after taking control of a situation. Fifty–one police stations were affected by the riots. Eighty–one cases of stabbing occurred in different jurisdictions resulting in deaths of 10 Hindus and 39 Muslims and injuries to 12 Hindus and 42 Muslims. One hundred and eight cases of arson occurred in which there was property loss, death of one Hindu, seven Muslims and two others, while one Hindu, one Muslim and one other were injured. Attempts of the fire brigade to reach the places of fire were frustrated by the rioters who not only blocked the streets but also threatened the fire brigade staff and resorted to stone throwing against the fire brigade vehicles. Fires blazed uncontrolled.

Mob violence was reported from 25 jurisdictions causing deaths of two Hindus, nineteen Muslims, while 3 Hindus, 27 Muslims and two others were injured.

The police were given orders to fire and resorted to firing on 82 occasions, resulting in deaths of 2 Hindus, 23 Muslims and one other, while injuries were caused to 7 Hindus, 27 Muslims and two others. Police seized large number of swords, choppers, tube lights, fire balls, soda water bottles, iron bars, guptis and also one country made revolver. The situation was very grave in several jurisdictional areas. Even normally law-abiding citizens seemed gripped by the communal frenzy and were seen attacking members of the rival community. Peace committee members, politicians and other social workers were conspicuous by their absence. Communal hatred and fear psychosis appeared to have overtaken the citizens of Bombay making tolerance and reason prime casualties. Rumours about attacks from rival community swept the city.

The names of the miscreants are disclosed to police by a Hindu lady in the locality. (Though the miscreants were arrested and tried by the Sessions Court at Bombay, later on they were all acquitted on the ground that the panchanamas were defective and that the eye–witnesses were not produced).

Police maintained continued vigil along with the army and para–military forces.

==Justice B.N. Srikrishna Commission==
{{main|Srikrishna Commission}}
[[B.N. Srikrishna|Justice Srikrishna]], then a relatively junior Judge of the Bombay High Court, accepted the task of investigating the causes of the riots, something that many of his colleagues had turned down{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. For five years until 1998, he examined victims, witnesses and alleged perpetrators. Detractors came initially from left quarters who were wary of a judge who was a devout and practising Hindu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mehta|first= Suketu|title= Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found|year= 2004|publisher= Alfred A Knopf|isbn= 0-375-40372-8|page= 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was disbanded by the [[Shiv Sena]] led government in January 1996 and on public opposition was later reconstituted on 28 May 1996; though when it was reconstituted its terms of reference were extended to include the Mumbai [[1993 Mumbai bombings|bomb blasts]] that followed in March 1993.

The report of the commission stated that the tolerant and secular foundations of the city were holding even if a little shakily. Justice Srikrishna indicted those he alleged as largely responsible for the second phase of the bloodshed and to some extent the first, the Shiv Sena.

The report was criticised as "politically motivated". For a while, its contents were a closely guarded secret and no copies were available. The Shiv Sena government rejected its recommendations. Since under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, an Inquiry is not a court of law (even if it conducts proceedings like a court of law) and the report of an inquiry is not binding on Governments, Srikrishna's recommendations cannot be directly enforced. To date, the recommendations of the Commission have neither been accepted nor acted upon by the [[Maharashtra]] Government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Many indicted policemen were promoted by the government and indicted politicians continue to hold high political office even today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

According to the commission report, the causes of these riots were listed as 
# Class Conflict
# Economic Competition
# Decline of employment
# Population density
# changing political discourse.
The immediate causes were listed as
# the demolition of Babri Masjid
# the aggravation of Muslim sentiments by the Hindus with their celebration rallies
# the insensitive and harsh approach of the police while handling the protesting mobs which initially were not violent.

==Arrests, convictions and verdict==
Only 3 convictions happened in the 1992-93 Bombay riots cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/743554/yakub-memon-case-one-chart-that-shows-just-how-partisan-indias-justice-system-can-be|title=Yakub Memon case: one chart that shows just how partisan India’s justice system can be}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 July 2008, a Mumbai court sentenced former [[Shiv Sena]] MP [[Madhukar Sarpotdar]] and two other party activists to a year's rigorous imprisonment in connection with the riots.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/10/stories/2008071057670100.htm |title=Former Sena MP sentenced |work=The Hindu|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2008/07/09/idINIndia-34444720080709|title=Shiv Sena politician convicted over 1992 Mumbai riots}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was immediately granted bail.&lt;ref name="ANI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topnews.in/former-shiv-sena-leader-sarpotdar-convicted-mumbai-inciting-violence-1992-251859 |title=Former Shiv Sena leader Sarpotdar convicted in Mumbai for inciting violence in 1992 |work=ANI|date=9 July 2008|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 20 February 2010 without serving his sentence.&lt;ref name="DNA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_sena-leader-madhukar-sarpotdar-dies_1350425 |title=Sena leader Madhukar Sarpotdar dies |work=DNA|date=20 February 2010|accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The riots are portrayed in several different films:

* They are the key plot in the 1995 film ''[[Bombay (film)|Bombay]]'' in which the protagonists, a Muslim wife and her [[Hindu]] husband, are separated from their children during the riots.
* The 2004 Hindi film ''[[Black Friday (2004 film)|Black Friday]]'' deals with the events leading to the riots and the aftermath which led to the [[1993 Bombay bombings|1993 Bombay bomb blasts]], and related investigations, told through the different stories of the people involved – police, conspirators, victims, middlemen.
* The violence is also an instrumental part of the plot of the film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''. The protagonist, Jamal Malik's mother is among those killed in the riots, and he later remarks "If it wasn't for [[Rama]] and [[Allah]], we'd still have a mother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inhome.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/09slum.htm |title= Oscar buzz for Anil Kapoor-starrer |author= Arthur J Pais |date= 9 September 2008  |publisher= Rediff |accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The event also appeared in 2010 film ''[[Striker (2010 film)|Striker]]'', 2000 film ''[[Fiza]]'' and 2013 film ''[[Shahid (film)|Shahid]]''.

The '''Chequers plan''', also known as the '''Chequers deal''' or '''Chequers agreement''', is a key [[white paper]] concerning [[Brexit]], published 12 July 2018 by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] under [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Theresa May]]. It lays out the type of relationship the UK [[Brexit negotiations|seeks to have]] with the [[European Union]] after Brexit.&lt;ref name="GOV-UK_12072018"&gt;{{cite web |title=The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-relationship-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union/the-future-relationship-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union-html-version |website=gov.uk |publisher=[[Department for Exiting the European Union]] via [[GOV.UK]] |date=17 July 2018 |access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_12072018"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Morris (journalist) |title=Brexit: What does the government White Paper reveal? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44807561 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 July 2018 |access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its official title is '''''The future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union'''''.

The then [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]] (Brexit Secretary), [[Dominic Raab]], described it as a "detailed proposal for a principled, pragmatic and ambitious future partnership between the UK and the EU".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2018-07-12/debates/5C45D798-0286-4298-BBDE-44C860396ECD/EUFutureRelationshipWhitePaper#contribution-05E4E40C-A0F5-41DE-8B6A-C31509AD972F |date=12 July 2018 |title=EU: Future Relationship White Paper |column=1154 |speaker=[[Dominic Raab]] |position = [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "The white paper proposes a free trade area for goods to maintain frictionless trade, supported by a common rulebook and a new facilitated customs arrangement, but only for the rules that are necessary to provide frictionless trade at the border."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] |url= https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2018-07-18/debates/5FA5E9E4-A4CD-42B4-8CA6-20FE6406A03B/FutureRelationshipBetweenTheUKAndTheEU#contribution-2F742528-7018-4B15-BD00-219CA7AC7F7D |date=18 July 2018 |title=Future Relationship Between the UK and the EU |column=471 |speaker=Dominic Raab |position=Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white paper was finalised at a meeting of the UK Cabinet held at [[Chequers]] on 6 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=What the cabinet has agreed at Chequers Brexit meeting |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/06/what-the-cabinet-has-agreed-at-chequers-brexit-meeting |work=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=6 July 2018 |access-date=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brexit Secretary [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Boris Johnson]] resigned in opposition to the plan.

==Proposals==
The white paper is split into four chapters: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements.&lt;ref name="BBC_12072018" /&gt;  

The plan aims at holding the UK in a close relationship with the EU, stating that the new relationship be “broader in scope than any other that exists between the EU and a third country”. This would be done by establishing a new [[European Union Association Agreement|association agreement]].&lt;ref name="alleuneed2know"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europeanmovement.ie/all-eu-need-to-know-uk-white-paper-on-the-future-relationship-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union-12-july-2018/|title=All EU need to know|last=|first=|date=Jul 16, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Oct 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common rulebook on state aid would be agreed, preventing either side from subsidising their own industries. For its part, the UK will commit to maintaining high environmental, climate change, social, employment and consumer protection standards.&lt;ref name="inews"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/brexit/chequers-deal-brexit-plan-agreement-what-explained-theresa-may/|title=What is the Chequers Deal?|last=|first=|date=24 October 2018|work=[[i (newspaper)]]|access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When presenting the plan, Theresa May addressed the [[Irish border question]], stating that there would be "No hard border between [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and no border in the UK".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-may-brexit-michel-barnier-brexit-a8456806.html|title='Theresa May's Brexit proposals died in Brussels in eight short minutes'|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A “facilitated customs agreement” would remove the need for customs checks by treating the UK and EU “as if a combined customs territory”.

==Subsequent resignations==
[[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], Brexit Secretary at the time of the [[Chequers]] meeting, resigned over the agreement on 8 July, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Heather |title=Brexit secretary David Davis resigns plunging government into crisis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/08/david-davis-resigns-as-brexit-secretary-reports-say |work=''The Guardian'' |date=9 July 2018 |access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the next day did his [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Parliamentary Under-Secretary]], [[Steve Baker (politician)|Steve Baker]], and the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Boris Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |last2=Crerar |first2=Pippa |last3=Sabbagh |first3=Dan |title=May's plan 'sticks in the throat', says Boris Johnson as he resigns over Brexit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/09/boris-johnson-resigns-as-foreign-secretary-brexit |work=''The Guardian'' |date=9 July 2018 |access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2018, Boris Johnson delivered his resignation speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. In his speech he avoided personal attacks on [[Theresa May]], although he asserted that ministers were "saying one thing to the EU about what we are really doing, and pretending another to the electorate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1019586379771203584 |title=Boris Johnson on Twitter |work=Twitter |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of adhering to the [[Lancaster House]] Vision set out in January 2017, Johnson said, "a fog of self doubt [had] descended" and that the government "burned through negotiating capital". He later added that "it is not too late to save Brexit. We have time in these negotiations. We have changed tack once and we can change once again". The speech received notable attention, with many noting its similarities to the 1990 resignation speech of Sir [[Geoffrey Howe]] as Deputy Prime Minister, which contributed to the [[resignation of Margaret Thatcher]]. [[Laura Kuenssberg]] of the BBC noted the seriousness of the speech, stating that "it's the first Boris Johnson speech that I can remember watching that didn't have any jokes". [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] praised the speech, describing it as "the speech of a statesman",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kuenssberg | first = Laura | author-link = Laura Kuenssberg |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44871629 |title=Johnson: It is not too late to save Brexit |date=18 July 2018 |work=BBC News |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Wes Streeting]] described Johnson's speech as a "damp squib".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = McGuinness | first = Alan |title='It's not too late to save Brexit,' Boris Johnson declares in explosive resignation statement |url=https://news.sky.com/story/its-not-too-late-to-save-brexit-boris-johnson-declares-in-explosive-resignation-statement-11440820 |date=19 July 2018 |work=Sky News |access-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The EU's Chief Brexit Negotiator, [[Michel Barnier]], has repeatedly stated that the integrity of the [[EU Single Market]] is "not negotiable", and that there can be no "[[cherry picking]]" of the Single Market's four freedoms: free movement of people, goods, services and capital. The UK's proposals outline staying in the EU Single Market for goods, but not the other three freedoms.&lt;ref name="alleuneed2know"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Chequers plan was eventually rejected by the EU,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1021017/theresa-may-brexit-deal-no-deal-news-EU-chequers-plan-northern-ireland-hard-border|title=Theresa May Brexit deal: Why has the EU rejected the Chequers plan?|last=Hopps|first=Kat|date=21 September 2018|work=[[Daily Express]]|access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging the UK to come up with another proposal.

The '''Christmas Uprising''' or '''Christmas Rebellion''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: Божићна побуна, ''Božićna pobuna'' or Божићни устанак, ''Božićni ustanak'') refers to an uprising led by the [[Zelenaši]], in response to the [[Podgorica Assembly]]'s claim of authority to unite the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] with the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. The uprising reached a climax in [[Cetinje]] on 7 January 1919, the day of Orthodox Christmas.

The catalyst for the uprising was the decision of the controversial [[Podgorica Assembly|Grand People's Assembly in Montenegro]] (The Podgorica Parliament) for unconditional unification of Montenegro with the Kingdom of Serbia. Following a questionable candidate selection process, unionist side (in favor of unification with Serbia) outnumbered the party favouring the preservation of Montenegrin statehood and a unification with the peoples of [[Yugoslavia]] in form of a [[confederation]]. The uprising was named after the Orthodox Christmas of January 7, 1919, because it erupted on the previous day, on Christmas Eve. The Unionists, with support from the [[Serbian Army]], defeated the [[Greens (Montenegrin separatists)|Greens]] near [[Cetinje]]. Many homes were destroyed, and a number of participants in the uprising were tried and imprisoned. Part of the rebels fled to Italy, while others retreated to the mountains, continuing a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla resistance]] under the banner of the Montenegrin Army in Exile which lasted until 1929. 

The military leader of the uprising was [[Krsto Zrnov Popović]] and its political leader was [[Jovan S. Plamenac]]. After it occurred, the dethroned [[King Nicholas I]] was forced to issue a call for peace, but several groups of rebels continued to resist until 1929, most notably the militia of Savo Raspopović.

==Background==
{{See also|Podgorica Assembly}}
[[Image:Krsto Zrnov Popovic.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Krsto Zrnov Popović was one of the leaders of the uprising.]]
Multiple historians acknowledge that a majority of Montenegrins supported the unification with other [[Southern Slavs]] on a federal basis after the [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="RSE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/Crna_Gora_Bozicni_ustanak/1923426.html|author=Predrag Tomović|title=Radio Slobodna Evropa: ''Božićni ustanak izaziva kontroverze na 90. godišnjicu''|language=Serbian|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt; However, support for unification did not involve the same degree of support for the Podgorica Assembly, since many of those who supported unification wanted Montenegro to join the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes as an autonomous entity, ultimately in a confederation rather than a centralized Serbian kingdom.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

On December 22, 1918, Krsto Popović wrote a list of requests to Serbian general Dragutin Milutinović, asking for the termination of resolutions by the Podgorica Assembly. Milutinović replied to him the next day, alleging that he was responsible for his troops in Montenegro, but also promised to bring Popović's requests to the government in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="Dvasestjedan"&gt;[[Živko Andrijašević]]. ''Istorija Crne Gore''. {{sr icon}} July 2015. p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellion==
On December 23, 1918, Milutinović's troops ended a smaller uprising in Rijeka Crnojevića and stopped an attack by the Greens on Nikšić.&lt;ref name="Dvasestjedan"/&gt; The next day, about 250 Serbian troops and 850 volunteers from nearby [[Tribes of Montenegro|Montenegrin clans]] fought a formation of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 rebel Greens in Cetinje.&lt;ref name="Dvasestjedan"/&gt; On January 6, 1919, the Greens initiated a siege on Cetinje, killing some members of the Great National Assembly and killing some Whites. After that, the Greens experienced severe factionalism, in addition to facing the militarily stronger Whites.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Morrison. ''Montenegro: A Modern History''. I.B. Tauris &amp; Co Ltd (2009). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International influence and reactions==
===Italian role===
As a result of the Podgorica Assembly, King Nicholas was exiled to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], from which the uprising enjoyed substantial support. King Nicholas's Ministers asked for the Italian Expedition Corps in [[Albania]] to enter Montenegro, "in order for it to be liberated solely by Italian troops".&lt;ref&gt;Živojinović, Dragoljub: ''Pitanje Crne Gore i mirovna konferencija 1919 [The Issue of Montenegro and the 1919 Peace Conference]'', Belgrade 1992, p. 7. See Rastoder, Šerbo: Crna Gora u egzilu [Montenegro in Exile], Podgorica 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A committee organized by Italian ethnographer Antonio Baldacci supported the Greens until at least 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Srđan Rudić, Antonello Biagini|title=Serbian-Italian Relations: History and Modern Times : Collection of Works|publisher=|date=2015|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_7RPDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Serbian-Italian+Relations+History&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis_JSIxIvbAhXMq1kKHfqPAHMQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Serbian-Italian%20Relations%20History&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late November 1918 during the Podgorica Assembly, Italian troops attempted to take control of the coastal areas of Montenegro under the guise of Entente troop movement, but got prevented from doing so.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=May 2018}}

===International response===
In the spring of 1919, the [[United States]] sent [[Charles W. Furlong]] as an envoy from the Peace Commission to Montenegro. Furlong reported to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in an interview published on June 15, 1919, that the electors in the Podgorica Assembly acted as [[carpetbaggers]] did in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodhouse|first=Edward|title=Italy and Jugoslavia|publisher=The Gorham Press|date=1920|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFMMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=italy+montenegro+1919&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=btougi24Di&amp;sig=VJH2nPA6T8fcHjeuwiE6QMjHMWQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJu47Bi4nbAhXnUd8KHTGjB_84ChDoAQgxMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=italy%20montenegro%201919&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An initiative called the Inter-Allied Commission of Investigation monitored the Podgorica Assembly and the [[Montenegrin Whites|Blejaši]] after the uprising. It included [[Louis Franchet d'Espèrey]], as well as lieutenants from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Stojedanaest"/&gt; They recorded that there were as few as 500 unionist troops in Montenegro, and that they were not exclusively Serbian but from other constituents of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.&lt;ref name="Stojedanaest"/&gt; The commission also concluded from interviewing Greens held as prisoners that the uprising had been "caused by agents of [[King Nicholas I]] and supported by some emissaries from Italy."&lt;ref name="Stojedanaest"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Later in the twentieth century, the Christmas Uprising was subject to ideological emphasis in [[Montenegrin nationalism]]. In [[World War II]], one of the earliest leaders of the Zelenaši, [[Sekula Drljević]], invited the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Italian occupation of Montenegro]] and collaborated with the [[Independent State of Croatia]] in order to break away from Yugoslavia. 

Since [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegro declared independence from Serbia in 2006]], the Christmas Uprising has been memorialized on polar opposite ends of the Montenegrin historical conscious. In 1941, a memorial on the burial site of unionist [[Whites (Montenegro)|Bjelaši]] was destroyed by the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Italian occupation of Montenegro]] in Cetinje.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; As of 2017, a walkway was paved on the same burial site in Cetinje without any recognition to the Bjelaši.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; On 7 January 2008, on the 90th anniversary of the uprising, Montenegrin Prime Minister [[Milo Đukanović]] revealed a memorial statue for the Greens who were killed in the insurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.danas.org/content/Crna_Gora_Bozicni_ustanak/1923426.html| title = Christmas uprising causing controversy on its 90th anniversary | accessdate = 27 January 2010 |  publisher = Danas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4338">'''Crow Street Theatre''' was a theatre in Dublin, Ireland, originally opened in 1758 by the actor [[Spranger Barry]]. From 1788 until 1818 it was a [[patent theatre]].

==History==
[[File:Spranger Barry, by Irish School of the 18th Century.jpg|thumb|upright|Spranger Barry]]
[[File:Benjamin van der Gucht, Henry Woodward as Petruchio (1773–1774, Yale Center for British Art).jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Woodward as Petruchio in ''[[Catharine and Petruchio]]'']]
===Spranger Barry and Henry Woodward===
The actor [[Spranger Barry]] (1719–1777), born in Dublin and appearing in London from 1746, induced the London-born actor Henry Woodward (1714–1777), who had saved £6,000, to participate in his project to build a theatre in Dublin. [[Charles Macklin]] participated at an early stage, but soon withdrew. Barry and Woodward moved to Dublin, and the Crow Street Theatre opened in October 1758. It struggled as a rival to the [[Smock Alley Theatre]].&lt;ref name=barry&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Barry, Spranger|volume=3|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=woodward&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Woodward, Henry|volume=62|pages=419–422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=17622|title=Macklin [Melaghlin, MacLaughlin], Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1760 Barry and Woodward opened a theatre in Cork, the [[Theatre Royal, Cork|Theatre Royal]]. By 1762 Woodward had lost half his savings; the partnership was dissolved, and he returned to London. Barry continued for a few more years, then also returned to London.&lt;ref name=barry/&gt;&lt;ref name=woodward/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/places/oliverplunkettstreet/buildings/generalpostoffice/theatreroyal/ Theatre Royal] Cork Past and Present. Retrieved 22 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henry Mossop and Richard Daly===
[[Henry Mossop]], manager of Smock Alley Theatre since 1760, took over Crow Street Theatre in 1767, but resigned the theatre in 1770; the actor [[Thomas Ryder (actor)|Thomas Ryder]], who ran Smock Alley Theatre from 1772, also ran Crow Street Theatre. In 1782 the actor [[Richard Daly]] became owner of the theatre, and in 1786, having obtained a patent from the Crown, he opened Crow Street Theatre in 1788 as the Theatre Royal, a [[patent theatre]]. £12,000 had been spent on rebuilding and decoration. It was profitable for a while, but later suffered from the opening of [[Astley's Amphitheatre (Dublin)|Astley's Amphitheatre]].&lt;ref name=mossop&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Mossop, Henry|volume=39|pages=187–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ryder&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Ryder, Thomas (1735-1790)|volume=50|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daly&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Daly, Richard|volume=13|pages=439–440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frederick Edward Jones===
[[Frederick Edward Jones]] leased the theatre from Daly, and spent £1200  on renovating the house, which was decorated by Marinari and Zaffarini. It was opened in 1796, but closed when [[martial law]] was declared, relating to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Jones obtained a new royal patent in 1798, and spent a further £5000 on the theatre, but in the political climate it had to close in 1803.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Jones, Frederick Edward|volume=30|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was wrecked in a riot of 1814; and there were further riots in 1819. Jones attributed his unpopularity to his being active in politics; in 1807 he had supported the election of an anti-ministerial member of parliament for Dublin. His application in 1818 for renewal of the patent was refused, being granted instead to  Henry Harris, a proprietor of [[Covent Garden Theatre]]. The years of disruption had been financially detrimental, and he was imprisoned for debt. During the 1819–20 season the Crow Street Theatre did not open regularly.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=15002|title=Jones, Frederick Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===End of the theatre===
The theatre was rented for a short period and opened as a circus, and was then abandoned. In 1836 the Apothecaries' Hall Company bought part of the site, and a medical school was built.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=boLmd-KxZ9oC&amp;pg=PA4444 John C. Greene.

The '''Daytona 500''' is a {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=mid|-long|0}} [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] motor race held annually at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. It is the first of two Cup races held every year at Daytona, the second being the [[Coke Zero 400]], and one of three held in [[Florida]], with the annual championship showdown [[Ford EcoBoost 400]] being held at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead]] south of [[Miami]]. It is one of the four [[restrictor plate]] races on the Cup schedule. The inaugural Daytona 500 was held in [[1959 Daytona 500|1959]] coinciding with the opening of the speedway and since [[1982 Daytona 500|1982]], it has been the season-opening race of the Cup series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dover International Speedway: The Monster Mile | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=Chad Culver | year=2014 | location=53 | pages=127 | isbn=1467121371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar, carrying by far the largest purse.&lt;ref&gt;"Culture, Class, Distinction"Bennett, Tony.  ''Culture, Class, Distinction''. [[Routledge]] (2009) Disaggregating cultural capital. English translation {{ISBN|0-415-42242-6}} (hardcover).&lt;/ref&gt;  Championship points awarded are equal to that of any other Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since [[1995 Daytona 500|1995]], U.S. [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the [[Indianapolis 500]] which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The [[2006 Daytona 500]] attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World’s most watched TV sports events: 2006 Rank &amp; Trends report |publisher=Initiative |date=2007-01-19 |url=http://initiative.com/static/prDec2006.html |accessdate=2007-01-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208200248/http://initiative.com/static/prDec2006.html |archivedate=2007-02-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race serves as the final event of [[Speedweeks]] and is sometimes known as '''"The Great American Race"''' or the '''"[[Super Bowl]] of Stock Car Racing"'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of the Daytona 500|url=https://www.ticketcity.com/daytona-500-tickets/daytona-500-history.html|publisher=[[TicketCity]]|accessdate=November 24, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509221046/http://www.ticketcity.com/daytona-500-tickets/daytona-500-history.html|archivedate=May 9, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crossman|first=Matt|title=Daytona 500 Magic Hour: Best 60 minutes in sports|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/nascar-illustrated/2015/2/nascar-illustrated-the-magic-hour-daytona-500.html|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=November 24, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125091337/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/nascar-illustrated/2015/2/nascar-illustrated-the-magic-hour-daytona-500.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Briggs|first=Josh|title=How Daytona Qualifying Works|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/nascar/nascar-basics/nascar-daytona-qualifying2.htm|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|accessdate=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the race has been held in mid-to-late February. From [[1971 Daytona 500|1971]] to [[2011 Daytona 500|2011]], and again since [[2018 Daytona 500|2018]], the event has been as associated with [[Washington's Birthday|Presidents Day]] weekend, taking place on the Sunday before the third Monday in February.

The winner of the Daytona 500 is presented with the [[Harley J. Earl Trophy]] in Victory Lane, and the winning car is displayed in race-winning condition for one year at [[Daytona 500 Experience]], a museum and gallery adjacent to Daytona International Speedway.

[[Austin Dillon]] is the defending winner of the Daytona 500, having won it in 2018.

The race is the direct successor of shorter races held on the [[Daytona Beach and Road Course|Daytona Beach Road Course]]. This long square was partially on the sand and also on the highway near the beach. Earlier events featured {{convert|200|mi|km|adj=on}} races with stock cars. Eventually, a {{convert|500|mi|km|0|adj=on}} [[stock car racing|stock car race]] was held at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in [[1959 Daytona 500|1959]]. It was the second 500-mile NASCAR race, following the annual [[Bojangles' Southern 500|Southern 500]], and has been held every year since. By [[1961 Daytona 500|1961]], it began to be referred to as the '''Daytona 500''',&lt;ref name="programs"&gt;1959, 1960, and 1961 Daytona 500 Programs&lt;/ref&gt; by which it is still commonly known.

Daytona International Speedway is {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} long and a 500-mile race&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autoballa.com/2014/07/157289/rise-and-fall-nascar-indy | title=The Rise And Fall Of NASCAR At Indy | date=Jul 24, 2014 | accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires 200 laps to complete. However, the race is considered official after two stages (120 laps) have been completed (300 miles).  The race has been shortened four times due to rain (in [[1965 Daytona 500|1965]], [[1966 Daytona 500|1966]], [[2003 Daytona 500|2003]], and [[2009 Daytona 500|2009]]) and once in response to the energy crisis of [[1974 Daytona 500|1974]]. Since the adaptation of the [[green–white–checker finish]] rule in 2004, the race has gone past 500 miles on seven occasions ([[2005 Daytona 500|2005]], [[2006 Daytona 500|2006]], [[2007 Daytona 500|2007]], [[2010 Daytona 500|2010]], [[2011 Daytona 500|2011]], [[2012 Daytona 500|2012]], and [[2015 Daytona 500|2015]]).

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
{{main article|Daytona 500 history}}
* '''[[1959 Daytona 500|1959]]''': [[Lee Petty]], patriarch of the racing family, won the inaugural Daytona 500 on February 22, 1959, defeating [[Johnny Beauchamp]].
* '''[[1960 Daytona 500|1960]]''': [[Junior Johnson]] made use of the [[drafting (aerodynamics)|draft]], then a little-understood phenomenon, to win while running a slower, year-old car in a field of 68 cars, most in Daytona 500 history through the present day.
* '''[[1965 Daytona 500|1965]]''': The first rain-shortened Daytona 500 was the 1965 event. [[Fred Lorenzen]] was in the lead when the race was called on lap 133 of 200.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Zeller, ''Daytona 500: An Official History'' (Phoenix: David Bull Publishing, 2002): 48-52.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[1966 Daytona 500|1966]]''': Richard Petty becomes the first two-time winner, having previously won the [[1964 Daytona 500|1964 race]]. Through 2015, only 11 drivers have won 2 or more Daytona 500s.
* '''[[1967 Daytona 500|1967]]''': [[Mario Andretti]] led 112 of the 200 laps including the last 33 to capture his first and only win in the Cup Series.
* '''[[1968 Daytona 500|1968]]''': For much of this race, both [[Cale Yarborough]] and [[LeeRoy Yarbrough]] traded the lead. With 5 laps to go, Yarborough made a successful slingshot pass on the third turn to take the lead from Yarbrough and never looked back as he won his first Daytona 500 by 1.3 seconds.
* '''[[1969 Daytona 500|1969]]''': Just like a year earlier, LeeRoy Yarbrough would inflict the same treatment on [[Charlie Glotzbach]], scoring the victory on the last lap.
* '''[[1971 Daytona 500|1971]]''': Richard Petty becomes the first three-time winner, including the [[1964 Daytona 500|1964]] and [[1966 Daytona 500|1966 races]]. Through 2015, only 5 drivers have won 3 or more Daytona 500s.
* '''[[1972 Daytona 500|1972]]''':  A. J. Foyt cruised into the lead on lap 80 and stayed there through the 200 lap race, lapping the entire field. Foyt beat second place Charlie Glotzbach by nearly two laps, with Jim Vandiver finishing 6 laps down in third.
* '''[[1973 Daytona 500|1973]]''': Richard Petty becomes the first four-time winner, including the [[1964 Daytona 500|1964]], [[1966 Daytona 500|1966]] and [[1971 Daytona 500|1971 races]] . Through 2015, only Petty (7 total) and Cale Yarborough have won 4 Daytona 500s.
* '''[[1974 Daytona 500|1974]]''': During the start of the 1974 NASCAR season, many races had their distance cut ten percent in response to the [[1973 oil crisis]]. As a result, the 1974 Daytona 500 was shortened to 180 laps (450 miles), as symbolically, the race "started" on lap 21.  Richard Petty became the first of only 3 drivers (through 2015) to win consecutive Daytona 500s, while also setting a mark of 5 total wins.&lt;!--not clear as written if it's 5 or 7 that was unequalled; mention it at 7.--&gt;
* '''[[1976 Daytona 500|1976]]''': In the 1976 race, Richard Petty was leading on the last lap when he was passed on the backstretch by David Pearson. Petty tried to turn under Pearson coming off the final corner, but didn't clear Pearson. The contact caused the drivers to spin into the grass in the infield just short of the finish line. Petty's car didn't start, but Pearson was able to keep his car running and limp over the finish line for the win. Many fans consider this finish to be the greatest in the history of NASCAR.
* '''[[1979 Daytona 500|1979]]''': The 1979 race was the first Daytona 500 to be broadcast live on national television,&lt;ref name=nascar.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/01/23/daytona_1979/ |title=1979: Petty winds up in 'fist' place |accessdate=June 9, 2007 |author=Mark Aumann |date=January 23, 2003 |publisher=Turner Sports Interactive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061914/http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/01/23/daytona_1979/ |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/1979-Daytona-500/dp/B000E4IED2 |title=1979 Daytona 500 |accessdate=June 9, 2007 |publisher=Amazon.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070716050023/http://www.amazon.com/1979-Daytona-500/dp/B000E4IED2| archivedate= 16 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; airing on [[CBS Sports|CBS]], whose audience was increased in much of the Eastern and Midwestern USA due to a blizzard. (The [[Indianapolis 500]] was only broadcast on tape delay that evening in this era; most races were broadcast only through the final quarter to half of the race, as was the procedure for ABC's Championship Auto Racing broadcasts; with the new CBS contract, the network and NASCAR agreed to a full live broadcast.) That telecast introduced in-car and low-level track-side cameras, which has now become standard in all sorts of automotive racing broadcasts. A final lap crash and subsequent fight between leaders Cale Yarborough and [[Donnie Allison]] (along with Donnie's brother [[Bobby Allison|Bobby]]) brought national (if unwelcome) publicity to NASCAR, with the added emphasis of a snowstorm that bogged down much of the northeastern part of the United States. Donnie Allison was leading the race on the final lap with Yarborough drafting him tightly. As Yarborough attempted a slingshot pass at the end of the backstretch, Allison attempted to block him. Yarborough refused to give ground and as he pulled alongside Allison, his left side tires left the pavement and went into the wet and muddy infield grass. Yarborough lost control of his car and contacted Allison's car halfway down the backstretch. As both drivers tried to regain control, their cars made contact several more times before finally locking together and crashing into the outside wall in turn three. After the cars settled in the grass, Donnie Allison and Yarborough began to argue. After they had talked it out, Bobby Allison, who was lapped at that point, pulled over, began defending his brother, and a fight broke out. Richard Petty, who was over half a lap behind at the time, went on to win; with the brawl in the infield, the television audience scarcely noticed. The story was the talk of the water cooler the next day, even making the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' Sports section.
* '''[[1980 Daytona 500|1980]]''': [[Buddy Baker]] won the fastest Daytona 500 in history, at 177.602&amp;nbsp;mph (285.809&amp;nbsp;km/h).
* '''[[1981 Daytona 500|1981]]''': Richard Petty becomes the first seven-time winner, three wins more than the second highest multiple winner, Cale Yarborough. With wins in [[1964 Daytona 500|1964]], [[1966 Daytona 500|1966]], [[1971 Daytona 500|1971]], [[1973 Daytona 500|1973]], [[1974 Daytona 500|1974]], and [[1979 Daytona 500|1979]],  Petty is the only driver to win in three different decades.
* '''[[1982 Daytona 500|1982]]''': The Daytona 500 becomes the opening race in the NASCAR season, a position held since.
* '''[[1983 Daytona 500|1983]]''': Cale Yarborough was the first driver to run a qualifying lap over {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in his [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]].
* '''[[1984 Daytona 500|1984]]''': Cale Yarborough completed a lap of  {{convert|201.848|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, officially breaking the {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} barrier at Daytona. He joined Richard Petty as the only drivers to win the race in consecutive years and to win the race four times overall.
* '''[[1985 Daytona 500|1985]]''': [[Bill Elliott]] dominated the race, and by lap 140, was close to lapping the entire field. During a pit stop, NASCAR officials held him in the pit area in order to repair a supposed broken headlight assembly. The two-minute pit stop dropped him to third, barely clinging to the lead lap. Elliott made up the deficit and survived a late race caution and a final lap restart to win his first Daytona 500. Elliott would go on to win the first [[Grand Slam (NASCAR)|Winston Million]].
* '''[[1986 Daytona 500|1986]]''': The race that came down to a two-car duel between  [[Dale Earnhardt]] and [[Geoff Bodine]]. With 3 laps to go, Earnhardt was forced to make a pit stop for a "splash 'n go". However, as Earnhardt left the pits, he burned a piston, allowing Bodine to cruise to victory.
* '''[[1987 Daytona 500|1987]]''': Winner Bill Elliott qualified for the pole position at an all-time Daytona record of 210.364&amp;nbsp;mph (338.532&amp;nbsp;km/h)..
* '''[[1988 Daytona 500|1988]]''': [[Restrictor plate]]s were mandated to reduce dangerously high speeds at Daytona. [[Bobby Allison]] and his son [[Davey Allison|Davey]] finished one-two and celebrated together in Victory Lane, making Bobby Allison the oldest driver to win the Daytona 500.
* '''[[1990 Daytona 500|1990]]''': Dale Earnhardt appeared headed for certain victory until the closing laps. On lap 193, Geoff Bodine spun in the first turn, causing the third and final caution of the race. All of the leaders pitted except [[Derrike Cope]], who stayed out to gain track position. On the lap 195 restart, Earnhardt re-took the lead. On the final lap, going into turn three, he ran over a [[bell housing]] from the blown engine of [[Rick Wilson (NASCAR)|Rick Wilson]]'s car. He blew a tire, allowing the relatively unknown Cope to slip by and take his first career win in a major upset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NASCAR.com&amp;nbsp;— The 1990 Daytona 500 - July 28, 2003 | url = http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070817224950/http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | archivedate = August 17, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[1991 Daytona 500|1991]]''': Dale Earnhardt's Daytona 500 frustrations continued as [[Ernie Irvan]] passed Earnhardt with six laps to go to. Ultimately, Earnhardt spun with two laps remaining and collected [[Davey Allison]] and [[Kyle Petty]]. Irvan took the win as the race ended under the caution flag. The race was dominated by complex pit stop rules, implemented to improve safety in the pit area.
* '''[[1992 Daytona 500|1992]]''': Davey Allison dominated the second half en route to his lone Daytona 500 victory. He avoided a major wreck on lap 92 and went on to lead the final 102 laps.
* '''[[1993 Daytona 500|1993]]''':  In a frightening wreck on lap 170, [[Rusty Wallace]] flipped over multiple times on the back straightaway. With two laps to go, [[Dale Earnhardt]] was leading Jeff Gordon and [[Dale Jarrett]]. Jarrett battled into the lead with one lap to go. It was the fourth time Earnhardt had been leading the Daytona 500 with less than ten laps to go, but failed to win.
* '''[[1994 Daytona 500|1994]]''': [[Sterling Marlin]] gambled on fuel, and was able to complete the final 59 laps without stopping, to win his first career Cup victory.  During Speedweeks, two drivers died, Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr.
* '''[[1995 Daytona 500|1995]]''': Sterling Marlin became the first driver since Cale Yarborough, and only third overall, to win back-to-back Daytona 500s. To date, Marlin is the last driver to have won back-to-back Daytona 500s. It was the third win in five years for [[Morgan–McClure Motorsports]] (1991, 1994, 1995).
* '''[[1996 Daytona 500|1996]]''': Dale Jarrett won his second Daytona 500 in four years, again holding off Dale Earnhardt, who finished second for the third time in four years.
* '''[[1997 Daytona 500|1997]]''': Jeff Gordon became the youngest driver to win the Daytona 500.
* '''[[1998 Daytona 500|1998]]''': Dale Earnhardt finally won the Daytona 500 after "20 years of trying, 20 years of frustration." Though Earnhardt had usually been a strong competitor in the Daytona 500, mechanical problems, crashes, or other misfortunes had prevented him from winning. After his victory, a joyous Earnhardt drove slowly down pit road, where members of other race teams had lined up to give him handshakes and high-fives. [[Mike Joy]], who was play-by-play announcer for [[NASCAR on CBS|CBS]]'s broadcast, called the win "the most anticipated moment in racing".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
* '''[[2001 Daytona 500|2001]]''': Also known as '''"Black Sunday"''', or the "darkest day in NASCAR", as Dale Earnhardt [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|died in a crash]] on the final lap. Michael Waltrip and [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] were running first and second on the final lap, while Earnhardt Sr. was third. In turn 4, Earnhardt lost control after making contact from Sterling Marlin, and crashed into the outside wall, taking [[Ken Schrader]] with him. Earnhardt suffered a fatal [[basilar skull fracture]]. Waltrip would win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jayski's Silly Season Site&amp;nbsp;— Race Info Page | url=http://www.jayski.com/next/2001/2001daytona500.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[2003 Daytona 500|2003]]''': Michael Waltrip became a two-time winner of in the shortest ever Daytona 500, after the race was shortened to 109 laps due to rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2003 Daytona 500 - Racing-Reference.info | url=http://racing-reference.info/race?id=2003-01&amp;series=W | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[2005 Daytona 500|2005]]''': The start time was changed, allowing the race to finish under the lights at dusk. In the first use of the green-white-checker finish rule in the Daytona 500, Gordon held off Kurt Busch, and Earnhardt, Jr. to win his third Daytona 500. The race went 203 laps/507.5 miles.
* '''[[2008 Daytona 500|2008]]''': The celebrated 50th running of the Daytona 500 was the first using NASCAR's [[Car of Tomorrow]]. It also marked the first race under the "Sprint Cup Series" banner, following the merger of Sprint with [[Nextel Communications|Nextel]] in 2006.

[[File:Trevor Bayne, the 2011 Daytona 500 winner.jpg|thumb|right|[[Trevor Bayne]], driving the No. 21 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for [[Wood Brothers Racing]], won the [[2011 Daytona 500]].]]
* '''[[2010 Daytona 500|2010]]''': The longest Daytona 500 distance, 208 laps ({{convert|520|miles|km}}), due to requiring two green-white-checker efforts to finish the race. Jamie McMurray came home with the 2010 Daytona 500 victory. Dale Earnhardt Jr.  finished second.
* '''[[2011 Daytona 500|2011]]''': Since this race marked the tenth anniversary of the death of Dale Earnhardt, the third lap was a "silent lap", meaning the TV and radio announcers were silent during the entire lap, and fans held up three fingers in reference to Earnhardt's car number. [[Trevor Bayne]], at 20 years and one day old, became the youngest Daytona 500 winner ever.
* '''[[2012 Daytona 500|2012]]''': While 2010 was the longest distance, 2012 was the longest time to complete the race. Scheduled for a 12 noon EST start on Sunday, rain delayed the race to Monday, then further delayed it to a 7 PM start that Monday night, resulting in the first primetime Daytona 500 start (but the third to reach primetime). On lap 160, [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] crashed into a jet dryer in turn 3, sparking a lengthy red flag as crews put out the resulting fire and repaired the damage. The race finally ended at approximately 1 AM EST Tuesday morning, 37 hours after the originally scheduled start, with [[Matt Kenseth]] becoming the first repeat winner since [[Jeff Gordon]] who won the [[2005 Daytona 500|2005]] race.
* '''[[2013 Daytona 500|2013]]''': There were a number of firsts.  This was the first race with NASCAR's new redesigned Generation 6 body. Rookie [[Danica Patrick]] won the pole, becoming the first woman on pole in the Daytona 500. She also was the first woman to lead laps under green flag conditions in the race. [[Jimmie Johnson]] earned his second Daytona 500 victory.
* '''[[2014 Daytona 500|2014]]''': For the second year in a row, a rookie won the pole position, in this case [[Austin Dillon]] in his first ride in the newly renumbered #3 Chevy SS for Richard Childress Racing, the first time the #3 had been used in a NASCAR Cup Series race since Dale Earnhardt's death. Dale Earnhardt, Jr., won his second Daytona 500, the third straight won by a past winner, after Kenseth in 2012 and Johnson in 2013. The race was delayed 6 hours, 22 minutes, and ended at 11:18 p.m. ET Sunday night.

* '''[[2015 Daytona 500|2015]]''': [[Jeff Gordon]] won the pole for the final time, There were two [[The Big One (NASCAR)|big wrecks]] during the race, one with 19 laps to go for [[Justin Allgaier]] and [[Ty Dillon]], brought out a red flag to ensue cleanup on the track, and one on lap 202 at a scheduled [[Green–white–checker finish]], [[Joey Logano]] won his first Daytona 500.
* '''[[2016 Daytona 500|2016]]''': Rookie [[Chase Elliott]] started the race from the pole position. Driver [[Denny Hamlin]] led 95 laps during the race, and on the last lap, Hamlin passed leader Matt Kenseth. Hamlin would then beat [[Martin Truex Jr.]] by 0.010 seconds, which would become the closest finish in the Daytona 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cain|first1=Holly|title=DENNY HAMLIN WINS THRILLING DAYTONA 500|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/2/21/daytona-500-denny-hamlin-race-recap-sprint-cup-series.html|website=nascar.com|publisher=nascar.com|date=21 February 2016|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[2017 Daytona 500|2017]]''': [[Chase Elliott]] started the race from the pole for the second year in a row, the first stage only had one caution brought out by [[Corey LaJoie]] mistiming his pit entry and aborting right at the entrance of pit road almost slamming into [[Clint Bowyer]], [[Kyle Busch]] went on the win stage one. The first major crash happened on lap 105 when Kyle Busch's car spun around and collected [[Erik Jones]], [[Matt Kenseth]], [[Ty Dillon]], and [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]]. [[Kevin Harvick]] went on to win stage two. The second major crash happened when [[Jimmie Johnson]] spun around and collected [[Trevor Bayne]] and 14 more cars. with four laps to go Elliott ran out of fuel and gave up the lead to [[Martin Truex Jr.]], with two laps to go Truex also ran out of gas and [[Kyle  Larson]] took the lead but the same fate fell on Larson and [[Kurt Busch]] took the lead in Turn 2 on the final lap to win the 59th Daytona 500.
* '''[[2018 Daytona 500|2018]]''': 20 years after [[Dale Earnhardt Sr.]] earned his [[1998 Daytona 500|iconic victory]] at Daytona, [[Austin Dillon]] brought Richard Childress's #3 Chevrolet back to Victory Lane. Dillon, Childress's grandson who was photographed next to Earnhardt as a child after the earlier win, led only the final lap, bumping leader [[Aric Almirola]] out of the way, sending the latter's Ford into the wall. Also of note, rookie [[Darrell Wallace Jr.]] finished in the runner-up spot, barely edging out 2016 winner [[Denny Hamlin]], the highest finish for an African-American driver in the event's history. It was also the final NASCAR race for [[Danica Patrick]], who was collected in a multi-car wreck near the end of the second stage that also ended the days of [[Chase Elliott]], [[Brad Keselowski]], [[Kevin Harvick]], among others.

==Qualifying procedure==
{{main article|Can-Am Duel}}
The qualifying procedure is unique for the Daytona 500. Some teams must race their way into the Daytona 500 field. The first row is set by a timed round of qualifying, held one week before the race (prior to 2003, this was two rounds; prior to 2001, it was three). The remainder of the field is set by two separate qualifying races (these were {{convert|100|mi|km}} from 1959 to 1967; {{convert|125|mi|km}} from 1969 to 2004; and {{convert|150|mi|km}} with two lap overtime, if necessary, beginning in 2005 (these races were not held in 1968 due to rain). The top two drivers from the qualifying races who were not in the top 35 in owner points were given spots on the field, and the rest of the field was set by the finishing order of the duels, with guaranteed spots to those in the top 35. The remaining spots, 40 to 43, were filled by top qualifying times of those not already in the field from the qualifying race. If there was a previous NASCAR champion without a spot, he would get one of those four spots, otherwise, the fourth fastest car was added to the field.

Prior to 2005 – and beginning again in 2013 – after the top two cars were set, the top fourteen cars in the qualifying races advance to the field, and then between six (1998–2003), eight (1995–97, 2004) or 10 (until 1994) fastest cars which do not advance from the qualifying race are added, then cars in the top 35 in owner points not locked into the race, and then the driver with the championship provisional, except for 1985 when no such car was eligible for a provisional starting spot, the only time that happened in the Daytona 500 from when the provisional was added in 1976 through 2004.

==Television==
{{see also|List of Daytona 500 broadcasters}}

The Daytona 500 was the first {{convert|500|mi|km|sing=on}} auto race to be televised live flag-to-flag on network television when [[CBS]] aired it in 1979, continuing to air until 2000.

From 2001 to 2006, the race alternated between [[Fox NASCAR|FOX]] and [[NASCAR on NBC|NBC]] under the terms of a six–year, $2.48 billion NASCAR television contract, with FOX broadcasting the Daytona 500 in odd-numbered years (2001, 2003, 2005) and the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] in even-numbered years (2002, 2004, 2006) and NBC broadcasting the opposite race in that year.

In 2005, a new television contract was signed, which made FOX the sole broadcaster of the Daytona 500 for eight years, from 2007 to 2014. In 2013, 10 more years were added to the contract, giving FOX every Daytona 500 from 2015 to 2024 as well, for a total of at least 20 Daytona 500s in a row.
The installation of the [[Night game#Motorsports|lighting system]] at Daytona International Speedway in 1998, as well as the implementations of the television packages in 2001 and 2007 respectively, have resulted in the race starting and ending much later than it did in the race's early years. The race started at 12:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] from 1979 until 2000. The start time was moved to 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern time from 2001 to 2004, 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. in 2005 and 2006 and 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. from 2007 to 2009, all for the convenience of west coast viewers. The 2005 race ended at sunset for the first time in its history, and the 2006 race ended well after sunset.

Every Daytona 500 between 2006 and 2010, as well as the 2012 and 2014 races, ended under the lights. The changing track conditions caused by the onset of darkness in the closing laps in these years forced the crew chiefs to predict the critical car setup adjustments needed for their final two pit stops. The 2007 race was the first Daytona 500 to go into prime-time, ending at 7:07&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern time. In 2010, the race moved back to a 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. start time, which should have resulted in it ending in daylight; however, two red flags caused by track surface issues led to long delays that pushed the race to 7:34&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST, pushing the race into prime-time for the second time. The 2012 race was also scheduled to start at 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST on Sunday, February 26, but heavy rain in the area caused the race to be postponed to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST on Monday, February 27, making it the first Daytona 500 to be postponed to a Monday, as well as the first (and only) Daytona 500 to be run as a night race. Due to a two–hour red flag period after a jet dryer fire on the track with 40 laps remaining, the race did not end until about 12:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday, February 28. The 2013 race marked a return to the race's past tradition of ending in the late afternoon, as it ended at about 4:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., the race's earliest ending time since 2004. Although the 2014 race started around 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST, heavy rain and a [[tornado warning]] red–flagged the race after 38 laps and it was delayed for a record six hours and 22 minutes; the race finished the entire 500–mile distance around after 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. the same day, which effectively competed with the time delayed East Coast broadcast of [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]]'s coverage of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] [[2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]], scheduled between 7:00 and 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. The 2015 race started on time around 1:00 &amp;nbsp;p.m., and ended after 203 laps due to a Green–white–checkered finish.

The television ratings for the Daytona 500 have surpassed those of the larger [[Indianapolis 500]] (which has much larger physical attendance and international attendance) since 1995, even though the 1995 race was available in far fewer homes than the year before. Then-broadcaster CBS had lost well-established [[very high frequency|VHF]] (channels 2–13) affiliates in major markets as a result of the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|Fox affiliate switches of 1994]]. As an example, new affiliates [[WDJT-TV|WDJT]] in [[Milwaukee]] and [[WGCL-TV|WGNX]] in [[Atlanta]]&amp;nbsp;— both cities that are home to NASCAR races&amp;nbsp;—  and [[WWJ-TV|WWJ]] in [[Detroit]], close to [[Michigan International Speedway]], were on the [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] band (channels 14–69), meaning that they had a significantly reduced broadcast area compared to former affiliates [[WITI (TV)|WITI]], [[WAGA-TV]], and [[WJBK]], respectively.  WDJT was not available in many Wisconsin markets by the time the Daytona 500 took place.

Hassan Amr is one of the former editors of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence Pintak |author2=Jeremy Ginges |title=The Mission of Arab Journalism: Creating Change in a Time of Turmoil |journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics |date=July 2008 |volume=13 |issue=3 |url=http://hij.sagepub.com/content/13/3/193.full.pdf |accessdate=13 February 2014 |doi=10.1177/1940161208317142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2013 Manal Lashin was the [[editor-in-chief]] of the weekly.&lt;ref name=sawt&gt;{{cite web |title=Media and Press Situation in Egypt: Ninth Report |url=http://asahnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MM-09-EN-f.pdf |work=Al Sawt Al Hurr |accessdate=6 October 2014 |format=Report |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 21st edition, dated 17 October 2005, ''El Fagr'' was the [[List of newspapers that reprinted Jyllands-Posten's Muhammad cartoons#Ordered chronologically|first newspaper worldwide]] to republish on its [[:Image:Page-1-of-El-Fagr.org-egyptian-newspaper-Oct-17-2005.jpg|front page]] (one cartoon) and page 17, a total of six cartoons portraying the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] of twelve cartoons originally published in the [[Denmark|Danish]] newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]''.&lt;ref name="BarryHansen2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Daved Barry |author2=Hans Hansen |title=The SAGE Handbook of New Approaches in Management and Organization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCtMD-pE11EC&amp;pg=PA245 |accessdate=5 October 2014 |date=30 April 2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4462-0407-8 |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; These twelve cartoons gave rise to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]]. However, these caricatures received little attention in Egypt and the paper was not banned due to its reprints of the caricatures.&lt;ref name=BarryHansen2008/&gt;

In March 2006 Amira Malsh, a journalist working for ''El Fagr'', was sentenced to a year in prison with hard labor because of libeling a judge in an article published in the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hussein Amin |title=Strengthening the Rule of Law and Integrity in the Arab World |journal=Arab Center for the Development of the Rule of Law and Integrity |url=http://www.arabruleoflaw.org/Files/PDF/Media/English/P2/Egypt_MediaReportP2_En.pdf |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the weekly started an award in the memory of Al Husseiny Abu Deif, a journalist who died in December 2012 during clashes among the demonstrators.&lt;ref name=sawt/&gt;

Starting in the 2015–16 season, the all new '''[[Formula 4]] UAE Championship''' will be launched by the [[Federation Internationale de l'Automobile]], and its national affiliate the [[Automobile &amp; Touring Club of the United Arab Emirates|Automobile &amp; Touring Club of the United Arab Emirates (ATCUAE)]], who will act as the championship's promoter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fia.com/news/formula-4-launched-uae&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2013, the FIA Single seat commission announced their intention to introduce a new category of single seat racing in order to bridge the gap between karting and [[Formula 3]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/106219&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the following two years, the ATCUAE has worked to develop a Formula 4 championship for the UAE, which will be the first in the Middle East and North African region. One of the first steps taken was to appoint Dubai based AUH Motorsports to manage the championship, based on their experience and expertise in having run the regional [[Radical Sportscars]] series for several years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dubaiautodrome.com/tracktalk/2015/12/atcuae-and-auh-motorsport-announce-formula-4-championship/&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the championship was launched in spectacular fashion in front of the world's tallest building, the [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai, with the public unveiling of the car undertaken by [[Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan|HH Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan]], the Minister of Culture and Knowledge Development and Chairman of the [[General Authority for Youth and Sports Welfare in UAE|General Authority for Youth and Sports Welfare]], and [[Mohammed Ben Sulayem]], President of the ATCUAE.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/sport/motorsport/uae-formula-4-championship-holds-promise-for-new-generation-of-emirati-drivers&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch in February 2016, the car was given its first test around the Dubai Autodrome, driven by Dubai-born [[Indy Lights]] driver [[Ed Jones (racing driver)|Ed Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FEW1uvA8s0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==

The inaugural 2016–17 championship will feature eighteen races over six weekends, four of which will be held at the [[Yas Marina Circuit]] in Abu Dhabi, with the remaining two at the [[Dubai Autodrome]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.f4uae.com/calendar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car==
{{also|Tatuus F4-T014}}
The championship features [[Tatuus]] designed and built cars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tatuus.it/formula4.php&lt;/ref&gt; The cars are constructed out of carbon fibre and feature a monocoque chassis. The engine is a 1.4 turbo [[Abarth]].

This combination of chassis and engine is the same as that already used in the [[Italian F4 Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.f4championship.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[F4 Spanish Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;http://f4spain.com/car/&lt;/ref&gt; [[ADAC Formula 4]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adac-motorsport.de/adac-formel-4/uk/autodetails-2016/adac-formel-4-1531&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SMP F4 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://smpf4championship.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2886">'''Gene Anthony “Rocky” Morrison''' (born 1958) was a fraudulent [[forensics|forensic detective]] who operated over three decades in the [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] area of [[Greater Manchester]], [[England]], under the title '''Dr. Gene Morrison'''.

Memorable for his trademark sheepskin jacket, during the course of his deception he managed to trick not only members of the public, but also many judges, lawyers and the police themselves, into believing he was a genuine expert in [[forensic science]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6386069.stm Fraudulent forensic expert jailed], BBC News, 22 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and imprisonment==
Appearing in court, he insisted on being referred to as ''Doctor'' throughout the entire trial, and the jury were supposedly reduced to laughter on many occasions throughout the proceedings.&lt;ref name=BradshawTimes&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article3277057.ece How to fake a living], by Steve Bradshaw,'' The Sunday Times'', February 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Morrison pleaded guilty to two charges and was found guilty on 20 of the remaining 23; he was sentenced to five years imprisonment,&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; with police suggesting that Morrison may attempt to revive his forensic services upon release.&lt;ref name=BradshawTimes/&gt; 

A video documentary was made about Morrison. Entitled ''Crime Scene Conman'', it was first shown on [[BBC1]] on 25 March 2008.&lt;ref name=show&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009nm9g Documentary about the conman who passed himself of as a top forensic scientist.] BBC One programmes - Crime Scene Conman&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex offences==
On 15 October 2009, Morrison was convicted of thirteen child sex offences (three counts of rape, six counts of indecent assault, four counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child) and one count of perverting the course of justice committed between the 1970s and 2007,&lt;ref name=BBCNews&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/8309265.stm Bogus scientist raped young girls] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; with 19 other charges taken into consideration.

He was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a minimum of seven-and-a-half years, to be served cumulatively with the five-year sentence. Morrison will be eligible for parole in 2017.

The '''''Guang Da Xing No. 28'' incident''' was a fatal shooting incident that occurred on 9 May 2013 involving the [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] fishing boat ''Guang Da Xing No. 28'' and the [[Philippine Coast Guard]] patrol boat ''Maritime Control Surveillance 3001'', which led to the death of Taiwanese fisherman Hung Shih-cheng (洪石成) by gunfire from the Philippine vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Chung | first =Lawrence | title =Philippines admits coastguard fired at Taiwanese fishing boat | publisher = [[South China Morning Post]] | date = 2013-05-11 | url =http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1234433/taiwan-demands-philippines-probe-fishermans-death | accessdate = 2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident occurred in the high seas, within the overlapping [[exclusive economic zones]] of [[Taiwan]] and the [[Philippines]]. After the incident, Taiwan imposed sanctions and conducted a two-day "safety and rescue drill" with its Naval and Coast Guard forces near the waters where the incident occurred, on the grounds that the killing took place within its exclusive economic zone and the Philippine authority's action was in violation of international law. A Philippine official stated that the shooting was a reaction to the threat of being rammed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/15/taiwan-imposes-sanctions-against-philippines?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=Sorry - this page has been removed.|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident came under separate investigations by Taiwanese and Philippine authorities; Taiwanese authorities presented evidence of more than 50 bullet holes found on the fishing boat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1240894/taiwanese-investigators-quit-shooting-probe-calling-philippine-officials Taiwanese investigators quit shooting probe, calling Philippine officials 'dishonest'].&lt;/ref&gt; while Philippine authorities examined a video tape recording of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/468756/20130519/taiwan-philippines-nbi.htm#.UZodhLW0KSo|title=Philippine Investigators Get Evidence On Taiwanese Fisherman's Death|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines released the result of the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]]'s inquiry into the incident on 7 August 2013; the NBI recommended homicide charges against eight Philippine Coast Guard personnel involved in the shooting and recommended sanctions against four others for allegedly trying to alter evidence.&lt;ref name=amita&gt;{{cite news | last =Legaspi | first =Amita | title =Taiwan lifts all 11 sanctions vs. PHL, including hiring freeze | publisher = [[GMA News and Public Affairs]] | date = 8 August 2013 | url = http://ph.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-lifts-11-sanctions-vs-phl-including-hiring-141121330.html | accessdate = 9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day after the release of the investigation report, a representative of the Philippine government traveled to Taiwan to officially apologize to the victim's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Hou | first =Elaine | title =Philippine envoy to apologize to family of dead fisherman | publisher =Focus Taiwan  | date = 8 August 2013 | url = http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201308080006.aspx | accessdate = 9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan subsequently lifted the sanctions it imposed against the Philippines and issued a statement announcing that relations between the two countries have normalized.&lt;ref name=amita/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Hou | first =Elaine | title =Taiwan lifts sanctions, says ties with Manila 'normal' again | publisher =Focus Taiwan  | date = 8 August 2013 | url = http://focustaiwan.tw/search/201308080037.aspx?q=filipino | accessdate = 9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Taiwan, the Philippines and China contest control of fishing waters in the South China Sea. On May 7, Chinese media reported that a large number of Chinese fishing vessels were on their way to disputed waters for a 40-day fishing expedition.&lt;ref name="santolan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santolan|first1=Joseph|title=Philippine coast guard kills Taiwanese fisherman in disputed waters|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/05/14/scsd-m14.html|accessdate=7 September 2016|publisher=World Socialist Web Site|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement provoked an angry response by some politicians in the Philippines, where an election was scheduled for May 13. Walden Bello, a spokesman for the left Akbayan party in a coalition with the ruling Liberal Party, called the fishing flotilla "tantamount to an invasion" and warned that Chinese "naval warships and troops" might follow. Taiwanese fishing vessels were also in the region.&lt;ref name="santolan" /&gt;

==Incident==
On 9 May 2013, the Taiwanese fishing boat ''Guang Da Xing No. 28'' ({{zh|t=廣大興28號|p=Guǎngdàxīng Èrshíbā Hào|poj=Kóng-tāi-hing Jī-tsa̍p-peh Hō}}) was operating about 164 nautical miles southeast of [[Cape Eluanbi]], Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/05/10/2003561896 |title=Fisherman killed in disputed waters |author=Shih Hsiu-chuan and Jake Chung |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2013-05-10 |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was captained by Captain Hung Yu-chih (洪育智); other crew members on board included the captain's father, Hung Shih-cheng (洪石成), the captain's brother-in-law, Hung Jie-shang and an Indonesian national.

The [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ''Maritime Control Surveillance 3001'' (MCS-3001), a 35-meter vessel jointly manned by the [[Philippine Coast Guard]] and [[Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Philippines)|Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources]] personnel, detected two fishing boats at 43 nautical miles east of [[Balintang Island]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2013/05/12/philippines-taiwan-ties-fragile-281958 |title=Philippines, Taiwan ties fragile |publisher=Sun.Star |date=2013-05-12 |accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mb0517"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/article.php?aid=11520&amp;sid=1&amp;subid=1#.UZYIObWW_oI |title=Taiwan vessel rams BFAR boat; Taiwanese fisher dies |author=Madel Sabater Namit and Roy C.

The Philippine Coast Guard opened fire on the fishing boat during a 50-minute chase that ended around 10:00am. Fifty-nine (59) bullet holes (45 of which were entry holes) were found on the vessel and the [[Slug (projectile)|slugs]] were identified as coming from a semi-automatic rifle.

=== Location ===
The incident occurred in the overlapping [[exclusive economic zones]] between [[Taiwan]] and the [[Philippines]]. The site of the incident is 43 nautical miles east of [[Balintang Island]] according to the [[Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Philippines)|Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/photo/37369/bfar-official-shows-where-pcg-vessel-met-taiwanese-fishing-boat |title=BFAR official shows where PCG vessel met Taiwanese fishing boat &amp;#124; GMA News Online |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 170 nautical miles south of Taiwan according to Taiwan's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], both well within the 200 [[nautical mile]] range prescribed by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aall/201305100036.aspx |title=Philippines investigating shooting of Taiwanese fishing boat &amp;#124; Latest &amp;#124; FOCUS TAIWAN - CNA ENGLISH NEWS |publisher=Focustaiwan.tw |date= |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Hung Shih-cheng===
As the first response, the [[Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)|Coast Guard Administration]] of Taiwan dispatched the 2,000-ton ROCCGC ''Tainan'' (CG-126) to the rescue of the stricken vessel and escort it back to its home port. Two Taiwanese fishing vessels assisted in the effort to tow the ''Guang Da Xing No. 28'' back to Taiwan under the escort of the CGA.  The incident led to the death of Taiwanese national Hung Shih-cheng (洪石成), who was 65.

The President of the Philippines, [[Benigno Aquino III]], sent his personal representative to make an unofficial apology for the death of the Taiwanese fisherman on 15 May 2013, dispatching the chairman of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, Amadeo R. Perez, to Taipei, Taiwan as his personal representative.&lt;ref name="pdi"&gt;{{cite news | title = Aquino apologizes for Taiwan fisherman’s death | publisher = [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date = 2013-05-15 | url = http://globalnation.inquirer.net/74547/aquino-apologizes-for-taiwan-fishermans-death | accessdate = 2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Taiwan President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] rejected the apology since it called the shooting "unfortunate" and "unintentional",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Taiwan Rejects Philippine Apology for Taiwanese Fisherman Death  | publisher = [[Voice of America]] | date = 2013-05-15 | url = http://www.voanews.com/content/philippine-president-apologizes-for-taiwanese-fisherman-death/1661262.html | accessdate = 2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; insisting that [[Manila]] offer a formal apology and just compensation.&lt;ref name="pdi"/&gt; The Philippines publicly welcomed a joint investigation with Taiwanese investigators on the incident in the first place,&lt;ref name="investigation"/&gt; but later denied that it had ever made such an offer and rejected the joint investigation when the Taiwanese investigators arrived in Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manilastandard.net/news/-main-stories/100501/taiwanese-group-here-doj-rejects-joint-probe.html|title=Taiwanese group here, DoJ rejects joint probe|website=Manila Standard|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Secretary [[Leila de Lima]] stated that she would allow Taiwan to conduct an investigation parallel to that being conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation.&lt;ref name="roe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/article.php?aid=12441&amp;sid=1&amp;subid=2#.UZb9QbUiHWQ |title= PCG may have violated rules of engagement in Balintang incident |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=|accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims and investigations==

The victim's son, Hung Yu-chih (洪育智), refuted the Philippine Coast Guard's claim, stating that the 15-ton ''Guang Da Xing No. 28'' had a much lower speed compared to the 90-ton PCG vessel. He said their immediate reaction was to flee when the fishing boat encountered the armed Filipino vessel and allegations that the fishing boat had tried to ram the PCG vessel was self-serving and baseless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2013/new/may/11/today-fo3.htm |title=自由電子報 - 「看到菲艦 跑都來不及 」 |publisher=Libertytimes.com.tw |date=2013-05-11 |accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Justice (Republic of China)|Ministry of Justice]] published an investigation report on May 15,&lt;ref name="investigation"/&gt; indicating that 45 bullets hit the boat and that no signs of a collision were found on the boat, refuting the Philippine's claim that the Taiwanese boat had rammed the Filipino vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/article.php?aid=11520&amp;sid=1&amp;subid=1#.UZa4TLUiHWQ|title=Taiwan vessel rams BFAR boat; Taiwanese fisher dies|publisher=Manila Bulletin|date=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report further states that there were total of 59 bullet holes with at least one under the waterline and four near the cabin where the crew was hiding, inferring that the PCG intended to kill the crew. According to the [[voyage data recorder]], the shooting occurred at 19°59'47.27"N and 122°55'41.37"E, which is outside the Philippines' territorial waters, but within the shared EEZ.&lt;ref name="investigation"/&gt; The report further stated that Hung Shih-cheng died of [[respiratory failure]] and [[hemorrhage]] caused by a single [[gunshot wound]] to the neck inflicted by a [[7.62 mm caliber]] [[ammunition]] commonly used in weapons such as the [[M14 rifle]], the [[M240 machine gun]] and the [[M60 machine gun]]. It gave his manner of death as [[homicide]].&lt;ref name="investigation"/&gt;

===Philippines===
On May 10, [[Philippine Coast Guard]] Commandant Rear Admiral Rodolfo Isorena stated that the Taiwanese fishing boat together with another vessel were halted by the crew of MCS-3001 for an on-board inspection. The smaller of the two Taiwanese fishing boats did not respond to the warning and tried to ram the Philippine Coast Guard vessel. The commanding officer of MCS-3001 then gave the order to open fire at Guang Ta Hsin-28 to disable its engine. Two unidentified vessels then arrived in the area, apparently to rescue the disabled Taiwanese vessel, prompting MCS-3001 to disengage and leave.&lt;ref name="mb0517"/&gt;

On May 17, investigators from the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] said that there are signs that the Philippine Coast Guard may have violated their so-called [[rules of engagement]].&lt;ref name="roe"/&gt;

The National Bureau of Investigation disclosed the results of their investigation on 7 August 2013, recommending the filing of homicide charges against the Philippine Coast Guard personnel involved in the shooting. The NBI stated that eight  crewmen were found to have fired at the Taiwanese vessel.  The investigation report also stated that the shooting occurred within Philippine territory in the waterway off the [[Batanes Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Diola | first =Camille | title =NBI recommends homicide vs Coast Guard in Taiwanese death | publisher =[[Philippine Star]] | date = 7 August 2013 | url =http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/08/07/1062831/nbi-recommends-homicide-vs-coast-guard-taiwanese-death | accessdate = 8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the NBI also recommended that charges of [[obstruction of justice]] be filed against four Philippine Coast Guard personnel for tampering with evidence related to the shooting incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Lopez | first =Virgil | title =10 Coast Guard men liable over Taiwanese fisherman’s death | publisher =Sun.Star | date = 7 August 2013 | url =http://www.sunstar.com.ph/breaking-news/2013/08/07/10-coast-guard-men-liable-over-taiwanese-fisherman-s-death-296578| accessdate = 8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
===Public===
====In Taiwan====
A protest by 200 Taiwanese outside the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei was held condemning the Philippine government and sympathizing with the dead fisherman. They also burned Philippine flags as part of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/451468|title=Taiwanese protest killing by Philippine forces|date=13 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Republic of China (Taiwan) President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] urged the Taiwanese people not to vent their anger on Filipinos working in Taiwan and stated that the Philippine government should be held responsible. He insisted that like their Taiwanese fishermen, the Filipino migrant workers are making a living in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=2222888|title=President urges people to treat Filipino workers rationally  - Taiwan News|first=Taiwan|last=News|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma also suggested that a [[Exclusive economic zone|fishery agreement]] will help solve its maritime dispute with the Philippines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=2222889|title=Fishery pact key to solving dispute with the Philippines: Ma  - Taiwan News|first=Taiwan|last=News|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rights groups in Taiwan also echoed the President's call to the Taiwanese people to refrain from targeting Filipinos in Taiwan. TransAsia Sisterhood Taiwan executive secretary Ly Vuoch, a Cambodian immigrant in Taiwan also insisted that not only Filipinos feel threatened when walking in the streets following the incident, but also other immigrants from Southeast Asia. Chen Hsiu-lien, policy researcher from the Taiwan International Workers’ Association, urged the Taiwanese public not to vent their anger towards the Philippine government on Filipino migrant workers. Chen also claimed that President Ma is encouraging people to vent their anger on Filipino workers and insisted that "he would not have waited until now to ask people not to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/05/18/2003562563/1|title=Taipei-Manila Row: Do not attack Filipinos: rights groups - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the Philippines====
Amid rumors of [[Overseas Filipino Worker|OFW]] abuse in [[Taiwan]] regarding the incident, former policeman Abner Afuang burned the [[Flag of the Republic of China|Taiwanese flag]] in protest and urged the Taiwanese to "show some respect". Contingency measures were being arranged for OFWs in case the situation escalates according to Undersecretary [[Abigail Valte]], deputy presidential spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnews.ph/news/metro/2013/05/17/ex-cop-burns-taiwanese-flag-over-abuse-of-ofws#.UZdA96xj7Vo|title=Ex-cop burns Taiwanese flag over abuse of OFWs|accessdate=May 18, 2013 |publisher=Solar News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Roque, an associate professor at the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]], stated that Taiwan is not a [[One-China policy|recognized sovereign body]], hence has no right to force the Philippines into signing a fishing agreement. Under [[international law]] however, he said that Taiwan is entitled to compensation and an apology which should not be made by any higher ranking Philippine official other than the Manila Economic and Cultural Office representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnews.ph/news/2013/05/17/expert-taiwan-can-t-compel-ph-on-fishing-pact#.UZdA9axj7Vo|title=Expert: Taiwan can't compel PH on fishing pact |accessdate=May 18, 2013 |publisher=Solar News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputy Presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said the ramming by a Taiwanese boat in Philippine territorial waters as "an aggressive act."&lt;ref name="mb0517"/&gt; [[Philippine Coast Guard]] (PCG) spokesman Commander Armand Balilo stated that the Filipino personnel had been properly carrying out their duties. He was quoted as saying, "If somebody died, they deserve sympathy but not an apology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/article.php?aid=11493&amp;sid=1&amp;subid=6#.UZYFIbWW_oI |title=Taiwan threatens sanctions over Philippines shooting |publisher=AFP |date=2013-05-11 |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] assigned Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) chairman Amadeo R.

{{Economics sidebar}}
In economics, '''hyperinflation''' is very high and typically accelerating [[inflation]]. It quickly erodes the [[real versus nominal value (economics)|real value]] of the local [[currency]], as the prices of all goods increase. This causes people to minimize their holdings in that currency as they usually switch to more stable foreign currencies, often the US Dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |author2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in action |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 |pages=341, 404 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices typically remain stable in terms of other relatively stable currencies like the US Dollar.

Unlike low inflation, where the process of rising prices is protracted and not generally noticeable except by studying past market prices, hyperinflation sees a rapid and continuing increase in nominal prices, the nominal cost of goods, and in the [[money supply|supply of money]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybowyer/2012/08/09/wheres-the-hyperinflation/ Where's the Hyperinflation?], Forbes.com, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, however, the general price level rises even more rapidly than the money supply as people try ridding themselves of the devaluing currency as quickly as possible. As this happens, the real stock of money (i.e., the amount of circulating money divided by the price level) decreases considerably.&lt;ref name="Bernholz, Peter 2003, chapter 5.3"&gt;Bernholz, Peter 2003, chapter 5.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperinflation is often associated with some stress to the government budget, such as wars or their aftermath, sociopolitical upheavals, a collapse in export prices, or other crises that make it difficult for the government to collect tax revenue. A sharp decrease in real tax revenue coupled with a strong need to maintain government spending, together with an inability or unwillingness to borrow, can lead a country into hyperinflation.&lt;ref name="Bernholz, Peter 2003, chapter 5.3"/&gt;

==Definition==
In 1956, [[Phillip D. Cagan|Phillip Cagan]] wrote ''The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation'', the book often regarded as the first serious study of hyperinflation and its effects&lt;ref name="On Cagan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBnqoV6eMCQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hyperinflation&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E2SDVITBDoWEPN7hgZAG&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Cagan&amp;f=false |title=The Four Ends of the Greek Hyperinflation of 1941-1946 |page=10 |first=Michael R. |last=Palairet |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |year=2000 |isbn=9788772895826}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though ''The Economics of Inflation'' by C. Bresciani-Turroni on the German hyperinflation was published in Italian in 1931&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Joan|date=1 January 1938|title=Review of The Economics of Inflation|jstor=2225440|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=48|issue=191|pages=507–513|doi=10.2307/2225440}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In his book, Cagan defined a hyperinflationary episode as starting in the month that the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%, and as ending when the monthly inflation rate drops below 50% and stays that way for at least a year.&lt;ref name="Hyper"&gt;[[Phillip D. Cagan|Phillip Cagan]], ''The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation'', in Milton Friedman (Editor), ''Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; Economists usually follow [[Phillip D. Cagan|Cagan]]’s description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%.&lt;ref name="On Cagan"/&gt;

The [[International Accounting Standards Board]] has issued guidance on accounting rules in a hyperinflationary environment. It does not establish an absolute rule on when hyperinflation arises. Instead, it lists factors that indicate the existence of hyperinflation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasplus.com/en/standards/standard28 |title=IAS 29 — Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies |accessdate=10 April 2012 |author=International Accounting Standards |publisher=IASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power
*The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;
*Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;
*Interest rates, wages, and prices are linked to a price index; and
*The cumulative inflation rate over three years approaches, or exceeds, 100%.

==Causes==
While there can be a number of causes of high inflation, most hyperinflations have been caused by government [[budget deficit]]s financed by money creation. [[Peter Bernholz]] analysed 29 hyperinflations (following Cagan's definition) and concludes that at least 25 of them have been caused in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Bernholz, Peter 2003, chapter 5.2 and Table 5.1&lt;/ref&gt; A necessary condition for hyperinflation is the use of [[paper money]], instead of gold or silver coins. Most hyperinflations in history, with some exceptions, such as the French hyperinflation of 1789-1796, occurred after the use of [[fiat currency]] became widespread in the late 19th century. The French hyperinflation took place after the introduction of a non-convertible paper currency, the [[assignat]]s.

===Money supply===
Hyperinflation occurs when there is a continuing (and often accelerating) rapid increase in the amount of money that is not supported by a corresponding growth in the output of goods and services.

The price increases that result from the rapid [[money creation]] creates a vicious circle, requiring ever growing amounts of new money creation to fund government deficits. Hence both [[monetary inflation]] and price inflation proceed at a rapid pace. Such rapidly increasing prices cause widespread unwillingness of the local population to hold the local currency as it rapidly loses its buying power. Instead they quickly spend any money they receive, which increases the [[velocity of money]] flow; this in turn causes further acceleration in prices. This means that the increase in the price level is greater than that of the money supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parsson |first=Jens |authorlink=Jens O. Parsson |title=Dying of Money (Chapter 17: Velocity) |publisher=Wellspring Press |year=1974 |location=Boston, MA |pages=112–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real stock of money, M/P, decreases. Here M refers to the money stock and P to the price level.

This results in an imbalance between the [[supply and demand]] for the money (including currency and bank deposits), causing rapid inflation. Very high inflation rates can result in a loss of confidence in the currency, similar to a [[bank run]]. Usually, the excessive money supply growth results from the government being either unable or unwilling to fully finance the government budget through taxation or borrowing, and instead it finances the government budget deficit through the printing of money.&lt;ref name="z"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080408131232/http://www.fingaz.co.zw/fingaz/2003/October/October2/1365.shtml Hyperinflation: causes, cures] Bernard Mufute, 2003-10-02, "Hyperinflation has its root cause in money growth, which is not supported by growth in the output of goods and services. Usually the excessive money supply growth is caused by financing of the government budget deficit through the printing of money."&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have sometimes resorted to excessively loose monetary policy, as it allows a government to devalue its debts and reduce (or avoid) a tax increase. Inflation is effectively a [[regressive tax]] on the users of money,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/economics/econref/workingpapers/researchreports/wp2000/wp2000_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910064531/http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/economics/econref/workingpapers/researchreports/wp2000/wp2000_1.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but less overt than levied taxes and is therefore harder to understand by ordinary citizens. Inflation can obscure quantitative assessments of the true cost of living, as published price indices only look at data in retrospect, so may increase only months later. [[Monetary inflation]] can become hyperinflation if monetary authorities fail to fund increasing government expenses from [[tax]]es, [[government debt]], cost cutting, or by other means, because either
*during the time between recording or levying taxable transactions and collecting the taxes due, the value of the taxes collected falls in real value to a small fraction of the original taxes receivable; or
*government debt issues fail to find buyers except at very deep discounts; or
*a combination of the above.

Theories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between [[seigniorage]] and the [[inflation tax]]. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position. Thus when [[fiat money]] is printed, government obligations that are not denominated in money increase in cost by more than the value of the money created.

[[File:German Hyperinflation.jpg|right|thumb|The price of gold in Germany, 1 January 1918 – 30 November 1923. (The vertical scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]).]]

From this, it might be wondered why any rational government would engage in actions that cause or continue hyperinflation. One reason for such actions is that often the alternative to hyperinflation is either [[depression (economics)|depression]] or military defeat. The root cause is a matter of more dispute. In both [[classical economics]] and [[monetarism]], it is always the result of the monetary authority irresponsibly borrowing money to pay all its expenses. These models focus on the unrestrained [[seigniorage]] of the monetary authority, and the gains from the [[inflation tax]].

In neo-classical economic theory, hyperinflation is rooted in a deterioration of the [[monetary base]], that is the confidence that there is a store of value that the currency will be able to command later. In this model, the perceived risk of holding currency rises dramatically, and sellers demand increasingly high premiums to accept the currency. This in turn leads to a greater fear that the currency will collapse, causing even higher premiums. One example of this is during periods of warfare, civil war, or intense internal conflict of other kinds: governments need to do whatever is necessary to continue fighting, since the alternative is defeat. Expenses cannot be cut significantly since the main outlay is armaments. Further, a civil war may make it difficult to raise taxes or to collect existing taxes. While in peacetime the deficit is financed by selling bonds, during a war it is typically difficult and expensive to borrow, especially if the war is going poorly for the government in question. The banking authorities, whether central or not, "monetize" the deficit, printing money to pay for the government's efforts to survive. The hyperinflation under the [[Chinese Nationalists]] from 1939 to 1945 is a classic example of a government printing money to pay civil war costs. By the end, currency was flown in over the Himalayas, and then old currency was flown out to be destroyed.

Hyperinflation is a complex phenomenon and one explanation may not be applicable to all cases. In both of these models, however, whether loss of confidence comes first, or central bank [[seigniorage]], the other phase is ignited. In the case of rapid expansion of the money supply, prices rise rapidly in response to the increased supply of money relative to the supply of goods and services, and in the case of loss of confidence, the monetary authority responds to the risk premiums it has to pay by "running the printing presses."

Nevertheless, the immense acceleration process that occurs during hyperinflation (such as during the German hyperinflation of 1922/23) still remains unclear and unpredictable. The transformation of an inflationary development into the hyperinflation has to be identified as a very complex phenomenon, which could be a further advanced research avenue of the [[complexity economics]] in conjunction with research areas like [[mass hysteria]], [[bandwagon effect]], social brain, and [[mirror neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Chr. Fischer (Editor), ''[http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/11756/ German Hyperinflation 1922/23 – A Law and Economics Approach]'', Eul Verlag, Köln, Germany 2010, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supply shocks===
A number of hyperinflations were caused by some sort of extreme negative [[supply shock]], often but not always associated with wars, the breakdown of the communist system or natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Montier |first=James |date=February 2013 |title=Hyperinflations, Hysteria, and False Memories |format=PDF |publisher=GMO LLC |url=https://www.gmo.com/America/CMSAttachmentDownload.aspx?target=JUBRxi51IIDV3C26gZvJ6r5NLthcX%2f9Q0ZPBQkExvMSh%2bvK1CMTHyV1xpwPa69Che8Ur%2b3GtnBdlT1z8uTf9QasTtYoks5h9OAqo9c0oc22JsBb%2fSWtTBA%3d%3d |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models===
Since hyperinflation is visible as a monetary effect, models of hyperinflation center on the demand for money. Economists see both a rapid increase in the [[money supply]] and an increase in the [[velocity of money]] if the (monetary) inflating is not stopped. Either one, or both of these together are the root causes of inflation and hyperinflation. A dramatic increase in the velocity of money as the cause of hyperinflation is central to the "crisis of confidence" model of hyperinflation, where the risk premium that sellers demand for the paper currency over the nominal value grows rapidly. The second theory is that there is first a radical increase in the amount of circulating medium, which can be called the "monetary model" of hyperinflation. In either model, the second effect then follows from the first—either too little confidence forcing an increase in the money supply, or too much money destroying confidence.

In the ''confidence model'', some event, or series of events, such as defeats in battle, or a run on stocks of the specie that back a currency, removes the belief that the authority issuing the money will remain solvent—whether a bank or a government. Because people do not want to hold notes that may become valueless, they want to spend them. Sellers, realizing that there is a higher risk for the currency, demand a greater and greater premium over the original value. Under this model, the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the backing of the currency, often by issuing a completely new one. War is one commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence, particularly losing in a war, as occurred during Napoleonic [[Vienna]], and capital flight, sometimes because of "contagion" is another. In this view, the increase in the circulating medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself.

In the ''monetary model'', hyperinflation is a [[positive feedback]] cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiraling costs, often from lax fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When business people perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot "win" and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the [[Washington consensus]] of the 1990s.

Whatever the cause, hyperinflation involves both the supply and [[velocity of money]]. Which comes first is a matter of debate, and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases. But once the hyperinflation is established, the pattern of increasing the money stock, by whichever agencies are allowed to do so, is universal. Because this practice increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for it, the price of the currency, that is the exchange rate, naturally falls relative to other currencies. Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the increase in money supply turns specific areas of pricing power into a general frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless. The purchasing power of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an unacceptable loss of purchasing power. As a result, no one holds currency, which increases the velocity of money, and worsens the crisis.

Because rapidly rising prices undermine the role of money as a [[store of value]], people try to spend it on real goods or services as quickly as possible. Thus, the monetary model predicts that the velocity of money will increase as a result of an excessive increase in the money supply. At the point when money velocity and prices rapidly accelerate in a [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]], hyperinflation is out of control, because ordinary policy mechanisms, such as increasing reserve requirements, raising interest rates, or cutting government spending will be ineffective and be responded to by shifting away from the rapidly devalued money and towards other means of exchange.

During a period of hyperinflation, bank runs, loans for 24-hour periods, switching to alternate currencies, the return to use of gold or silver or even barter become common. Many of the people who hoard gold today expect hyperinflation, and are hedging against it by holding specie. There may also be extensive [[capital flight]] or flight to a "hard" currency such as the US dollar. This is sometimes met with [[capital control]]s, an idea that has swung from standard, to anathema, and back into semi-respectability. All of this constitutes an economy that is operating in an "abnormal" way, which may lead to decreases in real production. If so, that intensifies the hyperinflation, since it means that the amount of goods in "too much money chasing too few goods" formulation is also reduced. This is also part of the vicious circle of hyperinflation.

Once the vicious circle of hyperinflation has been ignited, dramatic policy means are almost always required. Simply raising interest rates is insufficient. Bolivia, for example, underwent a period of hyperinflation in 1985, where prices increased 12,000% in the space of less than a year. The government raised the price of gasoline, which it had been selling at a huge loss to quiet popular discontent, and the hyperinflation came to a halt almost immediately, since it was able to bring in hard currency by selling its oil abroad. The crisis of confidence ended, and people returned deposits to banks. The German hyperinflation (1919–November 1923) was ended by producing a currency based on assets loaned against by banks, called the [[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]]. Hyperinflation often ends when a civil conflict ends with one side winning.

Although [[incomes policy|wage and price controls]] are sometimes used to control or prevent inflation, no episode of hyperinflation has been ended by the use of price controls alone, because price controls that force merchants to sell at prices far below their restocking costs result in shortages that cause prices to rise still further.

[[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel prize]] winner [[Milton Friedman]] said "We economists don't know much, but we do know how to create a shortage. If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can't sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you'll have a tomato shortage. It's the same with oil or gas."&lt;ref&gt;"Controls blamed for U.S. energy woes", ''Los Angeles Times'', 13 February 1977, Milton Friedman press conference in Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

Hyperinflation effectively wipes out the purchasing power of private and public savings; distorts the economy in favor of the hoarding of real assets; causes the monetary base, whether [[money|specie]] or hard currency, to flee the country; and makes the afflicted area anathema to investment.

One of the most important characteristics of hyperinflation is the accelerating substitution of the inflating money by stable money—gold and silver in former times, then relatively stable foreign currencies after the breakdown of the gold or silver standards ([[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]]' [[Thiers' law|Law]]). If inflation is high enough, government regulations like heavy penalties and fines, often combined with exchange controls, cannot prevent this currency substitution. As a consequence, the inflating currency is usually heavily undervalued compared to stable foreign money in terms of purchasing power parity. So foreigners can live cheaply and buy at low prices in the countries hit by high inflation. It follows that governments that do not succeed in engineering a successful currency reform in time must finally legalize the stable foreign currencies (or, formerly, gold and silver) that threaten to fully substitute the inflating money. Otherwise, their tax revenues, including the inflation tax, will approach zero.&lt;ref name="Bernholz, Peter 2003"&gt;Bernholz, Peter 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The last episode of hyperinflation in which this process could be observed was in [[Zimbabwe]] in the first decade of the 21st century. In this case, the local money was mainly driven out by the US dollar and the South African rand.

Enactment of price controls to prevent discounting the value of [[paper money]] relative to gold, silver, [[hard currency]], or other commodities fail to force acceptance of a paper money that lacks intrinsic value. If the entity responsible for printing a currency promotes excessive money printing, with other factors contributing a reinforcing effect, hyperinflation usually continues. Hyperinflation is generally associated with paper money, which can easily be used to increase the money supply: add more zeros to the plates and print, or even stamp old notes with new numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/03/06/jefferson-county-memories/ Jefferson County Miracles], ''Wall Street Journal'', 6 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, there have been numerous episodes of hyperinflation in various countries followed by a return to "hard money". Older economies would revert to [[hard currency]] and [[barter (economics)|barter]] when the circulating medium became excessively devalued, generally following a "run" on the [[store of value]].

Much attention on hyperinflation centers on the effect on savers whose investments become worthless. Interest rate changes often cannot keep up with hyperinflation or even high inflation, certainly with contractually fixed interest rates. For example, in the 1970s in the United Kingdom inflation reached 25% per annum, yet interest rates did not rise above 15%—and then only briefly—and many fixed interest rate loans existed. Contractually, there is often no bar to a debtor clearing his long term debt with "hyperinflated cash", nor could a lender simply somehow suspend the loan. Contractual "early redemption penalties" were (and still are) often based on a penalty of ''n'' months of interest/payment; again no real bar to paying off what had been a large loan. In interwar Germany, for example, much private and corporate debt was effectively wiped out—certainly for those holding fixed interest rate loans.

[[Ludwig von Mises]] used the term "crack-up boom" (German: Katastrophenhausse) to describe the economic consequences of an unmitigated increasing in the base-money supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ludwig von Mises]] |title=[[Human Action]] |publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes, San Francisco, 4th edition, 1986 |page=428 |isbn=0-930073-18-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more and more money is provided, interest rates decline towards zero. Realizing that fiat money is losing value, investors will try to place money in assets such as real estate, stocks, even art; as these appear to represent "real" value. Asset prices are thus becoming inflated. This potentially spiraling process will ultimately lead to the collapse of the monetary system. The Cantillon effect&lt;ref&gt;[https://azizonomics.com/2012/08/07/the-cantillon-effect/ Definition of Cantillon effect, first described by [[Richard Cantillon]]]&lt;/ref&gt; says that those institutions that receive the new money first are the beneficiaries of the policy.

===Aftermath===
Hyperinflation is ended by drastic remedies, such as imposing the [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] of slashing government expenditures or altering the currency basis. One form this may take is [[dollarization]], the use of a foreign currency (not necessarily the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]) as a national unit of currency. An example was dollarization in Ecuador, initiated in September 2000 in response to a 75% loss of value of the [[Ecuadorian sucre]] in early 2000. But usually the "dollarization" takes place in spite of all efforts of the government to prevent it by exchange controls, heavy fines and penalties. The government has thus to try to engineer a successful currency reform stabilizing the value of the money. If it does not succeed with this reform the substitution of the inflating by stable money goes on. Thus it is not surprising that there have been at least seven historical cases in which the good (foreign) money did fully drive out the use of the inflating currency. In the end the government had to legalize the former, for otherwise its revenues would have fallen to zero.&lt;ref name="Bernholz, Peter 2003"/&gt;

Hyperinflation has always been a traumatic experience for the people who suffer it, and the next political regime almost always enacts policies to try to prevent its recurrence. Often this means making the central bank very aggressive about maintaining price stability, as was the case with the German [[Bundesbank]], or moving to some hard basis of currency, such as a [[currency board]]. Many governments have enacted extremely stiff [[wage and price controls]] in the wake of hyperinflation, but this does not prevent further inflation of the money supply by the [[central bank]], and always leads to widespread shortages of consumer goods if the controls are rigidly enforced.

===Currency===
In countries experiencing hyperinflation, the [[central bank]] often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the smaller denomination notes become worthless. This can result in the production of unusually large demoninations of [[banknote]]s, including those denominated in amounts of 1,000,000,000 or more.
*By late 1923, the [[Weimar Republic]] of Germany was issuing two-trillion mark banknotes and postage stamps with a face value of fifty billion marks. The highest value banknote issued by the Weimar government's Reichsbank had a face value of 100 trillion marks (10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;; 100,000,000,000,000; 100 million million).&lt;ref&gt;1 billion in the German long scale = 1000 milliard = 1 trillion US scale.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sammler.com/coins/inflation.htm Values of the most important German Banknotes of the Inflation Period from 1920 – 1923]&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the inflation, one US dollar was worth 4 trillion German marks. One of the firms printing these notes submitted an invoice for the work to the Reichsbank for 32,776,899,763,734,490,417.05 (3.28 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;, or 33 [[quintillion]]) marks.&lt;ref&gt;''The Penniless Billionaires'', Max Shapiro, New York Times Book Co., 1980, page 203, {{ISBN|0-8129-0923-2}} Shipiro comments: "Of course, one must not forget the 5 pfennig!"&lt;/ref&gt;
*The largest denomination banknote ever officially issued for circulation was in 1946 by the [[Hungarian National Bank]] for the amount of 100 quintillion [[pengő]] (100,000,000,000,000,000,000, or 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;; 100 million million million) [http://bankjegy.szabadsagharcos.org/xxcentury/p136.htm image]. (A banknote worth 10 times as much, 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; (1 [[sextillion]]) pengő, was printed but not issued [http://bankjegy.szabadsagharcos.org/xxcentury/p137.htm image].) The banknotes did not show the numbers in full: "hundred million b.-pengő" ("hundred million trillion pengő") and "one milliard b.-pengő" were spelled out instead. This makes the 100,000,000,000,000 [[Zimbabwean dollar]] banknotes the note with the greatest number of zeros shown.
*The Post-World War II hyperinflation of Hungary held the record for the most extreme monthly inflation rate ever – 41,900,000,000,000,000% (4.19 × 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;% or 41.9 quadrillion percent) for July 1946, amounting to prices doubling every 15.3 hours. By comparison, recent figures (as of 14 November 2008) estimate Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate at 89.7 [[sextillion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;) percent.&lt;ref name="cato"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/zimbabwe |title=New Hyperinflation Index (HHIZ) Puts Zimbabwe Inflation at 89.7 sextillion percent, |author=Hanke, Steve H. |publisher=[[The Cato Institute]] |date=17 November 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest monthly inflation rate of that period was 79.6 billion percent, and a doubling time of 24.7 hours. In figures, that is 79,600,000,000%.

One way to avoid the use of large numbers is by declaring a new unit of currency. (As an example, instead of 10,000,000,000 dollars, a central bank might set 1 new dollar = 1,000,000,000 old dollars, so the new note would read "10 new dollars".) A recent example of this is Turkey's revaluation of the [[Lira]] on 1 January 2005, when the old [[Turkish lira]] (TRL) was converted to the [[New Turkish lira]] (TRY) at a rate of 1,000,000 old to 1 new Turkish Lira. While this does not lessen the actual value of a currency, it is called [[redenomination]] or [[revaluation]] and also occasionally happens in countries with lower inflation rates. During hyperinflation, currency inflation happens so quickly that bills reach large numbers before revaluation.

Some banknotes were stamped to indicate changes of denomination, as it would have taken too long to print new notes. By the time new notes were printed, they would be obsolete (that is, they would be of too low a denomination to be useful).

Metallic coins were rapid casualties of hyperinflation, as the scrap value of metal enormously exceeded its face value. Massive amounts of coinage were melted down, usually illicitly, and exported for hard currency.

Governments will often try to disguise the true rate of inflation through a variety of techniques. None of these actions addresses the root causes of inflation; and if discovered, they tend to further undermine trust in the currency, causing further increases in inflation. [[Price controls]] will generally result in shortages and hoarding and extremely high demand for the controlled goods, causing disruptions of [[supply chain]]s. Products available to consumers may diminish or disappear as businesses no longer find it economic to continue producing and/or distributing such goods at the legal prices, further exacerbating the shortages.

There are also issues with computerized money-handling systems. In Zimbabwe, during the hyperinflation of the Zimbabwe dollar, many [[automated teller machines]] and payment card machines struggled with [[arithmetic overflow]] errors as customers required many billions and trillions of dollars at one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/31/zimbabwe |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=Tran |title=Zimbabwe knocks 10 zeros off currency amid world's highest inflation |date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable hyperinflationary episodes==

===Rome===
During the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], Rome underwent hyperinflation caused by years of coinage [[devaluation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-currency-debasement-contributed-to-fall-of-rome-2016-2|title=This infographic shows how currency debasement contributed to the fall of Rome|work=Business Insider|access-date=18 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
[[File:The Hanke Krus Hyperinflation Table.pdf|right|thumb|Hanke Krus Hyperinflation Table that lists 56 episodes of hyperinflation (following Cagan's definition)]]
In 1922, inflation in Austria reached 1,426%, and from 1914 to January 1923, the consumer price index rose by a factor of 11,836, with the highest banknote in denominations of 500,000 [[Austrian krone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fee.org/pdf/the-freeman/0604RMEbeling.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219200751/http://www.fee.org/pdf/the-freeman/0604RMEbeling.pdf|date=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]], essentially all State enterprises ran at a loss, and the number of state employees in the capital, Vienna, was greater than in the earlier monarchy, even though the new republic was nearly one-eighth of the size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Fergusson|title=When Money Dies: The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxUBAwAAQBAJ|date=12 October 2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-994-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observing the Austrian response to developing hyperinflation, which included the hoarding of food and the speculation in foreign currencies, Owen S. Phillpotts, the Commercial Secretary at the British Legation in Vienna wrote: "The Austrians are like men on a ship who cannot manage it, and are continually signalling for help. While waiting, however, most of them begin to cut rafts, each for himself, out of the sides and decks. The ship has not yet sunk despite the leaks so caused, and those who have acquired stores of wood in this way may use them to cook their food, while the more seamanlike look on cold and hungry. The population lack courage and energy as well as patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Fergusson |year=2010|title=When Money Dies – The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany|page=92|publisher=Public Affairs – Perseus Books Group|isbn=978-1-58648-994-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
As the first user of [[fiat currency]], China was also the first country to experience hyperinflation. Paper currency was introduced during the [[Tang Dynasty]], and was generally welcomed. It maintained its value, as successive Chinese governments put in place strict controls on issuance. The convenience of paper currency for trade purposes led to strong demand for paper currency. It was only when discipline on quantity supplied broke down that hyperinflation emerged.&lt;ref&gt;The Truth About Inflation, Chapter 2, [[Paul Donovan (economist)|Paul Donovan]], Routledge 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368) was the first to print large amounts of fiat paper money to fund their wars, resulting in hyperinflation. Much later, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] went through hyperinflation from 1948–49. In 1947, the highest denomination bill was 50,000 [[Chinese yuan#First yuan, 1889–1948|yuan]]. By mid-1948, the highest denomination was 180,000,000 yuan. The 1948 currency reform replaced the yuan by the gold yuan at an exchange rate of 1 gold yuan = 3,000,000 yuan. In less than a year, the highest denomination was 10,000,000 gold yuan. In the final days of the civil war, the Silver Yuan was briefly introduced at the rate of 500,000,000 Gold Yuan. Meanwhile, the highest denomination issued by a regional bank was 6,000,000,000 yuan (issued by Xinjiang Provincial Bank in 1949). After the [[renminbi]] was instituted by the new communist government, hyperinflation ceased, with a revaluation of 1:10,000 old [[First series of the renminbi|Renminbi]] in 1955.

===France===
During the [[French Revolution]] and [[French First Republic|first Republic]], the National Assembly issued bonds, some backed by seized church property, called [[assignat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecurrencycollector.com/pdfs/BankNotesoftheFrenchRevolutionPartII.pdf J.E. Sandrock: "Bank notes of the French Revolution" and First Republic]&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon replaced them with the franc in 1803, at which time the assignats were basically worthless.
Stephen D. Dillaye pointed out that one of the reasons for the failure was massive counterfeiting of the paper currency, "the Assignats" – largely through London – where, according to Dillaye: "Seventeen manufacturing establishments were in full operation in London, with a force of four hundred men devoted to the production of false and forged Assignats." &lt;ref&gt;Stephen D.

By November 1922, the value in gold of money in circulation had fallen from £300 million before World War I to £20 million. The Reichsbank responded by the unlimited printing of notes, thereby accelerating the devaluation of the mark. In his report to London, Lord D'Abernon wrote: "In the whole course of history, no dog has ever run after its own tail with the speed of the Reichsbank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Fergusson|year=2010|title=When Money Dies – The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany|page=117|publisher=Public Affairs – Perseus Books Group|isbn=978-1-58648-994-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lord D'Abernon|year=1930|title=An Ambassador of Peace, the diary of Viscount D'Abernon, Berlin 1920–1926 (V1–3)|publisher=London: Hodder and Stoughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany went through its worst inflation in 1923. In 1922, the highest denomination was 50,000 [[German Papiermark|Marks]]. By 1923, the highest denomination was 100,000,000,000,000 (10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;) Marks.

===Greece (German-Italian occupation)===
With the German invasion in April 1941, there was an abrupt increase in prices. This was due to psychological factors related to the fear of shortages and to the hoarding of goods. During the German and Italian [[Axis occupation of Greece]] (1941-1944), the agricultural, mineral, industrial etc. production of Greece were used to sustain the occupation forces, but also to secure provisions for the [[Afrika Korps]]. One part of these "sales" of provisions was settled with bilateral clearing through the German [[DEGRIGES]] and the Italian Sagic companies at very low prices. As the value of Greek exports in drachmas fell, the demand for drachmas followed suit and so did its forex rate.
While shortages started due to naval blockades and hoarding, the prices of commodities soared. The other part of the "purchases" was settled with drachmas secured from the Bank of Greece and printed for this purpose by private printing presses. As prices soared, the Germans and Italians started requesting more and more drachmas from the Bank of Greece to offset price increases; each time prices increased, the note circulation followed suit soon afterwards. For the year November 1943 - November 1944, the inflation rate was 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;%, the circulation was 6.28 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; drachmae and one gold sovereign cost 43,167 billion drachmas.
The hyperinflation started subsiding immediately after the departure of the German occupation forces, but inflation rates took several years before they fell below 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Athanassios K.

The [[Treaty of Trianon]] and political instability between 1919 and 1924 led to a major inflation of Hungary's currency. In 1921, in an attempt to stop inflation, the national assembly of Hungary passed the Hegedűs reforms, including a 20% levy on bank deposits. This action precipitated a mistrust of banks by the public, especially the peasants, and resulted in a reduction in savings and in the amount of currency in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Fergusson |year=2010|title=When Money Dies&amp;nbsp;– The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany|page=101|publisher=Public Affairs&amp;nbsp;– Perseus Books Group|isbn=978-1-58648-994-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to tax adequately, the government resorted to printing money, and in 1923 inflation in Hungary reached 98% per month.

Between the end of 1945 and July 1946, Hungary went through the worst inflation ever recorded. In 1944, the highest denomination{{clarify|date=September 2016}} was 1,000 [[Hungarian pengő|pengő]]. By the end of 1945, it was 10,000,000 pengő. The highest denomination in mid-1946 was 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) pengő. A special currency, the adópengő – or tax pengő – was created for tax and postal payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heindorffhus.motivsamler.dk/shoebox/frame-HungaryInflation02.htm Hungary: Postal history – Hyperinflation (part 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the adópengő was adjusted each day, by radio announcement.

===North Korea===
North Korea has most likely experienced hyperinflation from December 2009 to mid-January 2011. Based on the price of rice, North Korea's hyperinflation peaked in mid-January 2010, but according to black market exchange-rate data, and calculations based on purchasing power parity, North Korea experienced its peak month of inflation in early March 2010. These data are unofficial, however, and therefore must be treated with a degree of caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/market.php |title=Brightening the future of Korea |publisher=DailyNK |accessdate=15 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110150151/http://www.dailynk.com/english/market.php |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peru ===
In modern history, [[Peru]] underwent a period of hyperinflation period in the [[1980s]] to the early 1990s starting with [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry|President Fernando Belaúnde's]] second administration, heightened during [[Alan García|Alan García's]] first administration, to the beginning of [[Alberto Fujimori|Alberto Fujimori's term]]. Over 3,210,000,000 old soles would be worth one [[United States dollar|USD]]. Garcia's term introduced the [[Peruvian inti|inti]], which worsened inflation into hyperinflation.

===Poland===
[[Poland]] has gone through two episodes of hyperinflation since the country regained independence following the [[World War I]], the first in 1923, the second in 1989-1990. Both events resulted in the introduction of new currencies. In 1924, the ''złoty'' replaced the original currency of post-war Poland, the mark. This currency was subsequently replaced by another of the same name in 1950, which was assigned the ISO code of PLZ. As a result of the second hyperinflation crisis, the current ''new złoty'' was introduced in 1990 (ISO code: PLN). See the article on [[Polish złoty]] for more information about the currency's history.

The newly independent Poland had been struggling with a large budget deficit since its inception in 1918 but it was in 1923 when inflation reached its peak. The exchange rate to the American dollar went from 9 Polish marks per dollar in 1918 to 6,375,000 marks per dollar at the end of 1923. A new personal 'inflation tax' was introduced. The resolution of the crisis is attributed to [[Władysław Grabski]], who became [[prime minister of Poland]] in December 1923. Having nominated an all-new government and being granted extraordinary lawmaking powers by the [[Sejm]] for a period of six months, he introduced a new currency, established a new national bank and scrapped the inflation tax, which took place throughout 1924.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbportal.pl/slownik/pozycje-slownika/hiperinflacja|title=Hiperinflacja - Polish National Bank|date=7 May 2015|website=www.nbportal.pl|language=PL|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic crisis in Poland in the 1980s was accompanied by rising inflation when new money was printed to cover a budget deficit. Although inflation was not as acute as in 1920s, it is estimated that its annual rate reached around 600% in a period of over a year spanning parts of 1989 and 1990. The economy was stabilised by the adoption of the [[Balcerowicz Plan]] in 1989, named after the main author of the reforms, minister of finance [[Leszek Balcerowicz]]. The plan was largely inspired by the previous Grabski's reforms.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Philippines===
The Japanese government occupying the Philippines during [[World War II]] issued fiat currencies for general circulation. The Japanese-sponsored [[Second Philippine Republic]] government led by [[Jose P. Laurel]] at the same time outlawed possession of other currencies, most especially "guerrilla money." The fiat money's lack of value earned it the derisive nickname "Mickey Mouse money". Survivors of the war often tell tales of bringing suitcases or ''bayong'' (native bags made of woven coconut or [[Corypha|buri]] leaf strips) overflowing with Japanese-issued bills. Early on, 75 Mickey Mouse [[Japanese government-issued Philippine fiat peso|pesos]] could buy one duck egg.&lt;ref name="LATimes.com_pera"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=A Return to Wartime Philippines |author=Barbara A.

In 1942, the highest denomination available was 10 pesos. Before the end of the war, because of inflation, the Japanese government was forced to issue 100-, 500-, and 1000-peso notes.

The term "banana money" originates from the [[motif (art)|motif]]s of banana trees on the currency's 10 dollar banknote.]]

Malaya and Singapore were under [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese occupation]] from 1942 until 1945. The Japanese issued [[banana money]] as the official currency to replace the [[Straits dollar|Straits currency]] issued by the British. During that time, the cost of basic necessities increased drastically. As the occupation proceeded, the Japanese authorities printed more money to fund their wartime activities, which resulted in hyperinflation and a severe depreciation in value of the banana note.

From February to December 1942, $100 of Straits currency was worth $100 in Japanese [[scrip]], after which the value of Japanese scrip began to erode, reaching $385 on December 1943 and $1,850 one year later. By 1 August 1945, this had inflated to $10,500, and 11 days later it had reached $95,000. After 13 August 1945, Japanese scrip had become valueless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banana Money Exchange|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19481217-1.2.75.aspx|website=Newspaper SG|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
{{Main|Hyperinflation in early Soviet Russia}}

A seven-year period of uncontrollable spiralling inflation occurred in the early [[Soviet Union]], running from the earliest days of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in November 1917 to the reestablishment of the [[gold standard]] with the introduction of the [[chervonets]] as part of the [[New Economic Policy]]. The inflationary crisis effectively ended in March 1924 with the introduction of the so-called "gold ruble" as the country's standard currency.

The early Soviet hyperinflationary period was marked by three successive [[redenomination|redenominations of its currency]], in which "new rubles" replaced old at the rates of 10,000-to-1 (1 January 1922), 100-to-1 (1 January 1923), and 50,000-to-1 (7 March 1924), respectively.

Between 1921 and 1922, inflation in the [[Soviet Union]] reached 213%.

This forecast was criticized by Steve H. Hanke, professor of applied economics at The Johns Hopkins University and senior fellow at the Cato Institute. According to Hanke, the IMF had released a "bogus forecast" because "no one has ever been able to accurately forecast the course or the duration of an episode of hyperinflation. But that has not stopped the IMF from offering inflation forecasts for Venezuela that have proven to be wildly inaccurate".&lt;ref name=Hanke&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hanke |first1=Steve |title=IMF Produces Another Bogus Venezuela Inflation Forecast |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2018/07/31/imf-produces-another-bogus-venezuela-inflation-forecast/#78430a7b7dc8 |website=Forbes |accessdate=31 August 2018 |date=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yugoslavia===
[[File:500000000000 dinars.jpg|thumb|right|A 500 billion Yugoslav dinar banknote circa 1993, the largest nominal value ever officially printed in Yugoslavia, the final result of hyperinflation.]]

[[Yugoslavia]] went through a period of hyperinflation and subsequent currency reforms from 1989–1994. One of several regional conflicts accompanying the dissolution of Yugoslavia was the Bosnian War (1992–1995). The Belgrade government of Slobodan Milošević backed ethnic Serbian secessionist forces in the conflict, resulting in a United Nations boycott of Yugoslavia. The UN boycott collapsed an economy already weakened by regional war, with the projected monthly inflation rate accelerating to one million percent by December 1993 (prices double every 2.3 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=31 December 1993|work=The New York Times|title=Where Zillion Loses Meaning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest denomination in 1988 was 50,000 [[Yugoslav dinar|dinars]]. By 1989 it was 2,000,000 dinars. In the 1990 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 10,000 old dinars. In the 1992 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 10 old dinars. The highest denomination in 1992 was 50,000 dinars. By 1993, it was 10,000,000,000 dinars. In the 1993 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000 old dinars. Before the year was over, however, the highest denomination was 500,000,000,000 dinars. In the 1994 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000,000 old dinars. In another currency reform a month later, 1 novi dinar was exchanged for 13 million dinars (1 novi dinar = 1 [[German mark]] at the time of exchange). The overall impact of hyperinflation was that 1 novi dinar was equal to 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;~1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; pre-1990 dinars. [[Yugoslavia]]'s rate of inflation hit 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; percent cumulative inflation over the time period 1 October 1993 and 24 January 1994. &lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD A PRICE DOUBLING OF EVERY 16 HOURS.

Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe was one of the few instances that resulted in the abandonment of the local currency. At independence in 1980, the [[Zimbabwe dollar]] (ZWD) was worth about USD 1.25. Afterwards, however, rampant inflation and the collapse of the economy severely devalued the currency. Inflation was steady until [[Tony Blair|British Prime Minister Tony Blair]] reneged on Land reform agreements arrived at between [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Robert Mugabe]] continued land redistribution from the [[White Zimbabweans|white]] farming community in 1998, resulting in reductions in food production and the decline of foreign investment.

By October 2008 Zimbabwe was mired in hyperinflation with wages falling far behind inflation. In this dysfunctional economy hospitals and schools had chronic staffing problems, because many nurses and teachers could not afford bus fare to work. Most of the capital of Harare was without water because the authorities had stopped paying the bills to buy and transport the treatment chemicals. Desperate for foreign currency to keep the government functioning, Zimbabwe's central bank governor, Gideon Gono, sent runners into the streets with suitcases of Zimbabwean dollars to buy up American dollars and South African rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Celia W. Dugger|work=The New York Times|title=Life in Zimbabwe: Wait for Useless Money|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For periods after July 2008, no official inflation statistics were released. Prof. Steve H. Hanke overcame the problem by estimating inflation rates after July 2008 and publishing the Hanke Hyperinflation Index for Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Steve H. Hanke, "New Hyperinflation Index (HHIZ) Puts Zimbabwe Inflation at 89.7 Sextillion Percent." Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. (Retrieved 17 November 2008) [http://www.cato.org/zimbabwe]&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Hanke's HHIZ measure indicated that the inflation peaked at an annual rate of 89.7 sextillion percent (89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000%) in mid-November 2008. The peak monthly rate was 79.6 billion percent, which is equivalent to a 98% daily rate, or around {{gaps|7|base= 10|e=108}} percent yearly rate. At that rate, prices were doubling every 24.7 hours. Note that many of these figures should be considered mostly theoretical since hyperinflation did not proceed at this rate over a whole year.&lt;ref name="catohanke"&gt;Steve H. Hanke and Alex K. F.

==Examples of high inflation==
Some countries experienced very high inflation, but did not reach hyperinflation, as defined as a ''monthly'' inflation rate of 50%.

===Holy Roman Empire===
{{main|Kipper und Wipper}}
Between 1620 and 1622 the [[Kreuzer]] fell from 1 [[Reichsthaler]] to 124 Kreuzer in end of 1619 to 1 Reichstaler to over 600 (regionally over 1000) Kreuzer in end of 1622, during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. This is a monthly inflation rate of over 20.6% (regionally over 34.4%).

===Iraq===
Between 1987 and 1995 the Iraqi Dinar went from an official value of 0.306 Dinars/USD (or $3.26 USD per dinar, though the black market rate is thought to have been substantially lower) to 3,000 Dinars/USD due to government printing of 10s of trillions of dinars starting with a base of only 10s of billions. That equates to approximately 315% inflation per year averaged over that eight-year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbi.iq/index.php?pid=History History page at the Central Bank of Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In spite of increased oil prices in the late 1970s (Mexico is a producer and exporter), Mexico defaulted on its external debt in 1982. As a result, the country suffered a severe case of capital flight and several years of acute inflation and [[Mexican peso|peso]] devaluation, leading to an accumulated inflation rate of almost 27,000% between December 1975 and late 1988. On 1 January 1993, Mexico created a new currency, the ''nuevo peso'' ("new peso", or MXN), which chopped three zeros off the old peso (One new peso was equal to 1,000 old MXP pesos).

===Roman Egypt===
In Roman Egypt, where the best documentation on pricing has survived, the price of a measure of wheat was 200 drachmae in 276 AD, and increased to more than 2,000,000 drachmae in 334 AD, roughly 1,000,000% inflation in a span of 58 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Life Contributors |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/7-gasoline-thanks-ben-2012-4 |title=Traveling In Europe Has Become Absurdly Expensive—And You Know The Reason Why |publisher=Business Insider |date=17 April 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the price increased by a factor of 10,000 over 58 years, the annual rate of inflation was only 17.2% (1.4% monthly) compounded.

===Romania===
Romania experienced high inflation in the 1990s. The highest denomination in 1990 was 100 [[Romanian leu|lei]] and in 1998 was 100,000 lei. By 2000 it was 500,000 lei. In early 2005 it was 1,000,000 lei. In July 2005 the lei was replaced by the new leu at 10,000 old lei = 1 new leu. Inflation in 2005 was 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=2003&amp;ED=2007&amp;R1=1&amp;R2=1&amp;CS=3&amp;SS=2&amp;OS=C&amp;DD=0&amp;OUT=1&amp;C=968&amp;S=PCPIPCH&amp;RequestTimeout=120&amp;CMP=0&amp;x=57&amp;y=10 |title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects |publisher=Imf.org |date=29 April 2003 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005 the highest denomination became 500 lei (= 5,000,000 old lei).

===Transnistria===
The Second [[Transnistrian ruble]] consisted solely of banknotes and suffered from high inflation, necessitating the issue of notes overstamped with higher denominations. 1 and sometimes 10 ruble become 10,000 ruble, 5 ruble become 50,000 and 10 ruble become 100,000 ruble. In 2000, a new ruble was introduced at a rate of 1 new ruble = 1,000,000 old rubles.

===Turkey===
{{main|Turkish currency and debt crisis, 2018}}
Since the end of 2017 Turkey has high inflation rates. It is speculated that the [[Turkish general election, 2018|new elections]] took place frustrated because of the impending crisis to forestall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.de/der-wahre-grund-warum-erdoan-die-wahlen-in-der-tuerkei-vorzieht-2018-4|title=Der wahre Grund, warum Erdoğan die Wahlen vorzieht|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wiwo.de/politik/ausland/vorgezogene-neuwahlen-in-der-tuerkei-warum-erdogan-es-so-eilig-hat/21190970.html|title=Warum Erdogan es so eilig hat|publisher=[[Wirtschaftswoche]]|date=19 April 2018|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Politik/Deutschland-Welt/Erdogan-kuendigt-vorgezogene-Neuwahlen-an|title=Erdogan kündigt Neuwahlen im Juni an |publisher=[[Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, inflation was at 11.9%, the highest rate since July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/maerkte/devisen-rohstoffe/tuerkische-lira-lira-faellt-richtung-rekordtief/20538184.html?ticket=ST-7210-45hD6rWiFYdVLkBpNMdq-ap1|title=Lira fällt Richtung Rekordtief|publisher=[[Handelsblatt]]|date=3 November 2017|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish Lira fall from 1.503 TRY = 1 US-Dollar in 2010 to 5.5695 TRY = 1 US-Dollar in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finanzen.net/devisen/us_dollar-tuerkische_lira-kurs|title=Dollar - Türkische Lira|publisher=Finanzen.net GmbH|date=3 August 2018|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], when the [[Continental Congress]] authorized the printing of paper  called [[continental (currency)|continental currency]], the monthly inflation rate reached a peak of 47 percent in November 1779 (Bernholz 2003: 48). These notes depreciated rapidly, giving rise to the expression "not worth a continental."
One cause of the inflation was counterfeiting by the British, who ran a press on [[HMS Phoenix (1759)|HMS ''Phoenix'']], moored in New York Harbour. The counterfeits were advertised and sold almost for the price of the paper they were printed on.&lt;ref&gt;Stealing Lincoln’s Body (Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2007: pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

A second close encounter occurred during the [[U.S. Civil War]], between January 1861 and April 1865, the [[Lerner Commodity Price Index]] of leading cities in the eastern Confederacy states increased from 100 to over 9,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/weidenmier.finance.confederacy.us|title=Money and Finance in the Confederate States of America, Marc Weidenmier, Claremont McKenna College|archive-date=28 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928064455/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/weidenmier.finance.confederacy.us |access-date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Civil War dragged on, the [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate dollar]] had less and less value, until it was almost worthless by the last few months of the war. Similarly, the Union government inflated its [[greenback (money)|greenbacks]], with the monthly rate peaking at 40 percent in March 1864 (Bernholz 2003: 107).&lt;ref name="cato.org"&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj29n2/cj29n2-8.pdf Steve H.

===Vietnam===
Vietnam went through a period of chaos and hyperinflation in the late 1980s, with inflation peaking at 774% in 1988, after the country's "price-wage-currency" reform package, led by then-Deputy Prime Minister Trần Phương, had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Napier |first1=Nancy K. |last2=Vuong |first2=Quan Hoang |title=What we see, why we worry, why we hope: Vietnam going forward |publisher=Boise State University CCI Press |year=2013 |location=Boise, ID, USA |page=140 |isbn=978-0985530587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperinflation also occurred in the early stages of the socialist-oriented market economic reforms commonly referred to as the [[Đổi Mới]].

==Units of inflation==
[[Inflation rate]] is usually measured in percent per year. It can also be measured in percent per month or in price doubling time.

&lt;!-- TABLES NOTE: "Unfortunately, the only way to align columns of numbers at the decimal point is to use two columns, with the first right-justified and the second left-justified." This can be confusing. For example, ... | 1 || ...| .001 below is correct because it displays together as 1.001. See [[Help:Table#Decimal point alignment]] --&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hbox{New price } y \hbox{ years later} = \hbox{old price} \times \left(1+\frac{\hbox{inflation}}{100}\right)^{y}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Monthly inflation} = 100 \times \left(\left(1+\frac{\hbox{inflation}}{100}\right)^{\frac{1}{12}} -1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Price doubling time} = \frac{\log_{e} 2}{\log_{e} \left(1+ \frac{\hbox{inflation}}{100}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Years per added zero of the price} = \frac{1}{\log_{10} \left(1+ \frac{\hbox{inflation}}{100}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Often, at [[redenomination]]s, three zeroes are cut from the bills. It can be read from the table that if the (annual) inflation is for example 100%, it takes 3.32 years to produce one more zero on the price tags, or 3 × 3.32 = 9.96 years to produce three zeroes. Thus can one expect a redenomination to take place about 9.96 years after the currency was introduced.

'''International Action''' is a small, non-violent, political group in [[Hong Kong]] campaigning for a range of issues such as non-violence, [[social justice]], [[human rights]] and [[democracy]]. The group was founded in 2004 and is made up of expatriate permanent residents and locals. Their website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebiggerpicture.hk]&lt;/ref&gt; claims that they represent the new breed of foreigners who reside in Hong Kong without the expatriate perks. International Action is not a closed group and welcomes anyone who may want to join. The group uses mixed campaign strategies of forging support and attention both in public and private spaces.

==Beliefs and approach==
The group's website states that it believes the democratic movement in Hong Kong needs to change its strategy to be more effective in the fight for real power for the people. It says the democratic camp should consider using tactics that are right for the cultural, social and political situation of Hong Kong in 2008.

==Past action==
*On April 30, 2006, the group deflated a large [[McDonald's]] advertisement located on top of [[North Point]] Ferry Pier. The group was calling for better worker's rights and a minimum wage for [[Labour Day]], the following day. A member also described the inflatable bill-board as an "eyesore" on the harbour.
*On January 23, 2006, the group supported teachers' unions demanding less pressure in Hong Kong schools. The group wore nooses around their necks to symbolise the increasing number of teacher stress-related suicides in the territory.
*On December 21, 2005, Matt Pearce, dressed as [[Santa Claus]], climbed onto a structure across Connaught Road, Central, while the [[Legislative Council]] voted on constitutional development. He was subsequently charged with causing a public nuisance and given 100 hours of community service.
*On December 4, 2005, group members, in costume, joined the democracy march to oppose the government's 5th report on Constitutional Development.

[[Image:Santaprotest1.jpg|frame|right|A democracy protest outside the Legislative Council]]
*On July 6, 2005, members dressed in tribal African clothing and unfurled a banner demanding more to be done at the [[G8]] meeting to tackle poverty in Africa.
*On July 1, 2005, the group dressed as cartoon characters '[[The Incredibles]]' and joined the territory-wide pro-democracy demonstration.
*On June 3, 2005, Matt Pearce climbed to the top of large outdoor TV screen in Central and unfurled a banner that said "Tiananmen Square 4.6.1989 : Justice Must Prevail". For this protest, he was convicted of causing a [[public nuisance]] and given a 21-day prison sentence.
*On May 17, 2005, on the first [[International Day Against Homophobia]], the group dressed up to support the gay and lesbian community and demand that gay marriage is made legal.
*On May 1, 2005, [[Labour Day]] in Hong Kong, the group staged a protest dressed as Supermen in a branch of local supermarket '[[Park n Shop]]'. The group handed out $50 notes to staff, suggesting that the amount would be an appropriate [[minimum wage]] for Hong Kong workers.
*On April 1, 2005, [[April Fool's Day]], the group dressed as [[clowns]], suggesting that the upcoming election for [[Chief Executive]] was a joke and Hong Kong people wanted full [[democracy]].
*On March 14, 2005 on the eve of the 2005 Budget, a member dressed as [[Robin Hood]] and handcuffed himself to the front door of the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]. The group wanted more to be done to help the poor in Hong Kong.

'''Iron Eyes Cody''' (born '''Espera Oscar de Corti''', April 3, 1904 – January 4, 1999) was an Italian-American [[actor]]. He portrayed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in [[Hollywood]] films,&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/ironeyes.htm |title=Was Iron Eyes Cody an American Indian? |publisher=Snopes.com |date=August 9, 2007 |first=Barbara |last=Mikkelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; famously as ''Chief Iron Eyes'' in [[Bob Hope]]'s [[The Paleface (1948 film)|The Paleface]] (1948). He also played a Native American shedding a tear about litter in one of the country's most well-known television [[public service announcement]]s, "[[Keep America Beautiful]]".&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/05/arts/iron-eyes-cody-94-an-actor-and-tearful-anti-littering-icon.html |title=Iron Eyes Cody, 94, an Actor And Tearful Anti-Littering Icon |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Amy |last=Waldman |date=January 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in Hollywood, he began to insist, even in his private life, that he was [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], over time claiming membership in several different tribes. In 1996, Cody's half-sister said that he was of [[Italian American|Italian]] ancestry, but he denied it.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Picayune&gt;[https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/cba/intranet/vita/public/resume.php?username=aaleiss Aleiss, Angela], {{cite news &lt;!-- |last=Aleiss |first=Angela --&gt; |title=Native Son: After a Career as Hollywood's Noble Indian Hero, Iron Eyes Cody is Found to Have an Unexpected Heritage |newspaper=[[The New Orleans Times-Picayune]]|url=https://www.academia.edu/11282618/Native_Son_Italian-American_Identity_of_Iron_Eyes_Cody_ |date=May 26, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, it was revealed that he was of Sicilian parentage, and not Native American at all.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Picayune/&gt;&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;

==Early life==
Cody was born Espera Oscar de Corti on April 3, 1904, in [[Kaplan, Louisiana|Kaplan]] in [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana|Vermilion Parish]], in southwestern [[Louisiana]], a second son of Francesca Salpietra from [[Sicily]] and her husband, Antonio de Corti from southern Italy.&lt;ref name=Picayune/&gt; He had two brothers, Joseph and Frank, and a sister, Victoria.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; His parents had a local grocery store in [[Gueydan, Louisiana|Gueydan]], Louisiana, where he grew up.&lt;ref name="walkoffame.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/iron-eyes-cody|title=Iron Eyes Cody - Hollywood Walk of Fame|author=|date=|website=www.walkoffame.com|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father left the family and moved to [[Texas]], where he took the name Tony Corti. His mother married Alton Abshire and had five more children with him.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;

When the three de Corti brothers were teenagers, they joined their father in Texas and shortened their last name to Corti. Cody's father, Tony Corti, died in Texas in 1924.&lt;ref name=Picayune/&gt; The brothers moved on to [[California]], where they were acting in movies, and changed their surname to Cody.&lt;ref name="Stefano2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=George De Stefano|title=An Offer We Can't Refuse: The Mafia in the Mind of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2482tWkpfpQC&amp;pg=PA279|date=23 January 2007|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber/Farrar, Straus, Giroux|isbn=978-0-86547-962-3|pages=279–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph William and Frank Henry Cody worked as extras, then moved on to other work.  Frank was killed by a hit-and-run driver in 1948.

==Career==
Cody began acting in the early 1930s. He worked in film and television until his death. Cody claimed his father was [[Cherokee]] (and his mother [[Cree]]),&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; also naming several different tribes, and frequently changing his claimed place of birth. To those unfamiliar with [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Indigenous American]] or [[First Nations]] cultures and people, he apparently gave the appearance of living "as if" he were Native American, fulfilling the stereotypical expectations by wearing his film wardrobe as daily clothing&amp;mdash;including braided wig, fringed leathers and beaded moccasins&amp;mdash; at least when photographers were visiting, and in other ways continuing to play the same Hollywood-scripted roles off-screen as well as on.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Picayune/&gt;

He appeared in more than 200 films, including ''[[The Big Trail]]'' (1930), with [[John Wayne]]; ''[[The Scarlet Letter (1934 film)|The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1934), with [[Colleen Moore]]; ''[[Sitting Bull]]'' (1954), as [[Crazy Horse]]; ''[[The Light in the Forest (film)|The Light in the Forest]]'' (1958) as Cuyloga; ''[[The Great Sioux Massacre]]'' (1965), with Joseph Cotten; ''[[Nevada Smith]]'' (1966), with [[Steve McQueen]]; ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), with [[Richard Harris]]; and ''[[Ernest Goes to Camp]]'' (1987) as Chief St. Cloud, with [[Jim Varney]].

In 1953, he appeared twice in [[Duncan Renaldo]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]], ''[[The Cisco Kid (TV series)|The Cisco Kid]]'' as Chief Sky Eagle. He guest starred on the [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', starring [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]], and ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]'', with [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] and [[Clu Gulager]]. In 1961, he played the title role in "The Burying of Sammy Hart" on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] western series, ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'', starring [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]]. A close friend of [[Walt Disney]], Cody appeared in a [[Disney]] studio serial titled ''The First Americans'', and in episodes of ''The Mountain Man'', ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'' and ''[[Daniel Boone (1960 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]''.  He also appeared in a 1968 episode of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' featuring Native American dancers.

Cody was widely seen as the "Crying Indian" in the "[[Keep America Beautiful]]" [[public service announcement]]s (PSA) in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/Our-Campaigns/The-Classics/Pollution-Keep-America-Beautiful-Iron-Eyes-Cody |title=Pollution: Keep America Beautiful - Iron Eyes Cody |publisher=Ad Council |accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental commercial showed Cody in costume, shedding a tear after trash is thrown from the window of a car and it lands at his feet. The announcer, [[William Conrad]], says: "People start pollution; people can stop it."

The [[Joni Mitchell]] song "Lakota," from the 1988 album, ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm]]'', features Cody's chanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris J. |last=Walker |url=http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_larry_klein_doing/ |title=Larry Klein Is Doing It All |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=June 1, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308220022/http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_larry_klein_doing/ |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1990 film ''[[Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|Spirit of '76]]''.

==Marriage and family==
In 1936, Cody married [[Bertha Parker Pallan|Bertha Parker]]. She was active in excavations during the late 1920s and early 1930s before becoming an assistant in archaeology at the [[Southwest Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/tn-gnp-verdugo-views-the-true-story-of-iron-eyes-cody-20140828-story.html|title=Verdugo Views: The true story of Iron Eyes Cody|date=28 August 2014|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; They adopted two children said to be of [[Dakota people|Dakota]]-[[Maricopa people|Maricopa]] origin, [[Robert Tree Cody]] and Arthur. The couple remained married until Bertha's death in 1978. 

Although the non-Native public who knew him from the movies and television thought of Cody as an American Indian, a 1996 story by ''The Times-Picayune'' in [[New Orleans]] questioned his heritage, reporting that he was a second-generation Italian-American. This was based on an interview with his half-sister, and documents including a baptismal record. Cody, who now wore his Hollywood costumes in daily life, denied the claim.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Picayune/&gt;

Cody died of [[mesothelioma]] on January 4, 1999, at age 94.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

==Honors==
On 20 April 1983, he was inducted to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6601 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].&lt;ref name="walkoffame.com"/&gt;

In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-13 |title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars – Listed by date dedicated }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Islamist insurgency in Mozambique''' is an ongoing conflict in [[Cabo Delgado Province]], [[Mozambique]], between [[Ansar al-Sunna (Mozambique)|Ansar al-Sunna]], an [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant group attempting to establish an [[Islamic state]] in Mozambique, and Mozambican security forces. Civilians have also been targets of attacks by Islamist militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201712050740.html|title=Mozambique: Islamist Raids Continuing in Mocimboa Da Praia|date=5 December 2017|website=AllAfrica.com|accessdate=27 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226234748/http://allafrica.com/stories/201712050740.html|archivedate=26 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ansar al-Sunna (English: Supporters of the [[Sunnah|tradition]]) is similar to the name of an [[Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna|Iraqi Sunni insurgent group]] that fought against US troops between 2003 and 2007. Locals call them "Al-Shabaab" but they are a separate organization from Somali Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clubofmozambique.com/news/alleged-islamist-base-shelled-near-mocimboa-da-praia-by-joseph-hanlon/?platform=hootsuite|title=Alleged Islamist base shelled near Mocimboa da Praia - By Joseph Hanlon|website=clubofmozambique.com|accessdate=2 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111165116/http://clubofmozambique.com/news/alleged-islamist-base-shelled-near-mocimboa-da-praia-by-joseph-hanlon/?platform=hootsuite|archivedate=11 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militants are known to speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the official language of Mozambique, [[Kimwani language|Kimwane]], the local language, and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the language spoken in the [[Great Lakes region (Africa)|Great Lakes region]]. Reports also state that members are mostly Mozambicans from [[Mocímboa da Praia|Mocimboa da Praia]], [[Palma, Mozambique|Palma]] and [[Macomia District|Macomia]] districts, but also include foreign nationals from [[Tanzania]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verdade.co.mz/newsflash/63770-populacao-captura-supostos-membros-do-grupo-armado-que-atacou-mocimboa-da-praia-|title=População captura supostos membros do grupo armado que atacou Mocímboa da Praia|website=Verdade.co.mz|accessdate=27 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226234801/http://www.verdade.co.mz/newsflash/63770-populacao-captura-supostos-membros-do-grupo-armado-que-atacou-mocimboa-da-praia-|archivedate=26 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's state-owned broadcaster, [[TASS]], reported that the [[Russia]]n and Mozambican governments signed an agreement on military and technical cooperation in late January, 2017. The document stipulates deliveries of arms and military equipment, as well as other military-oriented products, spare parts and components as part of the [[war on terror]]ism.&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/defense/993217 |title=Military &amp; Defense - Russia, Mozambique to step up military-technical cooperation |publisher=TASS |date= |accessdate=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ansar al-Sunna, also known by its original name "Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jamo" (translated "adepts of the prophetic tradition"), was initially a religious movement in northern districts of Cabo Delgado&lt;ref name="Former Policemen"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201805010190.html|title=Mozambique: Former Policemen Train Islamist Group |date=2018-05-01|work=Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (Maputo)|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which first appeared around 2015. It was formed by followers of the radical [[Kenya]]n cleric [[Aboud Rogo]], who was killed in 2012. Thereafter, some of members of his movement settled down in Kibiti, [[Tanzania]], before moving into Mozambique.{{sfnp|West|2018|p=5}}

There, Ansar al-Sunna militants were trained by ex-policemen, and ex-frontier guards who had been fired and held grudges against the government. The movement also contacted other Islamist militants in East Africa, and reportedly hired [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] trainers from [[Somalia]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Kenya]]. These al-Shabaab trainers acted as mercenaries, however, and aided Ansar al-Sunna not out of actual connections between al-Shabaab and Ansar al-Sunna, but due to the pay they received from the latter.&lt;ref name="Former Policemen"/&gt; Some of the Ansar al-Sunna militants have also journeyed abroad to receive direct training by other militant groups.&lt;ref name="extremist threat"/&gt;

The militants are not unified, but split into different cells which do not appear to much coordinate their actions.&lt;ref name="extremist threat"/&gt; By August 2018, the Mozambiquan police had identified six men as leaders of the militants in Cabo Delgado: Abdul Faizal, Abdul Raim, Abdul Remane, Ibn Omar, "Salimo", and Nuno Remane.&lt;ref name="ringleaders"/&gt; Ansar al-Sunna funds itself through [[heroin]], [[contraband]] and [[ivory trade]].{{sfnp|West|2018|p=6}}

While religion does play a fundamental role in the conflict, analysts believe the most important factors in the insurgency are widespread social, economic and political problems in Mozambique. Unemployment and especially youth unemployment are considered the main causes for locals to join the Islamist rebels. Increasing inequalities have led many young people to be easily attracted by such a radical movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/pt-002/mocímboa-da-praia-problema-com-ataques-controlado/a-43724524 Mocímboa da Praia: problema com ataques controlado?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Former Policemen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extremist threat"/&gt;{{sfnp|West|2018|p=5}} as Ansar al-Sunna promises that its form of Islam will act as "antidote" to the existing "corrupt, elitist rule".&lt;ref name="ringleaders"/&gt;

As a result, more than {{convert|323000|impgal|L}} of beer burst out and gushed into the streets. The wave of beer destroyed two homes and crumbled the wall of the Tavistock Arms pub, killing teenage employee Eleanor Cooper under the rubble.&lt;ref name="expages"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117063012/http://www.expage.com/page/beerflood London Beer Flood] at Expages.com (archived version)&lt;/ref&gt; Within minutes neighbouring George Street and New Street were swamped, seriously injuring a mother, and killing a daughter and young neighbour who were taking tea. The beer also surged through a room of people gathered for a wake, killing five of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funlondontours.com/news/london-beer-flood-1814 The London Beer Flood of 1814]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The brewery was among the poor houses and tenements of the St Giles [[rookery (slum)|Rookery]], where whole families lived in basement rooms that quickly filled with beer. At least eight people were known to have [[Drowning|drowned]] in the flood or died from injuries.

The brewery was eventually taken to court over the accident, but the disaster was ruled to be an [[Act of God]] by the judge and jury, leaving no one responsible.&lt;ref name="Rennison2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rennison|first=Nick|title=Book of Lists London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWBquVNVZMUC&amp;pg=PA149|accessdate=13 December 2013|year=2010|publisher=Canongate Books|isbn=978-1-84767-666-5|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There were speculations of corruption regarding the court ruling but no official statement was made. The company found it difficult to cope with the financial implications of the disaster, with a significant loss of sales made worse because they had already paid duty on the beer. They made a successful application to Parliament reclaiming the duty which allowed them to continue trading.&lt;ref name="BHO"&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22171 ''Industries: Brewing'']  (British History Online) accessed 10 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The brewery was demolished in 1922, and the [[Dominion Theatre]] later occupied part of the site. In 2012, a local pub, the Holborn Whippet, started to mark this event with a vat of [[porter (beer)|porter]] brewed especially for the day.{{citationneeded|date=August 2017}}

The '''Marrakesh Agreement''', manifested by the '''Marrakesh Declaration''', was an agreement signed in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], by 124 nations on 15 April 1994, marking the culmination of the 8-year-long [[Uruguay Round]] and establishing the [[World Trade Organization]], which officially came into being on 1 January 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/marrakesh_decl_e.htm Marrakesh Declaration of 15 April 1994] at World Trade Organization&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement developed out of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), supplemented by a number of other agreements on issues including [[General Agreement on Trade in Services|trade in services]], [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures|sanitary and phytosanitary measures]], [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|trade-related aspects of intellectual property]] and [[Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade|technical barriers]] to trade. It also established a new, more efficient and legally binding means of [[Dispute Settlement Body|dispute resolution]]. The various agreements which make up the Marrakesh Agreement combine as an indivisible whole; no entity can be party to any one agreement without being party to them all.

'''[[Melodifestivalen]] 1963''' (known as '''Eurovisionsschlagern, svensk final''') was the selection for the sixth song to represent [[Sweden]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was the fifth time that this system of picking a song had been used. One singer performed the song with a large [[orchestra]] and one with a smaller orchestra. 816 songs were submitted to [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] for the competition. The final was broadcast on [[SVT1|Sveriges Radio TV]] but was not broadcast on radio. Monica Zetterlund performed "[[En gång i Stockholm]]" at Eurovision, and became the first and only artist to score "nul points" for Sweden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">'''Military terminology''' refers to the [[terminology|terms]] and language of [[military]] organizations and [[personnel]] as belonging to a discrete category, as distinguishable by their usage in [[military doctrine]], as they serve to depoliticise, dehumanise, or otherwise abstract discussion about its operations from an actual description thereof.

==Common understanding==
The operational pressure for uniform understanding has developed since the early 20th century with the importance of [[joint operations]] between different services (army, navy, air force) of the same country. International alliances and operations, including [[peacekeeping]],&lt;ref&gt;Colonel Andrei Demurenko and Professor Alexander Nikitin, ''Basic Terminology and Concepts in International Peacekeeping Operations: An Analytical Review'' (translated Robert R. Love) in Low Intensity Conflict &amp; Law Enforcement, 
Volume 6, Summer 1997, Frank Cass, London accessed at Foreign Military Studies Office, Fort Leavenworth, US [http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/pkterms.htm] July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; have added additional complexity. For example, the [[NATO]] alliance now maintains a large [[dictionary]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/natoterm_index.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms] accessed on Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), US  website, July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of common terms for use by member countries. Development work is also taking place&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bell, ''Ballistic Missile Threats:A NATO-Russia Strategic Challenge'' in Krasnaya Zvezda, Feb 23, 2003 accessed at NATO on-line Library [http://www.nato.int/docu/articles/2003/a030227a.htm] July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; between NATO and Russia on common terminology for extended air defence, in English, French and Russian.
'''

==Criticism==
Some claim military terms serve to depoliticise, dehumanize, or otherwise abstract discussion about operations from an actual description thereof. 
Similar to "[[legalese|legal terminology]]" and related to "political terminology", military terms are known for an oblique tendency to incorporate [[technical language]]. In many cases, it reflects a need to be precise. It can also reflect a perceived need for [[operational security]], giving away no more information than needed. It can also serve to disguise or distort meaning as with [[doublespeak]]. "Kinetic activity" as a [[buzzword]] for [[combat]], in use since the inception of the [[War on Terror]], has been criticized as a [[Don't ask, don't tell|don’t-ask-don’t-tell]] policy for murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The pop crowd, estimated at 8,000, started arriving at the 62-acre farm at Myponga early on Saturday morning.

'''New Year's Day''', also called simply '''New Year's''' or '''New Year''', is observed on [[January 1]], the first day of the year on the modern [[Gregorian calendar]] as well as the [[Julian calendar]].

In pre-Christian Rome under the [[Julian calendar]], the day was dedicated to [[Janus]], god of gateways and beginnings, for whom [[January]] is also named. As a date in the Gregorian calendar of [[Christendom]], New Year's Day liturgically marked the [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ|Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus]], which is still observed as such in the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] and [[Lutheran Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=Dictionary of Theological Terms|year=1996|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=0664255116|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobart|first=John Henry|title=A Companion for the festivals and fasts of the Protestant Episcopal Church|year=1840|publisher=Stanford &amp; Co.|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In present day, with most countries now using the Gregorian calendar as their [[de facto]] calendar, New Year's Day is probably the most celebrated public [[holiday]], often observed with [[fireworks]] at the stroke of [[midnight]] as the [[new year]] starts in each time zone. Other global New Year's Day traditions include making [[New Year's resolution]]s and calling one's friends and family.&lt;ref name="Mehra2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehra|first=Komal|title=Festivals Of The World|date=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishers |isbn=9781845575748|page=69|quote=In many European countries like Italy, Portugal and Netherlands, families start the new year by attending church services and then calling on friends and relatives. Italian children receive gifts or money on New Year's Day. People in the United States go to church, give parties and enjoy other forms of entertainment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:New Years 2014 Fireworks - London Eye.jpg|thumb|Fireworks in [[London]] on New Year's Day at the stroke of midnight.]]

==History==
[[File:Menologion of Basil 047.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|In Christendom, under which the Gregorian Calendar developed, New Year's Day traditionally marks the [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ]], which is still observed as such by the [[Anglican Church]] and the [[Lutheran Church]].]]
Mesopotamia (Iraq) instituted the concept of celebrating the new year in 2000 BC and celebrated new year around the time of the [[vernal equinox]], in mid-March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/newyearhistory.html |title=A History of the New Year |first=Borgna |last=Brunner |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/5-ancient-new-years-celebrations |title=5 Ancient New Year’s Celebrations |first=Evan |last=Andrews |newspaper=History News |date=31 December 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Roman calendar designated [[March 1]] as the new year. The calendar had just ten months, beginning with March. That the new year once began with the month of March is still reflected in some of the names of the months. [[September]] through [[December]], our ninth through twelfth months, were originally positioned as the seventh through tenth months. (''Septem'' is [[Latin]] for "seven"; ''octo'', "eight"; ''novem'', "nine"; and ''decem'', "ten".) [[Roman legend]] usually credited their second [[Kingdom of Rome|king]] [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] with the establishment of the months of [[Ianuarius|January]] and [[Februarius|February]]. These were first placed at the end of the year, but at some point came to be considered the first two months instead.

The '''January [[Kalends]]''' ({{lang-la|[[wikt:kalendae#Latin|Kalendae]] [[wikt:Ianuarius#Latin|Ianuariae]]}}) came to be celebrated as the new year at some point after it became the day for the inaugurating new [[Roman consul|consuls]] in 153{{nbsp}}BC. Romans had long dated their years by [[list of Roman consuls|these consulships]], rather than sequentially, and making the [[kalends]] of January start the new year aligned this dating. Still, private and religious celebrations around the March new year continued for some time and there is no consensus on the question of the timing for January 1's new status.&lt;ref&gt;Michels, A.K. ''The Calendar of the Roman Republic'' (Princeton, 1967), p. 97-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Once it became the new year, however, it became a time for family gatherings and celebrations. A series of disasters, notably including the [[Revolt of Lepidus|failed rebellion]] of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 78 BC)|M. Aemilius Lepidus]] in 78{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, established a superstition against allowing Rome's [[nundinae|market days]] to fall on the [[kalends]] of January and the [[pontifex maximus|pontiffs]] employed [[intercalation (calendar)|intercalation]] to avoid its occurrence.{{sfn|Macrobius|loc=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#13 Book I, Ch. xiii, §17]}}{{sfnp|Kaster|2011|p=163}}

In AD 567, the [[Council of Tours]] formally abolished January 1 as the beginning of the year. At various times and in various places throughout medieval [[Christian Europe]], the new year was celebrated on [[December 25]] in honor of [[Christmas|the birth of Jesus]]; [[March 1]] in the old Roman style; [[March 25]] in honor of [[Lady Day]] and the [[Feast of the Annunciation]]; and on the [[computus|movable feast]] of [[Easter]]. These days were also [[astronomy|astronomically]] and [[astrology|astrologically]] significant since, at the time of the [[Julian reform]], March 25 had been understood as the [[spring equinox]] and December 25 as the [[winter solstice]]. (The Julian calendar's small disagreement with the [[solar year]], however, shifted these days earlier before the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] which formed the basis of the calculations used during the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] of the calendar.) Medieval calendars nonetheless often continued to display the months running from January to December, despite their readers reckoning the transition from one year to the next on a different day.

Among the 7th century [[pagan]]s of [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]], it was the custom to exchange gifts on the first day of the new year. This custom was deplored by [[Saint Eligius]] (died 659 or 660), who warned the Flemish and Dutch: "(Do not) make vetulas, [little figures of the Old Woman], little deer or iotticos or set tables [for the house-elf, compare [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]] at night or exchange New Year gifts or supply superfluous drinks [another [[Yule]] custom]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoting the ''Vita'' of St. Eligius written by [[Audoin (bishop)|Ouen]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the date that European Christians celebrated the New Year, they exchanged Christmas presents because New Year's Day fell within the twelve days of the [[Christmastide|Christmas season]] in the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] liturgical [[calendar]];&lt;ref name="Forbes2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Bruce David|title=Christmas: A Candid History|date=1 October 2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520258020|page=114|quote=Some people referred to New Year's gifts as "Christmas presents" because New Year's Day fell within the twelve days of Christmas, but in spite of the name they still were gifts given on January 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the custom of exchanging Christmas gifts in a Christian context is traced back to the [[Biblical Magi]] who gave gifts to the [[Child Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Collins2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Ace|title=Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas|date=4 May 2010|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=9780310873884|page=88|quote=Most people today trace the practice of giving gifts on Christmas Day to the three gifts that the Magi gave to Jesus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berking1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berking|first=Helmuth|title=Sociology of Giving|date=30 March 1999|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780857026132|page=14|quote=The winter solstice was a time of festivity in every traditional culture, and the Christian Christmas probably took its place within this mythical context of the solar cult. Its core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event. 'Children were given presents as the Jesus child received gifts from the magi or kings who came from afar to adore him. But in reality it was they, together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life' (ibid.: 61).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the leap year error in the Julian calendar, the date of [[Easter]] had drifted backward since the [[First Council of Nicaea]] decided [[Computus|the computation of the date of Easter]] in 325. By the sixteenth century, the drift from the observed [[equinox]] had become unacceptable. In 1582, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] declared the [[Gregorian calendar]] widely used today, correcting the error by a deletion of 10 days. The Gregorian calendar reform also (in effect) restored January 1 as New Year's Day. Although most Catholic countries adopted the Gregorian calendar almost immediately, it was only gradually adopted among Protestant countries. The British, for example, did not adopt the reformed calendar [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|until 1752]]. Until then, the [[British Empire]] {{snd}} and its American colonies {{snd}} still celebrated the new year on 25 March.

Most nations of [[Western Europe]] officially adopted 1 January as New Year's Day somewhat before they adopted the Gregorian Calendar. In [[Tudor England]], New Year's Day, along with [[Christmas Day]] and [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], was celebrated as one of three main festivities among the [[Twelve Days of Christmas|twelve days]] of [[Christmastide]].&lt;ref name="Sim2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sim|first=Alison|title=Pleasures and Pastimes in Tudor England|date=8 November 2011|publisher=[[The History Press]]|isbn=9780752475783|page=85|quote=Most of the twelve days of Christmas were saint's days, but the main three days for celebration were Christmas Day, New Year's Day and Epiphany, or Twelfth Night.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, until the adoption of the Gregorian Calendar in 1752, the first day of the new year was the Western Christian [[Feast of the Annunciation]], on 25 March, also called "[[Lady Day]]". Dates predicated on the year beginning on 25 March became known as ''Annunciation Style'' dates, while dates of the Gregorian Calendar commencing on 1 January were distinguished as ''Circumcision Style'' dates,&lt;ref name="Harris2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Max|title=Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOMAn_rIUIAC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=31 December 2012|date=2011-03-17|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801449567|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; because this was the date of the [[Feast of the Circumcision]], the observed memorial of the eighth day of [[Jesus Christ]]'s life after his birth, counted from the latter's observation on [[Christmas]], 25 December. [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregory]] acknowledged 1 January as the beginning of the new year according to his reform of the Catholic [[Liturgical Calendar]].&lt;ref name="Trawicky2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trawicky|first=Bernard|title=Anniversaries and Holidays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDbKexa1jfcC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=31 December 2012|edition=5th|date=2000-07-01|publisher=American Library Association|isbn=9780838906958|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Year's Days in other calendars==
In cultures which traditionally or currently use calendars other than the Gregorian, New Year's Day is often also an important celebration.

===New Year's Eve===
{{Main|New Year's Eve}}
[[File:OperaSydney-Fuegos2006-342289398.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Sydney]] contributes to some of the major New Year celebrations each year.]]
January 1 represents the fresh start of a new year after a period of remembrance of the passing year, including on radio, television, and in newspapers, which starts in early December in countries around the world. Publications have year-end articles that review the changes during the previous year. In some cases publications may set their entire year work alight in hope that the smoke emitted from the flame brings new life to the company.  There are also articles on planned or expected changes in the coming year.

This day is traditionally a [[Religious festival|religious feast]], but since the [[1900–1909|1900s]] has also become an occasion to celebrate the night of December 31, called [[New Year's Eve]]. There are [[fireworks]] at midnight at the moment the new year arrives (a major one is in [[Sydney]], Australia). [[Watchnight service]]s are also still observed by many.&lt;ref name="BOW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&amp;mid=11612|title=Watch Night services provide spiritual way to bring in New Year|publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]]|accessdate=28 December 2011|quote=The service is loosely constructed with singing, spontaneous prayers and testimonials, and readings, including the Covenant Renewal service from The United Methodist Book of Worship (pp. 288–294).|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301064835/http://www.interpretermagazine.org/interior.asp?ptid=43&amp;mid=11612|archivedate=1 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional celebrations===

* On New Year's Day, people in certain countries gather on beaches and run into the water to celebrate the new year. In [[Canada]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], the United States, and the [[Netherlands]] this is very popular. These events are sometimes known as [[polar bear plunge]]s, and are sometimes organized by groups to raise money for [[Charitable organization|charity]]. [[Polar Bear Clubs]] in many [[Northern Hemisphere]] cities near bodies of water, have a tradition of holding organized plunges on New Year's Day.

In the country's most famous New Year celebration in [[New York City]], the 11,875-pound (5,386-kg), 12-foot-diameter (3.7-m) [[Times Square Ball]] located high above [[One Times Square]] is lowered starting at 11:59 pm, with a countdown from sixty seconds until one second, when it reaches the bottom of its tower. The arrival of the new year is announced at the stroke of [[midnight]] with [[fireworks]], music and a [[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest|live celebration]] that is broadcast worldwide. ([[List of objects dropped on New Year's Eve|Hundreds of local imitations of the ball drop]] also occur throughout the United States.)

People would like to toast for the new year.
* In Spain, it is customary to have 12 grapes at hand when the clock strikes 12 at midnight. One grape is eaten on each stroke.

* [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], in the [[Orgelbüchlein]], composed three chorale preludes for the new year: ''Helft mir Gotts Güte preisen'' ["Help me to praise God's goodness"] (BWV 613); ''Das alte Jahr vergangen ist'' ["The old year has passed"] (BWV 614); and ''In dir ist freude'' ["In you is joy"] (BWV 615).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libweb.grinnell.edu/vufind/Record/.b22618132/TOC|title=Table of Contents: Orgelbüchlein :|website=libweb.grinnell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The year is gone, beyond recall'' is a traditional Christian hymn to give thanks for the new year, dating back to 1713.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/y/e/a/yearigbc.htm|title=The Year Is Gone, Beyond Recall|website=www.hymntime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]'' by [[Robert Burns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotland.org/features/in-the-words-of-the-bard|title=Scotland - In the words of the Bard -|website=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual [[Vienna New Year's Concert]], primarily featuring music composed by the [[:Category:Strauss family|Strauss family]], is broadcast around the world.

===New Year's babies===
A common image used, often as an editorial cartoon, is that of an incarnation of [[Father Time]] (or the "Old Year") wearing a sash across his chest with the previous year printed on it passing on his duties to the [[Baby New Year]] (or the "New Year"), an infant wearing a sash with the new year printed on it.&lt;ref name="Birx2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Birx|first=H. James|title=Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, &amp; Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3ddWSxmi9cC&amp;pg=PA510|accessdate=31 December 2012|date=2009-01-13|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=9781412941648|page=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babies born on New Year's Day are commonly called ''New Year babies''. Hospitals, such as the Dyersburg Regional Medical Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Dyersburg State Gazette |url=http://www.stategazette.com/story/1489857.html |title=DRMC rounds up prizes for New Year's baby, Life Choices |publisher=Stategazette.com |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, give out prizes to the first baby born in that hospital in the new year. These prizes are often donated by local businesses.  Prizes may include various baby-related items such as [[Infant formula|baby formula]], [[blanket|baby blankets]], [[diaper]]s, and [[gift certificate]]s to stores which specialize in baby-related merchandise.

==Other celebrations on January 1==
The [[Anglican Church]] and the [[Lutheran Church]] celebrate the [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ]] on January 1, based on the belief that if Jesus was born on December 25, then according to Hebrew tradition, his [[circumcision]] would have taken place on the eighth day of his life (January 1). The Roman Catholic Church celebrates on this day the [[Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God]], which is also a [[Holy Day of Obligation]]. In the United States, New Year's Day is a [[postal holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/news/service-alerts/2011-federal-holidays.htm|title=2011-federal-holidays|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed several [[List of Bach cantatas|church cantatas]] for the double occasion:
* [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 190]], 1 January 1724
* [[Jesu, nun sei gepreiset, BWV 41]], 1 January 1725
* [[Herr Gott, dich loben wir, BWV 16]], 1 January 1726
* [[Gott, wie dein Name, so ist auch dein Ruhm, BWV 171]], 1 January ?1729
* [[Christmas Oratorio#Part IV|Fallt mit Danken, fallt mit Loben]] 1 January 1735 (Christmas Oratorio Part IV)

[[File:Moneypit-1-.jpg|thumb|alt=Apparent excavation, with a standing man for scale||Money pit on Oak Island]]
The '''Oak Island mystery''' refers to stories of buried treasure and unexplained objects on [[Oak Island]] in [[Nova Scotia]]. Since the 19th century, a number of attempts have been made to locate treasure and artifacts. In addition to treasure, theories about artifacts present on the island include [[Marie Antoinette]]'s jewels, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] manuscripts and religious artifacts. To date, no significant treasure has been found.&lt;ref&gt;"to this day, the treasure still remains buried" http://www.oakislandtreasure.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early accounts ===

No direct evidence exists for any treasure-related activity on Oak Island prior to the first published account in 1856, which included stories of treasure hunts going back to the late eighteenth-century.&lt;ref name="Nickell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/secrets_of_oak_island/|title=The Secrets of Oak Island|author=Nickell, Joe|work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|date=March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original lot owners' names were mapped for the Nova Scotia Crown Lands office by William Nelson and David W. Crandall on July 6, 1818.&lt;ref name=mather/&gt; According to the most widely-held story, a man named Daniel McGinnis (the island's first recorded settler) discovered a depression in the ground around 1799 while he was looking for a location for a farm.&lt;ref name="Yar001"&gt;{{cite news |last=Phy |first=Paul |date=February 19, 1863 |title=Oak Island – The Reasons for expecting there is Treasure there. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=TFP_iSt0sucC&amp;dat=18630219&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |magazine=''Yarmouth Herald'' |location= |publisher= |access-date=10 April 2018 |page=1 |series=column 4 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Early settlers told a story of a dying sailor from the crew of [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]] (who had died in 1701). The sailor said that treasure worth [[£]]2 million had been buried on the island.&lt;ref name="Trans001" /&gt; Gordan Chase also attempted to find treasure; he was wounded by another treasure hunter, Micheal J Whynot, in 1801. His attempts ended shortly after the attack.&lt;ref name="beamish"&gt;{{cite book |last=Murdoch |first=Beamish |author-link=Beamish Murdoch |title=A History of Nova-Scotia, Or Acadie |volume=Vol. I |date=1865 |publisher=J. Barnes |location=Halifax |url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorynovasco00murdgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGinnis, who believed that the depression was consistent with the Captain Kidd story, sought help with digging. With the assistance of two men identified only as Smith and Vaughn, he excavated the depression and discovered a layer of [[flagstone]]s two feet below.&lt;ref name="Trans001" /&gt; According to later accounts, oak platforms were discovered every {{convert|10|ft}};&lt;ref name="Crooker"&gt;Crooker, William S. ''Oak Island Gold'' (Nimbus Publishing, 1993) {{ISBN|1-55109-049-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the earliest accounts simply mention "marks" of some type at these intervals.&lt;ref name="Crooker" /&gt; The accounts also mentioned "tool marks" or pick scrapes on the walls of the pit. The dirt was noticeably loose, not as hard-packed as the surrounding soil.&lt;ref name="Crooker" /&gt; The three men reportedly abandoned the excavation at {{convert|30|ft}} due to "superstitious dread".&lt;ref name="Trans002"&gt;McCully, J.B. [http://www.criticalenquiry.org/oakisland/diggings.shtml "The Oak Island Diggings."] ''Liverpool Transcript'', October 1862 - printing letter dated 2 June 1862 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110826080309/http://www.oakislandtreasure.co.uk/content/view/232/176/ another link] - described by the newspaper as "about the best account we have ever seen of the "diggings" - mentions the finding of the inscribed stone, but not what happened to it subsequently&lt;/ref&gt;

The McGinnis excavation first appears in print in the ''[[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]] Transcript'' in October 1856. The first published account, which mentioned a group digging for Captain Kidd's treasure on Oak Island, was published the following year.&lt;ref name="Trans001"&gt;{{cite news |last=Forks |first=''J.P.'' |date=August 20, 1857 |title=Correspondence |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203061940/http://www.novascotia.ca/nsarm/virtual/newspapers/archives.asp?ID=2941&amp;Page=201200742 |newspaper=Liverpool Transcript |location=Liverpool, Nova Scotia |publisher=S.

Investigator [[Joe Nickell]] reviewed the original accounts and interviews with descendants of McGinnis and the original Oak Island landowners.&lt;ref name="Nickell"/&gt; While later sources said that the treasure had been discovered by three young boys, Nickell reported that the story was about three adult lot owners who discovered the depression on the island and began digging.&lt;ref name="Nickell"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Onslow and Truro Companies (Early 1800s – 1849)}}Onslow and Truro Companies (Early 1800s, 1849) ===
About eight years after the McGinnis dig (c. 1807), a group known as the Onslow Company sailed from central Nova Scotia to Oak Island to recover what they believed to be hidden treasure. They continued the excavation down to about {{convert|90|ft|m}}, with layers of logs (or "marks") found about every {{convert|10|ft|m|spell=in}}, and also discovered layers of [[charcoal]], [[putty]] and [[coconut]] [[fibre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oak Island Treasure – the world's greatest treasure hunt |url=http://www.oakislandtreasure.co.uk/content/view/162/2/ |accessdate=May 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220655/http://www.oakislandtreasure.co.uk/content/view/162/2/# |archive-date=May 27, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an 1862 account, at {{convert|80|-|90|ft}} they recovered a large stone inscribed with symbols.&lt;ref name="Trans002"/&gt; The excavation was abandoned when the pit flooded to the {{convert|33|ft|adj=on}} level, and bailing was ineffective.

Several unnamed researchers reportedly attempted to decipher the symbols on the stone, and one claimed that the cipher translated as "Forty feet below, two million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] lie buried." The symbols associated with the "Forty feet below" translation first appeared in 1949's ''True Tales of Buried Treasure'' by explorer and historian [[Edward Rowe Snow]]. In his book, Snow said that he received the set of symbols from Rev. A. T. Kempton of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], but no information was provided as to how or where Kempton obtained them.&lt;ref name="snow001"&gt;Snow, Edward Rowe. ''True Tales of Buried Treasure'', (Dodd and Mead, 1951) {{ASIN|B000OI2EFC}}{{isbn missing|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from Kempton dated April 1949 is printed in [http://www.criticalenquiry.org/oakisland/kempton.shtml History, Hoax, and Hype - The Oak Island Legend], in which he states that he had obtained his information from "a school teacher long since dead". 

The Truro Company was formed in 1849 by investors who re-excavated the shaft back down to the {{convert|86|ft|adj=on}} level; the pit flooded again, and it was decided to drill into the ground beneath the bottom of the shaft. According to a nineteenth-century account, the drill (pod auger) passed through a [[spruce]] platform at {{convert|98|ft}}. After this platform, the drill hit layers of oak, something described as "metal in pieces", another spruce layer, and clay for {{convert|7|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Trans002"/&gt;

=== Oak Island Association (1861–1864) ===

The next excavation attempt was carried out in 1861 by a new company, the Oak Island Association. Instead of digging deeper into the now-flooded, original shaft, they drilled a side shaft to avoid the water. During the excavation of the new shaft, the bottom of the original shaft collapsed. It was later speculated that the treasure had fallen into a deep void and the pit may have been booby-trapped to protect it. The new shaft eventually flooded as well, after workers reportedly hit a booby-trapped flood tunnel. During further excavation, a man was killed when the boiler of a pump engine burst. This was the first of six accidental deaths during excavations.&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Decoding the Past: The Templar Code'', video documentary, November 7, 2005, written by Marcy Marzuni&lt;/ref&gt; The company abandoned their efforts when their money ran out in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McIntee|first1=David|title=Fortune and Glory: A Treasure Hunter's Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jx7DCwAAQBAJ| | date=2016 | page=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Maynard Kaiser search (1896–1898)}}1896–1898 ===

In 1896, an unknown group arrived on the island with steam pumps and boring equipment. Although the pumps were unable to keep water out of the flooded side shaft, boring samples were taken. It was claimed that one of the samples brought a tiny piece of sheepskin parchment to the surface. The parchment had two letters, "vi" or "wi", written in [[India ink]].&lt;ref name="Colliers01"&gt;Bowdoin, H. L. [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?view=image;size=100;id=mdp.39015016754973;q1=oak%20island;page=root;seq=269;num=71 "Solving the Mystery of Oak Island"] ''[[Collier's|Colliers Magazine'']], August 19, 1911 p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The group attempted to block any possible booby traps with large underground dynamite blasts.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

On March 26, 1897, a worker, Maynard Kaiser, fell to his death.&lt;ref name="HC"/&gt; In 1898, excavators poured red paint into the flooded pit, which reportedly revealed three exit holes around the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lamb|first1=L.|title=Oak Island Obsession: The Restall Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQWMw7yQyAMC| | date=2006 | page=207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|The Old Gold Salvage group (1909)}}Old Gold Salvage group (1909)===

Captain Henry L. Bowdoin arrived on Oak Island in August 1909 representing the Old Gold Salvage Group, one of whose members was [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. The "money pit" was cleared out to {{convert|113|ft}}, and divers were sent down to investigate.&lt;ref name="Colliers01" /&gt; Although multiple borings were taken in and around the pit, none of the cores revealed anything of interest.&lt;ref name="Colliers01" /&gt;

Bowdoin also examined Smith's Cove, where drain tunnels and a [[Eye bolt#Ring bolts|ring bolt]] in a rock had reportedly been seen. Although the group found the remains of an 1850 [[cofferdam]], no evidence of anything else was found.&lt;ref name="Colliers01" /&gt; Bowdoin later examined the "stone cipher" in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and found it a [[basalt]] rock with no symbols. He was doubtful that symbols could have worn off the rock, given its hardness. The group left the island in November 1909, but Roosevelt kept up with Oak Island news and developments for most of the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Colliers01"/&gt;

===William Chappell and Gilbert Hedden (1928–1939)===
[[File:Digs and Buildings, photo 2, Oak Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, August 1931.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo|August 1931 aerial photo of digs and buildings]]

In 1928, a New York newspaper published a feature story about Oak Island. William Chappell became interested and excavated the pit in 1931 by sinking a {{convert|12|x|14|ft|adj=on}}
{{convert|163|ft|m|0|sing=on}} shaft southwest of what he believed was the site of the 1897 shaft (which was thought, without evidence, to be near the original pit). At {{convert|127|ft|m|0}}, a number of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], including an axe, a fluke anchor and a pick, were found. The pick was identified as a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] miner's pick, but by this time the area around the pit was littered with debris from previous excavation attempts and finding the owner was impossible.

[[Gilbert Hedden]], an operator of a steel fabricating company, saw the 1928 article and was fascinated by the engineering problems involved in recovering the reported treasure. Hedden made six trips to Oak Island and collected books and articles about the island. He went to England to consult [[Harold T. Wilkins]], author of ''Captain Kidd and His Skeleton Island'', about a link he found between Oak Island and a map in Wilkins' book.&lt;ref name="doyle"&gt;Doyle, Lynn C. "Nova Scotia's Treasure Island." ''MacLean's'' June 1, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; After Chappell's excavations, Hedden began digging in the summer of 1935, after he purchased the southeastern end of the island. In 1939, he informed [[Monarchy of Canada|King]] [[George VI]] about developments on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Khatri, Vikas, ''World Famous Treasures Lost and Found,'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations were made in 1935 and 1936, none of which were successful.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy O'Connor, ''The Big Dig: the $10 Million Search for Oak Island's Legendary Treasure,'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restall family and Robert Dunfield (1959–1966)===  
Robert Restall, his 18-year-old son, and workpartner Karle Graeser, came to Oak Island in 1959 after signing a contract with one of the property owners. In 1965, they tried to seal what was thought to be a [[storm drain]] in Smith's Cove and dug a shaft down to {{convert|27|feet|m}}. On August 17, Restall was overcome by [[hydrogen sulfide]] fumes. His son then went down the shaft, and also lost consciousness. Graeser and two other, Cyril Hiltz and Andy DeMont, then attempted to save the two men. A visitor to the site, Edward White, had himself lowered on a rope into the shaft but was able to bring out only DeMont. Restall, his son, Graeser and Hiltz all died.

That year, Robert Dunfield leased portions of the island. Dunfield dug the pit area to a depth of {{convert|134|ft}} and a width of {{convert|100|ft}} by using a 70-ton digging [[crane (machine)|crane]] with a clam bucket. Transportation of the crane to the island required the construction of a [[causeway]] (which still exists) from the western end of the island to Crandall's Point on the mainland, two hundred metres away.&lt;ref name="HC"/&gt; Dunfield's lease ended in August 1966.

===Triton Alliance (1967–1990s)===

In January 1967, Daniel C. Blankenship, David Tobias, Robert Dunfield, and Fred Nolan formed a [[syndicate]] for exploration on Oak Island. Two years later, Blankenship and Tobias formed Triton Alliance after purchasing most of the island. Several former landowners, including Mel Chappell, became shareholders in Triton. Triton workers excavated a {{convert|235|ft|m}} shaft, known as Borehole 10-X and supported by a steel [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] to [[bedrock]], in 1971.

According to Blankenship and Tobias, cameras lowered down the shaft into a cave recorded possible chests, human remains, wooden cribbing and tools; however, the images were unclear and none of the claims have been independently confirmed. The shaft later collapsed, and the excavation was again abandoned. The shaft was later re-dug to {{convert|181|ft|m|0}}, reaching bedrock, but work was halted due to lack of funds and the collapse of the partnership.&lt;ref name="ellerd"&gt;Ellerd, Kerry. "Finding Buried Treasure: It's an Expensive Business." ''Montreal STAR'' February 6, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Divers sent to the bottom of Borehole 10-X in 2016 found no artifacts.

An account of an excavation of the pit was published in the January 1965 issue of ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oakislandtreasure.co.uk/archive/readersdigest/readersdigest.pdf |title=Scanned copy of the original Reader's Digest article |publisher=Oakislandtreasure.co.uk |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002081600/http://www.oakislandtreasure.co.uk/archive/readersdigest/readersdigest.pdf# |archive-date=October 2, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island was the subject of an episode of ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]'' which was first broadcast on January 18, 1979.

In 1983, Triton Alliance sued Frederick Nolan over the ownership of seven lots on the island and its causeway access. Two years later, Nolan's ownership of the lots was confirmed but he was ordered to pay damages for interfering with Triton's tourist business. On appeal, Triton lost again in 1989 and Nolan's damages were reduced.

During the 1990s, further exploration stalled because of legal battles between the Triton partners and a lack of financing.

It was announced in April 2006 that brothers Rick and Marty Lagina of [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Michigan]] had purchased 50 percent of Oak Island Tours from David Tobias for an undisclosed sum. The rest of the company is owned by Blankenship. Center Road Developments, in conjunction with Allan Kostrzewa and Brian Urbach (members of the Michigan group), had purchased Lot 25 from David Tobias for a reported $230,000 one year before Tobias sold the rest of his share. The Michigan group, working with Blankenship, said that it would resume operations on Oak Island in the hope of discovering buried treasure and solving the island's mystery.

In July 2010, Blankenship and the other stakeholders in Oak Island Tours announced on their website that the Nova Scotia [[Executive Council of Nova Scotia|Department of Natural Resources]] and [[Executive Council of Nova Scotia|Department of Tourism, Culture and Heritage]] had granted them a treasure-trove license which allowed them to resume activities until December 31, 2010.&lt;ref name="oit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oakislandtreasure.co.uk/content/view/396/2/ |title=Treasure Trove License granted! |work=Oak Island Treasure |accessdate=November 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808184407/http://www.oakislandtreasure.co.uk/content/view/396/2/# |archive-date=August 8, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After December 2010, the departments repealed the treasure-trove license and replaced it with an Oak Island Treasure Act.&lt;ref name="hch1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Treasure hunter hopes new law clears path to gold" Province to replace old rules with Oak Island Act |last=Medel |first=Brian |date=July 15, 2010 |work=Halifax Chronicle Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act, which became effective on January 1, 2011, allows treasure hunting to continue on the island under the terms of a license issued by the Minister of Natural Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/bills/61st_2nd/3rd_read/b081.htm |title=Oak Island Treasure Act |work=nslegislature.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration by the Lagina brothers has been documented in a [[reality television]] show airing on the [[History (Canadian TV network)|History]] channel starting in 2014.

== {{anchor|Water in the money pit}}Water in the pit ==

According to an account written in 1862, after the Onslow Company had excavated to {{convert|80|–|90|ft|m|abbr=off}} the pit flooded with seawater up to the {{convert|33|foot|m|adj=on}} level; attempts to remove the water were unsuccessful. Explorers have made claims about an elaborate drainage system extending from the ocean beaches to the pit.

Later treasure hunters claimed that coconut fibres were discovered beneath the surface of a beach, Smith's Cove, in 1851. This led to the theory that the beach had been converted into a [[siphon]], feeding seawater into the pit through a man-made tunnel. A sample of this material was reportedly sent to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] during the early 20th century, where it was concluded that the material was coconut fibre.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;French, Carey. "Treasure Island? Fabled Booty Eludes the Fortune Hunters." ''The Globe and Mail'' November 19, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Although one expedition claimed to have found a flood tunnel lined with flat stones at {{convert|90|feet}},&lt;ref name="Crooker" /&gt; geologist Robert Dunfield wrote that he carefully examined the walls of the re-excavated pit and was unable to locate any evidence of a tunnel.&lt;ref name="Crooker" /&gt;

At the invitation of Boston-area businessman [[David Mugar]], a two-week survey was conducted by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in 1995 (the only known scientific study conducted on the site). After running [[dye tracing|dye tests]] in the bore hole, the institution concluded that the flooding was caused by a natural interaction between the island's freshwater [[Lens (hydrology)|lens]] and tidal pressures in the underlying geology (refuting the man-made tunnel theory). The Woods Hole scientists who viewed the 1971 videos reported that nothing conclusive could be determined from the murky images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criticalenquiry.org/oakisland/whoi.shtml |title=Appendix: Woods Hole Explores Oak Island |first=Richard |last=Joltes |date=August 2002 |work=CriticalEnquiry.org |page=1 |accessdate=March 20, 2010 |ref=Joltes2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reported five finger (or box) drains at Smith's Cove have recently been thought to be the remains of an early salt works, with no connection between the drains and any flooding of the pit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criticalenquiry.org/oakisland/Dennis_King_Mar_2010.shtml |title=A Solution To The Mystery Of The Oak Island Five Finger Drains |last=King |first=Dennis |date=February 2010 |work=CriticalEnquiry.org |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oak Island lies on a [[glacier|glacial]] [[tumulus]] system and is underlain by a series of water-filled [[anhydrite]] cavities, which may be responsible for the repeated flooding of the pit. This type of limestone easily dissolves when exposed to water, forming caves and natural voids. [[Bedrock]] lies at a depth of {{convert|38|to|45|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the pit area.

== Stone with alleged markings ==
A stone found 90 feet below the surface was said to have been inscribed with "mysterious markings." It was first reported in a July 2, 1862, ''Halifax Sun and Advisor'' article, which mentioned a June 2, 1862, letter by J. B. McCully which retold the story of the stone.&lt;ref name="Trans002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Newspapers on Microfilm – 2013 Catalog|url=http://www.commonwealthimaging.com/media/user/Commonwealth_Imaging_Catalogue.pdf|publisher=Common Wealth Imagining|access-date=February 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210122012/http://commonwealthimaging.com/media/user/Commonwealth_Imaging_Catalogue.pdf#|archive-date=February 10, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offering a secondhand description of its discovery during the 1805 excavation, McCully wrote: "Some [layers] were charcoal, some putty, and one at 80 feet was a stone cut square, two feet long and about a foot thick, with several characters cut on it." No 19th-century account attests to what the actual symbols were. The earliest documentation of the reported symbols is Edward Rowe Snow's 1949 book, ''True Tales of Buried Treasure''. According to Snow, A. T. Kempton of Cambridge, Massachusetts provided him with the symbols but did not disclose where or how he had obtained them.

In an 1863 newspaper article, the stone was said to have been built into the "chimney of an old house near the pit".&lt;ref name="Yar001"/&gt; Another article, a year later, claimed that the stone was held by the Smith family. On January 2, 1864, Historical Society of Nova Scotia secretary John Hunter-Duvar contacted treasure hunter George Cooke. In a January 27, 1864, letter to Hunter-Duvar, Cooke claimed that Smith built the stone into his chimney in 1824 and said that he was shown the stone by Smith in the chimney around 1850, when "there were some crudely cut letters, figures or characters upon it.  I cannot recollect which, but they appear as if they had been scraped out by a blunt instrument, rather than cut with a sharp one." According to Cooke, when he made inquiries in 1864, he discovered that the chimney had been enclosed in wood and surrounded by a staircase; the stone was no longer visible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oakislandcompendium.ca/90ft-stone---descriptions.html Oak Island Compendium]&lt;/ref&gt; An undated post-1893 letter by William Blair read, "Jefferson W. McDonald, who first mentioned Oak Island to me in 1893, worked under George Mitchell. Mr. McDonald, who was a carpenter by trade, also told of taking down a partition in Smith's house, in order that he with others might examine the characters cut on the stone used in the fireplace in the house. The characters were there all right, but no person present could decipher them."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oakislandtours.ca/uploads/5/0/8/8/50887171/b01_early_oak_island_docs_compiled_by_les_m_may_2014.pdf Early Oak Island Documents] (71/130)&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell was the superintendent of works for the Oak Island Association, which was formed on April 3, 1861, and ceased operation by March 29, 1865.&lt;ref name=mather/&gt;

In his 1872 novel, ''The Treasure of the Seas'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMille|first1=James|title=The Treasure of the Seas|url=https://fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20080504|publisher=Lea and Shepard|location=Boston}} [https://archive.org/stream/treasureofseas00demi#page/n3/mode/2up Same book at www.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James DeMille]] describes being a summer resident of Chester Basin during the later 1860s. DeMille lived on Oak Island for a summer and had firsthand knowledge of the area. The characters in the novel find that the stone had been removed from the chimney when they arrived on the island;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_26436#page/n137/mode/2up P128]&lt;/ref&gt; until then, no one had been able to decode the mysterious symbols reportedly on the stone, which an inn landlord describes as 'rather faint, and irregular' — he also says that 'men who don't believe in Kidd's treasure ... say that it isn't an inscription at all ... it's only some accidental scratches'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_26436#page/n91/mode/2up PP85-6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_26436#page/n113/mode/2up PP 104-5]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reginald Vanderbilt Harris (1881–1986) wrote in his 1958 book, ''The Oak Island Mystery'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vanderbilt Harris|first1=Reginald|title=The Oak Island Mystery|url=http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM1540991&amp;R=1540991|website=Toronto Public Library|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; "About 1865–1866 the stone was removed and taken to Halifax. Among those who worked to remove the stone was Jefferson W. MacDonald." The Blair letter mentioned above states that MacDonald took down the partition in order to examine the stone, not to remove it. Harris provides no source for the claim that the stone was removed in 1865 or 1866. The next mention of the stone is in an 1893 Oak Island Treasure Company [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]]. According to the prospectus, the stone was taken out of the chimney and moved to Halifax; there, an unnamed expert was said to have deciphered the stone as reading: "Ten feet below are two million pounds buried."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_34838#page/n9/mode/2up/search/stone Oak Island Treasure Company ([microform) : capital, sixty thousand dollars, shares only five dollars each, full paid and non-assessable - P5]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On August 19, 1911, ''Collier's'' magazine published a firsthand account by Captain H. L. Bowdoin of the stone (which was then in use at Creighton's bookbindery in Halifax). Bowdoin described the rock as "of a basalt type hard and fine-grained." The stone he saw had no symbols on it. Although Bowdoin was told that they had worn off, he was skeptical because of the stone's hardness.&lt;ref name="Colliers01"/&gt;
According to Charles B. Driscoll's 1929 book, ''The Oak Island Treasure'' (based on secondhand accounts),
{{quote|The stone was shown to everyone who visited the Island in those days. Smith built this stone into his fireplace, with the strange characters outermost, so that visitors might see and admire it. Many years after his death, the stone was removed from the fireplace and taken to Halifax, where the local savants were unable to translate the inscription. It was then taken to the home of J.B. McCulley in Truro, where it was exhibited to hundreds of friends of the McCulleys who became interested in a later treasure company. Somehow the stone fell into the hands of a bookbinder, which used it as a base upon which to beat leather for many years. A generation later, with the inscription nearly worn away, the stone found its way to a bookstore in Halifax, and what happened to it after that I was unable to learn. But there are plenty of people living who have seen the stone. Nobody, however, ever seriously pretended to translate the inscription."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Driscoll|first1=Charles B.|title=The Oak Island Treasure|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/NorthAmericanRev-1929jun-00685| | date=1929 | page=685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The stone was reportedly brought by A. O. Creighton (of the 1866 expedition) from the Smith home to Creighton's bookbindery in Halifax. Harry W. Marshall (born 1879), the son of an owner of the bookbindery, wrote in 1935 that: -

# He well remembered seeing the stone as a boy.
# "While in Creighton’s possession some lad had cut his initials ‘J.M.” on one corner, but apart from this there was no evidence of any inscription either cut or painted on the stone." 
# Creighton used the stone for a beating stone and weight. 
# When the business was closed in 1919, ... the stone was left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Harry W. Marshall|url=http://www.oakislandcompendium.ca/statement-of-harry-w-marshall.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investors and explorers==
[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], stirred by family stories originating from his sailing and trading grandfather (and Oak Island financier) Warren Delano, Jr., began following the mystery in late 1909 and early 1910. Roosevelt continued to follow it until his death in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasure Hunters in Nova Scotia|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/treasure/treasure_hunt_01.html|website=US National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his political career, he monitored the island's recovery attempts and development. Although the president secretly planned to visit Oak Island in 1939 while he was in Halifax, fog and the international situation
prevented him from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roosevelt:|first1=Franklin D.|title=White House Letter – August 24th, 1939|url=http://historical.ha.com/itm/autographs/u.s.-presidents/franklin-d-roosevelt-typed-letter-signed-as-president/a/6001-53128.s|website=Heritage Auctions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
=== Natural sinkhole ===
Wide-ranging speculation exists about how the pit was formed and what it might contain. According to Joe Nickell, there is no treasure; the pit is a natural phenomenon, probably a [[sinkhole]] connected to limestone passages or caverns.&lt;ref name="Nickell"/&gt; Suggestions that the pit is a natural phenomenon (accumulated debris in a sinkhole or [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]]) date to at least 1911.&lt;ref&gt;This section follows Nickell, section "Man-made or Natural?".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowdoin, H. L. 1911. Solving the mystery of Oak Island. Collier's Magazine, August 18. Cited and discussed in Harris 1958, 110–120; O'Connor 1988, 63–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faribault, E. Rudolph. 1911. Summary Report of Geological Survey Branch of the Department of Mines. Quoted in Furneaux 1972, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;Atlantic Advocate. 1965. Article in October issue, cited in Crooker 1978, 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of sinkholes and underground caves, to which the "booby traps" are attributed, exist on the mainland near the island.

Its resemblance to a human-made pit has been suggested as partly due to the texture of natural, accumulated debris in sinkholes: "This filling would be softer than the surrounding ground, and give the impression that it had been dug up before".&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; The "platforms" of rotten logs have been attributed to trees, damaged by "blowdowns" ([[derecho]]s) or wildfires, periodically falling (or washing into) the hollow.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Douglas. 1988 ''[http://www.prestonchild.com/books/riptide/Death-Trap-Defies-Treasure-Seekers-for-Two-Centuries;art45,47 Death Trap Defies Treasure Seekers for Two Centuries]'', published in the Smithsonian Magazine June 1988 53–56&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pit, similar to the early description of the "money pit", was discovered in the area in 1949 when workmen were digging a well on the shore of Mahone Bay. At a point where the earth was soft, "At about two feet down a layer of fieldstone was struck. Then logs of spruce and oak were unearthed at irregular intervals, and some of the wood was charred. The immediate suspicion was that another money pit had been found."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor (1988, 172–173)&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Treasure trove theories}}Treasure trove===

According to the earliest theory, the pit held a pirate treasure buried by [[Captain Kidd]];&lt;ref name="Trans001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="howlett"&gt;Howlett, A. "Mystery of Captain Kidd's Treasure." ''World Wide Magazine'' October 1958&lt;/ref&gt; Kidd reportedly conspired with [[Henry Avery]], and Oak Island was their community bank. Another pirate theory involved Edward Teach ([[Blackbeard]]), who said that he buried his treasure "where none but [[Satan]] and myself can find it."{{cn|date=November 2017}}

An additional proposed explanation is that the pit was dug by Spanish sailors to hold treasure from a wrecked [[galleon]] or [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[troops]] stationed there during the [[American Revolution]]. Others claim that British marines dug the pit to store the loot acquired from the [[Battle of Havana (1762)|British invasion of Cuba]], valued at about £1,000,000 pounds (about $180,000,000 in 2015). John Godwin wrote that given the apparent size and complexity of the pit, it was probably dug by French Army engineers hoping to hide the treasury of the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] after it fell to the British during the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref name="godwin"&gt;Godwin, John.

==== Marie Antoinette's jewels ====
[[Marie Antoinette]]'s jewels, missing except for specimens in museum collections, have been reportedly hidden on the island. On October 5, 1789, an angry mob of Parisian working women was incited by [[French Revolution|revolutionaries]] and [[Women's March on Versailles|marched]] on the [[Palace of Versailles]]. According to the undocumented story, Marie Antoinette instructed her maid (or a lady-in-waiting) to take the jewels and flee.

==== {{anchor|Shakespeare manuscripts}}Bacon-Shakespeare authorship ====
In his 1953 book, ''The Oak Island Enigma: A History and Inquiry Into the Origin of the Money Pit'', Penn Leary wrote that the pit was used to hide manuscripts indicating that [[Francis Bacon]] was the author of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works and a leader of the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]].&lt;ref name="leary"&gt;Leary, Thomas P. ''The Oak Island Enigma: A History and Inquiry Into the Origin of the Money Pit.'' (T. P.

====Masonic and other artifacts====

In his book, ''Oak Island Secrets'',&lt;ref name=secrets/&gt; Mark Finnan noted that many Masonic markings were found on Oak Island, and the shaft (or pit) and its mysterious contents seemed to replicate aspects of a Masonic initiation rite involving a hidden vault with a sacred treasure. [[Joe Nickell]] identifies parallels between Oak Island accounts, the "Secret Vault" allegory in [[York Rite]] [[Freemasonry]] and the [[Chase Vault]] on [[Barbados]].&lt;ref name="Nickell"/&gt;
Freemason Dennis King examines the Masonic aspects of the Oak Island legend in his article, "The Oak Island Legend: The Masonic Angle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criticalenquiry.org/oakisland/Dennis_King_Masonic_Angle.shtml |title=The Oak Island Legend: The Masonic Angle |last=King |first=Dennis |publisher=CrititalEnquiry.org |date=May 12, 2010 |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Sora speculated that the pit could have been dug by exiled [[Knights Templar]] and might be the final resting place of the [[Holy Grail]] or the [[Ark of the Covenant]].&lt;ref name="sora"&gt;Sora, Steven. ''The Lost Treasure of the Knights Templar'' (Inner Traditions/Destiny, 1999). {{ISBN|0-89281-710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory holds that the [[Rosicrucian]]s and their reported leader, [[Francis Bacon]], organized a secret project to make Oak Island the home of its legendary vault with ingenious means to conceal ancient manuscripts and artifacts. Researchers and cryptographers such as Petter Amundsen and Daniel Ronnstam claim to have found codes hidden in Shakespeare, rock formations on the island, and clues hidden in other 16th- and 17th-century art and historical documents. According to Daniel Ronnstam, the stone found at {{convert|90|ft|m}} contains a dual cipher created by Bacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ronnstam|first1=Daniel|title=The Duel Cipher|url=http://oakislandproject.com/wp/a/news|website=The Oak Island Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|certain=y|date=November 2017}}

===Other theories===

Author Joy Steele suggests that the money pit is actually a [[tar]] [[kiln]] dating to the historical period when "Oak Island served as a tar-making location as part of the British [[naval stores]] industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/books/1322501-oak-island-mystery-its-history-is-the-real-treasure|title=Oak Island mystery: Its history is the real treasure|work=The Chronicle Herald | accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When marine biologist [[Barry Fell]] attempted to have the symbols on the stone translated during the late 1970s, he said that the symbols resembled the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] alphabet and read: "To escape contagion of plague and winter hardships, he is to pray for an end or mitigation the Arif: The people will perish in misery if they forget the Lord, alas."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Fell, Saga America, pg. 172&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fell's theory, Coptic migrants sailed from North Africa to Oak Island and constructed the pit.

'''Pemoline''' is a [[stimulant]] drug of the 4-[[oxazolidinone]] class. It was first synthesized in 1913&lt;ref&gt;Chemische Berichte,1913,vol.46, p. 2083&lt;/ref&gt; but its activity was not discovered until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Acta Academiae Aboensis, Series B: Mathematica et Physica,   1939, vol. 11, #14 p. 3,7&lt;/ref&gt; Under the names '''Betanamin''', '''Cylert''', '''Tradon''', and '''Ceractiv''' it was used as a medication to treat [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and [[narcolepsy]]. Under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]], it is a Schedule IV drug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf Annual Estimates Of Requirements Of Narcotic Drugs, Manufacture Of Synthetic Drugs, Opium Production And Cultivation Of The&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205000000/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |date=December 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer generally available in the United States as a result of the FDA withdrawing approval of pemoline as an indicated treatment for ADHD, due to its implication in liver failures among children who were receiving the medication. An FDA Alert warned against prescribing pemoline for ADHD. This spurred Abbott Laboratories, the patent owner of Cylert, to cease manufacturing Cylert. Manufacturers of the generic equivalents followed suit.

==Mechanism of action==
Pemoline is generally considered [[dopaminergic]], but its precise method of action hasn't yet been definitively determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cylert (Pemoline)|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2003/016832s022_017703s018lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pemoline passes the [[blood–brain barrier]] and acts as a surrogate for dopamine, not affecting endogenous intracellular dopamine. For this reason, and the fact that it has little or no affinity for adrenaline receptors, pemoline has minimal [[sympathomimetic]] side effects such as: dry mouth, reduction in appetite, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, constriction of smooth muscle, cardiac stress, dilated pupils and insomnia. There is some data to suggest that pemoline is a [[nootropic]] acting as a catalyst conductor in the synapses of the brain's memory centers, raising the efficiency of memory and assisting [[RNA]] formation in the brain. While drugs like [[dexamphetamine]] and [[methylphenidate]] are classified as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|Schedule II]], pemoline is listed as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule IV controlled substances|Schedule IV]] (non-narcotic). In studies conducted on primates, pemoline fails to demonstrate a potential for self-administration.

Pemoline is Schedule IV Non-Narcotic (Stimulant) controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 1530 and is not subject to annual manufacturing quotas.  The salts in use are pemoline magnesium (free base conversion ratio .751), pemoline iron (.578), pemoline copper (.644), pemoline nickel (.578), pemoline rubidium, pemoline calcium, pemoline chromium, and chelates of the above which are identical in weight to the salt mentioned.  Pemoline free base and pemoline cobalt, strontium, silver, barium, lithium, sodium, potassium, zinc, manganese, and caesium are research chemicals which can be produced in situ for experiments.&lt;ref&gt;DEA office of Diversion Control site: Federal Register publications of CSA schedules, 2014 Q1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The A-Z Encyclopaedia of Alcohol and Drug Abuse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CRC Handbook of Chemistry &amp; Physics&lt;/ref&gt;  Others such as lanthanide pemoline salts such as pemoline cerium can be prepared; pemoline beryllium would presumably be toxic.

==Interactions==
Other stimulants and [[MAOI]]’s are contraindicated with pemoline.

==Liver toxicity==
In some patients pemoline is suspected of causing [[hepatotoxicity]],&lt;ref name="pmid9602211"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marotta PJ, Roberts EA |title=Pemoline hepatotoxicity in children |journal=J. Pediatr. |volume=132 |issue=5 |pages=894–7 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9602211 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-3476(98)70329-4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002234769800208X}} {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the FDA recommended that regular liver tests should be performed on those treated with it.&lt;ref name="pmid12108802"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Willy ME, Manda B, Shatin D, Drinkard CR, Graham DJ |title=A study of compliance with FDA recommendations for pemoline (Cylert) |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=785–90 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12108802 |doi= 10.1097/00004583-200207000-00009|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0890-8567&amp;volume=41&amp;issue=7&amp;spage=785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since receiving FDA approval in 1975,&lt;ref name="pmid18217792"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Etwel FA, Rieder MJ, Bend JR, Koren G |title=A surveillance method for the early identification of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions |journal=Drug Saf |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=169–80 |year=2008 |pmid=18217792 |doi= 10.2165/00002018-200831020-00006|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been linked with 21 cases of [[liver failure]], of which 13 resulted in liver replacement or death.

In March 2005 [[Abbott Laboratories]] and generic manufacturers withdrew pemoline from the American market due to concerns about the liver toxicity risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pemoline - Withdrawn due to liver toxicity risk | journal = WHO Pharmaceuticals Newsletter | year = 2005 | issue = 5 | url = http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js8120e/1.3.html#Js8120e.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overdose==
Overdose of pemoline may present with [[choreoathetosis]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stork CM, Cantor R |title=Pemoline induced acute choreoathetosis: case report and review of the literature |journal=J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=105–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9022662 |doi= 10.3109/15563659709001175|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Pemoline is synthesized by the condensation of racemic [[mandelic acid|ethyl mandelate]] with [[guanidine]].

The '''Presidential Council''' was created in March 1990 to replace the [[Politburo]] as the major policymaking body in the [[USSR]]. According to article 127 in the [[Soviet constitution]] the job of the presidential council was "to implement the basic thrust of USSR's domestic and foreign policy and ensure the country's security". It was abolished on 26 December 1990. Only the writer [[Valentin Rasputin]] was a non-party member.

A '''rock festival''', often considered synonymous with '''[[pop festival]],''' is a large-scale [[rock music]] [[concert]], featuring multiple acts performing an often diverse range of popular music including rock, pop, folk, electronic, and related genres.

As originally conceived in the mid to late 1960s, rock festivals were held outdoors, often in open rural areas or open-air sports arenas, fairgrounds and parks, typically lasted two or more days, featured long rosters of musical performers, and attracted very large crowds, sometimes numbering several hundred thousand people.

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2018}}
Initially, some of the earliest rock festivals were built on the foundation of pre-existing jazz and blues festivals, but quickly evolved to reflect the rapidly changing musical tastes of the time. For example, the United Kingdom’s [[National Jazz Festival]] was launched in Richmond from August 26–27, 1961. The first three of these annual outdoor festivals featured only jazz music, but by the fourth "Jazz &amp; Blues Festival" in 1964, a shift had begun that incorporated some blues and pop artists into the lineup. In 1965, for the first time the event included more blues, pop and rock acts than jazz, and by 1966, when the event moved to the town of Windsor, the rock and pop acts clearly dominated the jazz artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/nat-jazz-menu.html/ UKRockFestivals.com] Retrieved January 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar, though more rapid, evolution occurred with [[Jazz Bilzen]], a solely jazz festival that was inaugurated in 1965 in the Belgian city of Bilzen. The 1966 festival still featured mostly jazz acts. However, by the time of the third festival from August 25–27, 1967, rock and pop acts had edged out most of the jazz bands and become the main attraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jazzbilzen.be/65-81Default.htm/ Jazz Bilzen history] Retrieved January 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, rock festivals seemed to spring up with a more self-defined musical identity. Preceded by several precursor events in the San Francisco area, the first two rock festivals in the US were staged in northern California on consecutive weekends in the summer of 1967: the KFRC [[Fantasy Fair &amp; Magic Mountain Music Festival]] on Mount Tamalpais (June 10–11) and the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]] (June 16–17).&lt;ref&gt;Santelli, Robert. ‘’Aquarius Rising – The Rock Festival Years’’.

The concept caught fire and spread quickly as rock festivals took on a unique identity and attracted significant media attention around the world. By 1969, promoters were staging dozens of them. According to Bill Mankin, in their dawning age rock festivals were important socio-cultural milestones: "… it would not be an exaggeration to say that, over a few short years, rock festivals played a unique, significant – and underappreciated – role in fueling the countercultural shift that swept not only America but many other countries [during the 1960s]. It seems fitting… that one of the most enduring labels for the entire generation of that era was derived from a rock festival: the ‘[[Woodstock]] Generation’."&lt;ref&gt;Mankin, Bill.  [http://likethedew.com/2012/03/04/we-can-all-join-in-how-rock-festivals-helped-change-america/ We Can All Join In: How Rock Festivals Helped Change America].  Like the Dew.  2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting their musical diversity and the then-common term ‘[[pop music]]’, for the first few years, particularly in the US, many rock festivals were called ‘pop festivals’. This also served to distinguish them among the ticket-buying public from other, pre-existing types of [[music festival]]s such as jazz and folk festivals. By the end of 1972, the term ‘pop festival’ had virtually disappeared as festival promoters adopted more creative, unique and location-specific names to identify and advertise their events. While it was still in vogue, however, over-zealous promoters eager to capitalize on the festival concept made the most of it, with some using the term "Pop Festival" or "Rock Festival" to advertise events held on a single day or evening, often indoors, and featuring only a handful of acts.&lt;ref&gt;Santelli, Robert.  ''Aquarius Rising - The Rock Festival Years''.  1980.  Dell Publishing Co., Inc.  Pg. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, rock festivals are still usually open-air concerts spread out over several days. Many are annual events sponsored by the same organization, and many feature a single type or closely related genres of music such as [[Dance music|dance]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], or [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

'''Production and financing'''

Several of the early rock festival organizers of the 1960s such as [[Chet Helms]], [[Tom Rounds]], [[Alex Cooley]] and [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]] helped create the blueprint for large-scale rock festivals in the United States, as well promoters such as [[Wally Hope]] in the United Kingdom. In various countries, the organizers of rock festivals have faced legal action from authorities, in part because such festivals have attracted large [[counterculture]] elements. In 1972, [[Mar Y Sol Pop Festival]] in [[Manatí, Puerto Rico]] attracted an estimated 30-35,000 people, and an arrest warrant was issued for promoter Alex Cooley, who avoided arrest by leaving the island before the festival was over.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} British [[free festival|Free Festival]] organizers [[Ubi Dwyer]] and [[Sid Rawle]] were imprisoned for attempting to promote a 1975 Windsor Festival,&lt;ref name="hudsonmark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaltimes.it/index.php?year=1975&amp;volume=IT-Volume-3&amp;issue=1&amp;item=IT_1975-06-01_E-IT-Volume-3_Iss-1_005|title=International Times Vol 3 Issue 1|date=June 1975|publisher=International Times|accessdate=3 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040227/http://www.internationaltimes.it/index.php?year=1975&amp;volume=IT-Volume-3&amp;issue=1&amp;item=IT_1975-06-01_E-IT-Volume-3_Iss-1_005|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="it2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaltimes.it/index.php?year=1975&amp;volume=IT-Volume-3&amp;issue=2&amp;item=IT_1975-07-01_E-IT-Volume-3_Iss-2_001|title=International Times Vol 3 Issue 2|date=July 1975|publisher=International Times|accessdate=3 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040248/http://www.internationaltimes.it/index.php?year=1975&amp;volume=IT-Volume-3&amp;issue=2&amp;item=IT_1975-07-01_E-IT-Volume-3_Iss-2_001|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="windsor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/win-74-3-jailed.jpg|title=Pop festival 'organiser' sent to jail|publisher=ukrockfestivals.com|accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British police would later outright attack free festival attendees at the 1985 [[Battle of the Beanfield]].

Festivals may require millions of USD to be organized, with the money often gathered through fundraising and [[angel investor]]s.&lt;ref name="financespagetwo"&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-first= Richard |editor1-last= West |date=June 1976  |title= Rock Economics |journal= [[Texas Monthly]] |volume= 4 |issue= 6 |pages= 17–18 |publisher= Mediatex Communications Corp. |location= Austin |issn= 0148-7736 |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wCwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate= 2010-10-04 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="financespage"&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-first= Richard |editor1-last= West |date=November 1976  |title= Rock on the Rocks |journal= [[Texas Monthly]] |volume= 4 |issue= 11 |pages= 86, 88 |publisher= Mediatex Communications Corp. |location= Austin |issn= 0148-7736 |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1iwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |accessdate= 2010-10-04 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stages and sound systems'''

While [[rock concerts]] typically feature a small lineup of [[rock band]]s playing a single stage, rock festivals often grow large enough to require several stages or venues with live bands playing concurrently. Some of these stages may in turn become known and large enough to be seen as festivals themselves, such as [[The Glade]] at the famous [[Glastonbury Festival]] in England. As rock music has increasingly been fused with other genres, sometimes stages will be devoted to a specific genre, such as [[folk rock]] or [[reggae]]. Some festivals such as [[SXSW]] hold smaller concurrent concerts throughout a city.

Advances in [[sound reinforcement system]]s beginning in the 1960s enabled larger and larger rock festival audiences to hear the performers' music with much better clarity and volume. The best example was the pioneering work of [[Bill Hanley (sound engineer)|Bill Hanley]], known as the "father of festival sound", who provided the sound systems for numerous rock festivals including Woodstock. Other examples included the [[Wall of Sound (Grateful Dead)|Wall of Sound]] invented in the 1970s to allow the [[Grateful Dead]] to play to larger audiences, and mobile [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]] such as those maintained by [[the Merry Pranksters]], which would later be important in the development of events such as reggae festivals and [[rave]]s.

'''Camping and crowd control'''

Many festivals offer camping, either because lodging in the area is insufficient to support the crowd, or to allow easy multi-day access to the festival's features. Festival planning and logistics are frequently a focus of the media, and while some festivals such as the historic [[Sky River Rock Festival]] were seen as logistical successes, other festivals such as the heavily commercialized [[Woodstock 1999]] were crowd control disasters, with insufficient water and other resources provided to audiences. Many early rock festivals successfully relied on volunteers for [[crowd control]], for example individuals like [[Wavy Gravy]] and biker groups such as the [[Hells Angels]]&lt;ref name="farmfriend"&gt;Gravy, W. ''The Hog Farm and Friends'', Links Press 1992 pp. 72-74&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grim Reapers Motorcycle Club (USA)|Grim Reapers Motorcycle Club]].&lt;ref name="pjstar1"&gt;[http://www.pjstar.com/news/luciano/x157343936/Luciano-A-Woodstock-or-laughingstock?zc_p=1 Luciano: A Woodstock or laughingstock? - News - Journal Star - Peoria, IL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Gravy in particular called his security group the "Please Force," a reference to their non-intrusive tactics at keeping order, e.g., "Please don't do that, please do this instead". When asked by the press&amp;nbsp;— who were the first to inform him that he and the rest of his commune were handling security&amp;nbsp;— what kind of tools he intended to use to maintain order at Woodstock in 1969, his response was "Cream pies and [[Soda syphon|seltzer bottles]]."&lt;ref name="farmfriend"/&gt; Other rock festivals hire private security or local police departments for crowd control, with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref name="nnyreallark"&gt;

[[File:Samba Pizzo d'Albundo 0572.JPG|thumb]]
The international '''[[ballroom dance|ballroom version]] of samba''' is a lively, rhythmical dance with elements from Brazilian [[samba]]. It differs considerably from the original [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|samba styles of Brazil]], in particular it differs from [[Samba de Gafieira]], a partner type of Samba in Brazil. 

==Technique==
As a ballroom dance, the samba is a [[partner dance]]. Ballroom samba, even more than other ballroom dances, is very disconnected from the origins and evolution of the music and dance that gives it its name.

Most steps are danced with a slight downward bouncing or dropping action. This action is created through the bending and straightening of the knees, with bending occurring on the beats of 1 and 2, and the straightening occurring between. However, unlike the bouncing of, e.g., [[Polka]], there is no considerable bobbing. Also, Samba has a specific hip action, different from that in ballroom Latin dances (Rumba and Cha-Cha-Cha).

The ballroom samba is danced to music in 2/4 or 4/4 time. It uses several different rhythmic patterns in its figures, with cross-rhythms being a common feature. Thus, for three-step patterns, common step values (in beats) are:

{| class="wikitable"
| 3/4 || 1/4 || 1 || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| 3/4 || 1/4 || 3/4 || 1/4
|-
| 1 || &amp;nbsp; || 1/2 || 1/2
|-
| 3/4 || 1/2 || 3/4 || &amp;nbsp;
|}

==Music==
The ballroom samba is danced under several different rhythms, including the original [[Samba (music)|samba music]]. It is also possible to dance ballroom samba with [[flamenco]], [[zouk]],  and other [[South America]]n rhythms.

'''Script Frenzy''', also known as '''Screenzy''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|r|ɛ|n|.|z|iː}}, was an international [[screenwriting]] challenge where participants attempted to write a script (for the stage, screen, or many other mediums) during the month of April.

The event was organized by The Office of Letters and Light, the nonprofit organization behind [[National Novel Writing Month|National Novel Writing Month ("NaNoWriMo")]].  It ran each year from 2007 until 2012.

The first Script Frenzy was held in June 2007 with a goal of 20,000 words to win. In 2008, Script Frenzy was moved to April and the goal was changed to 100 pages. The goals are roughly equivalent; the change simply reflects the fact that page count is a more standard measure of script length.

Other changes include the ability for writers to team up and work as two-person teams. The functionality was given to link both writers such that their page count would be shared.

Finally, in the original Script Frenzy only screenplays and stage plays were permitted. This has been expanded to include other types of scripts including TV series, graphic novels, shorts and audio plays amongst others. For the shorter formats, participants were allowed to submit several scripts to make up the 100-page total.

==Closure of the event==
On June 26, 2012 it was announced that Script Frenzy was being closed down. The decision was made by the Office of Letters and Lights board after close consideration and a vote.  The event was cancelled due to a continued decline in participants, and likewise, a continued decline in donations.&lt;ref&gt;Important News about Script Frenzy [http://www.scriptfrenzy.org/node/4189006 Important News about Script Frenzy] (Retrieved June 28, 2012) {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Script Frenzy is the script version of [[National Novel Writing Month]], better-known as NaNoWriMo, where participants use November's 30 days to try to write 50,000 words of prose (a short novel, or series of short stories, or part of a longer novel).  NaNoWriMo was started in July 1999 by Chris Baty, and garnered a mere 21 participants.  In 2000, the challenge moved to November, and by 2009, the event had 170,000 participants.

'''''Socrates''''' ({{Lang-fr|Socrate}}) is a [[1759]] French play in three acts written by [[Voltaire]]. It is set in [[Ancient Greece]] during the events just before the [[Socrates#Trial and death|trial and death]] of Greek philosopher [[Socrates]].  It is heavy with satire specifically at government authority and organized religion. The main characters besides the titular role is that of the priest [[Anitus]], his entourage, [[Xantippe|Socrates' wife Xantippe]], several judges, and some children Socrates has adopted as his own. 

Like more historical accounts by [[Herodotus]], [[Plato]], and [[Xenophon]], the playwright shows Socrates as a moral individual charged with baseless accusations by a conspiracy of corrupt [[Ancient Athens|Athenians]] or [[Athenian democracy|Athenian officials]] although Voltaire implies that the wrongdoers are a select few.  

Unlike the historical account, Socrates deals with several judges, whereas his real life counterpart receives his punishment of death by [[Conium|hemlock]] by a [[jury]] of 500 Athenians.  The presence or mention of Socrates' best-known students such as [[Plato]], [[Antisthenes]], [[Aristippus]], and others are replaced by unnamed disciples, delivering only a few token lines at the end of the play.  Socrates is also portrayed as a monotheist and a victim of religious persecution, an interpretation that is not generally shared by modern scholars and historians.

Generally, this is not the most well-known of his works in comparison with ''[[Letters on the English]]'' which Voltaire published in 1778 or the ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' published earlier in 1764.  However, hints of his contempt for government and religion are apparent here which later influenced the leaders of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].

}}
[[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]] composed his grand [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[motet]] '''''Te Deum''''' (H. 146) in [[D major]] probably between 1688 and 1698, during his stay at the [[Jesuit Order|Jesuit]] Church of Saint-Louis in [[Paris]], where he held the position of musical director.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Te Deum (H. 146). Vocal score |last=Charpentier |first=Marc Antoine |translator=Taylor, Steve |year=2004 |publisher=Bärenreiter Verlag |location=[[Kassel]] |isbn= |pages=v-viii |url= }} ISMN M-0006-52543-0&lt;/ref&gt; The work is written for the group of soloists, choir, and instrumental accompaniment.

Charpentier authored six ''Te Deum'' settings, although only four of them have survived.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; It is thought that the composition was performed to mark the victory celebrations and the [[Battle of Steenkerque|Battle of Steinkirk]] in August, 1692.

== Structure ==
The composition consists of the following parts:
*Prelude (''Marche en rondeau'')&lt;ref name="Fornäs"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fornäs|first=Johan|title=Signifying europe|year=2011|publisher=Intellect Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781841505213|page=187|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=QvWnEitwHnkC&amp;pg=PT340}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Te Deum laudamus (bass solo)
*Te aeternum Patrem (chorus and SSAT solo)
*Pleni sunt caeli et terra (chorus)
*Te per orbem terrarum (trio, ATB)
*Tu devicto mortis aculeo (chorus, bass solo)
*Te ergo quaesumus (soprano solo)
*Aeterna fac cum sanctis tuis (chorus)
*Dignare, Domine (duo, SB)
*Fiat misericordia tua (trio, SSB)
*In te, Domine, speravi (chorus with ATB trio)

Charpentier considered the key D-major as ''"bright and very warlike"''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The instrumental introduction, composed in the form of rondo, precedes the first verset, led by the bass soloist. The choir and other soloists join gradually. Charpentier apparently intended to orchestrate the work according to the traditional exegesis of the Latin text. The choir thus predominates in the first part (verset 1–10, praise of God, heavenly dimension), and individual soloists in the second part (verset 11–20, Christological section, secular dimension). In subsequent versets, nos. 21–25, both soloists and choir alternate, and the final verset is a large-scale fugue written for choir, with a short trio for soloists in the middle.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Orchestration ==
The composition is scored for five soloists (SSATB) and choir (SATB), accompanied with an instrumental ensemble of 2 nonspecified recorders or flutes, 2 oboes, trumpet, low trumpet and timpani (playing the same part), 2 violins, 2 violas ("haute-contres de violon" and "tailles de violon") and basso continuo. 

Typical continuo instruments used in French baroque music are "[[Basse de violon|basses de violon]]" (a [[violoncello|cello]]-like, large scaled instrument often replaced by cellos in modern performances), organ, harpsichord, theorbo, bass viol and bassoon. Furthermore, [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]]s were frequently used to double the bass line of vocal choirs in 17th century France.

The orchestral tutti is mostly constricted to 4 parts (all high wind instruments and violins playing the same line), while the vocal soloist sections make use of a lighter three-part instrumental texture including 2 flutes and basso continuo as well as 2 violins and basso continuo.

==In popular culture==
After the work's rediscovery in 1953 by French musicologist [[Carl de Nys]], the instrumental prelude, ''Marche en rondeau'', was chosen in 1954 as the theme music preceding the broadcasts of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].&lt;ref name="Fornäs" /&gt; After over sixty years of use notably before EBU programs such as the popular [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and [[Jeux Sans Frontières]], the prelude, as arranged by Guy Lambert and directed by Louis Martini,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cessac|first=textes réunis par Catherine|title=Les manuscrits autographes de Marc-Antoine Charpentier|year=2007|publisher=Mardaga|location=Wavre|isbn=9782870099414|page=6|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=FAcMwO-pgcAC&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has become Charpentier's best-known work.

The prelude was used for the introduction of the ''Olympiad'' films by [[Bud Greenspan]].

The prelude was briefly played during King Richard's coronation in the 1995 film ''[[Richard III (1995 film)|Richard III]]''.

The prelude was played in the TV series ''[[Outlander_(TV_series)|Outlander]]'', Series 2 Episode 2, in a scene at the [[Palace of Versailles]] in 1744, during the reign of King [[Louis XV]] of France.

The prelude was used in popular songs including "United" by [[Drafi Deutscher|Drafi]] and "Kun rakkaus voittaa" by [[Fredi (singer)|Fredi]].

{{Politics of Uruguay}}

'''General elections''' were held in [[Uruguay]] on 25 November 1984,&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II'', p494 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928358-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first since the [[1973 Uruguayan coup d'état|1973 coup]]. Since then the country had been run by a [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|civic-military dictatorship]]. The electoral process was considered transparent and marked the end of the dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/342242-calendiario-871 |title=Remembering the 1984 elections |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a victory for the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]], which won the most seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Uruguay|Chamber of Deputies]] and received the most votes in the presidential election.

{{World-Scrabble-Championship | year=1999 | date-from=4 November 1999 | date-to=7 November 1999 | location=[[Melbourne]] | winner=Joel Wapnick | number-of-players=98 | sponsor=Mattel | next=2001 | previous=1997 }}

The '''World Scrabble Championship 1999''' was the fifth World Scrabble Championship and was held at the Carlton Crest Hotel, Melbourne, Australia. 

The winner was [[Joel Wapnick]] of Canada.&lt;ref name=wsc1999&gt;{{cross-tables tournament|tid=1567|tname=WSC 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second time a player representing Canada has won, the first being when [[David Boys (Scrabble)|David Boys]] won in [[World Scrabble Championship 1995|1995]]. The [[World Scrabble Championship 1991|1991]] champion, [[Peter Morris (Scrabble)|Peter Morris]], was also a Canadian but represented the United States.

Eight games were played on each of the first three days with the top two players advancing to a best-of-five finals.

In the first game, Wapnick opened with the [[Bingo (Scrabble)|bingo]] [[wikt:chaplet|CHAPLET]] and took a 249-60 lead three turns later with the double -double FILTHIER then cruised to a 624-307 victory. Nyman took the second game and Wapnick took the third then got off to an early lead in the fourth before losing a turn when he tried the phony FUROUR. The game remained tight, with both players getting down two bingos, until Wapnick drew the X and [[wikt:deoxy|DEOXY]] for 50 to take a one -point lead and take the last tile out of the bag. With Wapnick having multiple places to go out, Nyman was unable to catch him and lost by a single point. Joel Wapnick could now add a world title to his [[National Scrabble Championship|US national title]] and [[Canadian Scrabble Championship|Canadian title]], one of only two players to have won the big three.

==History==
[[File:Shambala festival 2003 (Lithuania) flyer.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] for Shambala Festival 2003]]

Yaga Gathering was originally a [[psychedelic trance]] [[music festival]] called '''Shambala Festival'''—named for the mythical hidden kingdom of [[Shambhala]]. The first event took place from 18–20 July 2003; it was small and not widely advertised. Organisers produced a second festival in 2005, and by the third festival in 2006 they had added a yoga class, a drum circle, film screenings, lectures, and a [[sweat lodge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yaga.lt/history/2006/ |title=History: 2006 |website=Yaga.lt |access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 festival was renamed Yaga Gathering. Yaga Gathering returned in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psytraveller.net/lithuania/ |title=Psychedelic Flash in Lithuania |last=Shoom |first=Anton |date=28 May 2013 |origyear=2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603003233/http://psytraveller.net/lithuania/ |archive-date=3 June 2015 |website=Psytraveller.net |access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2011 through 2017. There was no Yaga Festival in 2008 or 2010. Yaga Gathering 2017 took place on 3–7 August 2017; the 13th festival, Yaga Gathering 2018, is planned for 9–13 August 2018.&lt;ref name="RA"/&gt;

In [[Vedic]] tradition, a ''yaga'' ({{lang-sa|याग|translit=[[yajna]]|lit=sacrifice|link=no}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=yAga |title=याग |website=Spoken Sanskrit Dictionary |access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a ritual performed in front of a sacred fire, or one in which an offering is burned in a fire. The festival's name alludes to spiritual rebirth.
