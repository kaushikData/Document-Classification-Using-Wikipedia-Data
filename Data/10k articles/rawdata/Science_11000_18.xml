In [[theoretical physics]], '''back-reaction''' (or '''backreaction''') is often necessary to calculate the self-consistent behaviour of a [[Elementary particle|particle]] or an object in an external field.

==Intuitive definition==
When a particle is considered to have no mass or to have an [[infinitesimal]] charge, this can be described as saying that we deal with a probe and that back-reaction is neglected. However, a real object also carries (in general) a mass and a charge itself. These properties imply that the model of the original environment needs to be modified to reach self-consistency. For example, a particle can be described as helping to curve the space in [[general relativity]]. Taking into account the constraints implied on the model by the particle's properties – the back-reaction – is one way of reaching a more accurate model than if those constraints are ignored.

==Cosmology==
In [[inhomogeneous cosmology]], in which structure formation is taken into account in a general-relativistic model of the Universe, the term "backreaction" is used for a measure of the non-commutativity of the averaging procedure
:&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu}(\overline{g_{\alpha\beta}}) \neq \overline{G_{\mu\nu}(g_{\alpha\beta})} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\overline{T_{\mu\nu}}&lt;/math&gt;
(which comes from the non-linearity of Einstein field equations) and the dynamical evolution of spatial slices of space-time&lt;ref name="Buchert2008GRGreview" /&gt;.
{{As of|2017}}, the role of backreaction in possibly leading to an alternative to [[dark energy]] is an open question of debate among cosmologists.&lt;ref name="Buchert11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchert11_CQGplus" /&gt;  The existence of a homogeneity length scale can be considered to be that at which the calculations with and without backreaction give the same results. {{As of|2017}}, the existence of such a scale needs experimental confirmation.&lt;ref name="Buchert2008GRGreview" /&gt;

In [[geology]], '''bedrock''' is the [[Lithification|lithified]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]] that lies under a loose softer material called [[regolith]] at the surface of the Earth or other [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial planets]]. The broken and weathered regolith includes [[soil]] and [[subsoil]]. The surface of the bedrock beneath the soil cover is known as '''rockhead''' in [[engineering geology]],&lt;ref&gt;Price, David George, ''Engineering Geology: Principles and Practice,'' Springer, 2009, p.{{nbsp}}16 {{ISBN|978-3540292494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gribble&amp;McLean"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayPapNgD1hMC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=bedrock+contour+map+rockhead&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3mIsVNHYNenY7Aa5pYH4CA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bedrock%20contour%20map%20rockhead&amp;f=false | title=Geology for Civil Engineers | publisher=CRC Press | author=Gribble C. &amp; McLean A. | year=2003 | pages=113 | isbn=9780203362150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its identification by digging, drilling or [[geophysics|geophysical]] methods is an important task in most [[civil engineering]] projects. Superficial [[deposit (geology)|deposits]] (also known as [[drift (geology)|drift]]) can be extremely thick, such that the bedrock lies hundreds of meters below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/10/pdf/newsletter/2004No.1.pdf |title=Swinford, E.

Bedrock may also experience subsurface [[weathering]] at its upper boundary, forming [[saprolite]].

A solid [[geologic map]] of an area will usually show the distribution of differing bedrock types, rock that would be exposed at the surface if all [[soil]] or other superficial deposits were removed.&lt;ref name="BGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/products/digitalmaps/digmapgb_solid.html|title=Digital Geology – Bedrock geology theme|last=BGS|accessdate=2009-11-12| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213185511/http://www.bgs.ac.uk/products/digitalmaps/digmapgb_solid.html| archivedate= 13 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horizons.gif|thumb|left|upright|Soil profile with bedrock labeled R]]

== In soil science ==
Soil scientists use the capital letters O, A, B, C, and E to identify the master [[soil horizons]]. Hard bedrock, which is not soil, uses the letter R.

{{Continuum mechanics}}

'''Boyle's law''' (sometimes referred to as the '''Boyle–Mariotte law''', or '''Mariotte's law'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Draper|first=John William|title=A Textbook on chemistry|year=1861|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKwS7QDh5eMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=draper,+john+william&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an experimental [[gas laws|gas law]] that describes how the [[pressure]] of a [[gas]] tends to increase as the [[volume]] of the container decreases. A modern statement of Boyle's law is
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an [[ideal gas]] is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the [[temperature]] and [[amount of substance|amount of gas]] remain unchanged within a [[closed system]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Ira. N (1978). "Physical Chemistry" University of Brooklyn: [[McGraw-Hill]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levine_1"&gt;Levine, Ira. N. (1978), p. 12 gives the original definition.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mathematically, Boyle's law can be stated as

{|
|-
| style="padding: 0.2em 0.4em;" | &lt;math&gt;P \propto \frac{1}{V}&lt;/math&gt;
| style="padding: 0.2em 0.4em;" | Pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.
|}

or

{|
|-
| style="padding: 0.2em 0.4em;" | &lt;math&gt; PV = k&lt;/math&gt;
| style="padding: 0.2em 0.4em;" | Pressure multiplied by volume equals some constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
where ''P'' is the pressure of the gas, ''V'' is the volume of the gas, and ''k'' is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]].

The equation states that the product of pressure and volume is a constant for a given mass of confined gas and this holds as long as the temperature is constant. For comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be usefully expressed as
 
:&lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The equation shows that, as volume increases, the pressure of the gas decreases in proportion. Similarly, as volume decreases, the pressure of the gas increases. The law was named after [[chemistry|chemist]] and [[physicist]] [[Robert Boyle]], who published the original law in 1662.&lt;ref&gt;In 1662, he published a second edition of the 1660 book ''New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects'' with an addendum ''Whereunto is Added a Defence of the Authors Explication of the Experiments, Against the Obiections of Franciscus Linus and Thomas Hobbes''; see ''J Appl Physiol'' 98: 31–39, 2005. ([http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/98/1/31 Jap.physiology.org Online].)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of thermodynamics}}
[[File:Boyles Law.svg|thumb|A graph of Boyle's original data]] 
This relationship between pressure and volume was first noted by [[Richard Towneley]] and [[Henry Power]] in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Henry Power, ''Experimental Philosophy, in Three Books'' … (London, England:  Printed by T. Roycroft for John Martin and James Allestry, 1663), pp. 126-130.  Available on-line at:  [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/a55584.0001.001/155?page=root;size=125;view=text Early English Books Online].  On page 130, Power presents (not very clearly) the relation between the pressure and the volume of a given quantity of air:  "That the measure of the Mercurial Standard, and Mercurial Complement, are measured onely by their perpendicular heights, over the Surface of the restagnant Quicksilver in the Vessel: But Ayr, the Ayr's Dilatation, and Ayr Dilated, by the Spaces they fill.  So that here is now four Proportionals, and by any three given, you may strike out the fourth, by Conversion, Transposition, and Division of them.  So that by these Analogies you may prognosticate the effects, which follow in all Mercurial Experiments, and predemonstrate them, by calculation, before the senses give an Experimental [eviction] thereof."  In other words, if one knows the volume V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ("Ayr") of a given quantity of air at the pressure p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ("Mercurial standard", i.e., atmospheric pressure at a low altitude), then one can predict the volume V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ("Ayr dilated") of the same quantity of air at the pressure p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ("Mercurial complement", i.e., atmospheric pressure at a higher altitude) by means of a proportion (because p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =  p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
* Charles Webster (1965) "The discovery of Boyle's law, and the concept of the elasticity of air in seventeenth century," ''Archive for the History of  Exact Sciences'', '''2''' (6) :  441-502 ; see especially pp. 473-477.
*  Charles Webster (1963) "Richard Towneley and Boyle's Law," ''Nature'', '''197''' (4864) :  226-228.
*  Robert Boyle acknowledged his debts to Towneley and Power in:  R. Boyle, ''A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air'', … (London, England:  Thomas Robinson, 1662).  Available on-line at:  [http://bvpb.mcu.es/en/consulta/registro.cmd?id=406806  Spain's La Biblioteca Virtual de Patrimonio Bibliográfico].  On pages 50, 55-56, and 64, Boyle cited experiments by Towneley and Power showing that air expands as the ambient pressure decreases.  On p. 63, Boyle acknowledged Towneley's help in interpreting Boyle's data from experiments relating the pressure to the volume of a quantity of air.  (Also, on p. 64, Boyle acknowledged that [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|Lord Brouncker]] had also investigated the same subject.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holton2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald James Holton|title=Physics, the Human Adventure: From Copernicus to Einstein and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czaGZzR0XOUC&amp;pg=PA270|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2908-0|pages=270–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Boyle]] confirmed their discovery through experiments and published the results.&lt;ref&gt;R. Boyle, ''A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air'', … (London, England:  Thomas Robinson, 1662).  Available on-line at:  [http://bvpb.mcu.es/en/consulta/registro.cmd?id=406806  Spain's La Biblioteca Virtual de Patrimonio Bibliográfico].  Boyle presents his law in "Chap. V.  Two new experiments touching the measure of the force of the spring of air compress'd and dilated.", pp. 57-68.  On p. 59, Boyle concludes that " … the same air being brought to a degree of density about twice as that it had before, obtains a spring twice as strong as formerly."  That is, doubling the density of a quantity of air doubles its pressure.  Since air's density is proportional to its pressure, then for a fixed quantity of air, the product of its pressure and its volume is constant.  On page 60, he presents his data on the compression of air:  "A Table of the Condensation of the Air."  The legend (p. 60) accompanying the table states:  "E.  What the pressure should be according to the ''Hypothesis'', that supposes the pressures and expansions to be in reciprocal relation."  On p. 64, Boyle presents his data on the expansion of air:  "A Table of the Rarefaction of the Air."&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Robert Gunther]] and other authorities, it was Boyle's assistant, [[Robert Hooke]], who built the experimental apparatus.  Boyle's law is based on experiments with air, which he considered to be a fluid of particles at rest in between small invisible springs. At that time, air was still seen as one of the four elements, but Boyle disagreed. Boyle's interest was probably to understand air as an essential element of life;&lt;ref&gt;The Boyle Papers BP 9, fol. 75v-76r at [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/boyle/boyle_papers/bp09_docs/bp9_075v-076r.htm BBK.ac.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122203756/http://www.bbk.ac.uk/boyle/boyle_papers/bp09_docs/bp9_075v-076r.htm |date=2009-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, he published works on the growth of plants without air.&lt;ref&gt;The Boyle Papers, BP 10, fol. 138v-139r at [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/boyle/boyle_papers/bp10_docs/bp10_138v-139r.htm BBK.ac.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122203809/http://www.bbk.ac.uk/boyle/boyle_papers/bp10_docs/bp10_138v-139r.htm |date=2009-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle used a closed J-shaped tube and after pouring mercury from one side he forced the air on the other side to contract under the pressure of mercury. After repeating the experiment several times and using different amounts of mercury he found that under controlled conditions, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to the volume occupied by it.{{sfn|Britannica Educational Publishing|2012|p=94}} The French physicist [[Edme Mariotte]] (1620–1684) discovered the same law independent of Boyle in 1679,&lt;ref&gt;See:

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus this law is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law or the Boyle–Mariotte law. Later, in 1687 in the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] showed mathematically that if an elastic fluid consisting of particles at rest, between which are repulsive forces inversely proportional to their distance, the density would be directly proportional to the pressure,&lt;ref&gt;Principia, Sec.V,prop. XXI, Theorem XVI&lt;/ref&gt; but this mathematical treatise is not the physical explanation for the observed relationship. Instead of a static theory a kinetic theory is needed, which was provided two centuries later by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]].

This law was the first physical law to be expressed in the form of an equation describing the dependence of two variable quantities.{{sfn|Britannica Educational Publishing|2012|p=95}}

== Definition ==
[[File:Boyle's Law Demonstrations.webm|thumb|Boyle's law demonstrations]]

The law itself can be stated as follows:

{{quotation|For a fixed amount of an [[ideal gas]] kept at a fixed temperature, pressure and volume are inversely proportional.&lt;ref name="levine_1"/&gt;}}
Or Boyle's law is a gas law, stating that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship, when temperature is held constant. If volume increases, then pressure decreases and vice versa, when temperature is held constant.

Therefore, when the volume is halved, the pressure is doubled; and if the volume is doubled, the pressure is halved.

=== Relation with kinetic theory and ideal gases ===
Boyle's law states that ''at constant temperature'' the volume of a given mass of a dry gas is inversely proportional to its pressure.

Most gases behave like [[ideal gas]]es at moderate pressures and temperatures.  The technology of the 17th century could not produce high pressures or low temperatures. Hence, the law was not likely to have deviations at the time of publication. As improvements in technology permitted higher pressures and lower temperatures, deviations from the ideal gas behavior became noticeable, and the relationship between pressure and volume can only be accurately described employing [[real gas]] theory.&lt;ref name="levine_2"&gt;Levine, Ira. N. (1978), p11 notes that deviations occur with high pressures and temperatures.&lt;/ref&gt;  The deviation is expressed as the [[compressibility factor]].

Boyle (and  Mariotte) derived the law solely on experimental grounds.  The law can also be derived theoretically based on the presumed existence of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s and assumptions about motion and perfectly elastic collisions (see [[kinetic theory of gases]]).  These assumptions were met with enormous resistance in the [[positivist]] scientific community at the time however, as they were seen as purely theoretical constructs for which there was not the slightest observational evidence.

[[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1737-1738 derived Boyle's law using [[Newton's laws of motion]] with application on a molecular level. It remained ignored until around 1845, when [[John Waterston]] published a paper building the main precepts of kinetic theory; this was rejected by the [[Royal Society of England]].  Later works of [[James Prescott Joule]], [[Rudolf Clausius]] and in particular Ludwig Boltzmann firmly established the [[kinetic theory of gases]] and brought attention to both the theories of Bernoulli and Waterston.&lt;ref name="levine_3"&gt;Levine, Ira. N. (1978), p400 – Historical background of Boyle's law relation to Kinetic Theory&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate between proponents of [[Energetics]] and [[Atomism]] led Boltzmann to write a book in 1898, which endured criticism up to his suicide in 1906.&lt;ref name="levine_3" /&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905 showed how kinetic theory applies to the [[Brownian motion]] of a fluid-suspended particle, which was confirmed in 1908 by [[Jean Perrin]].&lt;ref name="levine_3" /&gt;

===Equation===
The mathematical equation for Boyle's law is:

:&lt;math&gt; PV = k &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''P'' denotes the [[pressure]] of the system.
* ''V'' denotes the [[volume]] of the gas.
* ''k'' is a constant value representative of the temperature and volume of the system.

So long as [[temperature]] remains constant the same amount of energy given to the system persists throughout its operation and therefore, theoretically, the value of ''k'' will remain constant. However, due to the derivation of pressure as perpendicular applied force and the probabilistic likelihood of collisions with other particles through [[collision theory]], the application of force to a surface may not be infinitely constant for such values of ''v'', but will have a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] when [[differential calculus|differentiating]] such values over a given time. Forcing the volume ''V'' of the fixed quantity of gas to increase, keeping the gas at the initially measured temperature, the pressure ''p'' must decrease proportionally. Conversely, reducing the volume of the gas increases the pressure. Boyle's law is used to predict the result of introducing a change, in volume and pressure only, to the initial state of a fixed quantity of gas.

The initial and final volumes and pressures of the fixed amount of gas, where the initial and final temperatures are the same (heating or cooling will be required to meet this condition), are related by the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represent the original pressure and volume, respectively, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent the second pressure and volume.

Boyle's law, [[Charles's law]], and [[Gay-Lussac's law#Pressure-temperature law|Gay-Lussac's law]] form the [[combined gas law]]. The three gas laws in combination with [[Avogadro's law]] can be generalized by the [[ideal gas law]].

==Human breathing system==

Boyle's law is often used as part of an explanation on how the [[breathing]] system works in the human body. This commonly involves explaining how the lung volume may be increased or decreased and thereby cause a relatively lower or higher air pressure within them (in keeping with Boyle's law). This forms a pressure difference between the air inside the lungs and the environmental air pressure, which in turn precipitates either inhalation or exhalation as air moves from high to low pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald J. Tortora, Bryan Dickinson, 'Pulmonary Ventilation' in ''Principles of Anatomy and Physiology'' 11th edition, Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, pp. 863-867&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">'''Chelating resins''' are a class of [[ion exchange resin]]s. They are almost always used to bind cations.  They utilize chelating agents covalently attached to a polymer matrix. Chelating resins have the same bead form and polymer matrix as usual ion exchangers.  Their main use is for preconcentration of metal ions in a dilute solution.&lt;ref&gt;Apte, S. C.; Batley, G. E., "Trace metal speciation of labile chemical species in natural waters and sediments: non-electrochemical approaches", IUPAC Ser. Anal. Phys. Chem. Environ. Syst. 1995, 3, 259-306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garg, B. S.; Sharma, R. K.; Bhojak, N.; Mittal, S., "Chelating Resins and Their Applications in the Analysis of Trace Metal Ions", Microchem. J. 1999, 61, 94-114.{{DOI|10.1006/mchj.1998.1681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, R. K.; Mittal, S.; Koel, M., "Analysis of trace amounts of metal ions using silica-based chelating resins: A green analytical method", Crit. Rev. Anal. Chem. 2003, 33, 183-197.{{DOI|10.1080/713609163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and structure==
Chelating resins operate similarly to ordinary ion exchange resins.
[[Image:mida.svg|thumb|left|A tridentate metal complex with the iminodiacetate anion, illustrating the nature of the metal-binding site in some chelating resins.]]

Most chelating resins are polymers (copolymers to be precise) with reactive functional groups that chelate to metal ions.&lt;ref&gt;Sahni, S. K.; Reedijk, J., "Coordination chemistry of chelating resins and ion exchangers", Coord. Chem. Rev. 1984, 59, 1-139.{{DOI|10.1016/0010-8545(84)85053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variation in chelating resins arises from the nature of the chelating agents pendant from the polymer backbone. Dowex chelating resin A-1, also known as Chelex 100, is based on [[iminodiacetic acid]] in a styrene-divinylbenzene matrix. Dowex A-1 is available commercially and is widely used to determine general properties of chelating resins such as rate determining step and pH dependence, etc.  Dowex A-1 is produced from chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer via amination with [[aminodiacetic acid]].

Poly metal chelating resin has almost negligible affinity to both alkali and alkaline earth metals; small quantities of resin can be utilized to concentrate trace metals in natural water systems or biological fluids, in which there are three or four orders of magnitude greater alkali and alkaline earth metal concentration than the trace metal concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colella|first=M.

Other functional groups bound to chelating resins are aminophosphonic acids, [[thiourea]], and 2-picolylamine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">A '''chief creative officer''' ('''CCO''') is the highest ranking position of the creative team within a company. Depending on the type of company, this position may be responsible for the overall look and feel of [[marketing]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[brand]]ing associated with the organization. The CCO may also be charged with managing, developing, and leading the team of [[creative director]]s, [[art director]]s, [[designer]]s, and [[copywriter]]s.

==Overall description==
The CCO directs a company's creative output, developing the artistic design strategy that defines the company's brand.&lt;ref name="do"&gt;Written By: Terry Masters, Edited By: Allegra J. Lingo [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-chief-creative-officer-do.htm "What Does a Chief Creative Officer Do"], 14 October 2014, Retrieved on 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The CCO creates the unique image of the firm and deliver this distinctive design to consumers and to create a clear [[brand image]] which is a fundamental and essential work throughout the company. Advertisements present a certain memorable artistic design while also structured to accomplish functional goals. The CCO ensures that the design and functionality combine harmoniously so the firm can present a product that successfully represents its creative brand.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

CCOs, in some cases are called [[creative directors]], are demanded in firms which involve creative thinking and artistic design. The position of generic head of marketing is usually replaced by chief creative officer in advertising firms.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt; The power of chief creative officer can even be compared to [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and at the early stages of a small company, usually at the start of [[partnerships]], the CCO and the CEO manage jointly.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

'''Darwin Core Archive''' (DwC-A) is a [[biodiversity informatics]] data standard that makes use of the [[Darwin Core]] terms to produce a single, self-contained dataset for species occurrence, checklist, sampling event or material sample data. Essentially it is a set of text (CSV) files with a simple descriptor (meta.xml) to inform others how your files are organized. The format is defined in the Darwin Core Text Guidelines.&lt;ref name="dwc-text"&gt;[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/index.htm Darwin Core Text Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the preferred format for publishing data to the [[GBIF]] network.

The Darwin Core today is broader in scope. It aims to provide a stable, standard reference for sharing information on biological diversity. As a glossary of terms, the Darwin Core provides stable semantic definitions with the goal of being maximally reusable in a variety of contexts. This means that Darwin Core may still be used in the same way it has historically been used, but may also serve as the basis for building more complex exchange formats, while still ensuring interoperability through a common set of terms.

==Archive format==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
The central idea of an archive is that its data files are logically arranged in a star-like manner, with one core data file surrounded by any number of ’extensions’. Each extension record (or ‘extension file row’) points to a record in the core file; in this way, many extension records can exist for each single core record.

Details about recommended extensions can be found in their respective subsections and will be extensively documented in the GBIF registry, which will catalogue all available extensions.

Sharing entire datasets instead of using pageable web services like DiGIR and TAPIR allows much simpler and more efficient data transfer. For example, retrieving 260,000 records via TAPIR takes about nine hours, issuing 1,300 http requests to transfer 500 MB of XML-formatted data. The exact same dataset, encoded as DwC-A and zipped, becomes a 3 MB file. Therefore, GBIF highly recommends compressing an archive using ZIP or GZIP when generating a DwC-A. 

An archive requires stable identifiers for core records, but not for extensions. For any kind of shared data it is therefore necessary to have some sort of local record identifiers. It’s good practice to maintain – with the original data – identifiers that are stable over time and are not being reused after the record is deleted. If you can, please provide globally unique identifiers instead of local ones.

===Dataset metadata===
A Darwin Core Archive should contain a file containing metadata describing the whole dataset. The [[Ecological Metadata Language]] (EML) is the most common format for this, but simple Dublin Core files are being used too.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5043">'''Dynamic Syntax'''  is a [[grammar formalism]] that aims to represent the real-time nature of the parsing/production process. Under the Dynamic Syntax approach, linguistic knowledge is considered to be the ability to parse spoken language in context, whilst syntax is the constraint-based way in which representations of context can be built up from words encountered in a string. While it has similarities to [[Combinatory categorial grammar]] in terms of the representations it generates, it is unique amongst grammar formalisms in that it puts word-by-word left-to-right incremental build-up of representations at the heart of the formalism, rather than incrementality only being used in external parsing algorithms.

==Parts of the formalism==

Dynamic Syntax constitutes several core components: semantic formulae and composition calculus (epsilon calculus within typed lambda calculus), trees (lambda application ordering), and tree building actions (lexical and computational actions).

===Semantic formulae and compositional calculus===

The semantic formulae which classical Dynamic Syntax generates are a combination of [[Epsilon calculus]] formulae and [[Lambda calculus]] terms (in recent years DS-TTR has been developed alongside DS where Record Types from the formalism Type Theory with Records (TTR)) are used - see Purver et al. (2011)).&lt;ref name="purveretal2011"&gt;Purver, M., Eshghi, A., &amp; Hough, J. (2011, January). Incremental semantic construction in a dialogue system. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Computational Semantics (pp. 365-369). Association for Computational Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formulae are either simple first order logic constants such as &lt;math&gt;john'&lt;/math&gt;, predicate terms such as &lt;math&gt;run'(john')&lt;/math&gt; or functions such as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.run'(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Normal lambda calculus substitution (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-reduction)  means a function can be applied to a simple term to return a predicate such that &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.run'(x))~john' = run'(john')&lt;/math&gt;. The Epsilon calculus extension to first order logic is implemented in quantifiers, where &lt;math&gt; (\exists x) A(x)\ \equiv \ A(\epsilon x\ A) &lt;/math&gt;, e.g. the string "a boy" may result in the formula &lt;math&gt; boy'(\epsilon x\ boy') &lt;/math&gt; being generated.

=== Tree growth ===
One of the basic assumptions behind DS is that natural language syntax can be seen as the progressive accumulation of transparent semantic representations with the upper goal being the construction of a logical propositional formula (a formula of type ''t''). This process is driven by means of monotonic tree growth, representing the attempt to model the way information is processed in a time-linear, incremental, word-to-word manner. Tree growth is driven by means of requirements (indicated by the question mark (?)).&lt;ref name="Chatzikyriakidis Gibson 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatzikyriakidis |first1=Stergios |last2=Gibson |first2=Hannah |title=The Bantu-Romance-Greek connection revisited: Processing constraints in                        auxiliary and clitic placement from a cross-linguistic perspective |journal=Glossa: a journal of general linguistics |date=3 February 2017 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=4 |doi=10.5334/gjgl.135}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree growth can take place in three ways: through computational rules, lexical input and pragmatic enrichment.

=== The language of trees ===
The language of representation in Dynamic Syntax consists of binary trees. These trees are underpinned by the Logic Of Finite Trees (LOFT, Blackburn &amp; Meyer-Viol 1994). LOFT is an expressive modal language that allows statements to be made about any treenode from the perspective of any treenode. LOFT uses two basic tree modalities, the up and down arrow relations. These correspond to the daughter and mother relations. Left nodes are addressed as 0 nodes and right nodes are 1 nodes. By convention, nodes on the left correspond to argument nodes, i.e. nodes in which arguments are represented, whereas right nodes correspond to the functor nodes, i.e. nodes in which all the various types of predicates are represented. The rootnode is given the treenode address 0 and it is defined as the sole node that does not have a mother node.&lt;ref name="Chatzikyriakidis Gibson 2017"/&gt;

'''Food moisture analysis''' involves the whole coverage of the food items in the world because foods are comprising a considerable amount of water rather than other ingredients. Foods are vital components which are consumed by the people at each and every moment for the surviving in the world. Basically there are several kinds of foods are available for the consumption as raw foods, [[processed foods]] and modified foods in the market. [[Moisture content]] of the food material is important to consider the food is suitable before the consumption, because [[moisture content]] affects the physical, chemical aspects of food which relates with the freshness and stability for the storage of the food for a long period of time and the moisture content determine the actual quality of the food before consumption and to the subsequent processing in the food sector by the food producers.

== Why food moisture analysis is important ==
Food    [[moisture analysis]] involves the amount of moisture content and the concentration of moisture by measuring qualitatively and quantitatively. The food processing companies and the "Research and Development" (R&amp;D) people of the food producing company, food related peoples, graduates, undergraduates and the high school students must be well aware of the moisture analysis of the food which do a lot in the food safety and storage conditions and the shelf life of the food. Moisture content analysis is important in determining the shelf life of foods and products

=== Legal and labeling requirements ===
Legal limitations regarding the amount of water present in the food is necessary for producing some of the specific products. For example, there should be less than 40% of moisture should be controlled during the production of cheddar cheese.

=== Economically important requirements ===
 
Moisture present in the food material is related with some type of food is dealing with economical values and the big business among industries therefore, food moisture analysis plays a significant role in the modern world.

=== Shelf life of the food or food products ===
Further, microbial activity of the food materials favor with the moisture availability in the food. Moisture rich foods are easily susceptible to the microbial attack and got rotted and damaged. Thus the shelf life of the food material is determined by the moisture content in the food.Low moisture foods usually slow down growth of microorganisms hence the need for analysis and control of food moisture.

=== Food quality measurements ===
Quality of the food is determined in terms of the food texture, taste, and appearance but [[moisture content]] of the food is a determination factor of the quality and the stability of the processed food products.

=== Food processing operations ===
Food processing operations are involved with the amount of moisture content present in the food item which is going to be processed for a specific purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9779">'''Helmut Volz''' ({{IPA-de|fɔlts|lang}}; 1 August 1911 in [[Göppingen]] &amp;ndash; 23 October 1978) was a [[Germany|German]] experimental [[nuclear physics | nuclear physicist]] who worked on the German nuclear energy project during World War II. In the latter years of World War II, he became a professor at [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen University]]. He declined to take a position offered to him in the [[United States]] after the war, and he continued his teaching and research at [[Erlangen]].

==Education==

From 1929 to 1933, Volz studied at the ''[[University of Tübingen | Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen]]'' and the ''[[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich | Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München]]''. He received his doctorate in 1935 under [[Hans Geiger]] at the University of Tübingen.&lt;ref&gt; Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Volz.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

From 1935 to 1937, Volz worked at and studied physics at the ''Institut für theoretische Physik'' of the ''[[University of Leipzig | Universität Leipzig]]''.&lt;ref&gt; H. Volz ''Über die Größe der Kernkräfte'', ''Zeitschrift für Physik'' Volume 105, Numbers 9-10, 537-552 (1937). Institutional citation: ''Institut für theoretische Physik der Universität, Leipzig''. Received 16 March 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; H. Volz ''Über die Größe der neuen Kernkräfte'', ''[[Die Naturwissenschaften]]'' Volume 25, Number 13, 200-101 (1937). Institutional citation: ''Leipzig, Institut fiir theoretiscbe Physik''. Received 30 January 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1937 to 1944, Volz was a teaching assistant to [[Hans Geiger]] at the ''Technische Hochschule Berlin'' (today, the [[Technical University of Berlin | Technische Universität Berlin]], in [[Charlottenburg | Berlin-Charlottenburg]]. During this period, Volz worked on the [[German nuclear energy project]], also called the ''Uranverein'' (Uranium Club). He specialized in experimental studies of [[neutron]] absorption in [[uranium]], conducted with another former student of Geiger, [[Otto Haxel]]. From 1943 to 1944, he was also a lecturer at the ''Technische Hochschule Berlin''.&lt;ref&gt; Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Volz.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1944, Volz was an extraordinarius professor (professor without a chair) at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg | Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg]].&lt;ref&gt; Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Volz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the close and after the end of World War II in Europe, the [[Russia]]ns and the Western powers had programs to foster technology transfer and exploit German technical specialists. For example, the U.S. had [[Operation Paperclip]] &lt;ref&gt; Naimark, 1995, 205-207. The author also points out that denying scientific and technical personnel to the Soviets was as much an objective as was acquiring their services for the West.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Gimbel, 1986, 433-451. The author, in Reference #3 on page 434, points out that the Soviets protested to [[Harry S. Truman | President Truman]] about U.S. and British removal in June 1945 of equipment, documents, and personnel from regions which were to fall within the Soviet zone of occupation. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower | General Eisenhower]] investigated and reported that the Soviet’s were correct about the removals, but what had been done had exceeded their claims.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Gimbel, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Russians had trophy brigades advancing with their military forces. In the area of atomic technology, the U.S. had [[Operation Alsos]] and the Russians had their version. While operational aspects of the Russian operation were modelled after the trophy brigades, a more refined approach was warranted for the exploitation of German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, and scientific personnel. This was rectified with a decree in late 1944 and the formation of specialised exploitation teams in early 1945 under the [[Russian Alsos]], which had broader objectives, including wholesale relocation of scientific facilities to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt; Oleynikov, 2000, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Volz was offered a position in the United States through [[Operation Paperclip]]. Volz had received a letter from the Munich Branch of the American War Department indicating that he had been suggested for a position in the United States and that he should henceforth report any change of address to the United States occupation authorities. The letter was not clear if this offer was voluntary or compulsory. Under further investigation, Volz found that the offer had a number of stipulations. On the positive side, his family in Germany would receive better quality care and rations than the average citizen of Germany under the occupation. On the other hand, he would not be allowed to correspond with anyone other than his relatives, he was to obey all orders, he would be restricted to a 50-mile radius around his duty station, and the minimum obligation had to be for at least six months. Furthermore, after his contractual period, he would not be allowed to return to Germany without permission of his employer. That was the last straw; Volz declined the offer. However, even with these conditions, the United States was able to attract considerable scientific talent to the United States under Operation Paperclip, as the living conditions in Germany were harsh and there were limited opportunities for meaningful scientific work there.&lt;ref&gt; Walker, 1993, 179-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1958, Volz was an ordinarius professor at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg | Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg]].&lt;ref&gt; Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Volz.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal reports==

The following reports were published in ''[[Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte]]'' (''Research Reports in Nuclear Physics''), an internal publication of the German ''[[German nuclear energy project|Uranverein]]''. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied [[Operation Alsos]] and sent to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the [[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center]] and the [[American Institute of Physics]].&lt;ref&gt; Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix E; see the entry for ''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Walker, 1993, 268-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ecological economics|People}}
The '''International Society for Ecological Economics''' ('''ISEE''') was founded in 1989, based heavily on the work of [[Herman Daly]] to promote [[Ecological Economics|ecological economics]] and assist ecological economists and related societies.  The society publishes a monthly journal ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'', books and other materials, and holds periodic meetings and conferences to facilitate a voice for ecological economists.

The ISEE was initially presided over by [[Robert Costanza]] who was also the first editor of the journal. Subsequent presidents have been [[Richard B. Norgaard]], John Proops, Charles Perrings, [[Joan Martinez Alier]], Peter May, John Gowdy, [[Bina Agarwal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isecoeco.org/about/ About The ISEE], accessed February 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and Marina Fischer-Kowalski, an Austrian sociologist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isecoeco.org/about/presidents-letter/ President's Letter], accessed February 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/socec/downloads/CVMFK_cv_update20140402.pdf CV] of Marina Fischer-Kowalski, accessed February 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The current president is Sabine O'Hara, Dean of the College of Agriculture, Urban Sustainability &amp; Environmental Sciences at the University of the District of Columbia.[http://www.udc.edu/faculty/faculty_researchers_dr_sabine_ohara]  [http://cloviscavalcanti.blogspot.co.uk/p/biografia.html Clóvis Cavalcanti] is the President Elect of the ISEE, his term as president commencing in January 2018.  The journal is currently edited by Richard B. Howarth.&lt;ref name=Newsletter&gt;ISEE Newsletter Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Right Livelihood Award]] was awarded to [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] "for defining a path of ecological economics that integrates the key elements of ethics, quality of life, environment and community." He was honored as one of the key figures in the foundation of ISEE, that was considered to be "the major forum that links economists and ecologists, and academics and environmental activists."&lt;ref&gt;Right Livelihood Award: ''[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/daly.html 1996 – Herman Daly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708053433/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/daly.html |date=8 July 2009 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;   Dr. Daly was also awarded the [http://steadystate.org/news-on-blue-planet-prize/ 2014 Japanese Blue Planet Award].

The ISEE is divided into regional societies.  There are currently ten regional societies:
* Africa (ASEE)
* Argentina and Uruguay (ASAUEE)
* Australia and New Zealand (ANZSEE)
* Brazil (Eco-Eco),
* Canada (CANSEE)
* European Union (ESEE)
* Mesoamerica ([[Mesoamerican Society for Ecological Economics|SMEE]])

'''Jacques Dauphin''' (July 4, 1923 &amp;ndash; April 1, 1994) was a French advertising pioneer&lt;ref name="He is referred to as a pioneer"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of FEPE|url=http://www.fepe.com/page.php?id=31|publisher=FEPE official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  founder and CEO of Dauphin OTA. He is best known as the father of modern [[billboard]] [[advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durand|first=Dominique|title=Le Livre du Mur Peint (Painted Walls) - Preface by Jacques Dauphin as the inventor of painted walls as advertising mediums|year=1985|publisher=Editions Alternatives|location=Paris|pages=166|url=http://www.priceminister.com/offer/buy/131712145/le-livre-du-mur-peint-art-et-techniques-de-durand-dominique-et-boulogne-daniel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovation and OOH are synonymous: John Ellery|url=http://www.mxmindia.com/2011/09/exclusive-interview-with-john-ellery/}} Jacques Dauphin is cited as "legendary".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notre histoire|url=http://www.clearchannel.fr/notre-histoire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Dauphin OTA was sold to the American company [[Clear Channel]] and became an emblematic part of its outdoor communication division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company History|url=http://www.clearchannel.com/Corporate/PressRelease.aspx?PressReleaseID=1166&amp;p=hidden|publisher=Clear Channel official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clear Channel acquires Dauphin OTA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clear Channel Buys Stake In French Outdoor Ad Company|url=http://www.sddt.com/News/article.cfm?SourceCode=19990611fai|publisher=San Diego Daily Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
After graduating with a law degree from Faculte de droit de Paris and from [[HEC Paris]], Jacques Dauphin re-opened the Parisian-based office created by his father Eugene Dauphin&lt;ref name="Eugene Dauphin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Lucy|title=Media Briefs|url=http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/58816/Media-Briefs/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|publisher=Marketing|accessdate=17 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1921 who closed it during WWII to prevent any collaboration with the Nazis. He then developed the company to a broader scale after the French Liberation expanding its activities (mainly billboard advertising and radio) to other European countries including the UK, Belgium, Italy or Spain.&lt;ref name="Eugene Dauphin"/&gt; Jacques Dauphin has notably created and developed the 4x3 format that remains today the international standard format used in billboard advertising worldwide.

==Career==
His professional achievements have been honoured in several occasions and he has successively occupied the following positions: president (1958 - 1966) of the national outdoor advertising federations of France, Germany, Belgium, Finland, Italy and the Netherlands best known as FEPE that he created&lt;ref name="He is referred to as a pioneer"/&gt; and the [[International Advertising Association]]. He was then vice-president (1969), president (1972 - 1974), and honorary president of the French Chambers of advertising. He presided the 3rd World Congress of Outdoor Advertising in London in 1972. He was a member of the International Commission « Publicité distribution » of the International Chamber of Commerce, and co-president of Grand prix international de l´affichage. He has been made Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] and Knight of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dauphin Coat of Arms and Name History|url=http://www.houseofnames.com/dauphin-coat-of-arms|publisher=House of Names}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Personal Interests==
[[File:Dauphin aime le cinéma, Cannes 1989.jpg|thumb|344x344px|Dauphin’s campaign and billboard advertising in support of the Cannes Film Festival - 1989]]Through Dauphin OTA Jacques Dauphin was also particularly active in the promotion of the arts and image. 

He notably promoted the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the French International Contemporary Art Fair best known as FIAC.

Through Dauphin, Jacques Dauphin has commissioned and inspired various artists, such as [[Daniel Buren]] or [[François Morellet]] among others.

Jacques Dauphin has turned billboard advertising into a popular art form, a witness of the contemporary society, and one of the leading media of the XXth century in Europe.

==Other facts==
After his only son died in a tragic car accident in 1988 Jacques Dauphin had no heir to take up the business that has led to the sale of the company in 1999.

His only heiress is his only granddaughter Charlotte de La Rochefoucauld (born Charlotte Dauphin in 1987) who has married Comte Charles-Henri de La Rochefoucauld in 2012 in Saint-Louis des Invalides cathedral in Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=William 1|title=Hanover8|url=http://www.william1.co.uk/han8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Royal forums|title=Noble Marriages Announcements 2012|url=http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f265/noble-marriages-announcements-2012-a-32280-3.html|publisher=The Royal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Dauphin's life and career, his personality, leadership, and his passion for sailing have inspired French film director [[Claude Lelouch]] for his film [[Itinerary of a Spoiled Child]] and its lead character Sam Lion.

'''Langat virus''' (LGTV) is a virus of the genus [[Flavivirus]]. The virus was first isolated in Malaysia in 1956 from a hard tick of the [[Ixodes]] genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=CE|title=A virus resembling Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus from an ixodid tick in Malaya.|journal=Nature|date=15 September 1956|volume=178|issue=4533|pages=581–2|pmid=13369466|doi=10.1038/178581a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This virus is antigenically related to [[Omsk hemorrhagic fever]] virus, [[Kyasanur forest disease]] virus, [[Alkhurma virus]], [[Louping ill virus]] and other viruses of the  [[Tick-borne encephalitis virus| tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) complex]]. The Langat virus does not pose a significant epidemiological threat in comparison with TBEV. There are no known cases of human diseases associated with LGTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gritsun TS, Lashkevich VA, Gould EA |title=Tick-borne encephalitis |journal=Antiviral Res |volume=57 |issue=1–2 |pages=129–46 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12615309 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166354202002061 |doi=10.1016/S0166-3542(02)00206-1|pmc=1814688 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malaysian strain (LGT strain TP21, also known as the Yelantsev virus) is naturally attenuated and induces neutralizing antibodies to [[tick-borne encephalitis virus]] (TBEV) and protection against other TBEV complex viruses in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rumyantsev|first1=A. A.|last2=Murphy|first2=B. R.|last3=Pletnev|first3=A. G.|title=A Tick-Borne Langat Virus Mutant That Is Temperature Sensitive and Host Range Restricted in Neuroblastoma Cells and Lacks Neuroinvasiveness for Immunodeficient Mice|journal=Journal of Virology|date=13 January 2006|volume=80|issue=3|pages=1427–39|doi=10.1128/JVI.80.3.1427-1439.2006|pmid=16415020|pmc=1346960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGTV-based vaccine==

In the 1970s a live attenuate LGTV-based vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis was made. At the same time, another vaccine was tested, but the group vaccinated with the LGTV-based vaccine had the lowest level of developing infection decease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shapoval AN |author2=Kamalov II |author3=Denisova EIu |author4=Sokolova ED |author5=Luzin PM |author6=Shamarina AG |author7=Gusmanova AG |author8=Pinaeva NI |title=Study of the distant consequences of immunizing people with a live vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis |journal=Tr Inst Im Pastera |volume=65 |pages=133–5 |year=1989 |pmid=2629181  |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were two big problems: the high level incidents of encephalitis (1:10 000) and lack of absolute protection from infection in endemic regions.

:''“As a Muslim woman, I am well aware of the difficult and severe conditions of your work and struggle,” said Ebadi in her letter today to Karman. Karman receives frequent death threats, and was thrown in jail last January. “I admire your tremendous work and courage. This victory will certainly inspire and reassure the million of Muslim women who suffer from discrimination and who fight for equality of rights between men and women—and also sends a message to countries going through the Arab Spring that true democracy will only be achieved if women also receive equal rights.”''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8234">Below are discoveries in science that involve chance circumstances in a particularly salient way. This page should not list all chance involved in all discoveries (i.e. it should focus on discoveries reported for their notable circumstances).

==Overview==
{{main|Role of chance in scientific discoveries}}
{{Cleanup-section|reason=It's more of a loose list than a proper introduction.|date=February 2018}}
Royston Roberts says that various discoveries required a degree of genius, but also some lucky element for that genius to act on.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, Royston M. (1989). Serendipity: Accidental Discoveries in Science. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gaughan writes that accidental discoveries result from the convergence of preparation, opportunity, and desire.&lt;ref name=Gaughan&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Gaughan |title=Accidental Genius: The World's Greatest By-Chance Discoveries|publisher=Metro Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4351-2557-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major everyday discoveries that were helped by luck in some way include products like [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]], [[teflon]], [[nylon]], [[penicillin]], [[cyanoacrylate]] (Super Glue), the implantable [[pacemaker]], the [[microwave oven]], [[Scotchgard]], [[Saran (plastic)|Saran wrap]], [[Silly Putty]], [[Slinky]], [[safety glass]],&lt;ref name="Engines"&gt;, {{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2463.htm|author=Andrew Boyd|title=Engines of Our Ingenuity, Episode 2463: Serendipity|accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[propeller (marine)|propeller]], [[snowmaking]], [[stainless steel]], [[Perkin's mauve]], and [[popsicle (brand)|popsicle]]s. Most artificial sweeteners have been discovered when accidentally tasted, including [[aspartame]] and [[saccharin]].&lt;ref name="Engines" /&gt;

Ideas include the theory of the [[big bang]], [[tissue culture]], [[radio astronomy]], and the discovery of [[DNA]].&lt;ref name=Gaughan/&gt;

Such archeological discoveries as the [[Rosetta stone]], the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and the ruins of [[Pompeii]] also emerged partly out of serendipity.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

Many relevant and well known scientific theories were developed by chance at some degree along history. According to a legend, [[Archimedes]] realized his [[Archimedes' principle|principle on hydrostatics]] when he entered in a bath full of water, which overflows (he then shouted out his famous "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!"). And the unexpected, negative results of the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] in their search of the [[luminiferous aether]] ultimately led to the [[Theory of Special Relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]].

The optical illusion called the "[[Flashed Face Distortion Effect|flashed face distortion effect]]" suggests a new area of research in the [[neurology]] of [[face perception]].

==Detailed examples==

===Newton and gravity===
[[File:Newton's apple tree in the Botanical Gardens, the University of Tokyo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Newton's reflections that led him to his theories about gravity started when he saw an apple fall from a tree]]
In his book, Roberts recounts [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s discovery of gravity (using Newton's own descriptions and notes). Newton was sitting in his yard when he noticed an apple fall from a tree. The apple fell straight down, perpendicular to the ground, and Newton found himself wondering why the apple never falls upward or off to a side. Newton soon realized that it was a property of all matter to have an attractive force, including the apple, and even the moon – which moves as one would expect if it was passing the earth but nevertheless being attracted. It was another 20 years before Newton published his detailed [[theory of gravity]], but he later visited the tree that helped him provoke the idea.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; Gaughan elaborates that Newton only had the opportunity to reflect on his orchard because of other chance circumstances: Newton was home because his university was shut down due to an outbreak of plague.&lt;ref name=Gaughan/&gt;

===Nobel and blasting gelatin===
According to Roberts, the common story that [[Alfred Nobel's]] discovery of [[dynamite]] was an accident may not be true. On the other hand, Roberts says, Nobel did make a discovery with the help of luck soon after that. Nobel cut his finger on a piece of glass one day at work and subsequently applied [[collodion]] in order to form a protective layer over the wound (similar in principle to [[liquid bandage]]). Nobel was kept up at night by the pain in his finger, so he started to think about a problem he was having back at work: Nobel was trying to create a powerful explosive using nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, but the two would not combine. Roberts reports that Nobel then realized that collodion (which he was using to dress his wound) could allow the two substances to combine, which led to the invention of [[blasting gelatin]] (as powerful as dynamite but much safer to handle).&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

===Pasteur===
[[File:2008-07-06 Bottle of Goo Gone solvent.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pasteur was lucky to be using a particular kind of acid salt, but also lucky that he left his solution on a window sill overnight. Otherwise there would have been no chemical reaction, and his genius would have had nothing to notice and interpret.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;]]
The French scientist [[Louis Pasteur]] is responsible for various discoveries, some of which involved serendipity in some way.  This seems to be the case with both his discovery that chemically identical molecules can have [[chirality]] (the way a right handed baseball glove will not work with the left hand), as well as his discovery of the chicken cholera vaccine.

====Chirality====
Roberts writes "Pasteur was puzzled: the salts of tartaric acid and [[racemic acid]] were said to be identical in chemical composition and crystalline shape, but they had different effects on polarized light."&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; Pasteur later prepared a solution of only racemic acid and found that it itself contained salt crystals with chirality and which affected light differently. This was somewhat lucky because the type of salt crystals that Pasteur was studying (sodium ammonium salt of racemic acid) is one of few salts that would be visibly different in Pasteur's time. Moreover, the salts only differentiate if the solution reaches a temperature below {{convert|26|C|F}}; Pasteur did not know about this temperature requirement, but he did happen to store the solution on a window sill over night and the cold Paris air activated it.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

====Chicken cholera vaccine====
Pasteur and his assistants had succeeded in isolating a microbe from chickens sick or dead from cholera. Chickens injected with the isolated microbe invariably died — a key element in Pasteur's reasoning that the microbe was responsible for the disease, rather than a result of the disease, as many thought. Pasteur was searching for a method of preventing the disease, but no matter what he did to the "broth" of microbes or to the chickens, all injected chickens died.  Gaughan writes "Finally Pasteur had had enough, he needed a vacation. He told [his assistant] to take care of injecting more chickens with the next batch of bacteria."&lt;ref name=Gaughan/&gt; His assistant neglected the task, electing to go on vacation as well. When the men returned and injected chickens with the batch of bacteria that had sat around for a few weeks, none died, indicating to Pasteur that the batch of bacteria had been ruined. But when those same chickens were injected with a new batch of bacteria, none of them died, while chickens that hadn't previously been injected with the "spoiled" batch all died. Pasteur reasoned that the "attenuated" microbes in the spoiled batch "'used up' something within the body; something that wasn't there for the fully functional bacteria to eat."&lt;ref name=Gaughan/&gt; His explanation was wrong, but his chance creation of attenuated bacteria resulted in the first intentionally created vaccine.&lt;ref name=Gaughan/&gt;

The page lists female [[Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering|Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng)]], elected by the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in the UK.

The '''Royal Academy of Engineering''' (RAEng), founded in 1976, is the youngest of the five [[national academy|national academies]] in the UK. It represents the nation's best practising engineers, innovators and entrepreneurs, who are very often in leading roles in industry, business and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Academy of Engineering: An Introduction|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/strategy-and-finance/raeng-an-introduction-brochure|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fellowship of the RAEng is a national honour, bringing prestige to both the individual and any organisation the Fellow is associated with. In recent years between 50 and 60 new Fellows have been chosen each year by peer review from nominations made by the current Fellowship;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fellowship|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those proposed for Fellowship must come “from among eminent engineers regarded by virtue of their personal achievements in the field of engineering as being of exceptional merit and distinction”.&lt;ref name="Statutes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter, Statutes, Regulations|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/raeng-charter-statutes-regulations|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All 130 of the Founding Fellows in 1976 were men. Four women were elected in the first 20 years, the first in 1982. In all, 13 female Fellows pre-date 2000, with a further 23 elected before 2010. In 2010 the Council determined a policy that over time 10-20% of newly elected Fellows should be women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAEng Newsletter Autumn 2010|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/newsletters/autumn-newsletter-2010|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Academy currently has a diversity policy and staff appointed to pursue it, both within the institution and across the engineering profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversity and the Academy|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/policy/diversity-in-engineering/diversity-and-the-academy|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, 85 women have been elected to Fellowship, plus six International Fellows, two Honorary Fellows and one Royal Fellow. Female engineers make up 4% of the total current Fellowship.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Academy|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/introduction-to-the-academy/history-of-the-academy-(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Lone Signal''' was a [[crowdfunded]] [[active SETI]] project designed to send messages from [[Earth]] to a possible [[extraterrestrial civilization]]. Founded by businessman Pierre Fabre and supported by several entrepreneurs, Lone Signal was based at the [[Jamesburg Earth Station]] in [[Carmel, California]].&lt;ref name=gohring-2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Lone Signal aims to send "hello!" tweets to extraterrestrials |last=Gohring |first=Nancy |agency=[[CNN]] |publisher=[[CNNMoney]] |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/17/technology/enterprise/lone-signal/index.html |date={{Date|2013-6-17|mdy}} |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hk9s9TD4?url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/17/technology/enterprise/lone-signal/index.html |archivedate=June 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's beacon, which commenced continuous operations on June 17, 2013, transmitted short, 144-character messages by citizens of Earth to the [[red dwarf]] star [[Gliese 526]], located 17.6 light-years away from Earth in the constellation [[Boötes]].&lt;ref name=simbad&gt;{{cite simbad|title=GJ 526|accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lone Signal team hoped to earn {{US$|100|link=yes}}&amp;nbsp;million to construct a network of dishes across the Earth's surface, beaming messages to many regions of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.&lt;ref name=gohring-2013 /&gt; The project ceased transmission shortly after it began, due to lack of funding.

==Message components==
Lone Signal's message consists of two key components, a background hailing component and a more complex message component. The hailing component, designed by planetary scientist Michael W. Busch, uses a universal binary encoding system, which goes through an [[octal]] intermediary, representing numbers, mathematical operators, or other symbols.&lt;ref name=setup&gt;{{cite news|title=Lone Signal &amp; Jamesburg Earth Station Technologies - Technical Setup |first= |last= |publisher=Lone Signal |date= |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/lonesignal-prod-web/Lone+Signal+Technical+Setup_06042013.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ik4qwRQ5?url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/lonesignal-prod-web/Lone%2BSignal%2BTechnical%2BSetup_06042013.pdf |archivedate=August 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each value corresponds to a single unique frequency. The offsets between those frequencies are set to be much larger than the bit rate (i.e. if transmitting at 100&amp;nbsp;Hz, the offsets between adjacent frequencies will be ~300&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref name=setup /&gt; Using these code blocks, coherent mathematical statements about the laws of physics and Earth's location in the galaxy are produced. The hailing message repeats on average three times in order to allow the recipient to decode it at any time when observation begins, with some parts repeating more often than others. The hailing component was designed to be easily decoded by an extraterrestrial civilization, which was confirmed by a [[double-blind experiment]].&lt;ref name="Busch-Reddick" /&gt;

The hailing component is not an end in itself, but is designed to be a "[[Rosetta Stone]]" toward understanding the more complex message component, consisting of brief, 144-character statements by the general public.&lt;ref name=encoding&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lonesignal.com/about/encoding |title=Message Encoding – But, Can They Read It? |publisher=Lone Signal |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These messages, with widely varying languages and contents, were posted from the Lone Signal website.&lt;ref name=gohring-2013 /&gt; Individuals who have signed up to send messages with Lone Signal, collectively known as the "beaming community", were permitted to send one message for free, and thereafter required to purchase "message credits" of $0.25 per message sent in order to fund the operation of the project.&lt;ref&gt;

== Potential dangers and detectability ==
Various commentators have identified several dangers with messaging extraterrestrial intelligence, which chief scientific officer Jacob Haqq-Misra covered in a 2013 paper before joining Lone Signal. In his paper, Haqq-Misra stated that while ordinary communication which might involve inadvertent leakage into space would not pose a threat, the dangers of actively beaming messages to extraterrestrial intelligences, and hence a determination of whether or not such beaming activities should be carried out, are uncertain.&lt;ref name=haqq-misra-2013&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Haqq-Misra | first1 = J. | last2 = Busch | first2 = M. W. | last3 = Som | first3 = S. M. | last4 = Baum | first4 = S. D. | title = The benefits and harm of transmitting into space | doi = 10.1016/j.spacepol.2012.11.006 | journal = Space Policy | volume = 29 | pages = 40 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon becoming an executive of Lone Signal, Haqq-Misra stated his belief that extraterrestrial civilizations probably already know of humanity's existence, and reaffirmed his position that the [[cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact]] is unknowable. He based this belief on the fact that various other radio sources have been broadcasting into space for decades, and would be detectable to any civilization with sufficiently large radio telescopes.&lt;ref name=kramer-2013 /&gt; For example, the hailing message sent by Lone Signal would be detectable with an array area of {{convert|50|m2}}, and the message portion would be detectable by a telescope with {{convert|10|km2}} of collecting area; by contrast, humanity's most powerful signals, from military radars and the [[Arecibo Observatory]], could be detected with a small, {{convert|1|m2}} antenna.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} At the same time, though, the previous messages from the most powerful beaming sources were intermittent, while Lone Signal aimed to establish the first continuous beam to space.&lt;ref name=atkinson-2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/102844/lone-signal-first-continous-message-beacon-to-find-and-say-hello-to-an-extraterrestrial-civilization/ |title=Lone Signal: First {{sic|nolink=y|Contin|ous|expected=Continuous}} Message Beacon to Find and Say Hello to an Extraterrestrial Civilization |publisher=[[Universe Today]] |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Openpolar.jpg|thumb|300px|Silas Bent's 1872 map of the supposed "Open Polar Sea"]]
The '''Open Polar Sea''' was a hypothesized ice-free ocean surrounding the [[North Pole]].  This unproven (and eventually disproved) theory was once so widely believed that many exploring expeditions used it as justification for attempts to reach the [[North Pole]] by sea, or to find a navigable sea route between Europe and the Pacific across the North Pole.

==History==
The theory that the north polar region might be a practical sea route goes back to at least the 16th century when it was suggested by Robert Thorne.  Explorers [[William Barents]] and [[Henry Hudson]] also believed in the Open Polar Sea.  For a time, the theory was put aside due to the practical experience of navigators who encountered impenetrable ice as they went north.  But the idea was revived again in the mid-19th century by theoretical geographers such as [[Matthew F. Maury]] and [[August Petermann]].  At this time, interest in polar exploration was high due to the search for [[John Franklin]]'s missing expedition, and many would-be polar explorers took up the theory, including [[Elisha Kent Kane]], Dr. [[Isaac Israel Hayes]], and [[George Washington De Long]].  It was believed that once a ship broke through the regions of thick ice that had stopped previous explorers, a temperate sea would be found beyond it.

==Arguments for the theory==
Although today we know that the North Pole was covered with thick ice for much of the period, the theory of the Open Polar Sea was popular in the 16th–19th centuries and many arguments were made to justify its existence:

* Since [[sea ice]] only forms in proximity to land (now known to be a false theory itself), if there were no land near the North Pole, there would be no ice.
* Since there is perpetual sun during the Arctic summer, it would melt all the ice.
* Russian explorers found large areas of open water north of [[Spitzbergen]], so surely there were other areas of open water elsewhere.
* Maury, Petermann, and other scientists who studied [[ocean currents]] in the 19th century hypothesized that warm northward currents such as the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[Kuroshio Current]] must rise to the surface and result in an ice-free sea near the pole.
* [[Extrapolation]] of temperature readings taken in subpolar regions indicated that the region of greatest cold would be at about 80° north instead of at the pole.
* Migration patterns of certain animals seemed to suggest that the polar region was a hospitable place for them to live.

==Disproof and re-emergence==
[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Arctic shrinkage]] as of 2007 compared to previous years]]
The Open Polar Sea theory was debunked gradually by the failure of the expeditions in the 1810s through the 1880s to navigate the polar sea. Reports of open water by earlier explorers, such as [[Elisha Kent Kane]] and [[Isaac Israel Hayes]], fueled optimism in the theory in the 1850s and 1860s. Support faded when [[George W. De Long]] [[Jeannette Expedition|sailed]] {{USS|Jeannette|1878|6}} into the [[Bering Strait]] hoping to find an open 'gateway' to the North Pole and was met by a sea of ice. After a long drift, pack ice crushed the ''Jeannette'' and her survivors returned home with first hand accounts of an ice-covered polar sea. Other explorers such as British explorer [[George Nares]] confirmed this.  By the time [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[Otto Sverdrup]] drifted through the polar ice pack in ''[[Fram]]'' in 1893–1895, the Open Polar Sea theory was defunct.

Nevertheless, scientific studies of [[global warming|climate change]] in the 2000s project that by the end of the 21st century, the annual summer withdrawal of the polar ice cap could expose large areas of the Arctic Ocean as open water, and an ice-free Arctic is possible in the future due to [[Arctic shrinkage]].  Although the North Pole itself could potentially remain ice-covered in winter, a navigable seasonal sea passage from Europe to the Pacific could develop along the north coast of Asia.

Within the fields of [[egalitarianism|equality]], [[multiculturalism|diversity]], and inclusion, the '''people accounting hypothesis''' is a [[Social psychology|social psychological]] [[theory]] based on [[Social categories|social categorization]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al., 2009, p.254.&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as “a [[hypothesis]] that describes how a simple numerical imbalance in representation along nominal social category lines can affect people’s choice of candidates in highly competitive situations (e.g., awards, jobs, etc.)”.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia &amp; Ybarra, 2007, p.802.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The people accounting hypothesis can be derived from connecting social categorization, fairness, and choice literatures.  When a numerical imbalance between social categories is recognized by individuals, the “social categorization and fairness literature clearly suggests that the concern for fairness shifts from the interpersonal to the intergroup level, prompting individuals to correct an imbalance by promoting equality between groups”.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia &amp; Ybarra, 2007, p.803.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic of the people accounting hypothesis is that while it can be caused by many different nominal social category lines, in the end it is “more likely to be triggered on a meaningful social category dimension versus a less meaningful one”. It should also be stressed that the significance of a social category line is “context specific”.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al., 2009, p.258.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Furthermore, there are implications of the people accounting hypothesis toward the [[affirmative action]] [[public policy|policy discussion]].{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} Observers note that “people accounting explains a much broader aversion to [[social inequality|imbalance]] across social category lines” than affirmative action programs that try to promote diversity and overcome past inequalities&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al., 2009, p.259.&lt;/ref&gt; By examining the people accounting hypothesis, they want to address a far broader phenomenon than the “narrow policy of affirmative action”&lt;ref&gt;Garcia &amp; Ybarra, 2007, p.802.&lt;/ref&gt; and examine its tendency towards equality that goes beyond [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al., 2009, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the people accounting hypothesis only works under two conditions: It requires an objective perspective of third parties and the acknowledgment of an imbalance along gender lines. If third parties do not recognize a numerical imbalance between social categories – be it on purpose or not – or “are partial to one category in the dispute, people accounting will not take place”,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al., 2009, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst cautioning that “there are undoubtedly individual differences in what people perceive as an imbalance”.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al., 2009, p.259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the assumption of an impartial, objective assessment of third-party observers should be questioned. It is difficult to find third-party observers with a totally impartial perspective. Since every person acts in a certain context and has his own background and [[Social relation|interconnections]] with other people, there is no such thing as an impartial third-party observer.

==Empirical analyses==
Garcia and Ybarra conducted a series of [[empirical study|empirical studies]] where they tested the people accounting hypothesis. Based on these findings, the focus of their analysis was that if there is an alleged imbalance along social category lines, then not everybody will have [[Equal employment opportunity|equal opportunities in the workplace]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al., 2009, p.258.&lt;/ref&gt; Garcia and his colleagues conclude that “to the extent that a social category is overrepresented, the winning chances for a member from an over-represented category will drop at the discretion of impartial third parties”. This process is explained by the fact that impartial third-party observers are reluctant to create inequalities along social category lines, and therefore feel pressure to categorically deny the overrepresented social category equal opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al., 2009, p.257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garcia et al. also critically observe that “people accounting does not always result in the final selection of members of underrepresented social category groups”. There are many other possible reasons why not everyone will have the same opportunity in the workplace (e.g., [[ingroup favoritism]]). Garcia and his colleagues focus on the perspective of impartial third-party observers and the psychological aspects of [[social class|social categorization]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al., 2009, p.258.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">In [[linguistics]], a '''polarity item''' is a [[lexical item]] that can appear only in environments associated with a particular [[grammatical polarity]] – affirmative or negative. A polarity item that appears in [[affirmative (linguistics)|affirmative]] (positive) contexts is called a '''positive polarity item''' (PPI), and one that appears in negative contexts is a '''negative polarity item''' (NPI).

The environment in which a polarity item is permitted to appear is called a "'''licensing context'''". In the simplest case, an affirmative statement provides a licensing context for a PPI, while negation provides a licensing context for an NPI. However, there are many complications, and not all polarity items of a given type need necessarily have exactly the same set of licensing contexts.

==In English==
As examples of polarity items, consider the [[English grammar|English]] lexical items ''somewhat'' and ''at all'', as used in the following sentences:
# I liked the film somewhat.
# I didn't like the film at all.
# *I liked the film at all.
# *I didn't like the film somewhat.

As can be seen, ''somewhat'' is licensed by the affirmative environment of sentence (1), but it is forbidden (anti-licensed) by the negative environment of sentence (4).&lt;ref&gt;See Baker (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; It can therefore be considered to be a positive polarity item (PPI). On the other hand, ''at all'' is licensed by the negative environment of sentence (2), but anti-licensed by the positive environment of sentence (3), and is therefore considered a negative polarity item (NPI). 

Because standard English does not have negative concord, that is, [[double negative]]s are not used to intensify each other, the language makes frequent use of certain NPIs that correspond in meaning to negative items, and can be used in the environment of another negative. For example, ''anywhere'' is an NPI corresponding to the negative ''nowhere'', as used in the following sentences:
# I was going nowhere. (the negative ''nowhere'' is used when not preceded by another negative)
# I was not going anywhere. (the NPI ''anywhere'' is used in the environment of the preceding negative ''not'')
Note that the alternative form with the double negative, *''I was not going nowhere'', is ungrammatical in the standard language, although such forms are used in some colloquial English, and parallel the constructions used in certain other languages which have negative concord. (Note also that ''anywhere'', like most of the other NPIs listed below, is also used in other senses where it is not an NPI, as in ''I would go anywhere with you''.) Similar pairs of negatives and corresponding NPI are listed below.
*nobody/no one – anybody/anyone
*nothing – anything
*no/none – any
*never – ever
*nowhere – anywhere
*no longer/no more – any longer/any more

==Determination of licensing contexts==
The actual set of contexts that license particular polarity items is not as easily defined as a simple distinction between affirmative and negative sentences. Baker&lt;ref&gt;See Baker (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; noted that [[double negative|double negation]] may provide an acceptable context for positive  polarity items:

: I can't believe you don't fancy her somewhat.

: John doesn't have any potatoes
: *John has any potatoes.

However, licensing contexts can take many forms besides simple negation/affirmation. To complicate matters, polarity items appear to be highly idiosyncratic, each with its own set of licensing contexts.

Early discussion of polarity items can be found in the work of [[Otto Jespersen]] and [[Edward Klima]]. Much of the research on polarity items has centered around the question of what creates a negative context. In the late 1970s, William Ladusaw (building on work by [[Gilles Fauconnier]]) discovered that most English NPIs are licensed in [[downward entailing]] environments. This is known as the [[Fauconnier–Ladusaw hypothesis]]. A downward entailing environment, however, is not a necessary condition for an NPI to be licensed—they may be licensed by some non-monotone (and thus not downward entailing) contexts, like "exactly N", as well. 
: *Some people have ever been on the moon.
: Exactly three people have ever been on the moon.
Nor is a downward entailing environment a sufficient condition for all negative polarity items, as first pointed out by Zwarts (1981) for Dutch "ook maar".

Licensing contexts across languages include the scope of n-words (negative [[grammatical particle|particles]], negative [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]]), the [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] of [[indicative conditional|conditionals]], [[question]]s, the [[Restrictor (linguistics)|restrictor]] of universal quantifiers, non-affirmative verbs (doubt), adversative predicates (be surprised), negative [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] (without), [[comparative]]s and [[superlative]]s, ''too''-phrases, negative predicates (unlikely), some [[subjunctive]] [[complement (linguistics)|complements]], some disjunctions, [[imperative mood|imperatives]], and others (finally, only). Given this wide range of mostly non-downward entailing environments, the Fauconnier-Ladusaw Hypothesis has gradually been replaced in favor of theories based on the notion of [[nonveridicality]] (proposed by [[Frans Zwarts|Zwarts]] and Giannakidou).

Different NPIs may be licensed by different expressions. Thus, while the NPI ''anything'' is licensed by the [[downward entailing]] expression ''at most two of the visitors'', the [[idiom]]atic NPI ''lift a finger'' (known as a "minimizer") is not licensed by the same expression.

: At most two of the visitors had seen anything.
: *At most two of the visitors lifted a finger to help.

While NPIs have been discovered in many languages, their distribution is subject to substantial cross-linguistic variation; this aspect of NPIs is currently the subject of ongoing research in cross-linguistic semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Giannakidou, Anastasia.

'''''Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy''''' ({{lang-de|Zur Soziologie des Parteiwesens in der modernen Demokratie; Untersuchungen über die oligarchischen Tendenzen des Gruppenlebens}}) is a book by the sociologist [[Robert Michels]], published in 1911 and first introducing the concept of [[iron law of oligarchy]]. It is considered one of the classics of [[social sciences]], in particular sociology and [[political science]].{{sfnm |1a1=Hughes |1a2=Sharrock |1a3=Martin |1y=2003 |1p=127 |2a1=Lipset |2y=1999 |2pp=20–21}} It was translated to Italian as ''Sociologia del partito politico nella democrazia moderna: studi sulle tendenze oligarchiche degli aggregati politici'' by Alfredo Polledro in 1912, and then translated from the Italian to English by [[Eden Paul]] and [[Cedar Paul]] for Hearst's International Library Co. in 1915.{{sfn|Rovira i Virgili|2012|p=37}}

This work analyses the [[power structure]]s of organizations such as [[political parties]] and trade unions. Michels's main argument is that all organizations, even those in theory most egalitarian and most committed to democracy&amp;nbsp;– like [[socialist]] political parties&amp;nbsp;– are in fact [[oligarchical]], and dominated by a small group of leadership. The book also provides a first systematic analysis of how a radical political party loses its radical goals under the dynamics of electoral participation. The origins of [[moderation theory]] can be found in this analysis.

==Synopsis==
Michels put forward a thesis about incompatibility of democracy and large-scale social organizations. He observed that contrary to democratic and egalitarian principles, both society in general, and specific organizations in particular are dominated by the leadership&amp;nbsp;– the [[oligarchy]].{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=15}} This, according to Michels, was not because of any particular weakness of a particular society or organization in question, but a characteristic of any and all complex [[social system]]s.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=15}} Such social systems have to be organized along the [[bureaucratic]] principles, and bureaucracies inevitably develop oligarchies. Michels concluded that in any complex organization, and such dominate the modern world, it is impossible to escape domination of oligarchy - a conclusion which became known as the [[iron law of oligarchy]].{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=15}}

{{Cquote|"Who says organization, says oligarchy"}}

The iron law of oligarchy is based on the following logic. First, any large scale organization will necessitate the development of bureaucracy for efficient administration.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=16}} Such leaders will amass resources (superior knowledge control over the formal means of communication with the membership, and the skill in the art of politics) given them power at the expense of rank and file members.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=16}}

{{Cquote|"Large-scale organizations give their officers a near monopoly of power"}}

Second, Michels expressed doubts about whether the rank and file possess the skills necessary to compete with the leaders, a concept he phrased as the "incompetence of the masses". In order to prevent the development of an oligarchy, the regular members must be involved in various activities of the organizations; however, reality of time constrains due to work, family and leisure will reduce the amount of time that most such members are willing to dedicate to active involvement in organizational activities and politics. This is compounded by the rank and file lack of education, and corresponding sophistication of the leadership.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=17}}

{{Cquote|"The masses are incapable of taking part in the decision-making process and desire strong leadership."}}

In his case study of his contemporary [[socialist]] [[political party|parties]], primarily the [[German Social Democratic Party]]. It was radical organization in his time, fighting for novel concepts such as adult [[suffrage]], [[free speech]], and popular participation in the government.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=15}} Michels described how their political program was overshadowed by the expansion of the organization favoured by the administrative bureaucracy.{{sfnm |1a1=Hughes |1a2=Sharrock |1a3=Martin |1y=2003 |1p=127 |2a1=Lipset |2y=1999 |2p=15}} This, Michels observed, can be explained thus: "it is far from obvious that the interests of the masses which have combined to form the party will coincide with the interests of the bureaucracy in which the party becomes personified."{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=18}} Michels noted that if an organization dedicated to such principles failed to realize its democratic ideals in its own governance, it is unlikely that other organizations, even less concerned with such lofty goals, would be able to function as democracies.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=16}}

{{cquote|"The socialists might conquer, but not socialism, which would perish in the moment of its adherents' triumph"}}

==Significance==
Michels book quickly became a classic of [[social sciences]].{{sfn|Lipset|1999|pp=20–21}} His theory was quickly vindicated on a large scale during [[First World War]], when most socialist parties of that time endorsed the war policies of their respective governments, thus showing that their corresponding party leaders put the short-term goals of organizational survival (allying with the state) over doctrinal points of "[[proletariat]] against [[bourgeoisie]]".{{sfn|Lipset|1999|pp=19–20}}

[[Sigmund Neumann]] said that "the study of sociology of political parties have been completely dominated by Robert Michels' iron law of [oligarchy]."{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=21}} Michels work significantly influenced the views on political party theory by his friend and one of the founding fathers of sociology, [[Max Weber]].{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=21}} A number of other theorists of political parties acknowledged that this work was a major influence on theirs, including [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]], [[Maurice Duverger]], and [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie]], among others.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|pp=21–22}}

Beyond political parties, Michels work was used to explain the functioning of numerous other voluntary organizations from [[trade union]]s to [[medical association]]s.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|pp=22, 24}} His theories are also seen as being applicable and influential to the [[sociology of organizations|study of all organizations in general]], as well as theories of bureaucracy.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=24}}

==Criticism==
Michel's argument has been criticized for being over-deterministic and overly critical of bureaucracy.{{sfn|Lipset|1999|p=27}}

==Quotes==
* "A party of the landed gentry which should appeal only to the members of its own class and to those of identical economic interests, would not win a single seat, would not send a single representative to parliament. A conservative candidate who should present himself to his electors by declaring to them that he did not regard them as capable of playing an active part in influencing the destinies of the country, and should tell them that for this reason they ought to be deprived of the suffrage, would be a man of incomparable sincerity, but politically insane."

'''RasMol''' is a computer program written for [[molecular graphics]] visualization intended and used mainly to depict and explore [[Structural biology|biological macromolecule structures]], such as those found in the [[Protein Data Bank]]. It was originally developed by Roger Sayle in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sayle and E. James Milner-White. "RasMol: Biomolecular graphics for all", Trends in Biochemical Sciences (TIBS), September 1995, Vol. 20, No. 9, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, it was an important tool for molecular biologists since the extremely optimized program allowed the software to run on (then) modestly powerful [[personal computer]]s. Before RasMol, visualization software ran on graphics workstations that, due to their cost, were less accessible to scholars. RasMol continues to be important for research in structural biology, and has become important in education.

RasMol has a complex [[Software license|licensing]] version history. Starting with the version 2.7 series,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert J. Bernstein, "Recent changes to RasMol, recombining the variants, Trends in Biochemical Sciences (TIBS), September 2000, Vol. 25, No. 9, pp. 453-455&lt;/ref&gt; RasMol [[source code]] is [[Multi-licensing|dual-licensed]] under a [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), or custom license ''RASLIC''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/RasMol_2.7.3/doc/RASLIC RASLIC license]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with version 2.7.5, a GPL is the only license valid for binary distributions.

RasMol includes a [[scripting language]], to perform many functions such as selecting certain [[protein]] chains, changing colors, etc. [[Jmol]] and [[Sirius visualization software|Sirius]] software have incorporated this language into their commands.

[[Protein Data Bank (file format)|Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) files can be downloaded for visualization from members of the [[Worldwide Protein Data Bank]] (wwPDB). These have been uploaded by researchers who have characterized the structure of [[molecule]]s usually by [[X-ray crystallography]], [[protein NMR]] spectroscopy, or [[cryo-electron microscopy]].

==Interprocess communication==
Rasmol can communicate with other programs via [[Tcl]]/[[Tk (software)|Tk]] on [[Unix]] platforms, and via [[Dynamic Data Exchange]] (DDE) on [[Microsoft Windows]].

With a [[multiple sequence alignment]] program, the responsible Java class can be freely used in other applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3d-alignment.eu/ Multiple alignment program]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1342">'''Researchers Alliance for Development (RAD)''' is a [[World Bank]] supported action-oriented and [[multidisciplinary]] network of [[researcher]]s. Recognizing the engagement of academia in the global intellectual debate on development cooperation, the RAD aims to strengthen the interaction between the World Bank and the research community worldwide. It is headed by a steering committee of academics and many major universities over the world are its members.

RAD objectives include:
1. Facilitating interaction between the academic community and the World Bank; 
2. Mobilizing the academic and student community on development issues and curricula, facilitating mutual flow of knowledge. 

Towards these ends, it runs a number of activities including a student essay prize, a post/doctoral workshop on international organisations and development as well as working groups on an ad hoc basis.

'''Risk score''' (or '''risk scoring''') is the name given to a general practice in applied [[statistics]], [[Biostatistics|bio-statistics]], [[econometrics]] and other related disciplines, of creating an easily calculated number (the '''score''') that reflects the level of [[risk]] in the presence of some [[risk factor]]s (e.g. risk of mortality or disease in the presence of symptoms or genetic profile, risk financial loss considering credit and financial history, etc.). 

Risk scores are designed to be: 
* Simple to calculate: In many cases all you need to calculate a score is nothing a pen and a piece of paper (although [[QRISK|some]] scores use rely on more sophisticated or less transparent calculations that require a computer program).
* Easily interpreted: The result of the calculation is a single number, and higher score usually means higher risk. Furthermore, many scoring methods enforce some form of [[Monotonic_function|monotonicity]] along the measured risk factors to allow a straight forward interpretation of the score (e.g. risk of mortality only increases with age, risk of payment default only increase with the amount of total debt the customer has, etc.).
* Actionable: Scores are designed around a set of possible actions that should be taken as a result of the calculated score. Effective score-based policies can be designed and executed by setting thresholds on the value of the score and associating them with escalating actions. 

== Formal definition == 
A typical scoring method is composed of 3 components:
# A set of consistent rules (or weights) that assign a numerical value ("points") to each risk factor that reflect our estimation of underlying risk.
# A formula (typically a simple sum of all accumulated points) that calculates the score.
# A set of thresholds that helps to translate the calculated score into a level of risk, or an equivalent formula or set of rules to translate the calculated score back into probabilities (leaving the nominal evaluation of severity to the practitioner0.

Items 1 &amp; 2 can be achieved by using some form of [[Regression_analysis|regression]], that will provide both the risk estimation and the formula to calculate the score. Item 3 requires setting an arbitrary set of thresholds and will usually involve expert opinion. 

=== Estimating risk with GLM ===
Risk score are designed to represent an underlying probability of an adverse event denoted &lt;math&gt; \lbrace Y = 1 \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; given a vector of &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; [[explaining variables]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; containing measurements of the relevant risk factors. In order to establish the connection between the risk factors and the probability we estimate a set of weights &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is estimated using a [[generalized linear model]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}(\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{X}) = \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{Y} = 1 | \mathbf{X}) = g^{-1}(\mathbf{X} \beta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued, monotonically increasing function that maps the values of the  [[Generalized_linear_model#Linear_predictor|linear predictor]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} \beta &lt;/math&gt; to the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt;. GLM methods typically uses the [[logit]] or [[probit]] as the [[Generalized_linear_model#Link_function|link function]].

==== Estimating risk with other methods ====
While it's possible to estimate &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{Y} = 1 | \mathbf{X}) &lt;/math&gt; using other statistical or machine learning methods, the requirements of simplicity and easy interpretation (and monotonicity per risk factor) make most of these methods difficult to use for scoring in this context:
* With more sophisticated methods it becomes difficult to attribute simple weights for each risk factor and to provide a simple formula for the calculation of the score. A notable exception are tree-based methods like [[Classification_and_regression_tree|CART]], that can provide a simple set of decision rules and calculations, but cannot ensure the monotonicity of the scale across the different risk factors.
* The fact that we are estimating underlying risk across the population, and therefore cannot tag people in advance on an ordinal scale (we can't know in advance if a person belongs to a "high risk" group, we only see observed incidences) [[Statistical_classification|classification]] methods are only relevant if we want to classify people into 2 groups or 2 possible actions. 

=== Constructing the score ===
When using GLM, the set of estimated weights &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; can be used to assign different values (or "points") to different values of the risk factors in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; (continuous or nominal as indicators). The score can then be expressed as a weighted sum:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{Score} = \mathbf{X} \beta = \sum_{j=1}^{P} \mathbf{X}_{j} \beta_{j}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* While some scoring methods use the values of the score "as is", some scoring methods (e.g. [[ABCD²_score|ABCD²]] score) will translate the score into probabilities by using &lt;math&gt; g^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; or a look-up table. This makes the process of obtaining the score more complicated computationally but has the advantage of translating an arbitrary number to a more familiar scale of 0 to 1.
* The columns of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; can represent complex transformations of the risk factors (including multiple [[Interaction_(statistics)|interactions]]) and not just the risk factors themselves.
* The values of &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; are sometimes scaled or rounded to allow working with integers instead of very small fractions (making the calculation simpler). While scaling has no impact ability of the score to estimate risk, rounding has the potential of disrupting the "optimality" of the GLM estimation. 

=== Making score-based decisions ===
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \lbrace \mathbf{a}_{1}, ... ,\mathbf{a}_{m} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; denote a set of &lt;math&gt; m \geq 2 &lt;/math&gt; "escalating" actions available for the decision maker (e.g. for credit risk decisions:  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_{1} &lt;/math&gt; = "approve automatically", &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_{2} &lt;/math&gt; = "require more documentation and check manually", &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_{3} &lt;/math&gt; = "decline automatically"). In order to define a decision rule, we want to define a map between different values of the score and the possible decisions in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; \tau = \lbrace \tau_1, ... \tau_{m-1} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; be a [[Partition_of_an_interval|partition]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; consecutive, non-overlapping intervals, such that &lt;math&gt; \tau_1 &lt; \tau_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; \tau_{m-1} &lt;/math&gt;. 

The map is defined as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{If Score} \in [\tau_{j-1},\tau_{j}) \rightarrow \text{Take action } \mathbf{a}_{j}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* The values of &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; are set based on expert opinion, the type and prevalence of the measured risk, consequences of miss-classification, etc. For example, a risk of 9 out of 10 will usually be considered as "high risk", but a risk of 7 out of 10 can be considered either "high risk" or "medium risk" depending on context. 
* The definition of the intervals is on right open-ended intervals but can be equivalently defined using left open ended intervals &lt;math&gt; (\tau_{j-1},\tau_{j}] &lt;/math&gt;.
* For scoring methods that are already translated the score into probabilities we either define the partition &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; directly on the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; or translate the decision criteria into &lt;math&gt; [g^{-1}(\tau_{j-1}),g^{-1}(\tau_{j})) &lt;/math&gt;, and the monotonicity of &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; ensures a 1-to-1 translation.

== Examples ==
=== Biostatistics ===
Some notable examples, taken from the category page [[:Category:Medical_scoring_system]]:
* [[Framingham Risk Score]]
* [[QRISK]]
* [[TIMI]]
* [[Rockall score]]
* [[ABCD² score]]
* [[CHA2DS2–VASc score]]

=== Financial industry ===
The primary use of scores in the financial sector is for [[Credit scorecards]], or [[Credit_score|credit scores]]: 
* In many countries (such as the [[Credit_score_in_the_United_States|US]]) credit score are calculated by commercial entities and therefore the exact method is not public knowledge (for example the [[Bankruptcy risk score]], [[Credit_score_in_the_United_States#FICO_score|FICO score]] and others). Credit scores in [[Credit_score#Australia|Australia]] and [[Credit_score#United_Kindgom|UK]] are often calculated by using [[Logistic_Regression|logistic regression]] to estimate [[probability of default]], and are therefore a type of risk score.
* Other financial industries, such as the [[Insurance_score|insurance]] industry also use variants of credit score.

[[File:The Weather Station, Ross-on-Wye - geograph.org.uk - 479291.jpg|thumb| The weather station]]
The '''Ross-on-Wye weather station''' is now a fully automated [[weather station]], situated off the Walford Road in [[Ross-on-Wye]], Herefordshire, England.
{{Coord|51.90924|-2.5883|display=title}}

==Tradition==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout the Second World War, it was the '''only volunteer run weather station''' to be accepted by the [[Meteorological Office|Met office]]. Every night throughout the conflict, it was the '''only land-locked station''' to be included in the [[shipping forecast]] on the [[World Service]]. The anecdotes goes that- even when in the Pacific- the soldiers from Ross would know exactly what the weather was like around at their mothers.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Clement Grant Dixon, Physics teacher, [[Ross Grammar School]], 1970.

==History==
Henry Southall (1836-1916), set up a station at 'The Craig, Ross' in 1859.&lt;ref name= rossweather&gt;{{cite web|title=Ross-on-Wye - Weather Station|url=http://www.ross-on-wye.com/index.php?page=ross_250-Weather_Station|website=www.ross-on-wye.com|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in 1860, after the loss of the [[Royal Charter]] in 1859, that [[Robert FitzRoy|Fitzroy]] (1805–1865) used the [[electric telegraph]] to transmit weather data so he might issue storm warnings and in 1861 issue weather forecasts. Importantly Ross was already operating. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The birth of the weather forecast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32483678|website=BBC News|accessdate=15 January 2018|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick James Parsons arrived in Ross in 1912 having previously had his own amateur station when a child. He met up with Southall, and established his own station at Chase Dale in the Chase, Ross. In 1914 he was made a [[Royal Meteorological Society|Fellow of Royal Meteorological Society]] but due to the [[World War I|outbreak of war]] he joined the [[Herefordshire Light Infantry|Herefordshire Territorials]] and was transferred to the [[Royal Engineers]] as one of the first five [[meteorologist]]s to be in the service. The station was maintained in his absence by the landowner, Mrs Purchase. On return he continued to take daily readings until 1964 when he was 72. &lt;ref name= rossweather/&gt;

From 1975 until 1985 the town was without a weather station, but on the initiative of the mayor, Arthur Clarke, it was reopened in May 1985. &lt;ref name="automated"&gt;{{cite web|title=Town's weather station to be fully automated|url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/15571310.Town__39_s_weather_station_to_be_fully_automated/|website=Hereford Times|accessdate=13 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently readings were taken by Howard Ellis, a retired chemist assisted by the husband and wife team, June and Rex Swallow. June Swallow took over the monitoring station in 1995 and continued to take readings until the Summer 2008 when she retired after 23 years.&lt;ref name= rossweather/&gt;
The station was semi-automated but still needed volunteers to take some readings. &lt;ref name="automated"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cain|first1=Rebecca|title=Town's weather station to be fully automated|url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/15571310.Town__39_s_weather_station_to_be_fully_automated/|accessdate=15 January 2018|work=Hereford Times|date=3 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 the station was fully automated.&lt;ref name="automated"/&gt;

==Henry Southall==
Henry Southall was a distinguished meteorologist, a [[Royal Meteorological Society|Fellow of Royal Meteorological Society]] who served as its president. In December 1895, he read his paper on the "Floods in the West Midlands" in which he considered the great floods that had occurred on the rivers [[Severn]], [[River Wye|Wye]], [[River Usk|Usk]] and[[River Avon, Warwickshire| Avon]]. He took data from the River Wye at Ross. He used a rise of {{convert|14|ft|6|in|m}}as measure of a 'primary flood'. He wrote that all the great floods occurred in November and February, and their frequency was decreasing. This he attributed to better drainage in the lower reaches and railway embankments and bridges holding back the surge from the upper reaches. He noted that rainfall had not decreased and he had taken the readings.&lt;ref name= rossweather/&gt;

The floods at Ross were in 
:   1770 - 16 to 18 November
:   1795 - 11 to 12 February
:   1809 - 27 January (exception)
:   1824 - 24 November
:   1831 - 10 February
:   1852 - 8 February &amp; 12 November
:   1894 - 15 November {{convert|14|ft|3|in|m}} a secondary flood.&lt;ref name= rossweather/&gt;

The '''Bakerian Medal''' is one of the premier medals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/premier-awards/|title=Premier Medals of the Royal Society, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Royal Society]] that recognizes exceptional and outstanding science. It comes with a medal award and a prize lecture. The medalist is required to give a lecture on any topic related to [[physical sciences]]. It is awarded annually to individuals in the field of physical sciences, including computer science. 

==History==
The prize was started in 1775, when [[Henry Baker (naturalist)|Henry Baker]] left [[GBP|£]]100 to establish a spoken lecture given by a Fellow of the Royal Society ''on such part of [[natural history]] or [[experimental philosophy]]'' as the Society shall determine. Clearly, this is to deliver a lecture of scientific interests and importance, and encourage sharing of knowledge with others.

'''Spatial planning''' systems refer to the [[Method (software engineering)|methods]] and approaches used by the public and private sector to influence the distribution of people and activities in spaces of various scales. Spatial planning can be defined as the coordination of practices and policies affecting spatial organization. Spatial planning is synonymous with the practices of [[urban planning]] in the United States but at larger scales and the term is often used in reference to planning efforts in European countries. Discrete professional disciplines which involve spatial planning include [[land use planning|land use]], [[urban planning|urban]], [[regional planning|regional]], [[transport planning|transport]] and [[environmental planning]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other related areas are also important, including [[economic planning|economic]] and [[community planning]].  Spatial planning takes place on local, regional, national and inter-national levels and often results in the creation of a spatial plan.

An early definition of spatial planning comes from the European Regional/Spatial Planning Charter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/heritage/cemat/versioncharte/default_EN.asp |title=Council of Europe |publisher=Council of Europe |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often called the 'Torremolinos Charter'), adopted in 1983 by the European Conference of Ministers responsible for Regional Planning (CEMAT): "''Regional/spatial planning gives geographical expression to the economic, social, cultural and ecological policies of society. It is at the same time a scientific discipline, an administrative technique and a policy developed as an interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach directed towards a balanced regional development and the physical organisation of space according to an overall strategy''."

Numerous planning systems exist around the [[world]]. The form of planning largely diverges and co-evolves with societies and their governance systems.&lt;ref&gt;Allmendinger, P. (2009). Planning theory. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Every country, and states within those countries, have a unique planning systems that is made up by different actors, different planning perspectives and a particular institutional framework. Perspectives, actors and institutions change over time, influencing both the form and the impact of spatial planning.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., &amp; Verschraegen, G. (2008). The limits of planning: Niklas Luhmann's systems theory and the analysis of planning and planning ambitions. Planning theory, 7(3), 263-283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunder, M., &amp; Hillier, J. (2009). Planning in ten words or less: A Lacanian entanglement with spatial planning. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd..&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in Northwestern Europe spatial planning has evolved greatly since the late 1950s.

==European spatial planning==

In 1999, a document called the [[European Spatial Development Perspective]] (ESDP) was signed by the ministers responsible for regional planning in the EU member states. Although the ESDP has no binding status, and the [[European Union]] has no formal authority for spatial planning, the ESDP has influenced spatial planning policy in European regions and member states, and placed the coordination of EU sectoral policies on the political agenda.

At the European level, the term [[territorial cohesion]] is becoming more widely used and is for example mentioned in the draft EU Treaty (Constitution) as a shared competency of the European Union; it is also included in the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]. The term was defined in a "scoping document" in Rotterdam in late 2004 and is being elaborated further using empirical data from the ESPON programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espon.eu |title=espon.eu |publisher=espon.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a document entitled "The Territorial State and Perspectives of the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccre.org/docs/territorial_state_and_perspectives.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - TSP-First-Draft-as-of-260606.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the minister's conference in May 2007 in Leipzig, a political document called the "Territorial Agenda" was signed to continue the process begun in [[Rotterdam]], revised in May 2011 in [[Gödöllő|Godollo]].

'''Statistical alchemy''' was a term originated by [[John Maynard Keynes]] to describe [[econometrics]] in 1939. The phrase has subsequently been used by [[Alvan Feinstein]] to describe [[meta-analysis]]. It is generally regarded as a deprecatory term which undermines attempts to present such activities as meeting the rigorous standards of science.

==Econometrics==
Keynes (1939) wrote a review of [[Jan Tinbergen]]'s ''Statistical Testing of Business-Cycle Theories''. Although he praised Tinbergen for his objectivity, he however depicted his methodology as "black magic" which he regarded as essentially untrustworthy. He was unpersuaded that "this brand of ''statistical alchemy'' is ripe to become a branch of science" (emphasis in the original).&lt;ref name="Hendry"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hendry|first1=David|title=Econometrics-Alchemy or Science?|journal=Economica|date=1980|volume=47|issue=188|pages=387–406|doi=10.2307/2553385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often this metaphor is seen as a way of suggesting that econometricians were following a foolhardy pursuit comparable to the [[alchemy|alchemical quest]] of turning base metal into gold. However G. M. P. Swann points out that Keynes was well aware that such eminent early scientists as [[Isaac Newton]]. He rather proposes a more nuanced interpretation of the metaphor as referring to the [[Alkahest]], a universal solvent, which, it was claimed could turn stone into water. He claimed that by restricting econometrics to theory, mathematics and statistics, econometricians had discarded other important applied techniques. Although [[Ragnar Frisch]] had made warnings about this, these had been subsequently ignored by other econometricians who had ended up claiming that econometrics constituted a universal solvent.&lt;ref name="Swann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swann|first1=G. M. P.|title=Putting Econometrics in Its Place: A New Direction in Applied Economics|date=2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Cheltenham|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==Meta-analysis==
Feinstein (1995) published "Meta-analysis: statistical alchemy for the 21st century" where he claimed that in meta-analysis scientific requirements had been removed or destroyed, eliminating the scientific requirements of reproducibility and precision. This was equivalent to a ''free lunch'', comparable to the alchemical transmutation of base metals to gold. [[Detournement|Detourning]] the adage concerning the combination of [[apples and oranges]], Feinstein suggested that meta-analytic mixtures were so heterogeneous that they might be better described as "combining rotten fruits". He argues that meta-analysis violates the [[Bradford Hill criteria]] of consistency as inconsistencies are ignored or buried through the process of  agglomerating the data.

'''''Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene''''' is a 2016 book by [[Donna Haraway]], published by [[Duke University Press]]. In it, Haraway offers "making kin" as a way to consider multiple species and interact in a multiple species world. 

By emphasizing connectedness, ''Staying with the Trouble'' can be thought of as a continuation of major themes from "[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]" and ''[[The Companion Species Manifesto]]''. Haraway's book can also be thought of as a critique of the [[Anthropocene]] as a way of making sense of the present, de-emphasizing human exceptionalism in favor of multispecism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thechart.me/book-review-donna-haraway-staying-with-the-trouble/|title=Book Review: Donna Haraway’s Staying with the Trouble|date=2017-06-21|work=The Chart|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phylogenetics.svg|thumb|400px|A comparison of phylogenetic and phenetic (character-based) concepts]]
Biological '''systematics''' is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the [[Correlation and dependence|relationships]] among living things through time. Relationships are visualized as evolutionary trees (synonyms: [[cladograms]], [[phylogenetic tree]]s, phylogenies).  Phylogenies have two components: branching order (showing group relationships) and branch length (showing amount of evolution).  Phylogenetic trees of species and higher [[taxa]] are used to study the evolution of traits (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the distribution of organisms ([[biogeography]]). Systematics, in other words, is used to understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.

==Branches and applications==
In the study of biological systematics, researchers use the different branches to further understand the relationships between differing organisms. These branches are used to determine the applications and uses for modern day systematics.

Biological systematics classifies species by using three specific branches. ''Numerical systematics'', or ''biometry'', uses biological statistics to identify and classify animals. ''Biochemical systematics'' classifies and identifies animals based on the analysis of the material that makes up the living part of a cell—such as the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[organelle]]s, and [[cytoplasm]]. ''Experimental systematics'' identifies and classifies animals based on the evolutionary units that comprise a species, as well as their importance in evolution itself. Factors such as mutations, genetic divergence, and hybridization all are considered evolutionary units.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/systematics-meaning-branches-and-its-application/32374|title=Systematics: Meaning, Branches and Its Application|date=2016-05-27|work=Biology Discussion|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the specific branches, researchers are able to determine the applications and uses for modern-day systematics. These applications include:   
* Studying the diversity of organisms and the differentiation between extinct and living creatures. Biologists study the well-understood relationships by making many different diagrams and "trees" (cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies, etc.).   
* Including the scientific names of organisms, species descriptions and overviews, taxonomic orders, and classifications of evolutionary and organism histories.
* Explaining the biodiversity of the planet and its organisms. The systematic study is that of conservation. 
* Manipulating and controlling the natural world. This includes the practice of 'biological control', the intentional introduction of natural predators and disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Definition and relation with taxonomy==

[[John Lindley]] provided an early definition of systematics in 1830, although he wrote of "systematic botany" rather than using the term "systematics".&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, J. S. ''[http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ What is systematics and what is taxonomy?]''. Available on http://evolvingthoughts.net&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970  Michener ''et al.'' defined "systematic biology" and "[[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]" (terms that are often confused and used interchangeably) in relationship to one another as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Michener, Charles D., John O. Corliss, Richard S. Cowan, Peter H. Raven, Curtis W. Sabrosky, Donald S. Squires, and G. W. Wharton (1970). ''Systematics In Support of Biological Research''. Division of Biology and Agriculture, National Research Council. Washington, D.C. 25 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Systematic biology (hereafter called simply systematics) is the field that (a) provides scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c) preserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations. This is a field with a long history that in recent years has experienced a notable renaissance, principally with respect to theoretical content. Part of the theoretical material has to do with evolutionary areas (topics e and f above), the rest relates especially to the problem of classification. Taxonomy is that part of Systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taxonomy, systematic biology, systematics, biosystematics, scientific classification, biological classification, phylogenetics: At various times in history, all these words have had overlapping, related meanings.  However, in modern usage, they can all be considered synonyms of each other.

For example, Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary of 1987 treats "classification", "taxonomy", and "systematics" as synonyms. According to this work, the terms originated in 1790, c. 1828, and in 1888 respectively. Some{{who|date=July 2013}} claim systematics alone deals specifically with relationships through time, and that it can be synonymous with [[phylogenetics]], broadly dealing with the inferred hierarchy{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} of organisms.  This means it would be a subset of taxonomy as it is sometimes regarded, but the inverse is claimed by others.{{who|date=July 2013}}

Europeans tend to use the terms "systematics" and "biosystematics" for the study of biodiversity as a whole, whereas North Americans tend to use "taxonomy" more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Brusca, R. C., &amp; Brusca, G. J. (2003). Invertebrates (2nd ed.). Sunderland, Mass. : Sinauer Associates, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; However, taxonomy, and in particular [[alpha taxonomy]], is more specifically the identification, description, and naming (i.e. nomenclature) of organisms,&lt;ref name="Fortey"&gt;
{{Citation |last= Fortey |first= Richard |author-link= Richard Fortey 
|year=2008
|title= Dry Store Room No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum |publication-place= London 
|publisher= Harper Perennial |isbn= 978-0-00-720989-7 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
while "classification" focuses on placing organisms within hierarchical groups that show their relationships to other organisms.  All of these biological disciplines can deal with both [[extinct]] and [[extant taxon|extant]] organisms.

Systematics uses taxonomy as a primary tool in understanding, as nothing about an organism's relationships with other living things can be understood without it first being properly studied and described in sufficient detail to identify and classify it correctly.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Scientific classifications are aids in recording and reporting information to other scientists and to laymen.  The '''systematist''', a scientist who specializes in systematics, must, therefore, be able to use existing classification systems, or at least know them well enough to skilfully justify not using them.

[[Phenetics]] was an attempt to determine the relationships of organisms through a measure of overall similarity, making no distinction between [[plesiomorph]]ies (shared ancestral traits) and [[apomorph]]ies (derived traits). From the late-20th century onwards, it was superseded by [[cladistics]], which rejects plesiomorphies in attempting to resolve the [[phylogeny]] of Earth's various organisms through time.  {{As of | 2014 | alt = Today's}} systematists generally make extensive use of [[molecular biology]] and of [[computer programs]] to study organisms.

==Difference between taxonomy and systematics==
taxonomy is the study of classification and nomenclature but phylogenetic and evolutionary relations are studied in systematics.

==Taxonomic characters==
Taxonomic characters are the taxonomic attributes that can be used to provide the evidence from which relationships (the [[phylogeny]]) between taxa  are inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1991). Principles of Systematic Zoology. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinds of taxonomic characters:&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1991), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WISE J004945.61+215120.0''' is a [[brown dwarf]] of [[spectral class]] T8.5,{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}} located in constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] at approximately 24 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]].{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}}

==Discovery==
'''WISE J004945.61+215120.0''' was discovered in 2012 by Mace et al. from data, collected by [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)]] [[Earth-orbit]]ing [[satellite]] — [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] [[infrared|infrared-wavelength]] 40 [[centimeter|cm]] (16 [[inch|in]]) [[space observatory|space telescope]], which mission lasted from December 2009 to February 2011. In 2013, the discovery paper was published.{{r|Mace2013}}

==Distance==
[[Trigonometric parallax]] of WISE J004945.61+215120.0 is not yet measured. Therefore, there are only distance estimates of this object, obtained by indirect — spectrofotometric — means (see table).

The '''World Medical Association''' ('''WMA''') is an international and independent confederation of free professional [[medical association]]s, therefore representing [[physicians]] worldwide. WMA was formally established on September 18, 1947&lt;ref name="wma.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/who-we-are/history/|title=History|date=4 May 2017|work=wma.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has grown in 2018 to 113 national medical associations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/who-we-are/members/members-list-printable/|title=Members' List|date=4 May 2017|work=wma.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wma.net/news-post/wma-general-assembly-6&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 10 million physicians.

The WMA provides a forum for its member associations to communicate freely, to co-operate actively, to achieve consensus on high standards of [[medical ethics]] and professional competence and to promote the professional freedom of [[physicians]] worldwide. With this unique partnership, WMA aims to facilitate high-caliber, humane care to [[patients]] in a healthy environment, enhancing the quality of life for all people in the world.

==Mission statement==
The purpose of the WMA is to serve [[human]]ity by endeavoring to achieve the highest international standards in [[Medical Education]], [[Medical Science]], [[Medical Art]] and [[Medical Ethics]], and [[Health Care]] for all people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/who-we-are/|title=About the WMA|date=4 May 2017|work=wma.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The WMA was founded on 18 September 1947, when [[physicians]] from 27 different countries met at the First General Assembly of the WMA in Paris. This organization was built from an idea born in the House of the [[British Medical Association]] in 1945, within a meeting organized in [[London]] to initiate plans for an international medical organization to replace l'Association Professionnelle Internationale des Médecins", which had suspended its activities because of  [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="wma.net"/&gt;

In order to facilitate financial support from its member associations, in 1948, the executive board, known as the Council, established the Secretariat of the WMA in [[New York City]] in order to provide close liaison with the United Nations and its various agencies. The WMA Secretariat remained in New York City until 1974 when for reasons of economy, and in order to operate within the vicinity of [[Geneva]]-based international organizations (WHO, ILO, ICN, ISSA, etc.) it was transferred to its present location in [[Ferney-Voltaire]], [[France]].
The WMA members gathered in an annual meeting, which from 1962 was named "World Medical Assembly."

Since its beginning WMA has shown concern over the state of [[medical ethics]] in general and over the world, taking the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world physicians. A modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates was sent for consideration at the II General Assembly in [[Geneva]] in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the Assembly agreed to name it the "[[Declaration of Geneva]]."

Also in the same II General Assembly a report on "War Crimes and Medicine" was received. This prompted the Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an [[International Code of Medical Ethics]], which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly.

Even after the adoption of these two documents, WMA was constantly being informed about violations of medical ethics, crimes committed by doctors in time of war, unethical human experimentation, among several other problems in the field of medical ethics and medical law. This information caused the Council to establish a permanent Committee on Medical Ethics in 1952, which has been working actively ever since, as one can see from the declarations or statements of the WMA and their continuous updates.

During the World Medical Association General Assembly in [[Reykjavik]] in early October, members of the [[Canadian Medical Association]] stated that parts of the speech by WMA's incoming president Leonid Eidelman had been plagiarized from a speech made in 2014 by [[Chris Simpson (cardiologist)]] who was then the president of CMA. Current president Dr. Gigi Osler told the group that part of the address was "copied word for word" from Simpson's speech. "Multiple other parts of the speech were also copied from various websites, blogs and news articles, without proper appropriate attribution to the authors", she latter added in a statement. A motion by Canada at the Assembly to call on Eidelman to resign was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Medical Association resigns from world body|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2018/10/08/canadian-medical-association-resigns-from-world-body/|work=CBC Radio International|date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October, the CMA resigned; their press release stated that the decision was made because WMA was not upholding ethical standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Medical Association (CMA) resigns from the World Medical Association (WMA)|url=https://www.cma.ca/En/Pages/Canadian-Medical-Association-(CMA)-resigns-from-the-World-Medical-Association-(WMA).aspx|publisher=CMA|date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an email to [[The Canadian Press]], WMA spokesman Nigel Duncan said that Eidelman's speech had been written by others and that he did not know that it might contain plagiarism.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Medical Association resigns from world body|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2018/10/08/canadian-medical-association-resigns-from-world-body/|work=CBC Radio International|date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A WMA source also told The Canadian Press that Eidelman apologized at the general assembly, after the Canadian delegates had departed; he "acknowledge[d] that part of his speech was taken from Simpson", and most delegates "accepted his apology" for the mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canadian Medical Association resigns from world body, accuses incoming president of plagiarizing inaugural speech|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-medical-association-resigns-from-world-body-amid-plagiarism-accusations|work=[[National Post]]|date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canadian doctors quit World Medical Association over plagiarism allegations|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-doctors-quit-world-medical-association-over-plagiarism/|work=[[Globe and Mail]]|date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

===General Assembly===
The main decision-making body of the WMA is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is formed by delegations from the National Member Associations, officers and members of the Council of the WMA, and representatives of the Associate Members (Associate Members are individual physicians who wish to join the WMA).

===Council===
The Assembly elects the WMA Council every two years with representatives drawn from each of the six WMA regions, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and the Pacific. It also elects the WMA president annually, who is the Ceremonial Head of the WMA. The President, President Elect and Immediate Past President form the Presidium that is available to speak for the WMA and represent it officially.

Every two years, the WMA Council, excluding the Presidium, elects a Chairperson who is the political head of the organization.
As Chief Executive of the operational units of the WMA, the Secretary-General is in full-time employment at the Secretariat, appointed by the WMA Council.

==Secretariat==
The WMA Secretariat is situated in [[Ferney-Voltaire]], [[France]], adjacent to the City of [[Geneva]].

==Official languages==
[[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are the official languages of the association since its creation.

[[File:WMA Constituent Members.svg|thumb|Map showing the 113 WMA Constituent Members]]
The WMA have the following status of membership:
* '''Constituent Membership''': Mainly applies for members who are typically National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world (sometimes these organizations are called National Medical Associations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/en/60about/10members/index.html|title=Members|date=4 May 2017|work=wma.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership. They range from chambers to orders, from colleges to private associations. Some of these have compulsory membership and some are trade unions.
* '''Associate Membership''': Applies for Individual physicians that want to join the WMA and who have voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members.
