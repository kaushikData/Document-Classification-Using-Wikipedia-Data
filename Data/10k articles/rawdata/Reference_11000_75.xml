'''Andreas Huyssen''' (born 1942) is the Villard Professor of German and [[Comparative Literature]] at [[Columbia University]], where he has taught since 1986. He is the founding director of the university's Center for Comparative Literature and Society and one of the founding editors of the ''[[New German Critique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://germanic.columbia.edu/content/andreas-huyssen|title=Columbia University in the City of New York|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Huyssen was born in Germany in 1942. He studied at several European universities in Madrid, Cologne, Paris, and Munich. He received his doctorate in Germanic and Romance Languages and Literature from the [[University of Zürich]] in 1969, and taught at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] from 1971 until 1986, when he joined the faculty at Columbia. From 1986 to 1992 and again from 2005 to 2008, he served as head of Columbia's Germanic Languages and Literature department. From 1998 to 2003 he was founding director of the Center for Comparative Literature and Society.

==Work==

Huyssen is known for his work on 18th-20th century [[German literature]] and culture, international [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]], [[Frankfurt School]] critical theory, [[cultural memory]], historical trauma, [[urban culture]], and [[globalization]]. His work has appeared in translation in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], French, and other languages.

He is currently{{when|date=April 2017}} working on a book assembling and expanding his collected essays on the contemporary visual arts.

In addition to his editorship of the ''New German Critique'', Huyssen serves on the editorial boards of ''October'', ''[[Constellations]]'', ''[[Memory Studies (journal)|Memory Studies]]'' and ''[[Germanic Review]]''.

==Personal life==
He is married to ''[[New York Times]]'' correspondent [[Nina Bernstein]]. Huyssen is a longtime friend of [[Nobel Prize]]-winning Turkish novelist [[Orhan Pamuk]], and often hosts him when the writer comes to the U.S. The two teach an undergraduate class together at Columbia called "Words and Pictures," which examines problems of visual representation in literature, particularly theories of [[ekphrasis]].

The '''Beach Volleyball Database''' is an online [[website]] that holds extensive information about international [[beach volleyball]] players, tournaments and history. News are frequently updated, and the site has results for [[continent]]al and [[international]] tournaments. It is the only website of its kind in the sport of beach volleyball.

The press operations officer for the [[Association of Volleyball Professionals|AVP]], Tim Simmons, has said that the Beach Volleyball Database has had a major impact on the sport. Information that is now easily accessible through the website, used to take time consuming research through different sources. Now professional athletes have a chance to set long-term goals based on their long-term results in comparison to other professional beach volleyball players.&lt;ref name=keck&gt;Alan Keck, [http://www.bvbinfo.com/news.asp?ID=399 Beach Volleyball: Fan is a one-man, on-line encyclopedia on the sport], [[The Virginian Pilot]], 2002 (Beach Volleyball Database)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Volleyball Magazine'' calls the website "a reliable source for entries and results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://volleyballmag.com/avp-contract-042917/|title=Most AVP players acquiesce and sign contract, exclusivity agreement|date=April 29, 2017|first=Ed|last=Chan|work=Volleyball Magazine|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also collaborates with the [[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball]] (FIVB) to provide tournament notes to the FIVB website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/BeachVolleyball/Document/2018_FIVB_BVB_Handbook_V1.pdf|title=FIVB 2018 Handbook Beach Volleyball|publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball]]|date=February 20, 2018|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bigeye tuna''', ''Thunnus obesus'', is a species of true [[tuna]] of the [[genus]] [[Thunnus]], belonging to the wider [[mackerel]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Scombridae]].

In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], it is one of two species known as '''{{okina}}ahi'''; the other is [[yellowfin tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii-seafood.org/yellowfin.html?ref=Hawaii] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331171539/http://www.hawaii-seafood.org/yellowfin.html?ref=Hawaii|date=March 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bigeye tuna are found in the open waters of all tropical and temperate [[ocean]]s, but not the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

==Description==
Bigeye tuna can grow up to 250 centimetre (98 inches) or 8 feet, in length. Maximum weight of individuals probably exceeds {{convert|180|kg|abbr=on}}, with the all-tackle angling record standing at {{convert|178|kg|abbr=on}}. They are large, deep-bodied, streamlined fish with large heads and eyes. The [[pectoral fin]]s are very long, reaching back beyond the start of the second [[dorsal fin]] in juveniles and the space between the first and second dorsal fin in adults. They have 13 or 14 [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] spines.

==Physiology==
Bigeye tuna have a unique physiology which allows them to forage in deeper colder waters and tolerate [[oxygen]]-poor waters. Bigeye tuna are reported to tolerate ambient oxygen levels of 1.0 ml/L and routinely reach depths where ambient oxygen content is below 1.5 ml/L,&lt;ref name="iccat.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iccat.int/Documents/CVSP/CV057_2005/no_2/CV057020142.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605043338/http://www.iccat.int/Documents/CVSP/CV057_2005/no_2/CV057020142.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to the presence of blood with a high oxygen affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002270000255#page-1|title=Blood oxygen-binding characteristics of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), a high-energy-demand teleost that is tolerant of low ambient oxygen | doi=10.1007/s002270000255 | volume=136|journal=Marine Biology|pages=1087–1098 | last1 = Lowe | first1 = T. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vascular counter-current heat exchangers maintain body temperatures above ambient water temperature. These heat exchangers are engaged to conserve heat in deeper colder waters and are disengaged to allow rapid warming as the tuna ascend from cold water into warmer surface waters, providing short-latency, physiological thermoregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v358/n6385/abs/358410a0.html|title=Physiological and behavioural thermoregulation in bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) | volume=358 | doi=10.1038/358410a0|journal=Nature|pages=410–412 | last1 = Holland | first1 = Kim N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyes of bigeye tuna are well developed and with a large spherical lens allowing their vision to function well in low light conditions.&lt;ref name="iccat.int"/&gt;

==Life history==
Conventional tagging data and counts of growth increments in otoliths (ear bones) of bigeye tuna have recorded a maximum age of 16 years.&lt;ref name="publish.csiro.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/MF05255|title=CSIRO PUBLISHING - Marine &amp; Freshwater Research|work=csiro.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recorded lengths at which sexual maturity is attained varies geographically with a length at which 50% of fishes sampled are mature of 135&amp;nbsp;cm in the eastern Pacific Ocean and 102–105&amp;nbsp;cm in the western Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="publish.csiro.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.iattc.org/PDFFiles2/Bulletins/Bulletin-Vol.-23-No-1-ENG.pdf |title=Reproductive Biology of Bigeye Tuna ''(Thunnus Obesus)'' in the Eastern and Central Pacific Ocean |last1=Schaefer|first1=Kurt M.|last2=Fuller|first2=Daniel W.|last3=Miyabe|first3=Naozumi|pages=7–8|format=PDF |type=Bulletin |volume=23 |issue=1 |date=2005 |location=La Jolla, California |publisher=Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translates to an age of maturity of 2 – 4 years. Differences in methods of studies may contribute to this variability. [[Spawning]] takes place across most months of the year in tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, becoming seasonal at higher latitudes when sea surface temperatures are above 24&amp;nbsp;°C. In the northwestern tropical Atlantic spawning occurs in June and July, and in January and February in the [[Gulf of Guinea]], which is the only known Atlantic nursery area.

==Behavior==

===Vertical movement===
Bigeye tuna undertake a distinct [[Diel vertical migration|diel shift in vertical behaviour]], generally descending at dawn to deeper, cooler waters and returning to shallower, warmer waters at dusk. During the day they can undertake vertical movements into waters of 300–500 m depth that can be as low as 20&amp;nbsp;°C than surface temperatures.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-010-1524-3#page-1|title=Vertical movements, behavior, and habitat of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean, ascertained from archival tag data | doi=10.1007/s00227-010-1524-3 | volume=157|journal=Marine Biology|pages=2625–2642 | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = Kurt M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2008.00464.x/full|title=Bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) vertical movements in the Azores Islands determined with pop-up satellite archival tags | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2419.2008.00464.x | volume=17|journal=Fisheries Oceanography|pages=74–83 | last1 = Arrizabalaga | first1 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661110000479 | doi=10.1016/j.pocean.2010.04.013 | volume=86 | title=Spatiotemporal variability in bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) dive behavior in the central North Pacific Ocean | journal=Progress in Oceanography | pages=81–93 | last1 = Howell | first1 = Evan A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals undertake thermoregulatory behaviour whilst at depth, periodically returning from deeper, cooler waters to shallower, warmer waters to re-warm.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; Across the Pacific Ocean the depths at which bigeye tuna spend the majority of their time during the day vary:  in the eastern Pacific the majority of time is spent at 200–350 m; around Hawaii the majority of time is spent at 300–400 m and in the Coral Sea the majority of time is spent at 300–500 m.

Typical vertical behaviour of bigeye tuna shifts when fish associate with seamounts, buoys and fish aggregating devices, with individuals remaining in surface waters. Association with objects has been observed to occur over periods of approximately 10–30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2419.2003.00229.x/full|title=Vertical movements of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) associated with islands, buoys, and seamounts near the main Hawaiian Islands from archival tagging data | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2419.2003.00229.x | volume=12|journal=Fisheries Oceanography|pages=152–169 | last1 = Musyl | first1 = Michael K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This associative behaviour of bigeye tuna (and also other species of tuna) is taken advantage of by fisheries with approximately 27% of all catches of tunas by purse seine vessels in the western and central Pacific Ocean derived from fish aggregating devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alr-journal.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8897387 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010101221/http://www.alr-journal.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8897387 |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
Bigeye tuna primarily feed on epipelagic and mesopelagic fish, [[crustaceans]] and [[cephalopods]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="food"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Potier|first=M. |author2=F.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added bigeye tuna to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205030730/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=February 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification#Guides and advisory lists|seafood sustainability guides]] encourage consumption of other types of tuna.

The bigeye tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Houston Harris was born in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], but later lived in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], and [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; He played baseball in the Negro Leagues for The House of David, where he was discovered to become a wrestler at a [[steel mill]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
Harris was trained by [[Joe Savoldi]] after meeting him at matches at the Naval Armory.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; Savoldi originally named Harris, BuBu Brasil, "The South American Giant," but a [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] misprinted his first name as "Bobo" in an advertisement and it stuck.&lt;ref name="WWE"/&gt;

Early in his career, some wrestling promoters would match Brazil against fellow African American wrestlers, including [[Ernie Ladd]] and [[Abdullah the Butcher]].&lt;ref name="WWE"/&gt; Fans clamored to see Brazil face opponents of any type and Brazil would have many matches with competitors such as [[Killer Kowalski]], [[Dick the Bruiser]], [[Johnny Valentine]], and [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]], who feuded with Brazil over the course of several decades.&lt;ref name="WWE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/2010/06/26/14526706.html|title=Bobo Brazil dies at age 74|accessdate=November 11, 2017|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other rivals would all fall victim to Brazil's finishing maneuver, the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Headbutt|Coco Butt]]. Brazil also once wrestled [[Bill Miller (wrestler)|Bill Miller]] to a draw,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bobo-brazil.html |title=Bobo Brazil|accessdate=September 8, 2011|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; and challenged [[Bruno Sammartino]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWWF World Heavywight Championship]] in a battle of two top [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] competitors.&lt;ref name="WWE"/&gt; On October 18, 1962, Brazil made history by becoming the first African American to win the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] by defeating [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]] (this distinction is usually given to [[Ron Simmons]], the first recognized African American world champion after winning the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]). Although Brazil initially refused the title (because of an "injury" that Rogers had claimed to have), Brazil was awarded the title the next day after doctors had found nothing wrong with Rogers. However, this title change is not recognized by the NWA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwawrestling.com/information/history/world/heavyweight.htm|title=History of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship|accessdate=March 24, 2009|publisher=NWA Wrestling|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201035204/http://www.nwawrestling.com/information/history/world/heavyweight.htm|archivedate=December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 1970,  Brazil and [[El Mongol]] defeated Mr. Ito and The Great Ota in the first racially mixed match in [[Atlanta]] history.&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWE"/&gt;

Brazil served as a mentor to wrestler [[Rocky Johnson|"Soulman" Rocky Johnson]]. Brazil's manager was [[James Dudley]], the first African American to be in charge of a major arena in the United States. Dudley would run to the ring waving a towel, as Brazil followed behind.&lt;ref name="WWE"/&gt;

Brazil retired in 1993 after a four decade career. His last official match was in [[Chicago, Illinois]] against Kelly Kiniski, son of rival [[Gene Kiniski]]. Brazil was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (1994)|class of 1994]] by Ernie Ladd.&lt;ref name="WWE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt; The following year, Brazil inducted Ladd into the WWF Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="WWE"/&gt;

== Personal life and death ==
Harris had a wife and six children.&lt;ref name="pwhf"/&gt; After retiring from wrestling, he ran a restaurant called Bobo's Grill.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

Harris died on January 20, 1998, at the Lakeland Medical Center in [[St. Joseph, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt; He had been admitted to the hospital on January 14, after suffering a series of [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt;

The '''Brooklyn Museum Art School ''' (BMAS) was a non-degree-granting professional school that opened at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in the summer of 1941. Prior to the creation of the BMAS, classes for amateur artists had been offered by the [[Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]] (BIAS), the Museum's parent organization. BIAS offered hands-on art classes dating back to 1841. The Brooklyn Museum Art School provided instruction for amateur artists as well until January 1985 when it was transferred to the [[Pratt Institute]]’s Continuing Education Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Records of the Brooklyn Museum Art School|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/assets/BMAS_final.pdf|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Brooklyn Museum Art School title was first used in the 1941-42 annual report from the Brooklyn Museum, remaining separate from the Brooklyn Museum's Education Department, which was directed towards children. During [[World War II]] the Brooklyn Museum Art School offered limited classes in painting, photography and drawing. In 1945 the artist [[Augustus Peck]] became director of the school and expanded its offerings. As a result of the [[GI Bill]] the BMAS had very stable income and funding, allowing many prominent artists to teach or lecture at the school. Artists included Augustus Peck, [[William Baziotes]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Raphael Soyer]], and [[Reuben Tam]]. At its peak, the Brooklyn Museum Art School had almost 400 applicants. This number suffered as more institutions began to offer accredited programs in the fine arts during the late 1950s. A Bachelor of Fine Arts program in conjunction with [[Long Island University]] was planned to begin in 1959, but never came to fruition due to lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brooklyn Museum of Art finding aid|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/assets/BMAS_final.pdf|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="cryptopp-fips"&gt;Crypto++ received three FIPS 140 validations from 2003 through 2008. In 2016 NIST moved Crypto++ to the Historical Validation List. The move effectively revokes the FIPS validation and federal agencies cannot use the module for validated cryptography.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="actual-cryptlib-not-validated"&gt;The actual cryptlib is not FIPS 140 validated, although a validation exists for an adapted cryptlib as part of a third party, proprietary, commercial product.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Hash functions ==
Comparison of supported cryptographic hash functions. At the moment this section also includes ciphers that are used for producing a MAC tag for a message. Here hash functions are defined as taking an arbitrary length message and producing a fixed size output that is virtually impossible to use for recreating the original message.

[[Image:Sylvester I and Constantine.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 13th-century fresco of [[Sylvester I]] and [[Constantine the Great]], showing the purported Donation ([[Santi Quattro Coronati]], Rome)]]
The '''''Donation of Constantine''''' ({{italics correction|{{lang-la|Donatio Constantini}}}}) is a [[Forgery|forged]] Roman imperial [[decree]] by which the 4th-century emperor [[Constantine the Great]] supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the [[Western Roman Empire|western part]] of the [[Roman Empire]] to the Pope. Composed probably in the 8th century, it was used, especially in the 13th century, in support of claims of political authority by the papacy.&lt;ref name=EMA&gt;Vauchez, Andre (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qtgotOF0MKQC&amp;pg=PA445 ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'']. Routledge.  p. 445. {{ISBN|9781579582821}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorenzo Valla]], an Italian [[Catholic]] priest and [[Renaissance humanist]], is credited with first exposing the forgery with solid [[Philology|philological]] arguments in 1439&amp;ndash;1440,&lt;ref&gt;Whelton, M. (1998). ''Two Paths: Papal Monarchy – Collegial Tradition''. Salisbury, MA: Regina Orthodox Press. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; although the document's authenticity had been repeatedly contested since 1001.&lt;ref name=EMA/&gt;

In many of the existing manuscripts (handwritten copies of the document), including the oldest one, the document bears the title ''Constitutum domini Constantini imperatoris''.&lt;ref name="WikisourceCatholicEncyclopedia1913"/&gt;  The ''Donation of Constantine'' was included in the 9th-century ''[[Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals]]'' collection.

== Content ==
The text, purportedly a decree of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] dated 30 March, in a year mistakenly said to be both that of his fourth consulate (315) and that of the consulate of [[Ovinius Gallicanus|Gallicanus]] (317), contains a detailed profession of Christian faith and a recounting of how the emperor, seeking a cure for his leprosy, was converted and baptized by [[Pope Sylvester I]]. In gratitude, he determined to bestow on the seat of Peter "power, and dignity of glory, and vigour, and honour imperial", and "supremacy as well over the four principal sees, [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Constantinople]], as also over all the churches of God in the whole earth". For the upkeep of the church of Saint Peter and that of Saint Paul, he gave landed estates "in [[Judaea (Roman province)|Judea]], [[Greece]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], [[Thrace]], [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], [[Italy]] and the various islands". To Sylvester and his successors he also granted imperial insignia, the tiara, and "the city of Rome, and all the provinces, places and cities of Italy and the western regions".&lt;ref&gt;"The Donation of Constantine".

== Medieval use and reception ==
What may perhaps be the earliest known allusion to the ''Donation'' is in a letter of 778, in which [[Pope Hadrian I]] exhorts [[Charlemagne]], whose father, [[Pepin the Short|Pepin the Younger]], had made the [[Donation of Pepin]] granting the Popes sovereignty over the [[Papal States]], to follow Constantine's example and endow the Roman Catholic church.

The first pope to directly invoke the decree was [[Pope Leo IX]], in a letter sent in 1054 to [[Michael I Cerularius]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="WikisourceCatholicEncyclopedia1913"&gt;[[s::Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Donation of Constantine|"Donation of Constantine"]]. Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; He cited a large portion of the document, believing it genuine,&lt;ref&gt;Migne, Jacques-Paul (1891). ''[[Patrologia Latina]]''. Volume 143 (cxliii). Col. 744–769.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansi, Giovanni Domenico. ''Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova Amplissima Collectio''. Volume 19 (xix). Col. 635–656.&lt;/ref&gt; furthering the debate that would ultimately lead to the [[East–West Schism]]. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the ''Donation'' was often cited in the [[Investiture Controversy|investiture conflicts]] between the papacy and the secular powers in the West.&lt;ref name="WikisourceCatholicEncyclopedia1913"/&gt;

In his [[The Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]], written in the early 14th century, the poet [[Dante Alighieri]] wrote: "Ahi, Costantin, di quanto mal fu matre, / non la tua conversion, ma quella dote / che da te prese il primo ricco patre!" ("Ah, Constantine, how much evil was born, / not from your conversion, but from that donation / that the first wealthy Pope received from you!").&lt;ref&gt;Dante Alighieri. ''Inferno''. Canto 19, lines 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], the ''Donation'' was widely accepted as authentic, although the Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] did possibly raise suspicions of the document "in letters of gold" as a forgery, in making a gift to the See of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''. DD II 820. pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the mid-15th century, with the revival of Classical scholarship and textual criticism, that [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]], and eventually the papal bureaucracy, began to realize that the document could not possibly be genuine. [[Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa]] declared it to be a forgery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Discovery of Time |first=Stephen |last=Toulmin |first2=June |last2=Goodfield |pages=104–106 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |edition=Phoenix |year=1982 |isbn=0-226-80842-4 |authorlink=Stephen Toulmin |authorlink2=June Goodfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Nicholas of Cusa, Paul E. Sigmund (editor and translator)|title=The Catholic Concordance|series=Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=0-521-40207-7|chapter=The properly ordered power of the Western emperor does not depend on the Pope|pages=216–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke of it as an [[apocryphal]] work. 

Later, the Catholic priest [[Lorenzo Valla]] argued in his [[philology|philological]] study of the text that the language used in manuscript could not be dated to the 4th century.&lt;ref name=Prosser&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 08919666| volume = 20| issue = Journal Article| pages = 35–| last = Prosser| first = Peter E.| title = Church history's biggest hoax: Renaissance scholarship proved fatal for one of the medieval papacy's favorite claims| journal = Christian History| date = 2001| url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;u=wikipedia&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA80303684&amp;asid=2e95f78ae926bf1bb8b214ce55f2aabb}}{{subscription|via=[[General OneFile]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the text suggests that the manuscript can most likely be dated to the 8th century. Valla believed the forgery to be so obvious that he leaned toward believing that the Church had knowledge that the document was inauthentic. Valla further argued that papal usurpation of temporal power had corrupted the church, caused the wars of Italy, and reinforced the "overbearing, barbarous, tyrannical priestly domination."&lt;ref name=Prosser/&gt;

This was the first instance of modern, scientific [[diplomatics]]. Independently of both Cusa and Valla, [[Reginald Pecock]]e, Bishop of Chichester (1450–57), reached a similar conclusion. Among the indications that the Donation must be a fake are its language and the fact that, while certain imperial-era formulas are used in the text, some of the Latin in the document could not have been written in the 4th century; anachronistic terms such as "[[fief]]" were used. Also, the purported date of the document is inconsistent with the content of the document itself, as it refers both to the fourth consulate of Constantine (315) as well as the consulate of Gallicanus (317).

[[Pope Pius II]] wrote a tract in 1453, five years before becoming Pope, to show that, though the ''Donation'' was a forgery, the papacy owed its lands to [[Charlemagne]] and its powers of the [[Keys of Heaven|keys]] to [[Primacy of Peter|Peter]]; he did not publish it, however.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Pius II (1883). ''Opera inedita''. pp. 571–81. Cited in: Lea, Henry Charles (1895). "The 'Donation of Constantine'". ''The English Historical Review'' '''10'''(37). pp. 86–87. {{doi|10.1093/ehr/X.XXXVII.86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary opponents of papal powers in Italy emphasized the primacy of civil law and civil jurisdiction, now firmly embodied once again in the Justinian ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. The Florentine chronicler [[Giovanni Cavalcanti (chronicler)|Giovanni Cavalcanti]] reported that, in the very year of Valla's treatise, [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], Duke of Milan, made diplomatic overtures toward [[Cosimo de' Medici]] in Florence, proposing an alliance against the Pope. In reference to the ''Donation'', Visconti wrote: "It so happens that even if Constantine consigned to Sylvester so many and such rich gifts &amp;mdash; which is doubtful, because such a privilege can nowhere be found &amp;mdash; he could only have granted them for his lifetime: the Empire takes precedence over any lordship."

Later, scholars further demonstrated that other elements, such as Sylvester's curing of Constantine, are legends which originated at a later time. [[Wolfram Setz]], a recent editor of Valla's work, has affirmed that at the time of Valla's refutation, Constantine's alleged "donation" was no longer a matter of contemporary relevance in [[political theory]] and that it simply provided an opportunity for an exercise in legal rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfram Setz|Setz, Wolfram]] (1976). ''Lorenzo Vallas Schrift gegen die Konstantinische Schenkung''. Weimar. (Translation of: Valla, Lorenzo (1440). ''De Falso Credita et Ementita Constantini Donatione Declamatio'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulls of [[Nicholas V]] and his successors made no further mention of the ''Donation'', even when partitioning the New World. Valla's treatise was taken up vehemently by writers of the [[Protestant Reformation]], such as [[Ulrich von Hutten]] and [[Martin Luther]], causing the treatise to be placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|index of banned books]] in the mid-16th century. The ''Donation'' continued to be tacitly accepted as authentic until [[Caesar Baronius]] in his "[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]" (published 1588–1607) admitted that it was a forgery, after which it was almost universally accepted as such.&lt;ref name="WikisourceCatholicEncyclopedia1913"/&gt; Some continued to argue for its authenticity; nearly a century after "Annales Ecclesiastici", [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] still alluded to the ''Donation'' as undisputed fact.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Christian. "Append. ad [[Council of Chalcedon|Concilium Chalcedonensem]]". ''Opere''. ii:261. Cited in: Lea, Henry Charles (1895). "The 'Donation of Constantine'". ''The English Historical Review'' '''10'''(37). pp. 86–87. {{doi|10.1093/ehr/X.XXXVII.86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
It has been suggested that an early draft of the ''Donation of Constantine'' was made shortly after the middle of the 8th century, in order to assist [[Pope Stephen II]] in his negotiations with [[Pepin the Short]], who then held the position of [[Mayor of the Palace]] (i.e., the manager of the household of the Frankish king).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duffy |first=Eamon |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiTl-lhM36wC&amp;pg=PA89 |title=Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes |publisher=Yale University Press |page=89 |isbn=978-0-300-11597-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Malley |first=S. W.

In return for Stephen's support, Pepin gave the Pope the lands in Italy which the [[Lombards]] had taken from the [[Byzantine Empire | Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schnürer |first=Gustav |year=1912 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm |title=States of the Church |work=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lands would become the [[Papal States]] and would be the basis of the Papacy's [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal  power]] for the next eleven centuries.

In one study, an attempt was made at dating the forgery to the 9th century, and placing its composition at [[Corbie Abbey]], in northern France.&lt;ref name=Fried&gt;Fried, Johannes (2007). ''"Donation of Constantine" and "Constitutum Constantini": The Misinterpretation of a Fiction and Its Original Meaning.'' Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. {{ISBN|978-3-11-018539-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mediaevalist [[Johannes Fried]] draws a distinction between the ''Donation of Constantine'' and an earlier, equally forged version, the ''Constitutum  Constantini'', which was included in the collection of forged documents, the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals|False Decretals]], compiled in the later half of the ninth century. Fried argues the ''Donation'' is a later expansion of the much shorter ''Constitutum''.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Christopher B. Coleman understands the mention in the ''Constitutum'' of a donation of "the western regions" to refer to Lombardy, Venetia, and Istria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c4ERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=Constitutum+Constantini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vVQdHFsSeD&amp;sig=XsAcPddnV30diqJ8aY3arn4KFcc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2vJzc6bLXAhUI44MKHZS9AMc4ChDoAQhQMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Constitutum%20Constantini&amp;f=false Coleman, Christopher Bush.

'''Editor war''' is the common name for the rivalry between users of the [[Emacs]] and [[vi]] (usually [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]]) [[text editor]]s. The rivalry has become a lasting part of [[hacker culture]] and the [[free software movement|free software community]].

The Emacs vs vi debate was one of the original "holy wars" conducted on [[Usenet]] groups,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~joern/jargon/holywars.HTML Holy War (Hacker Jargon)]&lt;/ref&gt; with many [[Flaming (Internet)|flame wars]] fought between those insisting that their editor of choice is the [[Wiktionary:paragon|paragon]] of editing [[perfection]], and insulting the other, since at least 1985.&lt;ref name=emacsvsvi&gt;[https://www.linux.com/news/emacs-vs-vi-endless-geek-holy-war EMACS vs. vi: The endless geek 'holy war']&lt;/ref&gt; Related battles have been fought over [[operating system advocacy|operating systems]], [[programming language]]s, [[version control]] systems, and even source code [[indent style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/just-let-me-code/240168735|title=Just Let Me Code}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/25/why-coding-style-matters/|title=Why Coding Style Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison==
The most important differences between vi and Emacs are presented in the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! vi !! Emacs 
|-
! Keystroke execution
| vi retains each [[permutation]] of typed keys. This creates a path in the [[decision tree]] which unambiguously identifies any command. &lt;!--There has to be mentioned that certain keys represent text-objects, others repetition, and others movement ... Permutation of such keys can be very effective, while keeping the user thinking about what is he doing.--&gt;
| Emacs commands are [[key combination]]s for which [[modifier key]]s are held down while other keys are pressed; a command gets executed once completely typed. This still forms a decision tree of commands, but not one of individual keystrokes. A vim-inspired Emacs package (&lt;tt&gt;undo-tree&lt;/tt&gt;) provides a [[user interface]] to the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/undo-tree-readme.txt|title=undo-tree-readme.txt|quote=The only downside to this more advanced yet simpler undo system is that it was inspired by Vim. But, after all, most successful religions steal the best ideas from their competitors!}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
! Memory usage and customizability
| vi is a smaller and faster program, but with less capacity for customization.  The [[vim (text editor)|vim]] version of vi has evolved to provide significantly more functionality and customization than vi, making it comparable to Emacs{{refn|group=notes|As of 2013, vim has 1731 [[Source lines of code|kLOC]] of code (1142 in C + 506 stock distro vimScript + 83 makefile-related), whereas GNU Emacs has 1623 (just 299 in C + 1270 stock distro Emacs Lisp + 54 makefile-related).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohloh.net/p/emacs/analyses/latest/languages_summary|title=The GNU Emacs Open Source Project on Open Hub : Languages Page|publisher=Ohloh.net|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohloh.net/p/vim/analyses/latest/languages_summary|title=The Vim Open Source Project on Open Hub : Languages Page|publisher=Ohloh.net|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many optional Emacs Lisp (and Vimscript) packages available; the numbers here refer to only code which is actually included in the main download of the respective editor.}}. vi start-up time is near instantaneous for small text files, while vim is almost as fast.
| Emacs executes many actions on startup, many of which may execute arbitrary user code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Startup-Summary.html|title=Startup Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Emacs take longer to start up (even compared to vim) and require more [[Random access memory|memory]]. However, it is highly customizable and includes a large number of features, as it is essentially an execution environment for a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] program designed for text-editing. Emacs 18 (released in 1987) introduced a server mode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://searchcode.com/codesearch/view/364358/|title=NEWS.18|quote=Programs such as mailers that invoke "the editor" as an inferior to edit some text can now be told to use an existing Emacs process instead of creating a new editor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to run continuously in the background. Various instances of Emacs can then be started in client mode, attaching to this server and sharing state. Emacs client startup time is practically instantaneous as all it does is provoke the existing Emacs process to redraw the display.
|-
! User environment
| vi was originally exclusively used inside of a text-mode console, offering no [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). Most modern vi derivatives, e.g. MacVim and gVim, include GUIs. However, support for [[Proportional font#Proportional font|proportionally spaced fonts]] remains absent. Also lacking is support for different sized fonts in the same document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=All fonts used, except for Menu and Tooltip, should be of the same character size as the default font!  Otherwise redrawing problems will occur.|url=ftp://ftp.tuwien.ac.at/.vhost/www.vim.org/vim/doc/syntax.txt|title=syntax.txt}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
| Emacs, while also initially designed for use on a console, grew a [[Text User Interface|TUI]] fairly early on due to its [[Lisp machine]] heritage. [[X11]] GUI support was added in Emacs 18, and made the default in version 19. Current Emacs GUIs include full support for [[Proportional font#Proportional font|proportionate spacing]] and font-size variation. Emacs also supports embedded images and [[hypertext]].
|-
! Function/navigation interface
| vi uses distinct editing [[Mode (computer interface)|mode]]s. Under "insert mode", keys insert characters into the document. Under "normal mode" (also known as "command mode"), bare keypresses execute vi commands.
| Emacs uses [[metakey]] chords.{{refn|group=notes|Emacs also has something called "modes"; however, in Emacs these generally refer to long-term interaction states that apply for entire time one works with a given file or dataset, and do not imply a modal interface ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryModes|title=EmacsWiki: Category Modes|publisher=Emacswiki.org|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Keys or key chords can be defined as [[prefix key]]s, which put Emacs into a mode where it waits for additional [[key press]]es that constitute a [[key binding]]. Key bindings can be mode-specific, further customizing the interaction style. Emacs provides a [[command line]] accessed by M-x that can be configured to [[autocomplete]] in various ways. Emacs also provides a &lt;tt&gt;defalias&lt;/tt&gt; macro, allowing alternate names for commands.
|-
! Keyboard
|vi uses no {{keypress|[[Alt key|Alt]]}} key and seldom uses the {{keypress|[[Ctrl key|Ctrl]]}} key. vi's keyset is mainly restricted to the [[alphanumeric]] keys, and the [[esc key|escape]] key. This is an enduring relic of its [[teletype]] heritage, but has the effect of making most of vi's functionality accessible without frequent awkward finger reaches.
|The expansion of one of Emacs' [[backronyms]] is ''Escape, Meta, Alt, Control, Shift'', which neatly summarizes most of the modifier keys it uses, only leaving out [[Super key (keyboard button)|Super]]. Emacs was developed on [[Lisp Machine]]s with [[Space-cadet keyboard]]s that were more ergonomic with respect to modifiers than modern layouts. There are multiple emacs packages, such as spacemacs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs|title=spacemacs}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ergoemacs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ergoemacs.org/|title=Ergoemacs}}&lt;/ref&gt; that replace these key combinations with ones easier to type, or customization can be done ''[[ad hoc]]'' by the user.
|-
! Language and script support
|vi has rudimentary support for languages other than English. Modern Vim supports Unicode if run in a shell that supports Unicode.
|Emacs has full support for all Unicode-compatible writing systems and allows multiple scripts to be freely intermixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/International-Chars.html#International-Chars|title=International Chars|quote=Internally, Emacs uses its own multibyte character encoding, which is a superset of the Unicode standard. This internal encoding allows characters from almost every known script to be intermixed in a single buffer or string. Emacs translates between the multibyte character encoding and various other coding systems when reading and writing files, and when exchanging data with subprocesses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

=== Benefits of Emacs ===
* Emacs has a non-modal interface
* One of the most [[porting|ported]] computer programs. It runs in [[text mode]] and under [[graphical user interface]]s on a wide variety of [[operating system]]s, including most [[Unix-like]] systems ([[Linux]], the various [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSDs]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[AIX operating system|AIX]], [[IRIX]], [[macOS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Emacs server architecture allows multiple clients to attach to the same Emacs instance and share the buffer list, [[kill ring]], [[undo]] history and other state.
* Pervasive [[online help]] system with keybindings, functions and commands documented on the fly.
* Extensible and customizable [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp programming language]] variant ([[Emacs Lisp]]), with features that include:
** Ability to [[emulator|emulate]] vi and vim (using Evil,&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-8519296"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home |title=Evil - Home - Open wiki |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=September 16, 2014 |work=gitorious.org |author1= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916073328/https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home |archivedate=September 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Viper or Vimpulse).
** A powerful and extensible file manager ([[dired]]), integrated debugger, and a large set of development and other tools.
** Having every command be an Emacs Lisp function enables commands to [[DWIM]] (Do What I Mean) by programmatically responding to past actions and document state. For example, a &lt;code&gt;switch-or-split-window&lt;/code&gt; command could switch to another window if one exists, or create one if needed. This cuts down on the number of keystrokes and commands a user must remember.
** "An OS inside an OS". Emacs Lisp enables Emacs to be programmed far beyond editing features. Even a base install contains several dozen applications, including two [[web browser]]s, news readers, several mail agents, four [[IRC]] clients, a version of [[ELIZA]], and a variety of games. All of these applications are available anywhere Emacs runs, with the same user interface and functionality. Starting with version 24, Emacs includes a [[package manager]], making it easy to install additional applications including alternate web browsers, EMMS ([[Emacs Multimedia System]]), and more. Also available are numerous packages for programming, including some targeted at specific language/library combinations or coding styles.

=== Benefits of vi ===
* Edit commands are composable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kozlowski|first=Mike|title=Why Atom Can’t Replace Vim|url=https://medium.com/p/433852f4b4d1|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vi has a modal interface
* Vi loads faster than Emacs.
* Being deeply associated with UNIX tradition, it runs on all systems that can implement the standard [[C (programming language)|C]] library, including [[UNIX]], [[Linux]], [[AmigaOS]], [[DOS]], [[Windows]], [[Macintosh|Mac]], [[BeOS]], [[OpenVMS]], [[IRIX]], [[AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[BSD]] and [[POSIX]]-compliant systems.
* Extensible and customizable through [[Vim script]] or APIs for interpreted languages such as Python, Ruby, Perl, and Lua
* Ubiquitous. Essentially all Unix and Unix-like systems come with vi (or a variant) built-in. Vi (and ex, but not vim) is specified in the [[POSIX]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/vi.html|title=vi|website=pubs.opengroup.org|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* System rescue environments, embedded systems (notably those with [[BusyBox]]) and other constrained environments often include vi, but not emacs.
* Generally editing itself requires fewer keystrokes and is faster.

==Evolution==
In the past, many small editors modeled after or derived from vi flourished. This was due to the importance of conserving memory with the comparatively minuscule amount available at the time. As computers have become more powerful, many vi clones, [[vim (text editor)|Vim]] in particular, have grown in size and code complexity. These vi variants of today, as with the old lightweight Emacs variants, tend to have many of the perceived benefits and drawbacks of the opposing side. For example, Vim without any extensions requires about ten times the disk space required by vi, and recent versions of Vim can have more extensions and run slower than Emacs. In ''[[The Art of Unix Programming]]'', [[Eric S. Raymond]] called Vim's supposed light weight when compared with Emacs "a shared myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch13s03.html|title=The Right Size for an Editor|publisher=Catb.org|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with the large amounts of RAM in modern computers, both Emacs and vi are lightweight compared to large [[integrated development environment]]s such as [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], which tend to draw derision from Emacs and vi users alike.

[[Tim O'Reilly]] said, in 1999, that [[O'Reilly Media]]'s [[Learning the vi and Vim Editors|tutorial on vi]] sells twice as many copies as that on Emacs (but noted that Emacs came with a free manual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/1999/unix_editor.html|title=Editor: vi or emacs?|date=21 June 1999|publisher=Oreilly.com|accessdate=1 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401165244/http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/1999/unix_editor.html|archive-date=1 April 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programmers use either Emacs and vi or their various offshoots, including [[Linus Torvalds]] who uses [[MicroEMACS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stifflog.com/2006/10/16/stiff-asks-great-programmers-answer/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108162904/http://www.stifflog.com/2006/10/16/stiff-asks-great-programmers-answer/|title=Stifflog: Stiff asks, great programmers answer|author=Jarosław Rzeszótko|archivedate=8 November 2006|publisher=Stifflog.com|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1999, vi creator [[Bill Joy]] said that vi was "written for a world that doesn't exist anymore" and stated that Emacs was written on much more capable machines with faster displays so they could have "funny commands with the screen shimmering and all that, and meanwhile, I'm sitting at home in sort of World War II surplus housing at Berkeley with a modem and a terminal that can just barely get the cursor off the bottom line".&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-4603951"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/11/bill_joys_greatest_gift/ |title=Bill Joy's greatest gift to man – the vi editor |work=theregister.co.uk |date=September 11, 2003 |accessdate=June 3, 2014 |first=Ashlee |last=Vance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603174753/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/11/bill_joys_greatest_gift/ |archivedate=June 3, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="From Archive.org-1423728"&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.linux-mag.com/1999-11/joy_04.html |title=The Joy of Unix: Sun Microsystems Co-Founder Bill Joy Charts Where Linux and Free Software Fit Into His Company's Solar System. |date=November 1999 |accessdate=June 3, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030207101427/http://www.linux-mag.com/1999-11/joy_04.html |archivedate=February 7, 2003 |deadurl=yes |first=Bill |last=Joy |edition= |issue= |number= |volume= |journal=Linux Magazine |interviewer=Eugene Eric Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Emacs and vi workalikes, [[pico (text editor)|pico]] and its [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] clone [[GNU nano|nano]] and other text editors such as [[ne (text editor)|ne]] often have their own third-party advocates in the editor wars, though not to the extent of Emacs and vi.

As of 2014, both Emacs and vi can lay claim to being among the longest-lived application programs of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Auerbach |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/05/oldest_software_rivalry_emacs_and_vi_two_text_editors_used_by_programmers.html |title=The Oldest Rivalry in Computing |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=9 May 2014 |quote=two rival programs can stake a claim to being among the longest-lived applications of all time. Both programs are about to enter their fifth decades. Both programs are text editors, for inputting and editing code, data files, raw HTML Web pages, and anything else. And they are mortal enemies.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being the two most commonly used text editors on Linux and Unix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch15s02.html|title=Choosing an Editor|quote=these two editors express sharply contrasting design philosophies, but both are extremely popular and command great loyalty from identifiable core user populations. Surveys of Unix programmers consistently indicate about a 50/50 split between them, with all other editors barely registering.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many operating systems, especially [[Linux]] and [[BSD]] derivatives, bundle multiple text editors with the operating system to cater to user demand. For example, a default installation of [[macOS]] contains Emacs, [[Ed (text editor)|ed]], [[Nano (text editor)|nano]], [[TextEdit]], and Vim.

("Using a [[free software|free]] version of vi is not a sin but a [[penance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/04/unabridged-selective-transcript-of.html|title=The unabridged selective transcript of Richard M Stallman's talk at the ANU|publisher=Linuxhelp.blogspot.com|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The Church of Emacs has its own [[newsgroup]], alt.religion.emacs, that has posts purporting to support this belief system.

Stallman has referred to himself as '''St I[[GNU]]−cius''', a saint in the Church of Emacs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stallman.org/saint.html|title=Saint IGNUcius - Richard Stallman|publisher=Stallman.org|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of vi have created an opposing '''Cult of vi''', argued by the more hardline Emacs users to be an attempt to "ape their betters".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Regarding vi's modal nature (a point of extreme frustration for new users)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~joern/jargon/vi.HTML vi (Hacker Jargon)]&lt;/ref&gt; some Emacs users joke that vi has two modes – "beep repeatedly" and "break everything". vi users enjoy joking that Emacs's key-sequences induce [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], or mentioning one of many satirical expansions of the acronym EMACS, such as "Escape Meta Alt Control Shift" (a jab at Emacs's reliance on modifier keys).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/gnuemacs.acro.exp.html|title=satirical expansions of EMACS|publisher=Gnu.org|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Eight Megabytes And [[Thrashing (computer science)|Constantly Swapping]]" (in a time when that was a great amount of memory) or "EMACS Makes Any Computer Slow"  (a [[recursive acronym]] like those Stallman uses) or "Eventually Munches All Computer Storage", in reference to Emacs's high system resource requirements. GNU EMACS has been expanded to "Generally Not Used, Except by Middle-Aged Computer Scientists" referencing its most ardent fans, and its declining usage among younger programmers compared to more graphically-oriented editors such as [[TextMate]] or [[Sublime Text]]. The Emacs distribution includes the full list.&lt;ref name="Raymond2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Eric S. Raymond]]|title=The art of Unix programming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4q1t-jAcBIC&amp;pg=PA343|accessdate=17 December 2011|year=2004|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-13-142901-7|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a poke at Emacs' [[creeping featurism]], vi advocates have been known to describe Emacs as "a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor". Emacs advocates have been known to respond that the editor is actually very good, but the operating system could use improvement (referring to Emacs' famous lack of [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]).

A game among UNIX users, either to test the depth of an Emacs user's understanding of the editor or to poke fun at the complexity of Emacs, involved predicting what would happen if a user held down a modifier key (such as {{keypress|[[Ctrl key|Ctrl]]}} or {{keypress|[[Alt key|Alt]]}}) and typed their own name. A similar "game" was reportedly played&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL |journal=Datamation |date=July 1983| pages=263–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; among users of the old [[TECO (text editor)|TECO]] editor, in which lay the roots of Emacs.

Due to the unintuitive character sequence to exit vi (":q!"), hackers joke that there is a proposed method of creating a [[Pseudorandom binary sequence|pseudorandom character sequence]] by having a user unfamiliar with vi seated in front of an open editor and asking them to exit the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1723">'''Ex Parte Naude''' was an important case in South African succession law. It involved a testator who had set aside three of the shares into which he had divided his estate. This was done for the purpose of establishing a trust fund--with power to the trustees to invest the capital constituting the trust--and an obligation imposed upon them to use the interest derived from the investments for certain specified purposes. In the event of a surplus of interest over and above the amount required for the said purposes, they were to apply the surplus in augmentation of the trust fund. The capital of the fund, however, was not to exceed £50,000.

It appeared that the value of the said three shares of the estate far exceeded £50,000, that there was already in the hands of the trustees a capital amount of £58,615, and that a further amount could be expected on the completion of the liquidation of the estate. It appeared further that the aforesaid compulsory annual interest payments amounted only to £616, so that there was an annual surplus of interest in the hands of the trustees in an amount of £7,777 which thus fell to be dealt with according to their discretion.

The court granted the trustees’ application for authority to increase the capital amount of the fund, by means of any capital already received from the estate, or to be received from it, so as to permit of the capital amount of the fund exceeding £50,000.

The '''{{lang|fr|Fédération aéronautique internationale}}''' ('''FAI'''; {{lang-en|The World Air Sports Federation}}), is the world governing body for [[air sports]].  It was founded on 14 October 1905, and is headquartered in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fai.org/ Home]. Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. Maison du Sport International, av. de Rhodanie 54, CH-1005 Lausanne, tel +41 21 345 1070.&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains world records for [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] activities including [[Balloon (aircraft)|ballooning]], [[aeromodeling]], and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s; and also for [[human spaceflight]].

==History==
The FAI was founded at a conference held in Paris 12–14 October 1905, which was organised following a resolution passed by the Olympic Congress held in Brussels on 10 June 1905 calling for the creation of an Association "to regulate the sport of flying, ... the various aviation meetings and advance the science and sport of Aeronautics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/icao/en/hist/stamps/fai_federation_aeronautique_internationale.htm|title=The Postal History of ICAO|website=Icao.int|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was attended by representatives from 8 countries: Belgium (''[[Aero Club Royal de Belgique]]'', founded 1901), France (''[[Aéro-Club de France]]'', 1898), Germany ([[:de:Deutscher Aero Club|Deutscher Aero Club]] e.V.''), Great Britain ([[Royal Aero Club]], 1901), Italy (''[[:it:Aero Club d'Italia|Aero Club d'Italia]]'', 1904), Spain (''[[:es:Real Aero Club de España|Real Aero Club de España]]'', 1905), Switzerland (''[[Aero-Club der Schweiz]]'', 1900) and the United States ([[Aero Club of America]], 1905).

On 2 February 2017 the FAI announced its new strategic partnership with international asset management firm [[Noosphere Ventures]]. FAI Secretary General Susanne Schödel, FAI President Frits Brink and Noosphere Ventures Managing Partner [[Max Polyakov]] signed the agreement, making Noosphere Ventures FAI’s Global Technical Partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fai.org/news/fai-names-noosphere-ventures-its-new-global-technical-partner|title=FAI names Noosphere Ventures as its new Global Technical Partner|publisher=www.fai.org|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noosphereventures.com/noosphere-ventures-to-bring-next-big-thing-to-air-sports/|title=Noosphere Ventures to Bring Next Big Thing to Air Sports|publisher=noosphereventures.com|accessdate=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAI establishes the standards for records in the activities.  Where these are [[air sports]], the FAI also oversees international competitions at world and continental levels, and also organizes the [[World Air Games]] and [[FAI World Grand Prix]].

The FAI keeps records set in [[human spaceflight]], through the FAI Astronautic Records Commission ("International Astronautic Records Commission – ICARE)&lt;ref name="ICARE website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/commission/icare |title =FAI Astronautic Records Commission |website=Fai.org |language= English |accessdate =11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAI also organises the FAI International Drones Conference and Expo in Lausanne, Switzerland, which offers a platform for organisations, businesses and individuals to discuss how drones are used today and to create a framework for how they will be used and impact on our lives in the future.

==Records==
[[Image:The Soviet Union 1971 CPA 3992 stamp (Yuri Gagarin Medal, Spaceships and Planets).jpg|thumb|right|1971 [[USSR]] commemorative stamp depicting [[Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal]] established by FAI]]
Among the FAI's responsibilities are the verification of record-breaking flights. For a flight to be registered as a "World Record," it has to comply with the FAI's strict rules, which include a proviso that the record must exceed the previous record by a certain percentage. Since the late 1930s, military aircraft have dominated some classes of record for powered aircraft such as speed, distance, payload, and height, though other classes are regularly claimed by civilians.

Some records are claimed by countries as their own, even though their achievements fail to meet FAI standards.  These claims are not typically granted the status of official records. For example, [[Yuri Gagarin]] earned recognition for the first manned spaceflight, despite failing to meet FAI requirements. The FAI initially did not recognize the achievement because he did not land in his [[Vostok spacecraft]] (he ejected from it), but later it recognized that Gagarin was the first human to fly into space.  The FAI then established [[Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal|"The Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal"]], which has been awarded since 1968.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fai.org/awards|title=Awards|website=Fai.org|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hemming's Cartulary''''' is a manuscript [[cartulary]], or collection of [[charter]]s and other land records, collected by a monk named [[Hemming (monk)|Hemming]] around the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of England]]. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the [[British Library]] as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the ''[[Liber Wigorniensis]]'', is a collection of [[Anglo-Saxon charters]] and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, ''Hemming's Cartulary'' proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.

The two works are bound together in one surviving manuscript, the earliest surviving cartulary from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester at the hands of royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] and [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], and nobles such as [[Eadric Streona]] and [[Urse d'Abetot]]. Also included are accounts of lawsuits waged by the Worcester monks in an effort to regain their lost lands. The two sections of the cartulary were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.

==Authorship and composition==
Although the monk Hemming has traditionally been credited with all the works in the manuscript, the cartulary contains two works that were collected together, only one of which is by Hemming. The two works were bound together to form the manuscript (abbreviated MS) [[Cotton Tiberius A xiii]], now held in the [[Cotton library|Cotton Library]], a collection in the British Library.&lt;ref name=BASE/&gt; Together, the two works form the first surviving cartulary from medieval England.&lt;ref name=Clanchy101&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; The first part is the so-called ''Liber Wigorniensis'', or ''Book of Worcester'',  which takes up [[wikt:folio|folios]] 1–118 of the manuscript.&lt;ref name=Intro11f38&gt;Brooks "Introduction" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' p. 11 footnote 38&lt;/ref&gt; The second is Hemming's work, and takes up folios 119–142, 144–152 and 154–200.&lt;ref name=Intro11&gt;Brooks "Introduction" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; MS [[Cotton Nero E i]] and British Library MS Add 46204 may also contain charters collected as part of Hemming's work, as they have been identified by some scholars as having been produced during Hemming's lifetime,&lt;ref name=Intro11/&gt; although others identify them as a copy of the ''Liber Wigorniensis''.&lt;ref name=Forge106&gt;Barrow "Forgery Production" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 106–107 and footnote 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscript condition===
The original manuscript containing the cartulary was damaged in a fire in 1733,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; but the damage was not serious. The edges of the manuscript were burned, which resulted in a few words being lost on the margins. Because of the fire damage, the manuscript was rebound in the 19th century, and each leaf was mounted separately.&lt;ref name=Ker51&gt;Ker "Hemming's Cartulary" ''Studies in Medieval History'' p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the two main sections, there are three smaller parchment pages bound in with the manuscript: folios 110, 143, and 153.&lt;ref name=Ker51/&gt; The first of them, folio 110,  measures {{convert|70|mm|in}} high by {{convert|90|mm|in}} wide and lists eight names, probably witnesses to a lease. The second inserted folio, 143, measures {{convert|130|mm|in}} high by {{convert|180|mm|in}} wide and gives a list of jurors in a late 11th-century hand. The last inserted folio, 153, measures {{convert|58|mm|in}} high by {{convert|180|mm|in}} wide and gives the boundaries of a manor in [[Old English]], rather than Latin; it is written in a 12th-century hand.&lt;ref name=Ker62&gt;Ker "Hemming's Cartulary" ''Studies in Medieval History' p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Liber Wigorniensis''===
The first part of the work is an early 11th-century collection of older charters, arranged geographically, with a section on late 10th-century land leases tacked on the end.&lt;ref name=BASE/&gt; The historian {{nowrap|[[H. P. R. Finberg]]}} gave this section of the work the title ''Liber Wigorniensis'' in 1961 to distinguish it from the later section actually assembled by Hemming.&lt;ref name=Tinti234&gt;Tinti "From Episcopal Conception" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Dates for the compilation of the work include the suggestion by historian [[Neil Ripley Ker|Neil Ker]] that it dates from between 1002 and 1016, when [[Wulfstan II|Wulfstan]] (the earlier Wulfstan&amp;nbsp;– later a saint&amp;nbsp;– who is not the Wulfstan who encouraged Hemming to compile the cartulary) held both the [[Archbishop of York|archbishopric of York]] and the [[Bishop of Worcester|bishopric of Worcester]]. Another historian, [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith|V. H. Galbraith]], suggests that instead of being compiled in Wulfstan's episcopate, it was created during the episcopate of [[Ealdwulf (died 1002)|Ealdwulf]], Wulfstan's predecessor in both [[Episcopal see|sees]]. A third historian, [[David Dumville]], argues that because no leases later than 996 are mentioned, it must date to a time-frame between 996 and 1016.&lt;ref name=Tinti235&gt;Tinti "From Episcopal Conception" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; There are 155&amp;nbsp;charters in the ''Liber'', of which 10 are later insertions; the date of their incorporation ranges from the early to the late 11th century.&lt;ref name=Barrow108/&gt; Ker, who studied the original manuscript, has identified five main scribes involved in the manuscript in the first section. The [[Hand (handwriting)|scribal hand]]s used are small and not very rounded, and resemble the type of writing prevalent in England during the early part of the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Ker49&gt;Ker "Hemming's Cartulary" ''Studies in Medieval History'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; This section consists of 117&amp;nbsp;leaves in the original manuscript, each page with 26&amp;nbsp;lines of text. The written area is approximately {{convert|190|mm|in}} tall by {{convert|100|mm|in}} wide.&lt;ref name=Ker51/&gt; A few blank areas in the original manuscript copy have been filled with information in the later 11th and 12th centuries, mainly related to properties owned by the cathedral.&lt;ref name=Ker52&gt;Ker "Hemming's Cartulary" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 52–55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemming's cartulary proper===
Hemming was the author of the second and later part, a collection of lands and rights belonging to the cathedral chapter of Worcester, as well as a narrative of the deeds of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], the Bishop of Worcester who died in 1095, and Archbishop [[Ealdred (archbishop)|Ealdred]] of York. In this part of the work is a preface known as the ''Enucleatio libelli'', where Hemming names himself as the person responsible for compiling the work, and names Wulfstan as the inspiration for his work.&lt;ref name=BASE/&gt; Another section, known as the ''Prefatio istius libelli'', now much later in the manuscript but possibly meant as an introduction to the ''Codicellus'', is a shorter introduction that gives the purpose of the collection.&lt;ref name=Tinti239&gt;Tinti "From Episcopal Conception" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Historians usually take the two prefaces to mean that Wulfstan commissioned the work,&lt;ref name=Feudal35&gt;Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams145&gt;Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; but it is unclear whether it was created before or after Wulfstan's death. It may have been produced during the vacancy after Wulfstan's death, and before the appointment of the next bishop, [[Samson (Bishop of Worcester)|Samson]]. Historian [[Nicholas Brooks]], along with Vivian Galbraith, argues that Hemming's work was a response to the problems encountered by the diocese during the vacancy, when royal officials administered the lands of the bishopric. According to Brooks, the claim that Wulfstan ordered the composition of the cartulary was inaccurate, and was made to appeal to the authority of the bishop.&lt;ref name=Intro11/&gt; The historian [[Julia Barrow]] believes that the inspiration for the work was the creation of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in 1086, although she agrees that the work was completed after Wulfstan's death. Hemming's work contains over 50&amp;nbsp;charters, some of which are duplicates of ones in the ''Liber''.&lt;ref name=Barrow114&gt;Barrow "Forgery Production" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section of the work is not just a collection of deeds and charters but includes other historical information of importance, especially for Hemming's monastery.&lt;ref name=BASE&gt;Keynes "Hemming" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 231–232&lt;/ref&gt; The documents are connected by a narrative explaining why and how the cartulary was created; the narrative is usually given the title of ''Codicellus possessionum''.&lt;ref name=Tinti235/&gt; This section of the work also includes the ''[[hagiography|Life]]'' of the later Wulfstan,&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Mason "Hemming" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; one of two contemporary records of Wulfstan's life.{{efn|The other record the ''[[Vita Wulfstani]]'' written by [[William of Malmesbury]] during the early 12th century, which is a translation of a work by Coleman, Wulfstan's chaplain.&lt;ref name=Monastic74/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Monastic74&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 74 footnote 2&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is broadly geographical, with some information grouped by topic.&lt;ref name=Cart83/&gt; In two sections, which are sometimes entitled "Indiculum Libertatis" and "Oswald's Indiculum",&lt;ref name=Tinti244&gt;Tinti "From Monastic Conception" ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 244–245&lt;/ref&gt; the work not only draws on charters but also incorporates regional information from a different type of source recording the holdings of tenants-in-chief. This has been identified as the documentation assembled at the shire-courts for the so-called Domesday survey, commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1085. More famously, the same records were later used for the compilation of Domesday Book.&lt;ref name=Cart83/&gt; Some of the documents are in Latin, others are in Old English.&lt;ref name=Cart83&gt;Fleming "Christ Church Canterbury's Anglo-Norman Cartulary" ''Anglo-Norman Political Culture'' pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Ker has identified the second part of the manuscript as being created by three scribes, describing their writing as "round and fairly large", in a style belonging to a period of transition between the late 11th and early 12th century.&lt;ref name=Ker49/&gt; There are 80&amp;nbsp;leaves in the original manuscript. Most pages in this section of the manuscript have 28&amp;nbsp;lines of writing, and the written area is approximately {{convert|190|mm|in}} high by {{convert|108|mm|in}} wide.&lt;ref name=Ker51/&gt; A few blank areas in the original manuscript were filled with information ranging from contemporary notes on landholdings of the cathedral to notes on the [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution]] of [[Worcester Priory]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Ker58&gt;Ker "Hemming's Cartulary" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 58–62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and contents==
Both the ''Liber Wigorniensis'' and Hemming's work contain a number of forged charters.&lt;ref name=Intro11/&gt; The historian Julia Barrow has determined that at least 25 of the 155&amp;nbsp;charters in the ''Liber'' are forged, but cautions that this is the minimum estimate.&lt;ref name=Barrow108&gt;Barrow "Forgery Production" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; Barrow identifies more than 30 of the charters in Hemming's work as forgeries, including some that are duplicates from the ''Liber''.&lt;ref name=Barrow114/&gt; Some of the stories that form Hemming's narrative do not always agree with other sources, and Ker says "it is safer to trust to the main facts than to the details of his [Hemming's] stories".&lt;ref name=Ker64&gt;Ker "Heming's Cartulary" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contents of the ''Liber Wigorniensis''===
The main goal of the ''Liber'' was to document the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to the property of the church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the ''Liber'' should be seen as a working document, compiled for the use of the bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The ''Liber'' was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.&lt;ref name=Davies145&gt;Davies ''Book of Llandaf'' p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The charters constitute valuable evidence for [[prosopography|prosopographical]] research and the study of land tenure in late Anglo-Saxon England. According to [[Donald A. Bullough]], they also offer a window on the kind of social bonds which could be created by "neighbourhood". In the 10th century, the Bishop of Worcester leased out various small estates attached to the Church in the three counties (Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire) to several high-ranking men and women, usually for three lifespans.&lt;ref name=Friends19&gt;Bullough ''Friends, Neighours and Fellow-drinkers'' pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern may be taken to suggest that this way of association served to "create a network, an inter-meshing, of high-status 'neighbours' ... with its central knot in Worcester and the ''domus'' of the bishop".&lt;ref name=Friends21/&gt; In the bishop's residence or at home, the lessees may have come together to participate in convivial drinking, just as the Norman successors to these lands are envisaged as doing in [[William of Malmesbury]]'s ''Life'' of St Wulfstan.&lt;ref name=Friends21&gt;Bullough ''Friends, Neighours and Fellow-drinkers'' pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some of the [[thegn]]s served in the royal army (''fyrd'') under the command of Bishop [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]] or his successors, which presupposes the creation of a personal warband and possibly one with the secondary purpose of protecting the bishop's properties.&lt;ref name=Friends22&gt;Bullough ''Friends, Neighours and Fellow-drinkers'' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemming's work===

====Purpose====
Hemming's introduction to his work (''Prefatio'') claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: &lt;blockquote&gt;about the things which have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.&lt;ref name=QSouthern249&gt;Quoted and translated in Southern "Aspects of the European Tradition of Historical Writing" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The historian [[Richard Southern]] argues that, notwithstanding the stated aim of the work, it was not produced to be used in lawsuits, but rather as a kind of utopian picture of what was in the past. The goal was to depict those things that were beyond human recovery but that were "laid up in heaven".&lt;ref name=Southern249&gt;Southern "Aspects of the European Tradition of Historical Writing" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its narrative structure, it should be seen not only as a documentation of the various landholdings of the diocese, but as a historical work as well. Unlike the ''Liber'', it was not revised as the property changed hands, and this lack of revision has been seen as emphasizing the commemorative nature of the work. The historian [[John Reuben Davies]] sees a close parallel between Hemming's work and the Welsh medieval document ''[[Book of Llandaff|The Book of Llandaf]]''.&lt;ref name=Davies145/&gt; Other similar works were the Norman ''[[pancartes]]'', which were compilations of gifts to a monastery, connected by a narrative which was then presented to the dukes to secure confirmation of the gifts. These Norman works date from the early 11th century, and like Hemming's work, they are of great interest to the historian as sources for the study of medieval history.&lt;ref name=Houts117&gt;van Houts "Historical Writing" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Also noting that Hemming's part of the compilation does not appear to have been revised or updated to meet new circumstances, Patrick Geary describes it as "a commemorative, historical volume, not a working administrative tool" and associates the work with counterparts produced in the continental West, such as [[Folcuin]]'s chronicle cartulary ''Gesta abbatum S. Bertini Sithiensium''.&lt;ref name=Phandom101&gt;Geary ''Phantoms of Remembrance'' pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Francesca Tinti has arrived at a different conclusion, arguing instead that Hemming's work, more so than the ''Liber Wigorniensis'', came to serve very real needs, and that these specifically concerned the monastic community at Worcester. Although the ''Prefatio'' is silent about monks, the ''Enucleatio'' is explicit that Bishop Wulfstan had commissioned the work to defend the estates assigned for the sustenance of the monks (''ad victum monachorum''). She relates these concerns to the rapid growth of the community during Bishop Wulfstan's episcopate in the second half of the 11th century.{{efn|One of the bishop's charters included in the work states that the number of monks had gone up from 12 to 50.&lt;ref name=Tinti257&gt;Tinti "From Episcopal Conception" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Tinti257/&gt; The coming of the Norman newcomer, Samson, who had been involved in the dissolution of [[Westbury-on-Trym]], would have given the enlarged community a particular incentive to safeguard its property and rights.&lt;ref name=Tinti237&gt;Tinti "From Episcopal Conception" ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 237, 258–261&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contents====
One of the themes of Hemming's work is the depredations suffered by his monastery at the hands of royal officials. One such notorious official from the last decade of King Æthelred's reign is Eadric ''Streona'' ("Grasper"), [[ealdorman]] of [[Mercia]], blamed for having appropriated land held by the church in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire and for having incorporated the [[Ancient counties of England|ancient county]] of [[Winchcombeshire]] into Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name=Baxter23&gt;Baxter ''Earls of Mercia'', pp. 23 and 107, citing ''Hemming's Cartulary'', ed. Hearne, pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt; Hemming may have invented Eadric's [[byname]] of ''Streona'', as it is not attested before appearing in Hemming's work.&lt;ref name=Aeth70&gt;Williams ''Æthelred the Unready'' p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror as being especially damaging.&lt;ref name=Uni22&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several [[Manorialism|manor]]s that were listed in ''Domesday Book'' as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims.&lt;ref name=Lawson729&gt;Lawson "Collection" ''English Historical Journal'' p. 729 footnote 12&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 [[mark (money)|marks]] of gold to recover their belongings.&lt;ref name=Dove32/&gt; Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric]], Earl of Mercia, and other members of his family.&lt;ref name=Spoil387&gt;Williams "Spoilation of Worcester" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XIX'' pp. 386–387&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Ted Johnson Smith points out that the ''Codicellus'' has strong parallels to the ''[[Historia de Sancto Cuthberto]]''.&lt;ref name=Introduction12&gt;Smith "Introduction" ''Historia de Sancto Cuthberto'' pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Historia'' was written in Durham in the mid-10th century, and is a history of the monastery of St. Cuthbert from foundation until about 945. Like the ''Codicellus'', it is a narrative concerned mainly to defend the patrimony of the monks against depredations.&lt;ref name=Introduction12/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grandsen76&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing in England'' pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Also contained in Hemming's work is a description of the lawsuit between the diocese of Worcester and [[Evesham Abbey]], which took place between 1078 and 1085. Although only Hemming relates the course of the proceedings, the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham]]'', or ''Evesham Chronicle'', also gives background information on the dispute. The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that the diocese maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of Æthelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from the diocese. After Æthelwig's death, most of these lands passed to [[Odo of Bayeux]], but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. The lawsuit was complicated because part of the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, [[Beorhtheah]], to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's lands were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following Æthelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with Æthelwig's successor Walter. The settlement, which was concluded in 1086, granted the lands to the abbey, but the diocese was the overlord of the lands, for which the abbey owed military service.&lt;ref name=Dove32&gt;Williams "Cunning of the Dove" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 32–35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscript and publication history==
The only other 11th-century cartulary surviving from England is the Oswald cartulary, also compiled at Worcester. Historian M. T. Clanchy has suggested that the form English cartularies took may have originated at Worcester,&lt;ref name=Clanchy101/&gt; although fellow historian [[Robin Fleming]] has argued that Christ Church Canterbury's surviving cartulary is also an 11th-century compilation.&lt;ref name=Cart83/&gt; Who owned the manuscript after it left Worcester Cathedral Priory, presumably with the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 1540s, is unknown, but the manuscript was in the possession of [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Robert Cotton]] by 1612, when it is recorded as being loaned by Cotton to [[Arthur Agarde]]. There are annotations in the manuscript by [[John Joscelyn]], who was secretary to [[Matthew Parker]] (d. 1575), the [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabethan]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], but whether Parker owned the manuscript is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Cotton105&gt;Tite ''Early Records of Sir Robert Cotton's Library'' p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Parker was noted for keeping many of the manuscripts his staff annotated, but he did not keep all of them, as another Worcester Priory document, now [[Bodleian Library]] Junius 121 was also annotated by Parker himself, but remained at Worcester until the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Graham327&gt;Graham "Matthew Parker's manuscripts" ''Cambridge History of Libraries'' p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;}} The manuscript thus became part of the Cotton library, which passed into public ownership in 1702 on the death of Cotton's grandson on the basis of an act of Parliament of 1701.&lt;ref name=Panizzi33&gt;Tite "Development of the Manuscript Collection" ''Manuscript Library'' p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLCL&gt;Staff "History of the Cotton Library" ''Help for Researchers''&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript itself is now part of the British Library's holdings.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;Staff "Manuscript Description of Cotton Tiberius A.xii" ''British Library Catalogue''&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript was originally published in 1723 as ''Hemingi chartularium ecclesiæ Wigorniensis'', in two volumes edited by [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; This was part of the ''Chronica Anglia'' series put out between 1709 and 1735, which included many chronicles and records in 20&amp;nbsp;volumes.&lt;ref name=Graves139&gt;Graves ''Bibliography'' p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Hearne printed his edition from a transcription made for the antiquary [[Richard Graves]].&lt;ref name=Tinti234/&gt; This transcript, known as MS Rawlinson B.445, is not a completely accurate transcription of the Cotton Tiberius manuscript, as some items were omitted, and [[marginalia]] were not always transcribed. There were also some additions of decorations.&lt;ref name=Ker72&gt;Ker "Hemming's Cartulary" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire manuscript of Cotton Tiberius A xiii is catalogued as number 366 in [[Helmut Gneuss]]'s work ''Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts''.&lt;ref name=Gneuss68&gt;Gneuss ''Handlist'' p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; A new critical edition by David Dumville is forthcoming as of 2010.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Heritage Microfilm, Inc.''' (est.1997) is a [[microform|preservation microfilm]] and microfilm digitization business located in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos.iowa.gov/search/business/(S(qerjzgzfwbv300b23c4rl13t))/summary.aspx |title=Heritage Microfilm, Inc. |author=Iowa Secretary of State |work=Business Entities |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company began in 1996 when the microfilm division of Cedar Rapids-based Crest Information Technologies was sold to Christopher Gill. The microfilm division was responsible at the time for preserving newspapers and for microfilming business documents.  The business document filming portion of the business was soon dropped in favor of the newspaper microfilming division. (Crest in 1999 sold the remaining portion of the company to [[Lason]].){{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1999, Heritage Microfilm began digitizing newspaper microfilm and launched [[NewspaperARCHIVE.com]].  Soon after, it began creating smaller "branded" newspaper archive websites in collaboration with publishing partners.  The ''[[Syracuse Post-Standard]]'' and ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' are among its clients for both microfilm and digital archives.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The firm works with [[ANSI]]/[[AIIM]] standards for preservation microfilming. It has a humidity and temperature-controlled storage facility.  It is a [[Kodak]] ImageGuard facility. One of its specializations is damaged microfilm recovery.  It has an Extek 3441 microfilm duplicator, which duplicates at low speeds to prevent damage to [[Redox]] or [[cellulose acetate film|Vinegar-Syndrome microfilm]]. It uses Kodak [[silver halide]] microfilm for master film and primary duplications.  It discontinued the use of [[vesicular film]] for duplications, due to the poor quality film available from distributors.  It claims to use Kodak BrownToner, a [[photographic print toning|polysulfide film treatment]], on every reel of silver-halide microfilm that they produce.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

'''NewspaperArchive.com''' is a commercial online database of digitized newspapers, and claims to be the world's largest newspaper archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/ |title=Newspaperarchive.com |author=Heritage Archives Inc. |location=855 Wright Bros. Blvd., Cedar Rapids, Iowa |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was launched in 1999 by Heritage Microfilm.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/about-us.aspx |title=About Us |author=Heritage Archives, Inc. |work=Newspaperarchive.com |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2008|6}}, NewspaperArchive said it provided full text search for 909 million articles on 85 million pages over 240 years that represented 2,875 publication titles in more than 748 cities. As of 2015, the product includes newspapers from Azerbaijan, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, South Africa, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/world-newspapers/ |title=World Newspaper Archives – Newspaperarchive.com |author=Heritage Archives Inc. |location=855 Wright Bros.

Searches can be conducted by keyword, date, and location. Results are free, but access to the newspaper articles available to download in [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]] requires a subscription. Searching is available directly from newspaperarchive or via news.google.com/archivesearch.  The company says that it follows the [[Automated Content Access Protocol]] in which its clients have a say in what is available online. The digitized newspapers that are currently available and [[Optical character recognition|OCR]]'d represent a fraction of the 150 million pages of historical documents that [[Heritage Microfilm]] maintains in its microform archive. According to NewspaperArchive, it is microfilming 2.5 million pages of newspapers each month and has 180,000 reels of microfilm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagearchives.org/CurrentClients.aspx |title=HeritageArchives.org |publisher=HeritageArchives.org |date=2005-06-27 |accessdate=2011-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224062523/http://www.heritagearchives.org/CurrentClients.aspx |archivedate=2011-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/HtmlViewer.aspx?ctl=About|title=Our Mission|publisher=NewspaperArchive.com|accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=October 2015}}

The resource has had its fair share of criticism.{{according to whom|date=October 2015}} A reviewer in 2004 observed that at the time the archive had some errors with year dates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barry Popik |year=2004 |title=Digital Historical Newspapers : A Review of the Powerful New Research Tools |journal=Journal of English Linguistics |volume=32 |publisher=Sage }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2014, The Iowa Attorney General’s Office opened an investigation after complaints about deceptive and misleading practices that include charging subscribers for involuntary donations to a charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jordan|first1=Erin|title=Cedar Rapids company under state review after complaints|url=http://thegazette.com/subject/news/cedar-rapids-company-under-state-review-after-complaints-20140622|accessdate=3 September 2014|publisher=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 1, 2014, Newspaper Archive, Inc. had a rating of ''F'' from [[Better Business Bureau]].{{Relevance inline|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/iowa/business-reviews/online-publications/newspaper-archive-in-cedar-rapids-ia-32006934|title=Newspaper Archive, Inc. – BBB Business Review|publisher=Better Business Bureau|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party inline|date=October 2015}}

==Criticism==
Some observers have expressed{{who|date=October 2015}} concern about the extent of involvement of a private commercial business with stewardship of historical resources otherwise assumed to be held in the [[Public trust doctrine|public trust]].{{POV statement|date=October 2015}} For example, "until 2002, the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[Center for Research Libraries]] regularly microfilmed the principal daily newspaper of Jamaica, ''The Gleaner''. ... In 2002 the [[Gleaner Company|Gleaner Publishing Company]] executed an agreement with Heritage Microfilm, Inc. giving to the for-profit firm exclusive rights to reformat and distribute ''The Gleaner'', in both microform and digital format. Because Heritage now holds exclusive digital rights the agreement effectively shifts control of back files ... to the commercial sector, where it is marketed primarily for genealogists and family history researchers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/acrl/conferences/confsandpreconfs/national/05titleindex |title=Knowledge Biodiversity: The Perilous Economics of World News Heritage Materials |author=Bernard F. Reilly, Jr. |date=2005 |work=Association of College and Research Libraries, 2005 national conference |publisher=American Library Association |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] addressed the issue of compensation of works by freelance writers whose work was copied by electronic databases in the case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Tasini]]'' (2001).

'''Kelkoo''' is a European [[price comparison service]] founded in [[France]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="privateequityonline1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.privateequityonline.com/Article.aspx?article=32455&amp;hashID=AFB0D0B34E33B4044A7ADEF3381482A02E58D183 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715114944/http://www.privateequityonline.com/Article.aspx?article=32455&amp;hashID=AFB0D0B34E33B4044A7ADEF3381482A02E58D183 |archive-date=2011-07-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Kelkoo merged with Zoomit, Dondecomprar and Shopgenie. The company was bought by [[Yahoo!]] on March 26, 2004.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3570775.stm&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently sold by Yahoo to Jamplant, a [[United Kingdom|British]] private equity firm, in 2008. On October 13, 2016 Kelkoo, the ecommerce advertising and price comparison platform, announced the acquisition of LeGuide group, &lt;ref name="kelkoo.com"&gt;https://www.kelkoo.com/kelkoo-acquires-leguide-group/&lt;/ref&gt; updating its branding to reflect the acquisition: Kelkoo Group. 

Kelkoo Group operates in 22 countries ([[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[UK]], [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]).

Kelkoo Group is headquartered in [[London]], UK; with operating offices in [[Paris]], [[Grenoble]], [[Vilnius]], [[Oslo]] and [[Milan]]. Richard Stables became chief executive officer ([[CEO]]) of Kelkoo Group in 2009.
== Company History==
Kelkoo was founded in 1999 by [[Pierre Chappaz]] and [[Mauricio Lopez]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo-says-bienvenue-to-Kelkoo/2100-1038_3-5179775.html&lt;/ref&gt; Initial funding of $3 million was provided by [[Banexi Ventures]] and [[Innovacom]].  Once Kelkoo merged with 3 other European businesses, it absorbed those founders into one single collective, consisting of [[Per Siljubergsåsen]], [[William Klippgen]], [[Philip Wilkinson (entrepreneur)|Philip Wilkinson]], and Jorge Garcia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jorge-juan-garcia-alonso/10/372/328&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2000, within days of each other, Kelkoo merged with Spanish-based Dondecomprar.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc.aspx?DOCID=1G1:61906531&amp;print=yes&amp;ctrlInfo=Round20%3AMode20a%3ADocG%3AResult&amp;ao= Spain's Dondecomprar.com merged with Kelkoo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and UK based competitor [[ShopGenie]], founded by [[Philip Wilkinson (entrepreneur)|Philip Wilkinson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/350621 European Merger Creates E-Commerce Giant]&lt;/ref&gt; In September of the same year, Kelkoo merged with Norway-based [[Zoomit.com]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kelkoo.co.uk/b/a/co_5261_128501-consumer-releases-zoomit-merger.html Consumer Releases: Zoomit Merger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; paying the Zoomit-shareholders in shares amounting to a third of Kelkoo's total equity making [[Zoomit.com]] the largest entity within "new" Kelkoo.

In June 2003, the company partnered with the European arm of the [[Microsoft]] site [[MSN]] to provide shopping listings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/150160/kelkoo-seals-msn-deal.html Kelkoo seals MSN deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221026/http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/150160/kelkoo-seals-msn-deal.html |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar deal was announced in June 2004 with [[Ask.com]] (formerly Ask Jeeves).

On March 26, 2004, Kelkoo was bought by [[Yahoo! Inc]] for €450 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/timeline.cfm |title=Yahoo! Inc. - Company Timeline |work=[[Wayback Machine]] |date=2008-07-13 |accessdate=2016-07-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713214826/http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/timeline.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Yahoo explained this move as providing advertisers with the ability to target individual products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1160.html Yahoo! to Acquire Kelkoo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701084008/http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1160.html |date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Kelkoo was sold by [[Yahoo! Inc]] to the private equity firm Jamplant Ltd.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In October 2016, Kelkoo acquired LeGuide group, the price comparison market leader in France. This newly formed group of two historical players had a major impact on the industry, with Kelkoo becoming the European leader in shopping comparison, a unique international position.&lt;ref name="kelkoo.com"/&gt; Kelkoo Group has 20 years of experience in ecommerce, digital advertising and consumer analytics, and is committed to driving exceptional revenue growth for merchants and publishers.

===Company name===
The name "Kelkoo" is a [[phonetic]] spelling meaning primarily the French phrase "Quel coût?", meaning "At what price?". It can also be understood as "Quel coup", meaning "What a bargain".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kelkoo.co.uk/co_5203-how-to-use-kelkoo-frequently-asked-questions.html#8 Kelkoo FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329135628/http://www.kelkoo.co.uk/co_5203-how-to-use-kelkoo-frequently-asked-questions.html |date=2010-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Kelkoo has been profitable since Q4 2002. Similar to other [[price comparison service]]s in how it operates, Kelkoo has focused much of its marketing on capturing users through [[Search engine optimization|SEO]] and launching partner sites&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kelkoo&lt;/ref&gt; including [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s [[PriceTerrier.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-itvs-priceterrier-goes-live-this-dog-stands-alone/ ITV’s PriceTerrier Goes Live]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being a price comparison site, '''Kelkoo''' also offers an API webservice where other price comparison websites, such as [[PriceSpin.com]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pricespin.net/partners.html |title=PriceSpin Data Partners |access-date=2011-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724021606/http://www.pricespin.net/partners.html |archive-date=2011-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:Category:Shopping price comparison websites|shopping comparison website]], and [[SmartShopper.com]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartshopper.com/Partners/OurPartners.aspx SmartShopper Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811072836/http://www.smartshopper.com/Partners/OurPartners.aspx |date=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; price comparison [[Plug-in (computing)|browser add-on]], use data and content from Kelkoo's database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.kelkoo.com/shopping-services/ Kelkoo Shopping Web Services]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[Revenue sharing|shared revenue]] business model. Kelkoo offers an [[Affiliate marketing|affiliate commission]] to the partner sites who use their data for every [[Pay per click|qualified click]] that they generate.

Kelkoo launched their [http://www.kelkoo.com.br Brazil website] in 2012, deciding on Brazil as a market over India and China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinking.grant-thornton.co.uk/emergingmarkets/index.php/article/kelkoos_bric_comparison_picks_out_brazil_for_growth/ Kelkoo arrives in Brazil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405070342/http://thinking.grant-thornton.co.uk/emergingmarkets/index.php/article/kelkoos_bric_comparison_picks_out_brazil_for_growth |date=2013-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
In October 2005 a book on Kelkoo appeared in French called ''Ils ont réussi leur start-up! La success-story de Kelkoo''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/2744061956 Amazon.fr : Ils ont réussi leur Start-up ! : La Success Story de Kelkoo: Livres: Julien Codorniou, Cyrille de Lasteyrie, Pierre Chappaz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; written by Julien Codorniou and Cyrille de Lasteyrie.

[[File:Maurin Quina.svg|thumb|250px|right]]
'''''Maurin Quina''''' is a [[France|French]] [[apéritif]] advertisement painted by [[Leonetto Cappiello]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;  It is perhaps Cappiello's most famous poster.&lt;ref name="au"&gt;National Gallery of Australia. [http://cs.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=144322 "Maurin Quina."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The image features a devilish figure sneakily de-corking the bottle; Cappiello used "infernal imagery" in several of his posters for alcohol.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;  The green devil in particular evokes ''la fée verte'' (the green fairy), the nickname for [[absinthe]], a drink popular during the [[Belle Époque]].&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;  The product was banned by the French government shortly after it was released. This poster, however, is an advertisement for an alcoholic beverage that went out of production in 1906. Maurin is the brand name and Quina is the type of alcohol. The product has since been reintroduced to both the French and American marketplace, featuring Cappiello's poster as the label. It is cherry in flavor with a background of quinine. It is similar to a liqueur, but does not contain enough sugar content to legally be classified as one.

The '''Megatherium Club''' was founded by [[William Stimpson]]. It was a group of [[Washington, D.C.]]-based scientists who were attracted to that city by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s rapidly growing collection, from 1857 to 1866.

Many of the members had no formal education, but came by their expertise through extensive direct observation.  They spent their weekdays in the rigorous and exacting work of describing and classifying species.  But their nights were spent in revelry.&lt;ref name=si-club&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.150.si.edu/chap3/club.htm | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | title=The Megatherium Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They particularly enjoyed partaking in [[ale]], [[oyster]]s, [[eggnog]], and whatever other fineries their meager budgets could afford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.si.edu/#highlightDetail/15/highlightId=648|title=Partying like it's 1855|last=|first=|date=|website=Smithsonian Institution Mobile Website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On Sundays, however, they recuperated from the week's stresses and excesses with long nature [[hiking|hike]]s.

The club was named for the ''[[Megatherium]]'', an extinct genus of [[giant ground sloth]].

The leading spirit of the club was marine biologist [[William Stimpson]], who hosted its earliest meetings in his home.  Members dubbed the place "The Stimpsonian."&lt;ref name=si-club /&gt;  By 1863, though, Stimpson and others had taken up residence in the castle of the actual Smithsonian.&lt;ref name=si-club /&gt; 

Club members were encouraged by [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]], the institution's assistant secretary.  And they attracted a variety of learned speakers to their meetings, including [[Louis Agassiz]], [[John Torrey]], and [[John Cassin]].  But they were eventually thrown out of their castle suites by the institution's secretary, [[Joseph Henry]], who disapproved of the way members held [[sack race]]s in the Great Hall and periodically [[serenade|serenaded]] his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.si.edu/#highlightDetail/15/highlightId=648|title=Partying like it's 1855|last=|first=|date=|website=Smithsonian Institution Mobile Website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Membership was transitory as individuals undertook independent studies abroad, sometimes for years at a time. Formal meetings ceased about the year 1866 when Stimpson moved to [[Chicago]] to oversee that city's [[Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum|Academy of Sciences]].

Several other "Megatherium Clubs" exist; one formed of overseas Smithsonian researchers, yet another only in fiction, supposedly located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]].

#That Sarawak is the heritage of Our Subjects and is held in trust by Ourselves for them.
#That social and education services shall be developed and improved and the standard of living of the people of Sarawak shall steadily be raised.
#That never shall any person or persons be granted rights inconsistent with those of the people of this country or be in any way permitted to exploit Our Subjects or those who have sought Our protection and care.
#That justice shall be freely obtainable and that the Rajah and every public servant shall be easily accessible to the public.
#That freedom of expression both in speech and in writing shall be permitted and encouraged and that everyone shall be entitled to worship as he pleases.
#That public servants shall ever remember that they are but the servants of the people on whose goodwill and co-operation they are entirely dependent.
#That so far as may be Our Subjects of whatever race or creed shall be freely and impartially admitted to offices in Our Service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability and integrity duly to discharge.
#That the goal of self-government shall always be kept in mind, that the people of Sarawak shall be entrusted in due course with the governance of themselves, and that continuous efforts shall be made to hasten the reaching of this goal by educating them in the obligations, the responsibilities, and the privileges of citizenship.
#That the general policy of Our predecessors and Ourselves whereby the various races of the State have been enabled to live in happiness and harmony together shall be adhered to by Our successors and Our servants and all who may follow them hereafter.

'''phpLDAPadmin''' is a [[web app]] for administering [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP) servers.&lt;ref name=unleashed&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hG_bhCL4tQ8C&amp;pg=PA574|title=Ubuntu Unleashed, 2012 Edition|last1=Helmke |first1=Matthew |isbn=978-0672335785|page=574|publisher=[[SAMS Publishing]]|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/377952:manage-ldap-data-with-phpldapadmin|title=Making LDAP Easy on Linux with phpLDAPadmin|work=[[Linux.com]]|date=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It's  written in the [[PHP]] programming language, and is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]]. The application is available in 14 languages&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; and supports [[UTF-8]] encoded directory strings.

==History==
The project began in Fall of 2002 when Dave Smith, a student from [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) and lead developer, needed a robust web application to manage his LDAP servers. Originally, phpLDAPadmin was called DaveDAP, but in August 2003, the name was changed to phpLDAPadmin. Since that time, the software has been downloaded approximately 150 times per day, and is commonly used throughout the world. Two other developers have contributed to the code base: Xavier Renard and Uwe Ebel. Xavier has focused on [[LDAP Data Interchange Format|LDIF]] imports/exports and [[Samba software]] integration. Uwe has focused on internationalizing the application.

In Spring of 2005, Deon George took over maintenance of phpLDAPadmin.&lt;ref name=deon/&gt;

No new pull requests have been merged into the master project since 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/leenooks/phpLDAPadmin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&lt;/ref&gt;, and no further releases made.  The product is no longer compatible with the recent versions of PHP and has effectively become [[abandonware]].

The '''''Qieyun''''' ({{zh|t=切韻|p=Qièyùn}}) is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[rime dictionary]], published in 601 CE during the [[Sui dynasty]]. The book was a guide to proper reading of classical texts, using the ''[[fanqie]]'' method to indicate the pronunciation of [[Chinese character]]s.
The ''Qieyun'' and later redactions, notably the ''[[Guangyun]]'', are important documentary sources used in the reconstruction of [[historical Chinese phonology]].

==History==
The book was created by Lu Fayan (Lu Fa-yen; 陸法言) in 601. The preface of the ''Qieyun'' describes how the plan of the book originated from a discussion with eight of his friends 20 years earlier at his home in [[Chang'an]], the capital of [[Sui dynasty|Sui China]].
{{quotation|When it grew late and we had been drinking wine for most of the evening, we began discussing the sounds and the rhymes.  Modern pronunciations are naturally varied; moreover, those who have written on the sounds and the rhymes have not always been in agreement. [...]

So we discussed the rights and wrongs of the North and the South and the comprehensible and incomprehensible of the ancients and moderns.  We wanted to select the precise and discard the extraneous, [...]

So under the candlelight I took up the brush and jotted down an outline.  We consulted each other extensively and argued vigorously.  We came close to getting the essence.|Lu Fayan|''Qieyun''|preface, translated by S. Robert Ramsey{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=116–117}}}}
[[File:Tangyun - Chinese Dictionary Museum.JPG|thumb|upright|left|''Tangyun'' excerpt in the Chinese Dictionary Museum]]
None of these scholars was originally from Chang'an; they were native speakers of differing dialects – five northern and three southern.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=25}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=37}} According to Lu, [[Yan Zhitui]] (顏之推) and Xiao Gai (蕭該), both men originally from the south, were the most influential in setting up the norms on which the ''Qieyun'' was based.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=25}}
However, the dictionary was compiled by Lu alone, consulting several earlier dictionaries, none of which have survived.{{sfnp|Coblin|1996|pp=89–90}}

When classical Chinese poetry flowered during the [[Tang dynasty]], the ''Qieyun'' became the authoritative source for literary pronunciations and it repeatedly underwent revisions and enlargements. It was annotated in 677 by Zhǎngsūn Nèyán (長孫訥言), revised and published in 706 by Wáng Renxu (王仁煦) as the ''Kanmiu Buque Qieyun'' (刊謬補缺切韻; "Corrected and supplemented ''Qieyun''"), collated and republished in 751 by Sun Mian (孫愐) as the ''Tángyùn'' (唐韻; "Tang rimes"), and eventually incorporated into the still-extant ''[[Guangyun]]'' and ''[[Jiyun]]'' rime dictionaries from the [[Song dynasty]].{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=38–39}} Although most of these Tang dictionary redactions were believed lost, some fragments were discovered among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] and manuscripts discovered at [[Turpan]].{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=38–39}}{{sfnp|Bottéro|2013|pp=35–37}}

The Buddhist [[Kingdom of Qocho|Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho]] used a version of the ''Qieyun''.{{sfnp|Takata|2004|p=337}}

During the Tang dynasty, several copyists were engaged in producing manuscripts to meet the great demand for revisions of the work.
Particularly prized were copies of Wáng Rénxū's edition made in the early 9th century by Wú Cǎiluán (呉彩鸞), a woman famed for her calligraphy.{{sfnp|Takata|2004|p=333}}
One of these copies was acquired by [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] (1100–1126), himself a keen calligrapher.  It remained in the palace library until 1926, when part of the library followed the deposed emperor [[Puyi]] to [[Tianjin]] and then to [[Changchun]], capital of the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].  After the Japanese surrender in 1945, it passed to a book dealer in Changchun, and in 1947 two scholars discovered it in a book market in [[Liulichang]], Beijing.{{sfnp|Malmqvist|2010|pp=299–300}}

Studies of this almost complete copy have been published by the Chinese linguists Dong Tonghe (1948 and 1952) and [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]] (1956).{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=39}}

==Structure==
{{further|Rime dictionary}}
[[File:Qieyun Dong entry.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.4|The first entry in the ''Qieyun'']]
The ''Qieyun'' contains 12,158 character entries.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1984|p=139}}
These were divided into five volumes, two for the many words of the "level" tone, and one volume for each of the other [[four tones]].
The entries were divided into 193 final rhyme groups (each named by its first character, called the ''yùnmù'' 韻目, or "rhyme eye").
Each rhyme group was subdivided into homophone groups (''xiǎoyùn'' 小韻 "small rhyme").
The first entry in each homophone group gives the pronunciation as a ''fanqie'' formula.{{sfnp|Takata|2004}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=33–35}}

For example, the first entry in the ''Qieyun'', shown at right, describes the character 東 ''dōng'' "east". The three characters on the right are a ''fanqie'' pronunciation key, marked by the character 反 ''fǎn'' "turn back".  This indicates that the word is pronounced with the initial of 德 [tək] and the final of 紅 [ɣuŋ], i.e. [tuŋ].  The word is glossed as 木方 ''mù fāng'', i.e. the direction of wood (one of the [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]]), while the numeral 二 "two" indicates that this is the first of two entries in a homophone group.

Later rime dictionaries had many more entries, with full definitions and a few additional rhyme groups, but kept the same structure.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=33}}

The ''Qieyun'' did not directly record [[Middle Chinese]] as a spoken language, but rather how characters ''should'' be pronounced when reading the classics. Since this rime dictionary's spellings are the primary source for reconstructing Middle Chinese, linguists have disagreed over what variety of Chinese it recorded. "Much ink has been spilled concerning the nature of the language underlying the ''Qieyun''," says Norman (1988: 24), who lists three points of view. Some scholars, like [[Bernhard Karlgren]], "held to the view that the ''Qieyun'' represented the language of Chang'an"; some "others have supposed that it represented an amalgam of regional pronunciations," technically known as a [[diasystem]]. "At the present time most people in the field accept the views of the Chinese scholar Zhou Zumo" (周祖謨; 1914–1995) that ''Qieyun'' spellings were a north-south regional compromise between literary pronunciations from the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1590">[[File:Paris Grand Palais, 18 July 2005.jpg|thumb|Grand Palais]]
The '''Réunion des Musées Nationaux''' ('''RMN''') is a French cultural umbrella organisation, an [[établissement public à caractère industriel et commercial]] (EPIC), formed in 2011 through the merger of the Paris National Museums and the [[Grand Palais]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rmn.fr/les-activites-de-la-rmn-gp/la-rmn-et-le-grand-palais-reunis Grand Palais (RMN)]". RMN. Retrieved 30 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its genesis came about in 1896 under the leadership of the French statesmen [[Raymond Poincaré]] and [[Georges Leygues]], with the aim of purchasing works of art for national collections. The institution has three current directives: the welcoming of the public, the organizing of temporary exhibitions, and the holding of exhibitions and its permanent collections.

The RMN is responsible for 34 national museums. Two statutes exist for these national museums; most are also public institutions with legal and financial autonomy. The others are services with national jurisdiction ({{ill|Service à compétence nationale|lt=SCN|fr}}), attached to the Museums Department of France ({{ill|Service des Musées de France|lt=SMF|fr}}).

'''YP Connecticut Information Services LLC''', originally '''SNET Information Services, Inc.''', was the directory publishing arm of [[Southern New England Telecommunications]]. It is currently owned by [[YP Holdings]] and publishes telephone directories for [[Southern New England Telephone]] customers under the '''YP Real Yellow Pages''' name.

==History==
When its parent, [[Southern New England Telecommunications]], was acquired by [[SBC Communications]] in 1998, its operations remained largely independent of other SBC directory companies. In 2003, however, following brand standardization, the SNET Yellow Pages were rebranded the SBC Yellow Pages. In 2005, following SBC's acquisition of [[AT&amp;T Corp.|AT&amp;T]], the SNET directories were rebranded as the '''AT&amp;T Yellow Pages'''. 

In 2006, following [[BellSouth]]'s purchase by [[AT&amp;T]], the directory company itself was rebranded as '''AT&amp;T Advertising &amp; Publishing''', the collective name of all of AT&amp;T's directory operations.

In 2012, the company's operations were reincorporated in [[Delaware]] as '''YP Connecticut Information Services LLC'''. The company was sold to [[YP Holdings]].

In 2014, AT&amp;T sold off Southern New England Telephone to [[Frontier Communications]]. However, YP continues to publish its Connecticut directories with the AT&amp;T name and logo as official directories for SNET customers are published by [[Local Insight Yellow Pages]], publisher of FrontierPages.

'''''S v Mhlungu and Others''''' is a decision of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]] in which the court interpreted a transitional provision in the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa]] relating to the handling of criminal cases that were pending when that constitution came into force on 27 April 1994. The ruling, handed down on 8 June 1995, held that such cases were subject to the [[human rights]] protections in Chapter 3 of the Interim Constitution despite a clause appearing to exclude them.

The '''spotback skate''' (''Atlantoraja castelnaui'') is a species of [[fish]] in the [[Rajidae]] family. It is found off the Atlantic coasts of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[Uruguay]] where its natural [[habitat]] is over the continental shelf in the open [[sea]]. It is a large fish, growing to over a metre in length. It feeds mainly on other fish according to availability, with shrimps, octopuses and other invertebrates also being eaten. Reproduction takes place throughout most of the year, with the eggs being laid in capsules that adhere to the seabed. The spotback skate is the subject of a fishery and is thought to be overfished, resulting in [[Greenpeace]] adding the fish to its red list of fish to be avoided, and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] listing it as an "[[endangered species]]".

== Distribution ==
The ''Atlantoraja castelnaui'' are found in the Southwest South Atlantic Ocean from Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil to Argentina.  They prefer warm-temperate waters at depths ranging from 20 to 220 m.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journal.nafo.int/38/oddone/5-oddone.pdf|title = Length-weight relationships, condition and population structure of the genus ''Atlantoraja'' (Elasmobranchii, Rajidae, Arhynchobatinae) in Southeastern Brazilian waters, SW Atlantic Ocean|last = Oddone|first = Maria Cristine|date = 2015-10-28|journal = Journal of Northwest Atlantic Fishery Science |volume=38 |pages=43–52 |doi = |pmid = |access-date = 29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, they can be found as natives to the Argentinian Zoogeographic Province. They seek warm water climates, and are often reported to have a more southern distribution than normal in correlation with higher water temperatures. Spotback skates may migrate only slightly or perform slight periodic backwards and forwards movement depending on ocean water temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovcon|first1=N. D.|last2=Cochia|first2=P. D.|last3=Góngora|first3=M. E.|last4=Gosztonyi|first4=A. E.|title=New records of warm-temperate water fishes in central Patagonian coastal waters (Southwestern South Atlantic Ocean) |journal=Journal of Applied Ichthyology |date=2011 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=832–839 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01594.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no notable seasonal variation for the species as they populate southern waters year round.

Although the location of their distribution has not been affected, the quantity of the spotback's distribution has lowered in many places and continues to be threatened by humans fishing in its habitats.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Reproduction ==
The length of maturity for males and females differ with males ranging from 185 to 1250&amp;nbsp;mm in total length and females ranging from 243 to 1368&amp;nbsp;mm in total length.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Males have a continuous production of mature spermatozoa suggests they can reproduce throughout the year but studies have shown higher values in certain months but they are not significant. Females also reproduce year-round with peaks of reproductive activity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Female spotback skates lay their eggs on the ocean floor and leave them there. There is not parental care so the eggs have a capsule that protects the embryo's development once the mother leaves.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1679-87592008000100007&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|title = Description of the egg capsule of ''Atlantoraja castelnaui'' (Elasmobranchii, Rajidae)|last = Oddone|first = Maria C.|date = 2008|journal = Brazilian Journal of Oceanography |doi = 10.1590/S1679-87592008000100007|pmid = |access-date = 29 October 2015|volume = 56|issue = 1|pages = 65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collected egg capsules typically are rectangular and have horny process in each corner. They are also shiny and are medium brown in color.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The capsules on the eggs are covered by adhesion fibrils that allow the egg to attach itself to the sea floor immediately after the mother releases them. These adhesion fibrils are also seen in other species of skates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The surface of the capsule is striated and presents a rough surface though it is relatively smooth. ''Atlantoraja castelnaui'' capsule's are also the largest egg capsule in its genus and compared to other co-occurring species in the same area and depth of the ocean.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Conservation status ==
In the cities of Santos and Guarujá, specimens of the spotback skate which are deemed large enough to have commercial value are commonly landed and marketed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oddone|first1=María C.|last2=Amorim|first2=Alberto F.|last3=Mancini|first3=Patricia L.|title=Reproductive biology of the spotback skate, ''Atlantoraja castelnaui'' (Ribeiro, 1907) (Chondrichthyes, Rajidae), in southeastern Brazilian waters|journal=Revista de Biología Marina y Oceanografía|date=2008|volume=43|issue=2|pages=327–334|url=http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/revbiolmar/v43n2/art10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999 to present, the market for the meat of the spotback skate has expanded to Asia, particularly South Korea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, commercial fishing has led to an overexploitation of the species and its consequent listing as an endangered species.

Spotback skates are particularly vulnerable to extinction&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; due to their large body size relative to other skate species. According to Dulvy &amp; Reynolds (2002), skate species considered to be locally extinct have larger body sizes compared to all other skates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Large body size is in turn correlated with higher mortality rates and with life-history parameters such as late age at maturity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another study by García et al. (2007) also corroborated the notion that a large body size increased the extinction risk in elasmobranchs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Spotback skates are also especially vulnerable to trawl fisheries because they inhabit the soft bottom substrates of the ocean (Ebert; Sulikowski, 2007).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Size and sex composition of two species of the genus ''Atlantoraja'' (Elasmobranchii, Rajidae) caught by the bottom trawl fisheries operating on the Uruguayan continental shelf (southwestern Atlantic Ocean)|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1679-87592011000400006&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal = Brazilian Journal of Oceanography |pages = 357–364|volume = 59|issue = 4|doi = 10.1590/S1679-87592011000400006|first = Luis|last = Orlando|first2 = Ines|last2 = Pereyra|first3 = Laura|last3 = Paesch|first4 = Walter|last4 = Norbis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the biomass of spotback skates has decreased by 75% from 1994 to 1999.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Behavior and eating habits ==
The spotback skate is found across most of the continental shelf year round.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbini|first1=Santiago A.|last2=Lucifora|first2=Luis O.|title=Feeding habits of a large endangered skate from the south-west Atlantic: the spotback skate, ''Atlantoraja castelnaui'' |journal=Marine and Freshwater Research |date=2012|volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=180–188 |doi=10.1071/MF11170 |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256840973_Feeding_habits_of_a_large_endangered_skate_from_the_Southwest_Atlantic_the_spotback_skate_Atlantoraja_castelnaui}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spotback skate's diet is a versatile and mainly piscivorous consumer. Their diet shifts with increasing body size and as a response to seasonal and regional changes in prey abundance and distribution. They prey mostly on teleost, cephalopods, elasmobranchs, and decapods. Smaller spotback skate tend to consume decapods and the larger skates ate elasmobranchs and cephalopods.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the diet of ''Bathyraja macloviana'', a benthophagous skate|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.12159/abstract|journal = Journal of Fish Biology|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1095-8649|pages = 156–169|volume = 83|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/jfb.12159|first = S. A.|last = Barbini|first2 = L. B.|last2 = Scenna|first3 = D. E.|last3 = Figueroa|first4 = J. M.|last4 = Díaz de Astarloa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumption of teleosts differed between seasons depending on whether the teleost were demersal- benthic or benthic. The more demersal- benthic teleosts were consumed during the cold season while the benthic teleosts were eaten during the warm season.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The decapods, cephalopods and elasmobranchs were predominantly shrimps, octopuses, and skates. The main cephalopod consumed in the warm season was the octopus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Sustainable consumption ==
In 2010, Greenpeace International has added the spotback skate to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephanus pagination''' is a system of reference and organization used in modern editions and translations of [[Plato]] (and less famously, [[Plutarch]]) based on the three volume 1578 edition&lt;ref&gt;''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'' edidit Henricus Stephanus, Genevae, 1578.&lt;/ref&gt; of Plato's complete works translated by Joannes Serranus ([[Jean de Serres]]) and published by Henricus Stephanus ([[Henri Estienne]]) in [[Geneva]].

==Overview==
In the case of Plato's works, Stephanus pagination first divides the works into numbers that are the page numbers of each of the Stephanus edition's three volumes, and each such page and page number is further subdivided into lettered sections which correspond to parallel Greek/Latin translated passages on a given page, mostly commonly a, b, c, d, and e.  This system is used in modern scholarship to cite Plato.  For Plato's works, unique coordinates for a passage can therefore be given with three pieces of information: the work's name, the (Stephanus) page number, and the letter denoting the passage.  For example, "''Symposium'' 172a" cites ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', Stephanus page 172 (the volume in which ''Symposium'' occurs, as it happens, volume 3), passage a.  To avoid ambiguity in this scheme, either the Platonic work or the volume must be cited; absent this, "page 50" might refer to any of the "pages 50" across Stephanus' three volumes.  Reference to Stephanus manifestly presupposes the existing ordering of the work in its given volumes, but given historical disagreement as to the chronology and proper ordering of Plato's works, care should therefore be taken when referring to Stephanus pagination as opposed to another scheme.

More specific citations may add line numbers, e.g. ''Symposium'' 209a5–9, but these generally refer to the lines in [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]]'s [[Oxford Classical Text]], not to Estienne's line divisions.

There are some peculiarities in the Stephanus page numbers. The length of each page and each paragraph can vary if extra commentary appears on the page of the 1578 edition. Thus Stephanus pages are not all of the same length. Some pages do not have all the paragraphs a through e. There are also gaps in the sequence of Stephanus page numbers for Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]''. The reason is that the editors added separate introductions to each 'book' of these longer works, and thus the page numbers of these introductions are not used to refer to pages in Plato's dialogues. 

The spurious dialogue ''[[Halcyon (dialogue)|Halcyon]]'' was included in the corpus of [[Lucian]]'s works and does not have Stephanus numbers.

[[Bekker numbering]] is the comparable system for the works of [[Aristotle]], and [[Diels–Kranz numbering]] is the comparable system for [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]].  Unlike Stephanus pagination, Bekker numbering starts with page 1 and proceeds through all of Aristotle's works without starting over, regardless of the number of volumes needed for a given edition.  Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage, not shared by Stephanus pagination, of giving compact, unambiguous numerical citation of a given passage, page, etc, without the absolute necessity in order to avoid ambiguity to specify the dialogue, work or volume which exists in the case of Stephanus.

'''''The Flight of the Wild Gander''''' is a 1969 book by mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], in which he collects a number of his early essays and forwards. Essays include "Bios and Mythos" (on the psycho-biological sources of mythic forms and symbols), "Mythogenesis" (on the rise and fall of a single Native American legend) and "The Symbol without Meaning" (about the secularization of myths in the modern age).

The ''wild gander'' of the title is a reference to the [[Hindu]] concept of the  [[paramahamsa]], a great spiritual teacher of exalted illumination, able to transcend the mundane, just as the ''hamsa'' is able to fly above the sky-scraping Himalayas.

Published originally in 1969 by [[Viking Press]], the book was rereleased by [[HarperCollins|Harper and Row]] in 1990. The third edition was published by [[New World Library]] in 2002, making ''The Flight of the Wild Gander'' the third title in the [[Joseph Campbell Foundation]]'s [[Collected Works of Joseph Campbell]] series.

'''''The Polish White Book''''' is a semi-official name of a series of comprehensive reports published during World War II by the Ministry of Information of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London, England; dealing with the Polish-German relations before-and-after the joint [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi-Soviet aggression against Poland]] in 1939. Each publication, released in English, French, German and Polish between 1940 and 1941, consisted of official documents and affidavits, supplemented with an overview by the Ministry. Notably the ''Polish White Book'' was released parallel with ''[[The Black Book of Poland]]'' series by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]] of New York, published in London by [[Hutchinson &amp; Co]] under a differing title in 1942.&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt;

==Publishing history==
The first volume of the ''White Book'' publication series, released in spring 1940, was titled ''Official Documents Concerning Polish-German and Polish-Soviet Relations 1933–1939 – Polish White Book.''&lt;ref name="Kochanski"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War |author=Halik Kochanski |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJ5vIyDBpLcC&amp;pg=PA708 |page=708 |year=2012 |ISBN=0674068165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book described and documented the Polish-German negotiations in the lead-up to World War II.&lt;ref name="Hansard"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1940/apr/03/polish-white-book-publication |title=Commons and Lords Hansard, the Official Report of debates in Parliament |work=HANSARD.

The third volume of ''The Polish White Book'' was titled the ''German Occupation of Poland. Extract of Note Addressed to The Allied and Neutral Powers.'' It is a 240-page report published in 1941 during World War II by the Ministry of Information of the [[Polish government-in-exile]], describing atrocities committed by Germany in [[occupied Poland]]. It contains 180 appendixes with lists, names, dates and the circumstances of Nazi brutality toward Polish civilians including men, women and children. Most of the book consists of appendixes, documenting the locations of [[Nazi ghettos]] where thousands of Jews perished; and the shift in extermination tactics from shootings to poisoning by gas. The affidavits confirm [[Heinrich Himmler]]’s personal involvement in the liquidation of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and the final transports to [[death camps]]. The ''Polish White Book'' was written as a plea for help to the world community. At the time of its compilation, there were two million [[Polish Jews]] still alive in occupied Poland and hoping for an international rescue effort.&lt;ref name="wayback2"/&gt;

==Contents==
As the reports of Nazi [[war crimes]] in occupied Poland increased dramatically, new volumes of ''The Polish White Book'' series were released. The ''German Occupation of Poland'' (1941) – also known as the second volume of ''The German Invasion of Poland'' (1940) – is sometimes considered a preamble to ''[[The Black Book of Poland]]'' (1942) by the [[Polish government-in-exile]].&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt; The ''White Books'' by the Polish Ministry were released over the course of two years.&lt;ref name="wayback2"/&gt; The original ''Polish White Book'', along with its subsequent volumes were published in both Paris by ''[[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]]'' and in London by [[Hutchinson &amp; Co]].&lt;ref name="wayback2"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[p.13 of 253 in PDF]&lt;/sup&gt;

The final ''White Book'' titled ''German Occupation of Poland. Extract of Note Addressed to the Allied and Neutral Powers'' was released by Greystone Press of New York in 1941. The book contained 55-page overview, signed by Auguste Zaleski in London on May 3, 1941, and 180 Appendixes with evidence of forced expulsions and deportations of Jews to overcrowded ghettos where starvation and disease were commonplace, along with evidence of deliberate destruction of the Polish nationhood; for the total of 243 printed pages.&lt;ref name="wayback2"&gt;{{cite book |work=Archive.org (253 pages in PDF) |url=https://archive.org/stream/GermanOccupationOfPoland/German%20Occupation%20of%20Poland#page/n1/mode/2up |title=German Occupation of Poland.

The ''White Book'' was followed by ''[[The Black Book of Poland]]'' printed by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]] of New York in 1942. It was a collection of authenticated documents, depositions, eye-witness accounts, and Ministerial summaries, describing and illustrating with photographs, the [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation]] and [[War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II]] committed in mere two years: including massacres, tortures, expulsions, forced colonization, persecution, destruction of culture, and humiliation of a nation.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Black Book of Poland |url=https://archive.org/details/TheBlackBookOfPoland |location=New York |publisher=G.P.

'''Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century''' is a compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people, published in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1999.

The idea for such a list started on February 1, 1998, with a debate at a symposium in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]]. The panel participants were former ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' anchor [[Dan Rather]], historian [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], former [[New York governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]], then–Stanford Provost [[Condoleezza Rice]], publisher [[Irving Kristol]], and ''Time'' managing editor [[Walter Isaacson]].

In a separate issue on December 31, 1999, ''Time'' recognized [[Albert Einstein]] as the Person of the Century.

==List categories==
''Time''{{'}}s article cites twenty persons in each of five broad categories: Leaders and Revolutionaries, Scientists and Thinkers, Builders and Titans, Artists and Entertainers, and Heroes and Icons.

==Person of the Century==
[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Albert Einstein]]
Of the 100 chosen, [[Albert Einstein]] was chosen as the Person of the Century, on the grounds that he was the preeminent scientist in a century dominated by science. The editors of ''Time'' believed the 20th century "will be remembered foremost for its science and technology", and Einstein "serves as a symbol of all the scientists—such as [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Richard Feynman]], ...who built upon his work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Einstein as Person of the Century (or Not?)|journal=AIP History Newsletter|date=Spring 2000|volume=XXXVII|issue=1|url=http://www.aip.org/history/newsletter/spring2000/einstein.htm|accessdate=17 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902052216/http://www.aip.org/history/newsletter/spring2000/einstein.htm|archivedate=2 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the magazine featured the famous image of Einstein taken in 1947 by American portrait photographer [[Philippe Halsman]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Mussolini and Hitler, most influential dictators of the 20th century]]
It was debated whether [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], responsible for World War II, [[The Holocaust]], and the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], should have been made Persons of the Century for their influence in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3879888/adolf-hitler-benito-mussolini-color-photos-of-chummy-warmongers/|title=Hitler and Mussolini: Color Photos of Chummy Warmongers|work=Time|first=Ben|last=Cosgrove|date=17 February 1999|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The argument was based on ''Time'''s explicit criterion that the persons chosen should have the greatest impact on this century, for better or worse. In the same 31 December 1999 issue of ''Time'', essayist Nancy Gibbs addressed the topic with the article ''The Necessary Evil?'' In the article, she argues that Hitler and Mussolini "were simply the latest in a long line of murderous figures, stretching back to before [[Genghis Khan]]. The only difference was technology: Both Hitler and Mussolini went about their cynical carnage with all the efficiency that modern industry had perfected" and present several [[rhetorical question]]s such as "Evil may be a powerful force, a seductive idea, but is it more powerful than genius, creativity, courage or generosity?"&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993038,00.html|title=The Necessary Evil?|work=Time|first=Nancy|last=Gibbs|date=31 December 1999|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

The list of the top 20 Artists and Entertainers, in particular, was criticized for not including [[Elvis Presley]], a decision Handy initially defended in the following way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most important, innovative things about rock is the whole notion of songwriters singing their own works, of the immediacy of expression. Since Elvis didn't write his own material, unlike [[The Beatles]] or [[Bob Dylan]] or [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], who's also someone who could have been included, maybe that cut against him… I think the Beatles pushed the envelope a lot further. Elvis' most original recordings were his first. The Beatles started out as imitators, then continued to grow throughout their years together.&lt;ref name="chat"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/time100/sinatra_chat.html TIME 100: Artist &amp; Entertainers – Bruce Handy] Yahoo Chat 4 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Handy was also asked to defend ''Time''{{'}}s decision to include the fictional character [[Bart Simpson]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' television series among the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, and he did so as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't see how you can look at this century and not include cartoons. They're one of our great contributions, along with jazz and film. (I know, I know. The movies were a 19th-century invention. But we 20th century folks really put them to good use.)… To some extent, too, we wanted people who also represented important 20th century trends or developments. That would help account for the Barts and Oprahs&lt;ref name="chat"/&gt;... What Bart, or really the Simpsons, have done is merge social satire with popular animation in a way that hasn't really been done before.&lt;ref name="chat"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
The list also received criticism for its inclusion of [[Lucky Luciano]], who was chosen in part because "he modernized the Mafia, shaping it into a smoothly run national crime syndicate focused on the bottom line". New York mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] accused ''Time'' of "romanticizing" gangsters, and he stated: "The idea that he civilized the Mafia is absurd. He murdered in order to get the position that he had, and then he authorized hundreds and hundreds of murders." The selection was called an "outrage" by Philip Cannistraro, a Queens College professor of Italian-American studies, and Thomas Vitale, the New York State vice president of Fieri, an Italian-American charitable organization, criticized ''Time'' for "perpetuating myths" about Italian-Americans. However, ''Time'' business editor Bill Saporito defended the selection by describing Luciano as "kind of an evil genius" who had a deep impact on the underground economy. "We're not out there to heap glory on these people", he explained. "We're out to say these are people who influenced our lives." Saporito further noted that "every piece of merchandise that came out of the Garment District had a little extra cost in it because of organized crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/12/01/1998-12-01_it_s_no_time_to_laud_luciano.html|location=New York|work=Daily News|title=It's No Time To Laud Luciano, Says Rudy|date=1 December 1998|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310192449/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/12/01/1998-12-01_it_s_no_time_to_laud_luciano.html|archivedate=10 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum''' ({{lang-km|សារមន្ទីរឧក្រិដ្ឋកម្មប្រល័យពូជសាសន៍ទួលស្លែង}}) is a museum in [[Phnom Penh]], the capital of [[Cambodia]], chronicling the [[Cambodian genocide]]. The site is a former [[secondary school]] which was used as '''Security Prison 21 (S-21)''' by the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime from its rise to power in 1975 to its fall in 1979. From 1976 to 1979, an estimated 20,000 people were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng (the real number is unknown). Tuol Sleng ({{lang-km|ទួលស្លែង}} {{IPA-km|tuəl slaeŋ}}) means "Hill of the Poisonous Trees" or "[[Strychnos nux-vomica|Strychnine]] Hill". Tuol Sleng was just one of at least 150 torture and execution centers established by the Khmer Rouge,&lt;ref&gt;Locard, Henri, [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/cambodia/locard.pdf State Violence in Democratic Kampuchea (1975-1979) and Retribution (1979-2004)], ''European Review of History'', Vol. 12, No. 1, March 2005, pp.121–143.&lt;/ref&gt; though other sources put the figure at 196 prison centers. On July 26, 2010, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia convicted the chief of Tuol Sleng Prison, [[Kang Kek Iew|Kaing kek Iew]], (alias Duch) for crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and sentenced him to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/1|website=Extraordinary Chambers of the Courts of Cambodia|accessdate=05/09/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly the Chao Ponhea Yat High School,&lt;ref name=dccam-history-of-dk&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979)| publisher=Documentation Center of Cambodia | page=74 | url=http://www.dccam.org/ | isbn=99950-60-04-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after a royal ancestor of King [[Norodom Sihanouk]], the five buildings of the complex were converted in March/April 1976 into a prison and interrogation center. Before other buildings in town were used already as prison S-21. The Khmer Rouge renamed the complex "Security Prison 21" (S-21) and construction began to adapt the prison to the inmates: the buildings were enclosed in electrified barbed wire, the classrooms converted into tiny prison and torture chambers, and all windows were covered with iron bars and barbed wire to prevent escapes and suicides.

From 1976 to 1979, an estimated 20,000 people were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng (the real number is unknown). At any one time, the prison held between 1,000–1,500 prisoners. They were repeatedly tortured and coerced into naming family members and close associates, who were in turn arrested, tortured and killed. In the early months of S-21's existence, most of the victims were from the previous [[Lon Nol]] regime and included soldiers, government officials, as well as academics, doctors, teachers, students, factory workers, monks, engineers, etc. Later, the party leadership's paranoia turned on its own ranks and purges throughout the country saw thousands of party activists and their families brought to Tuol Sleng and murdered.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt; Those arrested included some of the highest ranking communist politicians such as [[Khoy Thoun]], [[Vorn Vet]] and [[Hu Nim]]. Although the official reason for their arrest was "espionage", these men may have been viewed by Khmer Rouge leader [[Pol Pot]] as potential leaders of a coup against him. Prisoners' families were sometimes brought ''en masse'' to be interrogated and later executed at the [[Choeung Ek]] extermination center.

In 1979, the prison was uncovered by the invading [[Vietnam People's Army|Vietnamese army]]. In 1979/80, the prison was reopened by the government of the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] as a historical museum memorializing the actions of the Khmer Rouge regime.

===Life in the prison===

Upon arrival at the prison, prisoners were [[Mugshot|photographed]] and required to give detailed autobiographies, beginning with their childhood and ending with their arrest. After that, they were forced to strip to their underwear, and their possessions were confiscated. The prisoners were then taken to their cells. Those taken to the smaller cells were shackled to the walls or the concrete floor. Those who were held in the large mass cells were collectively shackled to long pieces of iron bar.  The shackles were fixed to alternating bars; the prisoners slept with their heads in opposite directions. They slept on the floor without mats, mosquito nets, or blankets. They were forbidden to talk to each other.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt;

The day in the prison began at 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. when prisoners were ordered to strip for inspection. The guards checked to see if the shackles were loose or if the prisoners had hidden objects they could use to commit suicide. Over the years, several prisoners managed to kill themselves, so the guards were very careful in checking the shackles and cells. The prisoners received four small spoonfuls of rice porridge and watery soup of leaves twice a day. Drinking water without asking the guards for permission resulted in serious beatings. The inmates were hosed down every four days.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt;

The prison had very strict regulations, and severe beatings were inflicted upon any prisoner who tried to disobey. Almost every action had to be approved by one of the prison's guards. They were sometimes forced to eat human feces and drink human urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The prison's medical staff were untrained and offered treatment only to sustain prisoners' lives after they had been injured during interrogation. When prisoners were taken from one place to another for interrogation, they were blindfolded. Guards and prisoners were not allowed to converse. Moreover, within the prison, people who were in different groups were not allowed to have contact with one another.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt;

===Torture and extermination===

Most prisoners at S-21 were held there for two to three months. However, several high-ranking Khmer Rouge cadres were held longer. Within two or three days after they were brought to S-21, all prisoners were taken for interrogation.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt; The torture system at Tuol Sleng was designed to make prisoners confess to whatever crimes they were charged with by their captors. Prisoners were routinely beaten and tortured with electric shocks, searing hot metal instruments and hanging, as well as through the use of various other devices. Some prisoners were cut with knives or suffocated with plastic bags. Other methods for generating confessions included pulling out fingernails while pouring alcohol on the wounds, holding prisoners' heads under water, and the use of the [[waterboarding]] technique (see picture). Women were sometimes raped by the interrogators, even though sexual abuse was against Democratic Kampuchea (DK) policy. The perpetrators who were found out were executed.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt; Although many prisoners died from this kind of abuse, killing them outright was discouraged, since the Khmer Rouge needed their confessions. The "Medical Unit" at Tuol Sleng, however, did kill at least 100 prisoners by bleeding them to death.&lt;ref name=duch_guilty&gt;{{cite news |first=Jared |last=Ferrie |title=Khmer Rouge executioner found guilty, but Cambodians say sentence too light |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2010/0726/Khmer-Rouge-executioner-found-guilty-but-Cambodians-say-sentence-too-light |accessdate=2010-07-26 | work=Christian Science Monitor | date=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proved that medical experiments were performed on certain prisoners. There is clear evidence that patients in Cambodia were sliced open and had organs removed with no anesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.d.dccam.org/Tribunal/Analysis/pdf/Prosecuting_Khmer_Rouge_Medical_Practices_as_Crimes_against_Humanity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/2016/06/16/propaganda-torture-and-french-colonial-heritage-looking-into-the-methods-of-the-khmer-rouge/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is also some evidence that inmates were drained of blood in order to study how long they would survive.&lt;ref name="malone1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1212360/The-Englishman-butchered-Cambodias-killing-fields-The-terrifying-tale-British-tourist-blundered-horror-Pol-Pots-Khmer-Rouge.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Andrew | last=Malone | title=The Englishman butchered in Cambodia's killing fields: The terrifying tale of the British tourist who blundered into horror of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge | date=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/16/cambodia-killing-fields-genocide-trials|title=Cambodia: Trial gives killing fields survivors a chance of justice|last=Fawthrop|first=Tom|date=2009-07-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their confessions, the prisoners were asked to describe their personal background. If they were party members, they had to say when they joined the revolution and describe their work assignments in DK. Then the prisoners would relate their supposed treasonous activities in chronological order. The third section of the confession text described prisoners' thwarted conspiracies and supposed treasonous conversations. At the end, the confessions would list a string of traitors who were the prisoners' friends, colleagues, or acquaintances. Some lists contained over a hundred names. People whose names were in the confession list were often called in for interrogation.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt;

Typical confessions ran into thousands of words in which the prisoner would interweave true events in their lives with imaginary accounts of their espionage activities for the [[CIA]], the [[KGB]], or [[Vietnam]]. Physical torture was combined with sleep deprivation and deliberate neglect of the prisoners. The torture implements are on display in the museum. It is believed that the vast majority of prisoners were innocent of the charges against them and that the torture produced false confessions. Not all prisoners were tortured.

For the first year of S-21's existence, corpses were buried near the prison. However, by the end of 1976, cadres ran out of burial spaces, the prisoner and family members were taken to the [[Choeung Ek|Boeung Choeung Ek]] ("Crow's Feet Pond") extermination centre, fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh.&lt;ref name="dccam-fact-sheet-pol-pot"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fact Sheet: Pol Pot and his Prisoners at Secret Prison S-21|publisher=The Documentation Center of Cambodia|location=Phnom Penh, Cambodia|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, they were killed by a group of teenagers led by a Comrade Teng&lt;ref name="dccam-fact-sheet-pol-pot"/&gt; being battered with iron bars, pickaxes, machetes and many other makeshift weapons owing to the scarcity, and subsequent price of ammunition. After the prisoners were executed, the soldiers who had accompanied them from S-21 buried them in graves that held as few as 6 and as many as 100 bodies.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt;

===Non-Cambodians in the prison===
Even though the vast majority of the victims were Cambodian, some foreigners, including 488 Vietnamese, 31 Thai, one Laotian, one Arab, one British, four French, two Americans, one Canadian, one New Zealander, two Australians, one Indonesian,&lt;ref name="victims-perpetrators-2001"&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=[[Documentation Center of Cambodia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; many Indians and Pakistanis were also imprisoned.

Almost all non-Cambodians had left the country by early May 1975, following an overland evacuation of the French Embassy in trucks. The few who remained were seen as a security risk. Though most of the foreign victims were either Vietnamese or Thai,&lt;ref name="dccam.org"&gt;[http://www.dccam.org/Archives/Documents/Confessions/Confessions_Killed_S_21.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012001333/http://www.dccam.org/Archives/Documents/Confessions/Confessions_Killed_S_21.htm |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of Western prisoners, many picked up at sea by Khmer Rouge patrol boats, also passed through S-21 between April 1976 and December 1978. No foreign prisoners survived captivity in S-21.

Two Franco-Vietnamese brothers named Rovin and Harad Bernard were detained in April 1976 after they were transferred from [[Siem Reap]] where they had worked tending cattle.&lt;ref name="Summary of world broadcasts: Far East"&gt;{{cite book

It is possible that a handful of French nationals who went missing after the 1975 evacuation of Phnom Penh also passed through S-21.&lt;ref name="Summary of world broadcasts: Far East" /&gt; 
Two Americans were captured under similar circumstances. James Clark and Lance McNamara in April 1978 were sailing when their boat drifted off course and sailed into Cambodian waters. They were arrested by Khmer patrol boats, taken ashore, where they were blindfolded, placed on trucks, and taken to the then-deserted Phnom Penh.

Twenty-six-year-old [[John Dawson Dewhirst|John D. Dewhirst]], a British tourist, was one of the youngest foreigners to die in the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Glass was killed during the arrest, while Dewhirst and Hamill were captured, blindfolded, and taken to shore. Both were executed, with Dewhirst possibly having been burned alive, after having been tortured for several months at Tuol Sleng.&lt;ref name="malone1"/&gt;

One of the last foreign prisoners to die was twenty-nine-year-old American [[Michael Scott Deeds|Michael S. Deeds]], who was captured with his friend [[Christopher E. DeLance]] on November 24, 1978 while sailing from [[Singapore]] to [[Hawaii]]. His confession was signed a week before the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge. In 1989, Deeds' brother, Karl Deeds, traveled to Cambodia in attempts to find his brother's remains, but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/774411.stm |title=Cambodian mass grave found |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-06-02 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 3, 2012, DeLance's photograph was identified among the caches of inmate portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/western-inmate-identified-s-21-portraits |title=Western inmate identified in S-21 portraits |publisher=Phnompenhpost.com |date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1999, there were a total of 79 foreign victims on record,&lt;ref name="dccam.org"/&gt; but former Tuol Sleng Khmer Rouge photographer Nim Im claims that the records are not complete. On top of that, there is also an eyewitness account of a [[Cubans|Cuban]] and a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] who passed through the prison, though no official records of either are shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/features/article_1354814.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905041025/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/features/article_1354814.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title=Photographers claim foreigners killed in Pol Pot's prison |publisher=Monsters and Critics |date=2007-09-12 |accessdate=2013-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survivors of Tuol Sleng===

Out of an estimated 20,000 people imprisoned at Tuol Sleng, there were only twelve known survivors: seven adults and five children. One child died shortly after the liberation.&lt;ref name=dccam-history-of-dk/&gt; As of mid-September 2011, only three of the adults and the children are thought to be still alive:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asiapacific/8123541.stm|title=Khmer Rouge survivor testifies|accessdate=2010-09-20 | work=BBC News | date=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brewer |first=Kirstie |date=11 June 2015 |title=How two men survived a prison where 12,000 were killed |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33096971 |newspaper=BBC News Magazine |location= |access-date=12 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chum Mey]], [[Bou Meng]], and [[Chim Meth]]. All three said they were kept alive because they had skills their captors judged to be useful.  Bou Meng, whose wife was killed in the prison, is an artist. Chum Mey was kept alive because of his skills in repairing machinery. Chim Meth was held in S-21 for 2 weeks and transferred to the nearby [[Prey Sar prison]]. She may have been spared because she was from Stoeung district in [[Kampong Thom City|Kampong Thom]] where [[Comrade Duch]] was born. She intentionally distinguished herself by emphasising her provincial accent during her interrogations. [[Vann Nath]], who was spared because of his ability to paint, died on September 5, 2011. Norng Chan Phal, one of the surviving children has just published his story.&lt;ref name="Norng Chan Phal"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chan Phal |first1=Norng |title=Norng Chan Phal: The mystery of the boy at S-21 |date=2018 |publisher=Kok-Thay Eng, Dr. |location=Phnom Penh |isbn=978-99963-900-6-7 |pages=103 |edition=First }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Documentation Center of Cambodia]] has recently estimated that, in fact, at least 179 prisoners were freed from S-21 between 1975 and 1979 and approximately 23 prisoners (including 5 children, two of them siblings Norng Chanphal and Norng Chanly) survived when the prison was liberated in January 1979. One child died short after.&lt;ref name="dccam-fact-sheet-pol-pot"/&gt; Of the 179 prisoners who were released most disappeared and only a few are known to have survived after 1979.&lt;ref name="dccam-fact-sheet-pol-pot"/&gt; Further research needs to be done. It was found that at least 60 persons (out of the DC Cam list) who are listed as having survived, were first released, but later rearrested and executed.

===Staff of S-21===

The prison had a staff of 1,720 people throughout the whole period. Of those, approximately 300 were office staff, internal workforce and interrogators. The other 1,400 were general workers, including people who grew food for the prison.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt; Several of these workers were children taken from the prisoner families. The chief of the prison was [[Khang Khek Ieu]] (also known as Comrade Duch), a former mathematics teacher who worked closely with Khmer Rouge leader [[Pol Pot]]. Other leading figures of S-21 were [[Kim Vat]] aka Ho (deputy chief of S-21), Peng (chief of guards), [[Mam Nai]] aka Chan (chief of the Interrogation Unit), and [[Tang Sin Hean]] aka Pon (interrogator). Pon was the person who interrogated important people such as Keo Meas, Nay Sarann, Ho Nim, Tiv Ol, and Phok Chhay.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt;

The documentation unit was responsible for transcribing tape-recorded confessions, typing the handwritten notes from prisoners' confessions, preparing summaries of confessions, and maintaining files. In the photography sub-unit, workers took mug shots of prisoners when they arrived, pictures of prisoners who had died while in detention, and pictures of important prisoners after they were executed. Thousands of photographs have survived, but thousands are still missing.

The defense unit was the largest unit in S-21. The guards in this unit were mostly teenagers. Many guards found the unit's strict rules hard to obey. Guards were not allowed to talk to prisoners, to learn their names, or to beat them. They were also forbidden to observe or eavesdrop on interrogations, and they were expected to obey 30 regulations, which barred them from such things as taking naps, sitting down or leaning against a wall while on duty. They had to walk, guard, and examine everything carefully. Guards who made serious mistakes were arrested, interrogated, jailed and put to death. Most of the people employed at S-21 were terrified of making mistakes and feared being tortured and killed.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt;

The interrogation unit was split into three separate groups: ''Krom Noyobai'' or the political unit, ''Krom Kdao'' or the ''hot'' unit and ''Krom Angkiem'', or the ''chewing'' unit.&lt;ref name="dunlop-2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Nic Dunlop]] | title=The Lost Executioner – A Journey into the Heart of the Killing Fields | publisher=Walker &amp; Company, New York | year=2005 | isbn=0-8027-1472-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hot unit (sometimes called the cruel unit) was allowed to use torture. In contrast, the cold unit (sometimes called the gentle unit) was prohibited from using torture to obtain confessions. If they could not make prisoners confess, they would transfer them to the hot unit. The chewing unit dealt with tough and important cases. Those who worked as interrogators were literate and usually in their 20s.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt;

Some of the staff who worked in Tuol Sleng also ended up as prisoners. They confessed to being lazy in preparing documents, to having damaged machines and various equipment, and to having beaten prisoners to death without permission when assisting with interrogations.&lt;ref name="dccam-history-of-dk"/&gt;

===Security regulations===
[[Image:Concentration camp rules.jpg|thumb|Concentration camp rules]]

When prisoners were first brought to Tuol Sleng, they were made aware of ten rules that they were to follow during their incarceration. What follows is what is posted today at the Tuol Sleng Museum; the imperfect grammar is a result of faulty translation from the original Khmer:

: ''1. You must answer accordingly to my question.  Don't turn them away.''
:''2. Don't try to hide the facts by making pretexts this and that, you are strictly prohibited to contest me.''
:''3. Don't be a fool for you are a chap who dare to thwart the revolution.''
:''4. You must immediately answer my questions without wasting time to reflect.''
:''5. Don't tell me either about your immoralities or the essence of the revolution.''
:''6. While getting lashes or electrification you must not cry at all.''
:''7. Do nothing, sit still and wait for my orders. If there is no order, keep quiet. When I ask you to do something, you must do it right away without protesting.''
:''8. Don't make pretext about [[Kampuchea Krom]] in order to hide your secret or traitor.''
:''9. If you don't follow all the above rules, you shall get many lashes of electric wire.''
:''10. If you disobey any point of my regulations you shall get either ten lashes or five shocks of electric discharge.''

During testimony at the [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia|Khmer Rouge Tribunal]] on April 27, 2009, Duch claimed the 10 security regulations were a fabrication of the Vietnamese officials that first set up the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gaeatimes.com/cambodian-genocide-defendant-says-infamous-sign-detailing-prison-regulations-a-fabrication-40683/ |title=Cambodian genocide defendant says infamous sign detailing prison regulations a fabrication |publisher=News.gaeatimes.com |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zimbio.com/Cambodia/articles/259/Khmer+Rouge+jailer+infamous+regulations+sign |title=Khmer Rouge jailer: infamous regulations sign fake - Cambodia |publisher=Zimbio |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401090705/http://www.zimbio.com/Cambodia/articles/259/Khmer+Rouge+jailer+infamous+regulations+sign |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andybrouwer.co.uk/blog/labels/S-21.html |title=Andy's Cambodia |publisher=www.andybrouwer.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of Tuol Sleng===

In 1979, Hồ Văn Tây, a Vietnamese combat photographer, was the first journalist to document Tuol Sleng to the world. Ho and his colleagues followed the stench of rotting corpses to the gates of Tuol Sleng. The photos of Hồ documenting what he saw when he entered the site are exhibited in Tuol Sleng today.&lt;ref name="dunlop-2005"/&gt;

The Khmer Rouge required that the prison staff make a detailed dossier for each prisoner. Included in the documentation was a photograph. Since the original negatives and photographs were separated from the dossiers in the 1979–1980 period, most of the photographs remain anonymous today.&lt;ref name="dunlop-2005"/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:S-21 Skull Map.jpg|thumb|"Skull map"]]
[[Image:Tuolsleng6.JPG|thumb|Cambodian school students tour the museum]]
The buildings at Tuol Sleng are preserved, some rooms as they were left when the Khmer Rouge were driven out in 1979. The regime kept extensive records, including thousands of photographs. Several rooms of the museum are now lined, floor to ceiling, with black and white photographs of some of the estimated 20,000 prisoners who passed through the prison.

The site has four main buildings, known as Building A, B, C, and D. Building A holds the large cells in which the bodies of the last victims were discovered. Building B holds galleries of photographs. Building C holds the rooms sub-divided into small cells for prisoners. Building D holds other memorabilia including instruments of torture.

Other rooms contain only a rusting iron bedframe, beneath a black and white photograph showing the room as it was found by the Vietnamese. In each photograph, the mutilated body of a prisoner is chained to the bed, killed by his fleeing captors only hours before the prison was captured. Other rooms preserve leg-irons and instruments of torture. They are accompanied by paintings by former inmate [[Vann Nath]] showing people being tortured, which were added by the post-Khmer Rouge regime installed by the Vietnamese in 1979.

The museum is open to the public from 8 am to 5 pm. Visitors have the opportunity of viewing a 'survivor testimony' from 2:30-3pm (Monday - Friday). Along with the [[Choeung Ek|Choeung Ek Memorial]] ([[The Killing Fields]]), the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum is included as a point of interest for those visiting Cambodia. Tuol Sleng also remains an important educational site as well as memorial for Cambodians. Since 2010, the ECCC brings Cambodians on a 'study tour' to the Tuol Sleng, Choeung Ek and finishing at the ECCC complex. During 2010, around 27,000 Cambodians visited the museum through this tour. (See ECCC Court Report January 2011) Some believed that ghosts of the victims continue to haunt the place.&lt;ref name=straights-times-haunted-2010&gt;{{cite news |title='Ghosts' of victims haunt |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_339861.html |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225143329/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/SE+Asia/Story/STIStory_339861.html |archivedate=2010-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of images from Tuol Sleng are featured in the 1992 [[Ron Fricke]] film ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]''.

Survivors Chum Mey and Bou Meng can both frequently be seen near the administration office of the museum for a 'meet and greet' as well as the opportunity to buy their biographies.

{{Main|S-21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine}}
''S-21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine'' is a 2003 film by [[Rithy Panh]], a Cambodian-born, French-trained filmmaker who lost his family when he was 11. The film features two Tuol Sleng survivors, [[Vann Nath]] and Chum Mey, confronting their former Khmer Rouge captors, including guards, interrogators, a doctor and a photographer. The focus of the film is the difference between the feelings of the survivors, who want to understand what happened at Tuol Sleng to warn future generations, and the former jailers, who cannot escape the horror of the genocide they helped create.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5356">'''UnifiedPOS''' or '''UPOS''' is a world wide vendor- and retailer-driven Open Standard's initiative under the National Retail Federation, Association of Retail Technology Standards (NRF-ARTS) to provide vendor-neutral software application interfaces (APIs) for numerous (as of 2011, thirty-six) [[point of sale]] (POS) peripherals (POS printer, cash drawer, magnetic stripe reader, bar code scanner, line displays, etc.).

The goal is to allow retailers freedom of choice in the selection of POS peripheral devices by the creation, utilization, and promotion of standardized connectivity.&lt;ref name=monroecs&gt;{{cite web|title=Website Excerpts|url=http://www.monroecs.com/unifiedpos_siteexcerpts.htm|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UnifiedPOS is an abstraction standard that contains appendices which provide specific platform implementation information for Microsoft OLE and .NET Windows OS and Java for other OS (Linux) environments. 

Developed by a team of joint retailer and industry technical experts following published policies and procedures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrf-arts.org/unifiedpos/uposadmin.pdf NRF-ARTS.org]&lt;/ref&gt; UnifiedPOS provides a consistent and exact framework for programming point of sales devices that is platform-independent and vendor-neutral.

Recent efforts (2010-2011) by the UnifiedPOS committee include provisions for local and remote POS peripheral support through a supplemental Web Services for point of service (WS-POS 1.1) standard. In addition, an increasing focus on using XML language commands to control the POS devices can be seen in the XML-POS Appendix in UnifiedPOS Version 1.13 standard.

==Management==
The UnifiedPOS standard is managed by [[Association for Retail Technology Standards]] (ARTS) through two committees. The ARTS [[Board of directors|board]] is composed of international [[retailer]]s and [[vendor]]s from all industry segments. The principal responsibilities of this committee are to ensure that the standards it manages continues to expand in accordance with retailer requirements. The committee will specify changes to the standards and approve new devices. Membership in NRF-ARTS is required to participate in the administrative committee. Membership in NRF-ARTS is not required to download and use the UnifiedPOS standards.

The technical committee, composed of both vendors and retailers, modifies the UnifiedPOS specification based on guidance of the Administrative Committee. The technical committee provides support by resolving implementation issues or issues arising from the standard.

[[OPOS]] and [[JavaPOS]] implementation groups modify or enhance their actual program implementations to conform to the UnifiedPOS specification.&lt;ref name="monroecs1"&gt;{{cite web|title=UnifiedPOS|url=http://www.monroecs.com/unifiedpos.htm|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UnifiedPOS technical committee periodically audits the specific implementations to ensure the various groups conform to the UnifiedPOS specification.

In 2003, a [[.NET Framework|.NET]] implementation was proposed, to the technical committee and subsequently accepted into the standard. This implementation is known as [http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5355 POS for .NET]. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Point of Service for .NET v1.12 (POS for .NET)|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5355|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microsoft has been criticized for not keeping up with the current revisions (1.13) to the UPOS standard.&lt;ref name="monroecs1"/&gt;  POS for .NET version 1.12 is not compatible with the current .NET Framework 4.0.  However, On December 13, 2013, Microsoft released POS for .NET 1.14 CTP via Microsoft Connect.  POS for .NET 1.14 is intended to conform to UPOS 1.14.  The public release of POS for .NET is expected in Spring 2014.

In 2011 effort is underway to create an updated UnifiedPOS 2.0 standard &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrf-arts.org/content/unified-pos UnifiedPOS]. Nrf Arts. Retrieved on 2013-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt; which will add many enhanced features and functions to support newer programming paradigms and remote XML POS peripheral installation scenarios.

==Practical application of the UPOS standard==
Although UPOS claims support for 36 device types, in practice most retailers will not be able to take advantage of many of these devices. For example, there are few, if any, UPOS service objects that support biometric or RFID types. Instead, most device manufacturers for these devices have created their own proprietary device drivers.

Also variously called {{nihongo||丑時詣|ushi no toki mōde}}, {{nihongo||丑参り|ushi mairi}}, {{nihongo||丑三参り|ushimitsu mairi}}.&lt;ref name="kojien"&gt;{{Citation|editor-last=新村|editor-first=出 (Niimura, Izuru)|title=広辞苑 (Kojien|edition=第4版|year=1991|publisher=岩波書店|isbn=978-4-00-080101-0|chapter=うしのときまいり|title-link=Kojien}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="nkdj"&gt;{{citation|title=日本国語大辞典 (Nihon kokugo daijiten)|volume=2|publisher=小学館|year=1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBtbAAAAMAAJ|page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Sources say that common method of the ritual developed during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868).&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|1996|pp=143–144}}, citing {{cite book|last=Ono|first=Susumu (小野進)|title=古語辞典|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman performing the curse is generally portrayed as dressed in white, with disheveled hair,&lt;ref name="pfoundes"/&gt; wearing an iron "crown" that holds three burning candles,&lt;ref name="joly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nelson"/&gt; suspending (from her neck) a mirror upon her chest&lt;ref name="sekien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kojien"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitford|1870|pp=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which lies hidden&lt;ref name="sekien"/&gt;) and wearring a pair of tall [[clogs]] (''[[Geta (footwear)|geta]]'').&lt;ref name="griffis"/&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;{{Harvnb|三橋|2011|pp=264–5}} states that she wears tall clogs with only one support board (「一本歯の高下駄」) , even though the accompanying illustration from a [[Toyohiro|Utagawa Toyohiro]] print clearly shows two supports.&lt;/ref&gt; She would then nail a straw doll representing her target to a {{nihongo|sacred tree|[[:ja:御神木|神木]]|shimboku}} at the [[Shinto shrine]].&lt;ref name="pfoundes"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pfoundes|1875|pp=19–20}}, quoted in {{Harvnb|Hildburgh|1915|loc=65. Notes.. Magical Methods for Injuring Persons, p.118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iron "crown" that she wears is actually a {{nihongo|tripod|[[:ja:五徳|五徳]]|gotoku}} (or [[trivet]],&lt;ref name="kusano"/&gt; a stand for setting cooking pots, etc., above a heat source) which she wears in inverted,&lt;ref name="griffis"&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffis|1876|p=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; slipping the iron ring over her head and sticking candles on its three legs.&lt;ref name="pfoundes"/&gt;

[[File:A woman makes a cursing ritual ceremony.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|A woman summoning a [[yōkai]] through ''ushi no toki mairi'', by [[Hokusai|Katsushika Hokusai]]]]
It was believed that the spot struck on the straw doll corresponded to the area of the body where the target would begin to experience illness or injury.&lt;ref name="pfoundes"/&gt;&lt;ref  name="nkdj"/&gt; However, this straw doll or other form of effigy was not a definitive requisite in the ritual even relatively late in the Edo Period. For instance, in [[Toriyama Sekien]]'s  ''[[Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki]]'' (1779, pictured top right) depicts the woman holding a hammer but no doll, nor is the doll mentioned in the caption.&lt;ref name="sekien"&gt;Sekien (1779), quote: 「丑時まいりハ、胸に一ツの鏡をかくし、頭に三つの燭〔ともしび〕を點じ、 丑みつの比神社にまうでゝ杉の梢に釘うつとかや。 はかなき女の嫉妬より起りて、人を失ひ身をうしなふ。 人を呪咀〔のろわ〕ば穴二つほれとは、よき近き譬ならん」 Translation: In the ''ushi doki mairi'', [a woman] conceals a mirror in the bosom, lights three candles around her head, visits the shrine in the ''ushi mitsu'' hour (third quarter of the hour of the [[ox (zodiac)|ox]], 2:00~2:30 AM), and drives nails into a [[sugi]] tree. The fleeting jealousies of a woman, brings ruin to the person and body. It is well said the proverb "curse someone, dig a second grave [for yourself]".&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the nails are driven directly into the branches of the sacred tree.

The props used are described somewhat differently, depending on the source. Nails of a particular size called {{nihongo||[[:ja:五寸釘|五寸釘]]|gosun kugi|extra="five inch nails"}} are prescribed according to some authorities.&lt;ref name="kojien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="komatsu"/&gt; She may hold in her mouth a [[comb]],&lt;ref name="komatsu"&gt;小松和彦(Komatsu, Kazuhiko)「いでたちは白い着物を着て、髮を乱し、顔に白粉、歯には鉄漿、口紅を濃くつくる、頭には鉄輪をかぶり、その三つの足にろうそくを立ててともす。胸に鏡を掛け、口に櫛をくわえる。履き物は歯の高い足駄である」 quoted in:{{citation|last=松井|first=吉昭|contribution=多賀社参詣曼陀羅を読む|publisher=歴研]|year=2000|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXY0AQAAIAAJ|isbn=978-4947769022|page=173|title=時と文化: 日本史攷究の視座 : 岡田芳朗先生古稀記念論集}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a "torch of bamboo and pine roots lighted at both ends".&lt;ref name="pfoundes"/&gt; The "proper witching hour" is, strictly speaking, the ''ushi no mitsu doki'' (2:00–2:30&amp;nbsp;am).&lt;ref name="sekien"/&gt;

In Sekien's or [[Hokusai]]'s print (above), the woman performing the curse ritual is depicted with a black ox by her side. Such a black ox, lying [[wikt:recumbent|recumbent]], is expected to appear on the seventh night of the ritual, and one must stride or straddle over the animal to complete the task to success,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=関|editor-first=一敏|editor2-last=大塚|editor2-first=和夫|title=宗教人類学入門|publisher=弘文堂|year=2004|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; but if one betrays fear at the ox's apparition the "potency of the charm is lost".&lt;ref name="pfoundes"/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Hashihime}}
In earlier times, the term simply referred to worshiping at the shrine during the hours of the ox, and the curse connotation developed later. At the [[Kibune Shrine]] in [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]], there was a tradition that if one prayed here on the "ox hour of the ox day of the ox month of the [[Ox (zodiac)|ox year]]" the wish was likely to be granted, because it was during this alignment of the hour, day, month, and year that the Kibune deity was believed to have made descent upon the shrine. However, the shrine became known a cursing spot in later development.&lt;ref name="mitsuhashi"&gt;{{Harvnb|三橋|2011|pp=264–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kibune Shrine became strongly associated with the ox hour curse following the fame of the medieval legend of the [[Hashihime]] of [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] ("The Princess of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Uji Bridge{{!}}Bridge of Uji|2=ja|3=宇治橋|preserve=1}}"). The legend is considered the prime source of the later conception ''Ushi no toki mairi'' curse ritual.&lt;ref name="mitsuhashi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marvin"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Marvin|first=Stephen E.|title=Heaven has a face, so does hell: the art of the Noh mask|volume=1|publisher=Floating World Editions|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bNJAQAAIAAJ|page=278|isbn=978-1891640322}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, Hashihime in mortal life was the daughter of a certain nobleman, but consumed by jealousy, made a wish to become a ''kijin'' (an ''[[oni]]'' demon) capable of destroying her love rival. After  7 days at Kibune Shrine, she was finally given revelation by the resident deity "to bathe for thirty seven days in the rapids of the [[Uji River]]."&lt;ref name="kato-on-heike-hashihime"&gt;{{citation|last=Kato|first=Eileen|contribution=The Iron Crown (Kanawa)|editor-last=Keene|editor-first=Donald|work=Twenty Plays of the Nō Theatre|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1970|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ea1vu0-3FiUC&amp;pg=PA193|pages=193–194ff|title=Twenty Plays of the N? Theatre|isbn=9780231034555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that even though Kibune has later been seen as a mecca for the ritual, Hashihime only learned the recipe here, and enacted it miles away (Kibune is in the north of Kyoto, the Uji River is to the south).

The earliest written text of the legend occurs in a late [[Kamakura period|Kamakura-period]] variant text (''Yashirobon'' codex&lt;ref name="selinger"/&gt;) of ''[[The Tale of Heike]]'', under the ''Tsurugi no maki'' ("Book of the Sword") chapter.&lt;ref name="kawashima"&gt;{{citation|last=Kawashima|first=Terry|title=Writing Margins: The Textual Construction of Gender in Heian and Kamakura Japan|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC807wsyLA0C&amp;pg=PA272|pages=272–|isbn=978-0674005167}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to it, Hashihime was originally a mortal during the reign of [[Emperor Saga]] (809 to 823),&lt;ref name="kato-on-heike-hashihime"/&gt; but after turning demon and killing her rival, her man's kinsmen, then indiscriminately other innocent parties, she lived on beyond the normal human life span, to prey on the samurai [[Watanabe no Tsuna]] at the {{nihongo|Ichijo Modoribashi|[[:ja:一条戻橋|一条戻橋]]|extra2="Turning Back bridge at the street crossing of Ichijō and Horikawa"}} bridge, only to have her arm severed by the sword {{nihongo|Higekiri|[[:ja:髭切|髭切]]}}.&lt;ref name="kawashima"/&gt; Tsuna kept the demon's arm, whose power was contained by the {{nihongo|Yinyang master|[[:ja:陰陽師|陰陽師]]|[[Onmyōdō#onmyōji|onmyōji]]}} [[Abe no Seimei]], via chanting the [[Humane King Sutra|Ninnō-kyō]] sutra.&lt;ref name="selinger"&gt;{{citation|last=Selinger|first=Vyjayanthi R.|title=Writing Margins: The Textual Construction of Gender in Heian and Kamakura Japan|publisher=BRILL|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbwdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130|pages=130|isbn=978-9004255333}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this variant of the "chapter of the sword",  the ceremony that the woman undergoes at the Uji River to transmogrify into the demon is described as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Secluding herself in a deserted spot, she divided her long hair into five bunches and fashioned these bunches into horns. She daubed her face with vermilion and her body with cinnabar, set on her head an iron tripod with burning brands [* &lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;or "to each of its leg, a torch made with pine wood is tied and afired" in {{Harvnb|Kusano|1962|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;] attached to its legs and held in her mouth  another brand, burning at both ends. 
{{right|&amp;mdash;From ''Tsurugi no Maki''&lt;ref name="kusano"&gt;{{citation|last=Kusano|first=Eisaburō|title=Stories behind noh and kabuki plays|publisher=Tokyo News Service|year=1962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USm1AAAAIAAJ|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kato-tr-kanawa"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kato|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kato, quoted in {{Harvnb|Murguia|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus in the ''Tsurugi no maki'' can be seen such elements as the wearing of the tripod (here called {{nihongo||鉄輪|kanawa}}) and propping lit torches (similar to candles in later tradition), but the woman painted her entire face and body red, rather than remain in pure white garb.

Later during the [[Muromachi period]], this legend was adapted by [[Zeami Motokiyo|Zeami]]&lt;ref name="kusano"/&gt; into the [[Noh]] play ''Kanawa'' or "The Iron Crown".&lt;ref name="kato-tr-kanawa"/&gt; The Noh play inherits essentially the same outfit for the principal woman, who is commanded by the oracle to  "daub your face with red and wear scarlet clothing,"&lt;ref name="mitsuhashi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kato-tr-kanawa"/&gt; and uses neither a straw doll or hammer,&lt;ref name="mitsuhashi"/&gt; but has the yingyang master Seimei creates "two life-size straw effigies of the man and his new wife [with] their names [placed] inside" in order to perform the rites to excorcize Hashihime's demon.&lt;ref name="kato-tr-kanawa"/&gt; Therefore, the later form of the ''ushi no mairi'' developed afterwards, {{Citation needed span|date=April 2014|text=through the marriage of the use of dolls in the Japanese esoteric art of ''[[onmyōdō]]'' with the shrine visiting of the ox hour}}.

=== Curse using dolls in antiquity ===
The use of dolls in the cursing ritual has been practiced since antiquity, with a reference in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' chronicle under the reign of [[Emperor Yōmei]], which relates that in the year 587, Nakatomi no Katsumi no Muraji "preparede figures of the Imperial {{Interlanguage link multi|Prince Oshisaka no Hikohito no Ōe{{!}}Prince Hikobito|2=ja|3=押坂彦人大兄皇子|preserve=1}}&amp;nbsp;... and [spellcast] them", but it did not work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author-link=William George Aston|last=Aston|first=William George|title=Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697|volume=1|place=London|publisher=Japan Society of London|year=1896|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IJrNAKBpycC&amp;pg=PA109|page=109–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this record does not clarify if the dolls were poked by sharp implements.

There are unearthed [[Archeology|archeological]] relics shaped like human dolls suspected of being used in curses. Called {{nihongo|wooden purificatory figurines|木製人形代|mokusei hitogatashiro}}, some have faces realistically drawn and ink, and others with iron nails driven into the breast. One such from the 8th century is held by the [[Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=永藤|first=靖 (Nagafuji, Yasushi)|title=古代仏教説話の方法: 霊異記から験記へ|publisher=三弥井書店 |year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNcxAAAAMAAJ|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="umeya"&gt;{{cite web|last=梅屋|first=潔 (Umeya, Kiyoshi)|title=のろい (noroi)|website=日本民俗学会編『民俗学事典』丸善、近刊予定|volume=Ⅲ-④-10 および 19|format=pdf|url=http://www2.kobe-u.ac.jp/~umeya/site01/_userdata/noroi.pdf|accessdate=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another from the Tatechō site in [[Matsue, Shimane]], a wooden tag depicts a female figure, apparently a noblewoman deducing from attire, and this doll had three wooden pegs or nails driven into it, aiming at her breasts and her heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=勝部|first=昭|others=川原和人, 宮澤明久, 柳浦俊一, 大谷祐司, 長峰康典|title=タテチョウ遺跡発掘調査報告書III|publisher=島根県教育委員会|year=1990|url=http://rar.lib.shimane-u.ac.jp/Repository/metadata/8441|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429184253/http://rar.lib.shimane-u.ac.jp/Repository/metadata/8441|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-04-29|pages=375, 377註2}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140429190353/http://rar.lib.shimane-u.ac.jp/Repository/file/8441/20090804000000/%E3%82%BF%E3%83%86%E3%83%81%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E9%81%BA%E8%B7%A1%E7%99%BA%E6%8E%98%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%BB%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A%E6%9B%B8III%E6%9C%AC%E7%B7%A8(2).pdf 本編(2).pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What's it going to take?''''' is a British [[newspaper advertisement|print]] and [[billboard|poster]] campaign launched in 2007 by [[Women's Aid]] to boost awareness of [[domestic violence]] against women in the United Kingdom. The campaign, handled by [[advertising agency]] [[Grey London]], comprised photographs of nine female celebrities [[make-up|made-up]] to appear as though they were the victims of domestic abuse. The campaign received substantial media attention, with commentary appearing in ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', and ''[[Marie Claire]]'', among others. The ''What's it going to take?'' campaign went on to win a number of honours within the advertising industry, including prizes at the 2008 Creative Circle Awards and the Aerial Awards.

==Background==
[[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]] was established in 1974 as an umbrella organisation for several [[feminism|feminist]] charities aiming to end [[domestic violence]] against women and children, including [[Sexual assault|molestation]], [[rape]], and [[sexual harassment]]. For the next thirty years, the organisation worked with a number of advertising agencies to promote its cause, including [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]],&lt;ref&gt;"Connections: OgilvyOne scoops Caples win for region", ''[[Media Asia Entertainment Group|Media Asia]]'', 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[McCann Erickson]],&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Jennifer; "[http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/230535/Poster-ad-uses-Boxing-Day-line-fight-violence/ Poster ad uses Another Boxing Day line to fight violence]", ''Brand Republic'', 13 December 2004. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mediaedge:cia]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/517312/Media-Strategy-Analysis---Tackling-domestic-violence-private/ Media: Strategy Analysis - Tackling domestic violence in private], ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 16 September 2005. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite numerous publicity campaigns over the years, by 2005 the charity's own research suggested that less than 16% of the public were aware of the existence of Women's Aid. Through a personal relationship between a pair of employees at the two organisations, Women's Aid were taken on as a [[pro-bono]] client by agency [[Grey London]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="probono"&gt;"[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-195481669/pro-bono-work-agency.html Pro Bono Work: Agency Viewpoint - Grey London (Contract with Women's aid)]", ''[[Marketing Week]]'', 12 March 2009. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/search/519922/ Hotline: Grey London appointed to handle Women's Aid's account]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 30 September 2005. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first product of this new collaboration was the 2006 ''[[Valentine's Day (advertisement)|Valentine's Day]]'' campaign. With a budget of £500, Grey London made strategic purchases of media space in newspapers and radio with a reach of about 2% of the UK population. Through an effective [[public relations]] campaign, this exposure was leveraged to the point where 52% of British adults saw the advertisements at least once. The campaign went on to win a number of awards in the advertising community, including an [[Effie Award|EFFIE Award]] for Socially Responsible Advertising and an IPA Effectiveness Award.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=208378 Grey EMEA Lands Hat-Trick at EACA Euro Effies]", ''[[PR Newswire]]'', 27 September 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;Sands, Marc; "[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/search/602959/IPA-Effectiveness-Awards-2006-Bronze-Awards/ IPA Effectiveness Awards 2006: Bronze Awards]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 3 November 2006. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the campaign was financially successful. Women's Aid recorded an increase of 25% in traffic to their website and a substantial increase in the number of donations following ''Valentine's Day'''s run.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

==Campaign==
Looking to build upon the success of ''Valentine's Day'', Grey London began planning for a new campaign to run in early 2007. The brief for the campaign was to bring the issue into public view by making use of celebrities. In an interview with ''Creativity'' magazine, a planner for the agency said: "The amount of column inches and time spent talking about celebrities is phenomenal and if we could own even a small piece of this it would help to raise awareness of domestic violence and also Women's Aid. In this gossip driven world if we thought a celebrity was suffering from a form of domestic abuse EVERYONE would be talking about it."&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;"AdCritic: Print and Design", ''Creativity'', February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; From this came the idea of a series of portraits of female celebrities made-up to appear as though they had been the victims of abuse. Grey London recruited [[fashion photographer]] [[Rankin (photographer)|Rankin]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.com/thework/news/885316/Womens-Aid-whats-going-take-Grey-London/ Women's Aid 'what's it going to take?' by Grey London]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 31 January 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; known for his portraits of politicians and celebrities including [[Tony Blair]], [[Kylie Minogue]], and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, John; "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/rankin-an-image-maker-at-the-cutting-edge-of-fashion-589849.html Rankin: An image maker at the cutting edge of fashion]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 3 May 2003. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; to conduct the shoot.

The team approached a number of women to star in the campaign but, due to scheduling conflicts and the lack of a campaign budget, securing dates for the photo-shoot proved difficult. In all, nine female celebrities, across a wide range of ages and ethnicities, were chosen: [[Honor Blackman]], veteran actress and former [[Bond girl]]; [[Fern Britton]], presenter of daytime television show ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]''; [[Fiona Bruce]], newsreader for BBC News;  [[Anne-Marie Duff]], known for playing Fiona Gallagher on television drama ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]''; [[Anna Friel]], known for playing Beth Jordache on the soap opera ''[[Brookside]]''; [[Jemma Wellesley, Countess of Mornington|Jemma Kidd]], former fashion model; [[Miquita Oliver]], television and radio personality; [[Fay Ripley]], known for playing Jenny Gifford in the comedy drama series ''[[Cold Feet]]''; and [[Kate Thornton]], journalist and television presenter.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;"Celebrities act to end domestic violence" (press release), [[Women's Aid]] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The head and shoulder prosthetics were created by Nigel Booth, whose previous work includes prosthetic and make-up design on feature films such as ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' and ''[[Blade II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Violence Against Violence", ''Creativity'', March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the campaign on 1 February 2007 was celebrated with a launch party at [[11 Downing Street]] hosted by then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] and his wife [[Sarah Jane Brown|Sarah]].&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt; All appearances in magazines, newspapers, posters, on television and on radio were donated free of charge, as was the work of the featured celebrities, photographer, and the advertising agency.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.womensaid.org.uk/page.asp?section=000100010010000600020001&amp;itemTitle=Celebrity+Campaign+FAQ's Frequently Asked Questions]", [[Women's Aid]] website (2007). Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In all, the campaign received an estimated £30m of media exposure,&lt;ref&gt;"Calling "Cut!" on Domestic Violence - How Women's Aid Used Celebrity to Change People's Minds" (case study), World Advertising Research Center (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; including an eight-page feature in [[women's magazine]] ''[[Marie Claire]]'' with an editorial written by [[Marian Keyes]].&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt;

===Reaction===
There was mixed reception to the campaign. Some were impressed with the impact of the images, such as Noel Bussey of [[Campaign (magazine)|''Campaign'' magazine]], who said:
"Many agencies pull out their best work when it's for charity, but rarely is it this effective, so well shot or so close to the brief. The images of battered female celebrities are bound to pick up coverage outside of the original media, and will not fail in raising awareness about the sickening problem of domestic violence."&lt;ref&gt;Bussey, Noel; "[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/search/630775/Diary-Pick-week---Grey-Womens-Aid/ Diary: Pick of the week - Grey/Women's Aid]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 2 February 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others felt that the use of celebrities diminished the relevance of the message; Roisin Donnelly of [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] commented: "In this print campaign, the celebrities, complete with injuries provided by the make-up artist, do get attention, but it seemed like it was a trick just to get attention, and was focused more on the celebrity and fake make-up rather than the central issue of domestic violence."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/633759/Work-Private-view/ The Work: Private view]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 16 February 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others were confused as to the point of the campaign; [[Kira Cochrane]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented: "The images were arresting, but odd. I can't imagine celebrity women posing as other sorts of victim: presenting themselves as trafficked women to highlight forced prostitution, or as rape victims to underline the low conviction rate. And what were the images supposed to tell us: that domestic violence is bad? Painful? Causes serious bruising?"&lt;ref&gt;Cochrane, Kira; "[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/03/domestic-violence-advertisement-keira-knightley Battered, Hollywood-style]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 April 2009. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, the campaign proved a moderate success. Grey London reported that at the height of publicity for the campaign, more than 67% of the British public were aware of Women's Aid and its goals.&lt;ref name="probono"/&gt; The ''What's it going to take?'' campaign went on to win a number of awards from the advertising and charitable communities, including an Aerial Award for the radio component,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aerialsfoundation.co.uk/ Archive: 2007 Winners]", Aerial Awards (2007). Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a Silver Award at the 2008 Creative Circle Awards for the print component,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.creativecircle.co.uk/2008/silverhonours.htm Archive: 2008 Silver Honours]", Creative Circle Awards (2008). Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and Women's Aid were honoured as the Campaigning Team of the Year at the Charity Times Gala Awards.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.womensaid.org.uk/page.asp?section=0001000100190006&amp;sectionTitle=Our+awards Our Awards]", [[Women's Aid]] website (2007). Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, Grey London continues to produce work for Women's Aid; later in 2007, they collaborated again with Rankin to produce a second series of posters for the ''Valentine's Day'' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/633757/Work-New-campaigns---UK/ The Work: New Campaigns]", ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'', 16 February 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 they continued to make use of celebrity to promote domestic abuse awareness, releasing a promotion starring [[Keira Knightley]], titled ''[[Cut (advertisement)|Cut]]''. The video, banned by the advertising standards agency [[Clearcast]] from appearing on British television,&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Rachel; "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/too-violent-knightley-advert-banned-from-tv-1674393.html 'Too violent' Knightley advert banned from TV]", ''[[The Independent]]'', April 26, 2009.

Wigand expanded upon the earlier work of [[Nikolaus von Jeroschin]].
