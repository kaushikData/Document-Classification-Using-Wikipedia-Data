'''The 1969 uprising in East Pakistan''' (ঊনসত্তরের গণঅভ্যুত্থান) was a democratic political movement in [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]). The uprising consisted of a series of mass demonstrations and sporadic conflicts between government armed forces and the demonstrators. Although the unrest began in 1966 with the [[Six point movement]] of [[Awami League]], it got momentum at the beginning of 1969 and culminated in the resignation of [[Field Marshal]] [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]], the first military ruler of [[Pakistan]]. The uprising also led to the withdrawal of [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]] and acquittal of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] and his colleagues from the case.&lt;ref name=pedia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamal|first1=Mesbah|last2=Kibria|first2=Arifatul|title=Mass Upsurge, 1969|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mass_Upsurge,_1969|website=Banglapedia|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asia Fashion Exchange''' ('''AFX''') is an annual fashion festival held in Singapore between 2001 and 2015. It began in 2001 as the '''Singapore Fashion Festival''' and was conceived by the [[Singapore Tourism Board]] (STB) with the goal of positioning [[Singapore]] as a fashion capital within [[Southeast Asia]]. The festival was eventually relaunched as the Asia Fashion Exchange in 2010 as a joint initiative between the private and public sector, and features a variety of fashion-related events.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_417_2005-01-26.html|title=Singapore Fashion Festival {{!}} Infopedia|last=Singapore|first=National Library Board,|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flagship event of the Asia Fashion Exchange is the [[Audi Fashion Festival Singapore]]. In 2015, Audi Fashion Festival Singapore was rebranded as Singapore Fashion Week&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stb.gov.sg/news-and-publications/newsletters/Pages/March%202015/AFX_2005.aspx|title=Singapore's Passion For Fashion Ramps Up with Asia Fashion Exchange|website=www.stb.gov.sg|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was the last year that the Asia Fashion Exchange was marketed as its parent event.

== 2001 - 2008: Singapore Fashion Festival ==
AFX began as Singapore Fashion Festival, an annual two-week long consumer-driven event that took place between 2001 and 2008.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/plush/audi-fashion-festival-goes-solo?page=0%2C1|title=Audi Fashion Festival goes solo|last1=Chia|first1=Stacey|accessdate=14 October 2016|publisher=AsiaOne}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was supported by the [[Singapore Tourism Board]] (STB), which aimed to position [[Singapore]] as a fashion capital within [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The event consisted of showcases by international and local designers, exhibitions and fashion-related fringe events. The event was organized by [[MS Twilight]], an events management company, from 2001 to 2003.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2004, [[Mercury Marketing and Communications]], now a fully integrated communications agency, won the contract to organize the Singapore Fashion Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/fashion/entrepreneur-tjin-lee-day-dreamer-comes-through|title=Entrepreneur Tjin Lee: Day-dreamer comes through|last1=Ankita|first1=Varma|date=13 July 2015|accessdate=14 October 2016|publisher=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Singapore Fashion Festival in 2001 hoped to present high fashion in a “fun and entertaining way” to consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiatraveltips.com/travelnews2001/31March2001Singapore.htm|title=The Curtain Falls in Style for Fashion Festival 2001|website=Asia Travel Tips|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===2006 Singapore Fashion Festival===

The 2006 Festival was a ten-day event held from 24 March to 2 April 2006. It was considered the best [[fashion festival]] for both international and local designers in Singapore. The most anticipated model taking the [[catwalk]] at this year's festival was British supermodel, [[Lily Cole]].

While primarily focused on stand-up comedy, it also includes films, theatre, cabaret, visual arts, spoken word, music, dance.&lt;ref&gt;Birmingham Comedy Festival: About, retrieved 9 Feb 2018, http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Birmingham Comedy Festival has been drawing attention to the city's vibrant (and often unsung) comedy scene since 2001 when the debut festival hit the road running thanks to appearances from [[Peter Kay]] and [[Sean Lock]]. Since then, the festival has grown into one of the largest independent arts festivals in the region. &lt;ref&gt;Visit Birmingham, retrieved 9 Feb 2018, http://visitbirmingham.com/what-to-do/festivals-events/annual-events/october/birmingham-comedy-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cruelty to animals''', also called '''animal [[abuse]]''', '''animal neglect''' or '''animal cruelty''', is the infliction by omission ([[animal neglect]]) or by commission by humans of [[suffering]] or [[Injury|harm]] upon any non-human. More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement, such as killing animals for [[food]] or for their [[fur]]; opinions differ about the extent of cruelty associated with a given method of slaughter. Cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself, defined as [[zoosadism]].  

Divergent approaches to laws concerning animal cruelty occur in different jurisdictions throughout the world. For example, some laws govern methods of killing animals for food, clothing, or other products, and other laws concern the keeping of animals for entertainment, education, research, or pets. There are a number of conceptual approaches to the issue of cruelty to animals. 

For example, the [[animal welfare]] position holds that there is nothing inherently wrong with using animals for human purposes, such as food, clothing, entertainment, and research, but that it should be done in a way that minimizes unnecessary [[Pain in animals|pain]] and suffering, sometimes referred to as "humane" treatment.

[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] advocates argue from the position of [[costs and benefits]] and vary in their conclusions as to the allowable treatment of animals. Some utilitarians argue for a weaker approach which is closer to the animal welfare position, whereas others argue for a position that is similar to animal rights. [[Animal rights]] theorists criticize these positions, arguing that the words "unnecessary" and "humane" are subject to widely differing interpretations, and that animals have basic rights. They say that the only way to ensure protection for animals is to end their status as property and to ensure that they are never used as commodities.

Throughout history individuals have condemned various practices that they considered to be cruel to animals. Renaissance polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]], for example, was troubled by the sight of birds in captivity, and (according to biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]]) once purchased caged birds in order to set them free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.yale.edu/cdm/ref/collection/rebooks/id/24652 |title=The life of Leonardo da Vinci by Giorgio Vasari |publisher=Yale University Library Digital Collections |accessdate=21 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706163415/http://digital.library.yale.edu/cdm/ref/collection/rebooks/id/24652 |archivedate=6 July 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed anger within his notebooks with the fact that humans use their strength and power to raise animals for slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/nov/30/leonardo-da-vinci-animal-rights-activist |title=Leonardo da Vinci unleashed: the animal rights activist within the artist |last=Jones |first=Jonathan |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016122713/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/nov/30/leonardo-da-vinci-animal-rights-activist |archivedate=16 October 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Descartes]] contrarily believed that non-humans are automata, complex machines with no soul, mind, or reason.&lt;ref name=MMidgley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Midgley|first1=Mary|title=Descartes' prisoners|journal=New Statesman|date=24 May 1999|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/149215|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208053932/http://www.newstatesman.com/node/149215|archivedate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cartesian dualism, consciousness was unique to human among all other animals and linked to physical matter by divine grace. However, close analysis shows that many human features such as complex sign usage, tool use, and self-consciousness can be found in some animals.&lt;ref name="cassuto" /&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]], by presenting the theory of [[evolution]], revolutionized the way that humans viewed their relationship with other species. Darwin believed that not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals, but the latter had social, mental and moral lives too. Later, in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), he wrote: "There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties."&lt;ref name="charles"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=The Descent of Man|date=1871|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvsHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers and intellectuals, such as [[Peter Singer]] and [[Tom Regan]], have argued that animals' ability to feel pain as humans do makes their well-being worthy of equal consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Rader, Priscilla, "Virtue Ethics and Non-Human Animals: The Missing Link to the Animal Liberation Movement" (2012). Humanities Capstone Projects. Paper 13.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many precursors of this train of thought. [[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of [[utilitarianism]], famously wrote in his ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' (1789):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/bentham/jeremy/morals/|title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|language=en|access-date=5 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406110618/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/bentham/jeremy/morals/|archivedate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"The question is not, can they reason nor can they talk? but, can they suffer?"}}

These arguments have prompted some to suggest that animals' well-being should enter a social welfare function directly, not just indirectly via its effect only on human well-being.&lt;ref name=norwood&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norwood|first1=FB|last2=Lusk|first2=JL|title=Direct versus indirect questioning: An application to the well-being of farm animals|journal=Soc Indic Res|date=2010|volume=96|issue=3|pages=551–565|doi=10.1007/s11205-009-9492-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one survey of United States homeowners, 68% of respondents said they actually consider the price of meat a more important issue.&lt;ref name="norwood" /&gt;

==Forms==

===Neglect===
[[File:This Horse is in Terrible Shape.jpg|thumb|A starved and bruised horse eating at a veterinary clinic after rescue.]]
Animal cruelty can be broken down into two main categories: active and passive. Passive cruelty is typified by cases of neglect, in which the cruelty is a lack of action rather than the action itself. Examples of neglect are starvation, dehydration, parasite infestations, allowing a collar to grow into an animal’s skin, inadequate shelter in extreme weather conditions, and failure to seek veterinary care when necessary. In many cases of neglect in which an investigator believes that the cruelty occurred out of ignorance, the investigator may attempt to educate the pet owner, then revisit the situation. In more severe cases, exigent circumstances may require that the animal be removed for veterinary care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_cruelty.php |title=Pet-Abuse.Com – Animal Cruelty |publisher=Pet-abuse.com |accessdate=6 November 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211105757/http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_cruelty.php |archivedate=11 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial animal farming===
[[File:Killing - Harling Farm.webm|thumb|Footage of a 'Quality Assured' pig farm in England]]
[[File:Animal Abuse Battery Cage 01.jpg|thumbnail|Egg laying hens in a crowded cage.]]
[[File:Legebat2.jpg|thumbnail|A chicken egg production facility.]]
Farm animals are generally produced in large, industrial facilities that house thousands of animals at high densities; these are sometimes called [[factory farms]]. The industrial nature of these facilities means that many routine procedures or animal husbandry practices impinge on the welfare of the animals and could arguably be considered as "cruelty", with Henry Stephen Salt claiming in 1899 that "it is impossible to transport and slaughter vast numbers of large and highly-sensitive animals in a really humane manner".&lt;ref&gt;Salt, H.S. (1899) The Logic of Vegetarianism: Essays and Dialogues. London.&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been suggested the number of animals hunted, kept as companions, used in laboratories, reared for the fur industry, raced, and used in zoos and circuses, is insignificant compared to farm animals, and therefore the "animal welfare issue" is numerically reducible to the "farm animal welfare issue".&lt;ref name=leahy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matheny|first1=Gaverick|last2=Leahy|first2=Cheryl|title=Farm-Animal Welfare, Legislation, and Trade|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=2007|volume=70|issue=1|pages=325–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, it has been suggested by campaign groups that chickens, cows, pigs, and other farm animals are among the most numerous animals subjected to cruelty. For example, because male chickens do not lay eggs, newly hatched males are [[Chick culling|culled]] using macerators or grinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matt-bershadker/are-farm-animals-not-cons_b_5709659.html|title=Are Farm Animals Not Considered Animals?|date=25 August 2014|work=The Huffington Post|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827112109/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matt-bershadker/are-farm-animals-not-cons_b_5709659.html|archivedate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraphtv/6122453/Shocking-undercover-footage-from-an-egg-hatchery.html|title=Video: Shocking undercover footage from an egg hatchery – Telegraph|date=1 September 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308172245/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraphtv/6122453/Shocking-undercover-footage-from-an-egg-hatchery.html|archivedate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide [[meat consumption|meat]] [[overconsumption]] is another factor that contributes to the miserable situation of farm animals.&lt;ref name="JSos"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/are-we-the-cruellest-weve-ever-been-the-way-we-treat-animals-suggests-we-are-20151004-gk168p.html|title=Are we the cruellest we've ever been?

Many undercover investigators have exposed the animal cruelty taking place inside the  factory farming industry and there is evidence to show that consumers provided with accurate information about the process of meat productions and the abuse that accompanies it has led to changes in their attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Fiber-Ostrow, Pamela, Lovell, Jarret S.

To reduce aggression in overcrowded conditions, shortly after birth piglets are castrated, their tails are amputated, and their teeth clipped.&lt;ref name=cassuto&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassuto|first1=David N.|title=Bred Meat: The Cultural Foundation of the Factory Farm|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=2007|volume=70|issue=1|pages=59–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calves are sometimes raised in [[Veal#Veal crates|veal crates]], which are small stalls that essentially immobilize calves during their growth, reducing costs and preventing muscle development, making the resulting meat a pale color, preferred by consumers.&lt;ref name=leahy /&gt;

Animal cruelty such as [[soring]], which is illegal, sometimes occurs on farms and ranches, as does lawful but cruel treatment such as [[livestock branding]]. Since [[Ag-gag]] laws prohibit video or photographic documentation of farm activities, these practices have been documented by [[secret photography]] taken by [[whistleblower]]s or [[Undercover operation|undercover operatives]] from such organizations as [[Mercy for Animals]] and the [[Humane Society of the United States]] posing as employees. [[Agricultural organization]]s such as the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]] have successfully advocated for laws that tightly restrict secret photography or concealing information from farm employers.&lt;ref name=NYT4613&gt;{{cite news|title=Taping of Farm Cruelty Is Becoming the Crime|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/us/taping-of-farm-cruelty-is-becoming-the-crime.html|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 April 2013|author=Richard A.

The following are lists of invasive procedures which cause pain, routinely performed on farm animals, and housing conditions that routinely cause animal welfare concerns.  It is arguable whether these practices constitute '''cruelty to animals'''.

===Alleged link to human violence and psychological disorders===
There are studies providing evidence of a link between animal cruelty and violence towards humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lockwood |first1=R. |last2=Hodge |first2=G. |year=1986 |title=The tangled web of animal abuse: The links between cruelty to animals and human violence |journal=Readings in Research and Applications |pages=77–82 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=155688 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623163557/https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=155688 |archivedate=23 June 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arluke |first1=A. |last2=Levin |first2=J. |last3=Luke |first3=C. |last4=Ascione |first4=F. |year=1999 |title=The relationship of animal abuse to violence and other forms of antisocial behavior |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=963–975 |doi=10.1177/088626099014009004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alleyne, E., Tilston, L., Parfitt, C. and Butcher, R.|year=2015|title=Adult-perpetrated animal abuse: development of a proclivity scale|journal=Psychology, Crime &amp; Law|volume=21|issue=6|pages=570–588|doi=10.1080/1068316X.2014.999064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baxendale, S., Lester, L., Johnston, R. and Cross, D.|year=2015|title=Risk factors in adolescents' involvement in violent behaviours|journal=Journal of Aggression, Conflict and Peace Research|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2–18|doi=10.1108/jacpr-09-2013-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conviction statistics are thought by some to show people convicted for animal cruelty to be more likely to be violent to humans, leading experts to believe that decreasing animal abuse will, in turn, decrease domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Cruelty and Human Violence|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/abuse_neglect/qa/cruelty_violence_connection_faq.html|website=The Humane Society of The United States|accessdate=6 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007082235/http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/abuse_neglect/qa/cruelty_violence_connection_faq.html|archivedate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, others explain apparent correlation by [[criminal court]]s more often convicting the former for the latter crime as a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], without any actual link between the two types of actions.&lt;ref&gt;Delinquent Networks Youth Co-Offending in Stockholm, Jerzy Sarnecki December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins Burke, R. (2001) An Introduction to Criminological Theory, Cullompton&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that  [[psychiatry]] and other authorities outside of courts keep records of who have been cruel to animals and can make biased guesses about whether or not they did violence to humans thereafter and also that they conversely record people who have been violent to humans and can be more biased towards later assuming them to have been cruel to animals, explaining apparent links by institutional bias without link between the actions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatric Bias and Bigotry in Mainstream Corporate Media, Don Weitz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Overt Psychiatric Bias – NICE Guidelines Development Group, 24 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of these studies is the definition of cruelty as "socially disapproved behavior". [[Piers Bierne]], for instance, has criticized existing studies for ignoring socially accepted practices (such as [[animal slaughter]] and [[vivisection]]) that might be linked to violence against humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021521/http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |archivedate=7 November 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A history of torturing pets and small animals, a behavior known as [[zoosadism]], is considered one of the signs of certain [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]], including [[antisocial personality disorder]], also known as psychopathic personality disorder . According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "[t]he FBI has found that a history of cruelty to animals is one of the traits that regularly appears in its computer records of serial [[rape|rapists]] and [[serial killer|murderers]], and the standard diagnostic and treatment manual for psychiatric and emotional disorders lists cruelty to animals a diagnostic criterion for [[conduct disorder]]s."&lt;ref name="aggression-v-animals"&gt;{{cite book

Cruelty to animals is one of the three components of the [[Macdonald triad]], behavior considered to be one of the signs of violent antisocial behavior in children and adolescents. According to the studies used to form this model, cruelty to animals is a common (but not universal) behavior in children and adolescents who grow up to become [[serial killer]]s and other violent criminals.

It has also been found that children who are cruel to animals have often witnessed or been victims of abuse themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duncan | first1 = A. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2005 | title = Significance of Family Risk Factors in Development of Childhood Animal Cruelty in Adolescent Boys with Conduct Problems | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/74324k81086433v0/ | journal = Journal of Family Violence | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 235–239 | doi=10.1007/s10896-005-5987-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two separate studies cited by the Humane Society of the United States, roughly one-third of families suffering from domestic abuse indicated that at least one child had hurt or killed a pet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]] |url=http://www.hsus.org/hsus_field/first_strike_the_connection_between_animal_cruelty_and_human_violence/animal_cruelty_and_family_violence_making_the_connection/ |title=Animal Cruelty and Family Violence: Making the Connection |accessdate=26 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025001436/http://www.hsus.org/hsus_field/first_strike_the_connection_between_animal_cruelty_and_human_violence/animal_cruelty_and_family_violence_making_the_connection/ |archivedate=25 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural rituals===
Many times, when [[Asiatic elephant]]s are captured in [[Thailand]], handlers use a technique known as the [[training crush]], in which "handlers use sleep-deprivation, hunger, and thirst to 'break' the elephants' spirit and make them submissive to their owners"; moreover, handlers drive nails into the elephants' ears and feet.&lt;ref name=Hile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1016_021016_phajaan.html|title=Activists Denounce Thailand's Elephant "Crushing" Ritual|last=Hile|first=Jennifer|date=16 October 2002|work=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=1 October 2014|quote=Just before dawn in the remote highlands of northern Thailand, west of the village Mae Jaem, a four-year-old elephant bellows as seven village men stab nails into her ears and feet. She is tied up and immobilized in a small, wooden cage. Her cries are the only sounds to interrupt the otherwise quiet countryside. The cage is called a "training crush." It's the centerpiece of a centuries-old ritual in northern Thailand designed to domesticate young elephants. In addition to beatings, handlers use sleep-deprivation, hunger, and thirst to "break" the elephants' spirit and make them submissive to their owners.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218231457/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1016_021016_phajaan.html|archivedate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of cruelty to animals for divination purposes is found in ancient cultures, and some modern religions such as [[Santeria]] continue to do animal sacrifices for healing and other rituals. [[Taghairm]] was performed by ancient Scots to summon devils.

===TV and film making===
Animal cruelty has long been an issue with the art form of [[filmmaking]], with even some big-budget [[Hollywood]] films receiving criticism for allegedly harmful—and sometimes lethal—treatment of animals during production. Court decisions have addressed films that harm animal such as videos that in part depict dogfighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.capitalpress.com/AP-Supreme-Court-pit-bull-videos-042010|agency=Associated Press|title=Court voids law aimed at animal cruelty videos|first=Mark|last=Sherman|date=10 April 2010|accessdate=10 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512161642/http://www.capitalpress.com/AP-Supreme-Court-pit-bull-videos-042010|archivedate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) has been associated with monitoring American filmmaking since after the release of the 1939 film ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'', in which a horse was pushed off a plank and drowned in a body of water after having fallen 40 feet into it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18071/Jesse-James/articles.html|title=Turner Classic Movies - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816183504/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18071/Jesse-James/articles.html|archivedate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, monitoring of animal cruelty was a partnership between the AHA and officials in the Hays Office through the [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Provisions in the code discouraged "apparent cruelty to children and animals", and because the Hays Office had the power to enforce this clause, the [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) often had access to sets to assess adherence to it. However, because the American Humane Association's Hollywood office depended on the Hays Office for the right to monitor sets, the closure of the Hays Office in 1966 corresponded with an increase in animal cruelty on movie sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/73437045|title=27 Jun 1982, Page 14 - The Pantagraph at Newspapers.com|access-date=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827090907/http://www.newspapers.com/image/73437045/|archivedate=27 August 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1977, a three-year contract was in place between the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) and the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] which specified that the [[American Humane Association]] should be "consulted in the use of animals 'when appropriate'", but the contract did not provide a structure for what "appropriate" meant, and had no enforcement powers. This contract expired in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/139631080/|title=30 Sep 1980, Page 56 - St. Louis Post-Dispatch at Newspapers.com|access-date=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818194614/https://www.newspapers.com/image/139631080/|archivedate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous examples of animal cruelty in film was [[Michael Cimino]]'s flop ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), in which numerous animals were brutalized and even killed during production. Cimino allegedly killed chickens and bled horses from the neck to gather samples of their blood to smear on actors for ''Heaven's Gate'', and also allegedly had a horse blown up with [[dynamite]] while shooting a battle sequence, the shot of which made it into the film. This film played a large part in renewed scrutiny of animal cruelty in films, and led to renewed official on-set jurisdiction to monitor the treatment of animals by the AHA in 1980.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the release of the film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981), the star and director of the picture, [[Warren Beatty]] apologized for his Spanish film crew's use of [[tripwire]]s on horses while filming a battle scene, when Beatty wasn't present. Tripwires were used against horses when ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988) and ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'' (1999) were being filmed. An [[ox]] was sliced nearly in half during production of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), while a donkey was bled to death for dramatic effect for the Danish film ''[[Manderlay]]'' (2005), in a scene later cut from the film.

There is a case of cruelty to animals in the [[South Korea]]n film ''[[The Isle]]'' (2000), according to its director [[Kim Ki-Duk]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy McKeague, [http://dvd.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_7779.php An Interview with Kim Ki-Duk and Suh Jung on The Isle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128010318/http://dvd.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_7779.php |date=28 November 2007 }} at monstersandcritics.com, 11 May 2005. Retrieved 11 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, a real [[frog]] is skinned alive while [[fish]] are mutilated. Seven animals were killed for the camera in the controversial [[Italy|Italian]] film ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name="Fango"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/4101 |title=Pointless Cannibal Holocaust Sequel in the Works |publisher=Fangoria |accessdate=13 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221071540/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/4101 |archivedate=21 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The images in the film include the slow and graphic beheading and ripping apart of a [[turtle]], a [[monkey]] being beheaded and its brains being consumed by natives and a [[spider]] being chopped apart. ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was only one film in a collective of similarly themed movies ([[cannibal films]]) that featured unstaged animal cruelty. Their influences were rooted in the films of [[Mondo film]]makers, which sometimes contained similar content. In several countries, such as the UK, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was only allowed for release with most of the animal cruelty edited out.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

More recently, the video sharing site [[YouTube]] has been criticized for hosting thousands of videos of real life animal cruelty, especially the feeding of one animal to another for the purposes of entertainment and spectacle. Although some of these videos have been flagged as inappropriate by users, YouTube has generally declined to remove them, unlike videos which include [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;Times online, [http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article2284380.ece timesonline.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519094714/http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article2284380.ece |date=19 May 2011 }} 19 August 2007.

Films monitored by the American Humane Association may bear one of their end-credit messages. Many productions, including those made in the US, do not advise AHA or SAG of animal use in films, so there is no oversight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101110015309/http://www.americanhumane.org/protecting-animals/programs/no-animals-were-harmed/movie-rating-system.html Movie Rating System.

Simulations of animal cruelty exist on [[television]], too. On the 23 September 1999 edition of [[WWE]] [[Smackdown!]], a plot line had professional wrestler [[Ray Traylor|Big Boss Man]] trick fellow wrestler [[Al Snow]] into appearing to eat his pet [[chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] Pepper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alsnowshead.tripod.com/pepper.html Pepper Tribute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717101710/http://alsnowshead.tripod.com/pepper.html |date=17 July 2011 }}.

===Circuses===
The use of animals in the [[circus]] has been controversial since animal welfare groups have documented instances of animal cruelty during the training of performing animals. Numerous instances of animal abuse in circuses have been documented such as confining enclosures, lack of regular veterinary care, abusive training methods and lack of oversight by regulating bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/wildlife/circus/2004_HSUS_Circus_Incidents.pdf | format = PDF | title = Circus Incidents:  Attacks, Abuse and Property Damage | publisher = [[Humane Society of the United States]] | date = 1 June 2004 | accessdate = 15 December 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194511/http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/wildlife/circus/2004_HSUS_Circus_Incidents.pdf | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/circuses_entertainment/facts/circus_facts.html| title = Circuses| publisher = [[Humane Society of the United States]]| accessdate = 15 December 2015| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222131038/http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/circuses_entertainment/facts/circus_facts.html| archivedate = 22 December 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal trainers have argued that some criticism is not based on fact, including beliefs that shouting makes the animals believe the trainer is going to hurt them, that caging is cruel and common, and the harm caused by the use of whips, chains or training implements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lionden.com/faqs.htm#+Do%20circus%20trainers/handlers%20abuse%20animals | last = Patton | first = K | date = 1 April 2007 | accessdate = 23 May 2008 | title = Frequently Asked Questions: Do circus trainers/handlers abuse animals? | publisher = lionden.com | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621073945/http://www.lionden.com/faqs.htm#+Do%20circus%20trainers/handlers%20abuse%20animals | archivedate = 21 June 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullfighting===
[[File:Stier geveld5.jpg|thumb|300px|A bull dying in a bullfight.]]

In Spanish, opposition to bullfighting is referred to as ''antitaurismo''.

''The Bulletpoint Bullfight'' warns that bullfighting is "not for the squeamish", advising spectators to "be prepared for blood". It details prolonged and profuse bleeding caused by horse-mounted lancers, the charging by the bull of a blindfolded, armored horse who is "sometimes doped up, and unaware of the proximity of the bull", the placing of barbed darts by banderilleros, followed by the matador's fatal sword thrust. It stresses that these procedures are a normal part of bullfighting and that death is rarely instantaneous. It further warns those attending bullfights to "be prepared to witness various failed attempts at killing the animal before it lies down."&lt;ref&gt;''The Bulletpoint Bullfight'', p. 6, {{ISBN|978-1-4116-7400-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Toro embolado====
[[File:Toro Jubilo IV.jpg|thumb|300px|The Toro Jubilo, Madrid, 2014.]]

The "[[Medinaceli|Toro Jubilo]]" or [[Toro embolado]] in [[Province of Soria|Soria]], [[Medinaceli]], Spain, is a festival associated with animal cruelty. During this festival, balls of pitch are attached to a bull's horns and set on fire. The bull is then released into the streets and can do nothing but run around in pain, often smashing into walls in an attempt to douse the fire. These fiery balls can burn for hours, and they burn the bull's horns, body, and eyes – all while spectators cheer and run around the victim. The animal rights group [[PACMA]] has described the fiesta as "a clear example of animal mistreatment", and [[PETA]] calls it "a sadistic festival".&lt;ref&gt;Typically Spanish – Spain News, [http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_32664.shtml Toro Jubilo fiesta returns to Medinaceli, Soria ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029022313/http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_32664.shtml |date=29 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PETA, [http://action.peta.org.uk/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=5&amp;ea.campaign.id=4590&amp;c=pukfpaa Help Stop the Sadistic 'Fire Bull' Festival in Soria] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120815122313/http%3A//action.peta.org.uk/ea%2Dcampaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id%3D5%26ea.campaign.id%3D4590%26c%3Dpukfpaa |date=15 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Toro Jubilo' 2011 en Medinaceli, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKLn8uGCguk on YouTube] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312165823/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKLn8uGCguk |date=12 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warfare===
[[Military animal]]s are creatures that have been employed by humankind for use in [[war]]fare. They are a specific application of [[working animal]]s. Examples include [[Horses in warfare|horses]], [[Dogs in warfare|dogs]] and [[Military dolphin|dolphin]]s. Only recently has the involvement of animals in war been questioned, and practices such as using animals for fighting, as living bombs (as in the use of [[exploding donkey]]s) or for military [[Animal testing|testing]] purposes (such as during the [[Bikini atomic experiments]]) may now be criticised for being cruel.&lt;ref name="aa-war"&gt;

===Unnecessary scientific experiments or demonstrations===
Under all three of the conceptual approaches to animal cruelty discussed above, performing unnecessary experiments or demonstrations upon animals that cause them substantial pain or distress may be viewed as cruelty. Due to changes in ethical standards, this type of cruelty tends to be less common today than it used to be in the past. For example, schoolroom demonstrations of oxygen depletion routinely suffocated birds by placing them under a glass cover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/lairetlemondear00manggoog#page/n56/mode/1up|title=L'air et le monde aérien|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animals were suffocated in the [[Cave of Dogs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first= An |title=Account of the Grotta del Cane; With Remarks Upon Suffocation by Carbonic Acid|publisher= The London Medical and Physical Journal|year= 1832|pages= 278–285 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eegEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA278&amp;lpg=RA1-PA278&amp;dq=An+account+of+the+Grotta+del+Cane#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20account%20of%20the%20Grotta%20del%20Cane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming &amp; Johnson, Toxic Airs: Body, Place, Planet in Historical Perspective, Pittsburgh, 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroonenberg, Why Hell Stinks of Sulfur: Mythology and Geology of the Underworld, Chicago, 2013, 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt; to demonstrate the density and toxicity of carbon dioxide to curious travellers on the [[Grand Tour]].

===No pet policies and abandonment===
Many apartment complexes and rental homes institute no pet policies. No pet policies are a leading cause of animal abandonment, which is considered a crime in many jurisdictions. In many cases, abandoned pets have to be euthanized due to the strain they put on animal shelters and rescue groups. Abandoned animals often become feral or contribute to feral populations. In particular, feral dogs can pose a serious threat to pets, children, and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0821_030821_straydogs.html|title=U.S. Facing Feral-Dog Crisis|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421131008/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0821_030821_straydogs.html|archivedate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feral cats are known to hunt endangered birds and have interbred with wild cat populations.

In [[Ontario, Canada]], no pet policies are outlawed under the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Act and are considered invalid even when a tenant signs a lease that includes a no pets clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2012/12/07/why_nopet_rental_clauses_lack_teeth.html|title=Why no-pet rental clauses lack teeth|date=7 December 2012|work=thestar.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720024623/https://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2012/12/07/why_nopet_rental_clauses_lack_teeth.html|archivedate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar legislation has also been considered in [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/no-pet-policy-for-man-renters-could-be-outlawed-1.932467|title=No-pet policy for Man. renters could be outlawed|date=15 February 2010|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413132526/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/no-pet-policy-for-man-renters-could-be-outlawed-1.932467|archivedate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws by country==
[[File:Chat plombé.jpg|thumb|Chest X-ray of a cat that has been shot. White spots are lead shot.]]
Many jurisdictions around the world have enacted statutes which forbid cruelty to some animals but these vary by country and in some cases by the use or practice.

The Animal Protection Act No 71 of 1962 in [[South Africa]] covers "farm animals, domestic animals and birds, and wild animals, birds, and reptiles that are in captivity or under the control of humans."

The Act contains a detailed list of prohibited acts of cruelty including overloading, causing unnecessary suffering due to confinement, chaining or tethering, abandonment, unnecessarily denying food or water, keeping in a dirty or parasitic condition, or failing to provide veterinary assistance. There is also a general provision prohibiting wanton, unreasonable, or negligible commission or omission of acts resulting in unnecessary suffering. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries for 2013/14 to 2016/17 mentions updating animal protection legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspca.co.za |title=NSPCA Cares about all Animals |publisher=Nspca.co.za |date= |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NSPCA]] is the largest and oldest animal welfare organisation in [[South Africa]] that enforces 90% of all animal cruelty cases in the country by means of enforcing the Animals Protection Act.

====South Sudan====
The Criminal Code of [[South Sudan]] has laws against maltreatment of animals. The laws read:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/IMG/pdf/penal_code_act_2008.pdf The Penal Code Act, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000802/http://www.sudantribune.com/IMG/pdf/penal_code_act_2008.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}. sudantribune.com&lt;/ref&gt;

''196. Ill-treatment of Domestic Animal''.
:Whoever cruelly beats, tortures or otherwise willfully ill-treats any tame, domestic or wild animal, which has previously been deprived of its liberty, or arranges, promotes or organizes fights between cocks, rams, bulls or other domestic animals or encourages such acts, commits an offence, and upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months or with a fine.

''197. Riding and Neglect of Animal''.
:Whoever wantonly rides, overdrives or overloads any animal or intentionally drugs or employs any animal, which by reason of age, sickness, wounds or infirmity is not in a condition to work, or neglects any animal in such a manner as to cause it unnecessary suffering, commits an offence, and upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month or with a fine or with both.

In [[Colombia]], there is little control over cruel behaviors against animals, and the government has proposed that [[bullfighting]] be declared a "[[Cultural Heritage]]"; other cruel activities like [[cockfighting]] are given the same legal treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultoro.com/blog/2012/10/17/el-gobierno-colombiano-se-compromete-a-que-los-toros-sean-patrimonio-cultual/|title=Colombian president offers to grant bullfighting status of cultural heritage|accessdate=17 October 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new bill has been presented to the Costa Rican legisletive assembly to better define animal cruelty and establish harsher punishments for the abuse of animals.

====Mexico====
The current policy of [[Mexico]], in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], condemns physical harm to animals as [[property]] damage to the owners of the abused animal, considering the animals as owned property.

In [[criminal law]], the situation is different. In December 2012, the [[Legislative Assembly of the Federal District]] reformed the existing Penal Code of [[Mexico City]], establishing abuse and cruelty to animals as criminal offenses, provided the animals are not deemed to be plagues or [[pest (organism)|pests]]. Abandoned animals are not considered to be plagues. A subsequent reform was entered into force on 31 January 2013, by a decree published in the Official Gazette of the Federal District. The law provides penalties of 6 months to 2 years imprisonment, and a fine of 50 to 100 days at minimum wage, to persons who cause obvious injury to an animal, and the penalty is increased by one half if those injuries endanger its life. The penalty rises to 2 to 4 years of prison, and a fine of 200 to 400 days at minimum wage, if the person intentionally causes the death of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://el5poder.org/blogs/entry/Por-fin-reforma-al-C-digo-Penal-del-D-F-sobre-maltrato-animal|title=Finally, reform to the Penal Code of Mexico City on animal abuse|accessdate=9 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414154122/http://el5poder.org/blogs/entry/Por-fin-reforma-al-C-digo-Penal-del-D-F-sobre-maltrato-animal|archivedate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This law is considered to extend throughout the rest of the 31 constituent states of the country. In addition, The Law of Animal Protection of the Federal District is wide-ranging, based on banning "unnecessary suffering". Similar laws now exist in most states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/laprensa/notas/n2827566.htm|title=Lawmakers seek to position Federal enforcement of the Law of Animal Protection of the Federal District|accessdate=9 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722075004/http://www.oem.com.mx/laprensa/notas/n2827566.htm|archivedate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Animal welfare in the United States}}

The primary federal law relating to animal care and conditions in the US is the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966]], amended in 1970, 1976, 1985, 1990, 2002 and 2007. It is the only Federal law in the United States that regulates the treatment of animals in research, exhibition, transport, and by dealers. Other laws, policies, and guidelines may include additional species coverage or specifications for animal care and use, but all refer to the Animal Welfare Act as the minimum acceptable standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/AWA2007/intro.shtml |title=Legislative History of the Animal Welfare Act |accessdate=7 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302102008/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/AWA2007/intro.shtml |archivedate=2 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AWA has been criticized by [[animal rights]] groups for excluding birds, rats and mice bred for research, and animals raised for food or fiber as well as all cold-blooded animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=80 |title=The Animal Welfare Act |accessdate=7 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429005431/http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=80 |archivedate=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] releases an annual report ranking the [[animal rights|animal protection laws]] of every state based on their relative strength and general comprehensiveness. In 2013's report, the top five states for their strong anti-cruelty laws were [[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Michigan]], [[Oregon]], and [[California]].The five states with the weakest animal cruelty laws in 2013 were [[Kentucky]], [[Iowa]], [[South Dakota]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/press-room/press-releases/annual-study-names-2013s-top-five-states-to-be-an-animal-abuser/|title=Annual Study Names 2013's "Top Five States to be an Animal Abuser"|work=Animal Legal Defense Fund|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722032419/http://aldf.org/press-room/press-releases/annual-study-names-2013s-top-five-states-to-be-an-animal-abuser/|archivedate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a [[Florida]] legislator proposed a ban on "cruelty to bovines," stating: "A person who, for the purpose of practice, [[entertainment]], or sport, intentionally fells, trips, or otherwise causes a cow to fall or lose its balance by means of roping, lassoing, dragging, or otherwise touching the tail of the cow commits a [[misdemeanor]] of the first degree."&lt;ref name="floridaban"&gt;{{cite web | last = Emery | first = David | title = Florida to Consider Ban on Cow Tipping | publisher = About.com | url = http://urbanlegends.about.com/b/a/058976.htm | accessdate = 7 June 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704141026/http://urbanlegends.about.com/b/a/058976.htm | archivedate = 4 July 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal did not become law.&lt;ref name="floridaban"/&gt;

In the United States, [[cropping (animal)|ear cropping]], [[docking (animal)|tail docking]], rodeo sports, and other acts are legal and sometimes condoned. Penalties for cruelty can be minimal, if pursued. Currently, 46 of the 50 states have enacted felony penalties for certain forms of animal abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=261 |title=ALDF: U.S. Jurisdictions With and Without Felony Animal Cruelty Provisions |publisher=Aldf.org |accessdate=29 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629052448/http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=261 |archivedate=29 June 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in most jurisdictions, animal cruelty is most commonly charged as a misdemeanor offense. In one recent California case, a felony conviction for animal cruelty could theoretically net a 25-year to life sentence due to their [[three-strikes law]], which increases sentences based on prior felony convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesocal.com/crime/2007/10/accused-dog-killer-an-excon-co.html|title=Accused Dog Killer Could Get 25 Years to Life in Prison|accessdate=6 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818225243/http://www.insidesocal.com/crime/2007/10/accused-dog-killer-an-excon-co.html|archivedate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, Texas Federal Court Judge [[Sim Lake]] ruled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/04/animal-crush-video-charges-dismissed-in-first-case-162412.html|title='Animal crush' video charges dismissed in first case under new law|work=POLITICO|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928024724/http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/04/animal-crush-video-charges-dismissed-in-first-case-162412.html|archivedate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010]], which criminalized the recording, sale, and transport of videos depicting animal cruelty as obscenity, is in violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Judge Lake noted that obscenity tests require an explicitly sexual depiction, which the criminalized videos lack. This follows the precedent set by [[United States v. Stevens]], which additionally held that restrictions on the possession of animal cruelty videos were unconstitutional.

Despite the absence of a unified law against animal mistreatment, the [[World Animal Protection]] notes that some legislation protecting the welfare of animals exists in certain contexts, especially ones used in research and in zoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China|url=http://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china|website=World Animal Protection|accessdate=23 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219084755/http://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china|archivedate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, legislation was drafted to address deliberate cruelty to animals in China. If passed, the legislation would offer some protection to pets, captive wildlife and animals used in laboratories, as well as regulating how farm animals are raised, transported and slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peterwedderburn/100010449/china-unveils-first-ever-animal-cruelty-legislation/|title=China unveils first ever animal cruelty legislation|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=18 September 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110728103413/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peterwedderburn/100010449/china-unveils-first-ever-animal-cruelty-legislation/|archivedate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The People's Republic of China is currently in the process of making changes to its stray-dog population laws in the capital city, Beijing. Mr. Zheng Gang who is the director of the Internal and Judicial Committee which comes under the Beijing Municipal People's Congress (BMPC), supports the new draft of the Beijing Municipal Regulation on Dogs from the local government. This new law is due to replace the current Beijing Municipal Regulation on Dog Ownership, introduced in 1989. The current regulation talks of "strictly" limiting dog ownership and controlling the number of dogs in the city. The new draft focuses instead on "strict management and combining restrictions with management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-07/18/content_246068.htm |title=Beijing loosens leash on pet dogs |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |accessdate=6 November 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013081420/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-07/18/content_246068.htm |archivedate=13 October 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hong Kong====
As of 2010, Hong Kong has supplemented or replaced the laws against cruelty with a positive approach using laws that specify how animals should be treated.&lt;ref name=HK2010&gt;[http://www.ke.hku.hk/assets/doc/Review-of-Animal-Welfare-Legisaltion-in-HK.pdf Review of Animal Welfare Legislation in Hong Kong] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721092607/http://www.ke.hku.hk/assets/doc/Review-of-Animal-Welfare-Legisaltion-in-HK.pdf |date=21 July 2011 }} by Amanda S. Whitfort and Fiona M. Woodhouse, June 2010. This document reviews animal welfare laws and compares them to those of Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, and the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;
The government department primarily responsible for animal welfare in Hong Kong is the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD).

Laws enforced by the AFCD include these:
* the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance (also enforced by the police)
* the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Ordinance (including regulations for licences imposed on livestock keepers and animal traders and a Code of Standards for Licensed Animal Traders)
* the Dogs and Cats Ordinance
* the Pounds Ordinance
* the Rabies Ordinance
* the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance
In addition, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) does the following:
* enforces the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance, which includes regulations for slaughterhouses and wet markets
* publishes a Code of Practice for the Welfare of Food Animals (which describes their transport)
* publishes Operational Guidelines for the Welfare of Food Animals at Slaughterhouses
The Department of Health does the following:
* enforces the Animals (Control of Experiments) Ordinance.
* publishes a Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Experimental Purposes

As of 2006, Hong Kong has a law titled "Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance", with a maximum 3 year imprisonment and fines of HKD$200,000.&lt;ref&gt;Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, "[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/CurAllEngDoc/504FD3C5228778AE88256489000BA497?OpenDocument Penalty for Cruelty to Animals]," ''Prevention of Cruelty to Animals'' (Chapter 169, Section 3) 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{Main|Animal welfare and rights in India}}

[[The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,1960]] was amended in the year 1982.&lt;ref name=oldin&gt;{{cite web|title=The prevention of cruelty to animals act,1960|url=http://envfor.nic.in/legis/awbi/awbi01.pdf|work=Amendments|publisher=Ministry of environment and Forests, Government of India|accessdate=9 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417144747/http://envfor.nic.in/legis/awbi/awbi01.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the newly amended ''Indian animal welfare act, 2011'' cruelty to animals is an offence and is punishable with a fine which shall not be less than ten thousand [[Rupees]], which may extend to twenty five thousand Rupees or with imprisonment up to two years or both in the case of a first offence. In the case of second or subsequent offence, with a fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand Rupees, but may extend to one [[lakh]] Rupees and with imprisonment with a term which shall not be less than one year but may extend to three years.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian animal welfare act 2011|url=http://moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/draft-animal-welfare-act-2011.pdf|work=Chapter IV.Cruelty to animals|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India|accessdate=9 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105144858/http://moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/draft-animal-welfare-act-2011.pdf|archivedate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amendment is currently awaiting ratification from the Government of India. The 1962 Act in the meanwhile is the one that is practiced as of now. The maximum penalty under the 1962 Act is Rs. 50 (under $1).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awbi.org/awbi-pdf/draftawact2011.pdf THE ANIMAL WELFARE ACT, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804082544/http://www.awbi.org/awbi-pdf/draftawact2011.pdf |date=4 August 2016 }}. awbi.org&lt;/ref&gt;
Many organizations, including ones such as the local [[SPCA]], PFA and [[Fosterdopt]] are actively involved in assisting the general population in reporting cruelty cases to the police and helping bring the perpetrator to justice. Due to this, much of change has been observed through the subcontinent.

Retrieved on 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; stipulates that "no person shall kill, injure, or inflict cruelty to animals without due course", and in particular, criminalises cruelty to all mammals, birds, and reptiles possessed by persons; as well as cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, pigeons, domestic rabbits, chickens, and domestic ducks regardless of whether they are in captivity.
* Killing or injuring without due reason: up to one year's imprisonment with labour or a fine of up to one million yen
* Cruelty such as causing debilitation by discontinuing feeding or watering without due reason: a fine of up to five hundred thousand yen
* Abandonment: a fine of up to five hundred thousand yen

Separate national and local ordinances exist with regards to ensuring health and safety of animals handled by pet shops and other businesses.

Animal experiments are regulated by the 2000 Law for the Humane Treatment and Management of Animals, which was amended in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Stevenson, Lisa A. Marshall and Douglas W.

Progress in Inflammation Research 2nd Edition 2006 p. 187. {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-7643-7520-1_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law requires those using animals to follow the principles outlined in the 3Rs and use as few animals as possible, and cause minimal distress and suffering. Regulation is at a local level based on national guidelines, but there are no governmental inspections of institutions and no reporting requirement for the numbers of animals used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a10 Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201152451/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm |date=1 December 2007 }} Report July 2002, Accessed 23 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As for pets, the new law provides that "whoever, having the duty to store, monitor or pet watch, abandons them, thereby putting in danger their food and the provision of care owed" faces up to six months imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Portugal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boasnoticias.pt/noticias_Animais-Lei-que-criminaliza-maus-tratos-entra-em-vigor_21060.html|title=Boas Notícias – Animais: Lei que criminaliza maus-tratos entra em vigor|author=The Agency|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003061452/http://boasnoticias.pt/noticias_Animais-Lei-que-criminaliza-maus-tratos-entra-em-vigor_21060.html|archivedate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Animal welfare in the United Kingdom}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], cruelty to animals is a criminal offence for which one may be jailed for up to 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/pdf/ukpga_20060045_en.pdf Animal Welfare Act 2006.

Retrieved on 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August 1911, the House of Commons introduced the [[Protection of Animals Act 1911]] (c.27) following lobbying by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ([[RSPCA]]). The maximum punishment was 6 months of "hard labour" with a fine of 25 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Monday, 1 January 1912; p. 3; Issue 39783; col F "The Animals' New Magna Charter"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1839]] "fighting or baiting Lions, Bears, Badgers, Cocks, Dogs, or other Animals" was prohibited in London, with a penalty of up to one month imprisonment, with possible hard labour, or up to five pounds. The law laid numerous restrictions on how, when, and where animals could be driven, wagons unloaded, etc.. It also prohibited owners from letting mad dogs run loose and gave police the right to destroy any dog suspected of being rabid or any dog bitten by a suspected rabid dog. The same law prohibited the use of dogs for drawing carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-law/victorian-legislation/1839-uk-act-london-police.htm |title=London Police Act 1839, Great Britain Parliament.

Under the [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]], domestic animals can be classed as property that is capable of being "damaged or destroyed".

The '''Dictatorship of Garibaldi''' (or ''Dictatorial Government of Sicily'') was the provisional [[Executive (government)|executive]] that [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] appointed to govern the territory of [[Sicily]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860. It governed in opposition to the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Bourbons of Naples]].

==History==
On May 14, [[1860]] in [[Salemi]], Garibaldi announced that he was assuming [[dictatorship]] over Sicily, in the name of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]]. On May 17, [[Francesco Crispi]] was appointed First Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YVYIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1  ''Raccolta degli atti del governo dittatoriale e prodittatoriale in Sicilia'', 1860, Stabilimento tipografico Francesco Lao, Palermo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]] advanced to [[Palermo]], the capital of the island, and launched a siege on 27 May. On June 2, 1860 in Palermo were appointed four secretaries of State and created six [[Ministry (government department)|departments]].

Created the Sicilian Army and a fleet of the Dictatorship Government of Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;http://oceania.pbworks.com/w/page/8470006/Ships-of-the-Dictatorship-Government-of-Sicily-in-1860&lt;/ref&gt;

The pace of Garibaldi's victories had worried [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]], who in early July sent him a proposal of immediate annexation of Sicily to [[Piedmont]]. Garibaldi, however, refused vehemently to allow such a move until the end of the war. Cavour's envoy, [[Giuseppe La Farina]], was arrested and expelled from the island. He was replaced by the more malleable [[Agostino Depretis]], who gained Garibaldi's trust and was appointed as pro-dictator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/agostino-depretis_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Agostino Depretis in ''Dizionario Biografico – Treccani'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictatorial government ended November 4, 1860, when the annexation of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] was ratified by the popular plebiscite of October 21.

Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years and have evolved considerably since that time as to language (written in a major international or a vernacular language), size (few or many volumes), intent (presentation of a global or a limited range of knowledge), cultural perceptions (authoritative, ideological, didactic, utilitarian), authorship (qualifications, style), readership (education level, background, interests, capabilities), and the technologies available for their production and distribution (hand-written manuscripts, small or large print runs, internet production). As a valued source of reliable information compiled by experts, printed versions found a prominent place in libraries, schools and other educational institutions.

The appearance of [[Online encyclopedia|digital and open-source versions]] in the 20th century has vastly expanded the accessibility, authorship, readership, and variety of encyclopedia entries and called into question the idea of what an encyclopedia is{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} and the relevance of applying to such dynamic productions the traditional criteria for assembling and evaluating print encyclopedias.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Two Greek words misunderstood as one===
The word ''[[wikt:encyclopedia|encyclopedia]]'' comes from the [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0060%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D10%3Asection%3D1 Ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία], Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'', 1.10.1, at Perseus Project&lt;!--Perseus features an erroneous transcription: *ἐγκύκλικος instead of ἐγκύκλιος--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; transliterated ''enkyklios paideia'', meaning "general education" from ''enkyklios'' (ἐγκύκλιος), meaning "circular, recurrent, required regularly, general"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gku%2Fklios ἐγκύκλιος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[paideia]]'' (παιδεία), meaning "education, rearing of a child"; together, the phrase literally translates as "complete instruction" or "complete knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpaidei%2Fa παιδεία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project&lt;/ref&gt; However, the two separate words were reduced to a single word due to a scribal error&lt;ref&gt;According to some accounts, such as the [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/encyclopedia ''American Heritage Dictionary''], copyists of Latin manuscripts took this phrase to be a single Greek word, ἐγκυκλοπαιδεία ''enkyklopaidia''.&lt;!--The American Heritage Dictionary gives "enkuklopaedia" (a mistaken transliteration) but Wikipedia follows [[WP:GREEK]].--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; by copyists of a [[Latin]] manuscript edition of [[Quintillian]] in 1470.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Franklin-Brown | first = Mary | title = Reading the world : encyclopedic writing in the scholastic age | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago London | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780226260709|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The copyists took this phrase to be a single Greek word, ''enkyklopaidia'', with the same meaning, and this spurious Greek word became the [[New Latin]] word "encyclopaedia", which in turn came into English. Because of this compounded word, fifteenth century readers and since have often, and incorrectly, thought that the Roman authors [[Quintillian]] and [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny]] described an ancient genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = König | first = Jason | title = Encyclopaedism from antiquity to the Renaissance | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-1-107-03823-3 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Pavao Skalić; Enciklopedija ili znanje svijeta svetih i svjetovnih struka (1559).jpg|thumb|right|Title page of [[Pavao Skalić|Skalich's]] ''Encyclopaedia, seu orbis disciplinarum, tam sacrarum quam prophanarum, epistemon'' from 1559, first clear use of the word ''encyclopaedia'' in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yeo | first = Richard | title = Encyclopaedic visions : scientific dictionaries and enlightenment culture | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0521152921 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Sixteenth century usage of the compounded word===
In the sixteenth century there was a level of ambiguity as to how to use this new word. As several titles illustrate, there was not a settled notion about its spelling nor its status as a noun. For example: Jacobus Philomusus's ''{{lang|la|Margarita philosophica encyclopaediam exhibens}}'' (1508); [[Johannes Aventinus]]'s ''{{lang|la|Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio}}''; [[Joachimus Fortius Ringelbergius]]'s ''{{lang|la|Lucubrationes vel potius absolutissima kyklopaideia}}'' (1538, 1541); [[Paul Skalich]]'s ''{{lang|la|[[Encyclopediae seu orbis disciplinarum tam sacrarum quam profanarum epistemon|Encyclopaediae sen orbis disciplinarum epistemon]]}}'' (1559); [[Gregor Reisch]]'s ''{{lang|la|Margarita philosophica}}'' (1503, retitled Encyclopaedia in 1583); and [[Samuel Eisenmenger]]'s ''{{lang|la|Cyclopaedia Paracelsica}}'' (1585).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D|title=Varieties of encyclopedism in the early Roman Empire: Vitruvius, Pliny the Elder, Artemidorus |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/304510158|last=Harris-McCoy |first=Daniel |year=2008 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |accessdate=January 18, 2018 |page=12|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only with [[Pavao Skalić]] and his ''{{lang|la|[[Encyclopediae seu orbis disciplinarum tam sacrarum quam profanarum epistemon]]}}'' (Encyclopaedia, or Knowledge of the World of Disciplines, Basel, 1559) that the term became first recognized as a noun.{{Citation needed|reason=This is an important distinction and needs to be backed up by a historical source.|date=February 2018}}

There have been two examples of the oldest [[vernacular]] use of the compounded word. In approximately 1490, Franciscus Puccius wrote a letter to Politianus thanking him for his ''Miscellanea'', calling it an encyclopedia.{{sfn|Harris-McCoy|2008|page=11–12}} More commonly, [[François Rabelais]] is cited for his use of the term in ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]]'' (1532).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Roest |first=Bert |booktitle=Pre-Modern Encyclopaedic Texts: Proceedings of the Second Comers Congress, Groningen, 1 – July 4, 1996|year=1997|publisher=BRILL|pages=213|title=Compilation as Theme and Praxis in Franciscan Universal Chronicles|ISBN=90-04-10830-0|editor=Peter Binkley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carey |first=Sorcha |title=Pliny's Catalogue of Culture: Art and Empire in the Natural History|page=17|chapter=Two Strategies of Encyclopaedism|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-925913-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The suffix ''-p(a)edia''===
Several encyclopedias have names that include the suffix ''-p(a)edia'', to mark the text as belonging to the genre of encyclopedias. For example, [[Banglapedia]] (on matters relevant for Bangladesh).

===Contemporary usage===
Today in English, the word is most commonly spelled ''encyclopedia'', though ''encyclopaedia'' ([[American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe|from ''encyclopædia'']]) is also used in Britain.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/61848?redirectedFrom=encyclopaedia#eid |format=online |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED.com), [[Oxford University Press]] |title=encyclopaedia |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern encyclopedia was developed from the [[dictionary]] in the 18th century. Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content [[expert]]s, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of [[words]] and their [[definitions]]. [[Synonym]]ous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited [[information]], [[wikt:Analysis|analysis]] or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in [[understanding]] the meaning, significance or limitations of a [[Term (language)|term]], and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.

To address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a ''subject or [[list of academic disciplines|discipline]]''. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]].

Four major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:
* Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field (the English-language ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and German ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Brockhaus]]'' are well-known examples). General encyclopedias may contain guides on how to do a variety of things, as well as embedded dictionaries and [[gazetteer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' or ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''.
* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopedia of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], or [[law]]. Works vary in the breadth of material and the depth of discussion, depending on the [[target audience]]. 
* Some systematic method of organization is essential to making an encyclopedia usable for reference. There have historically been two main methods of organizing printed encyclopedias: the [[alphabetical order|alphabetical]] method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organized in alphabetical order) and organization by [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] categories. The former method is today the more common, especially for general works. The fluidity of electronic media, however, allows new possibilities for multiple methods of organization of the same content. Further, electronic media offer new capabilities for search, [[Subject indexing|indexing]] and [[cross reference]]. The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from [[Horace]] on the title page of the 18th century ''Encyclopédie'' suggests the importance of the structure of an encyclopedia: "What grace may be added to commonplace matters by the power of order and connection."
* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, new methods have emerged for the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Projects such as [[Everything2]], [[Encarta]], [[h2g2]], and Wikipedia are examples of new forms of the encyclopedia as [[information retrieval]] becomes simpler. The method of production for an encyclopedia historically has been supported in both for-profit and non-profit contexts. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' mentioned above was entirely state sponsored, while the ''Britannica'' was supported as a for-profit institution. By comparison, [[Wikipedia]] is supported by volunteers contributing in a non-profit environment under the organization of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].

Some works entitled "dictionaries" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''). The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]],'' Australia's national dictionary, became an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.

There are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.&lt;ref name=DOLencyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition /&gt; There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide [[linguistics|linguistic]] information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand.&lt;ref name=bejoint /&gt;&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;&lt;ref name=DOLei /&gt;&lt;ref name=OHEL22 /&gt; Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.&lt;ref name=bejoint /&gt;

In practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, "encyclopedic" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries.&lt;ref name=DOLei /&gt;&lt;ref name=DOLencyclopedicdefinition&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Dictionary of Lexicography|last= Hartmann|first=R.

== History ==
{{Main|History of encyclopedias}}
Encyclopedias have progressed from written form in antiquity, to print in modern times. Today they can also be distributed and displayed electronically.

=== Ancient times ===
[[File:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiæ'', 1669 edition, title page]]
One of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the first century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and other aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77–79, although Pliny probably never finished editing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.&lt;ref name=naturalis&gt;Naturalis Historia&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
[[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (''The Etymologies'') or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and contemporary. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.

The most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian]] Age was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830; it was based on ''Etymologiae''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The encyclopedia of [[Suda]], a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.

The [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]] were engaged in their ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''&lt;/ref&gt; Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[Masudi|al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose ''[[The Muqadimmah|Muqadimmah]]'' contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.

The enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century AD during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4 million [[Chinese characters]] in 1000 written volumes. The 'period of the encyclopedists' spanned from the tenth to seventeenth centuries, during which the government of China employed hundreds of scholars to assemble massive encyclopedias.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277203534|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart,|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|oclc=277203534}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of which is the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]]; it was completed in 1408 and consisted of almost 23,000 folio volumes in manuscript form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In late medieval Europe, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example [[Bartholomew of England]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Radulfus Ardens]], [[Book of Sydrac|Sydrac]], [[Brunetto Latini]], Giovanni da Sangiminiano, [[Pierre Bersuire]]. Some were women, like [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[Herrad of Landsberg]]. The most successful of those publications were the ''Speculum maius (Great Mirror)'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and the ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things)'' by [[Bartholomew of England]]. The latter was translated (or adapted) into French, Provençal, Italian, English, Flemish, Anglo-Norman, Spanish, and German during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title ''Encyclopaedia'' – they were often called ''On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum)'', ''Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale)'', ''Treasure (Trésor)''.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Paulmier-Foucart, "Medieval Encyclopaedias", in André Vauchez (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', James Clarke &amp; Co, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]
Medieval encyclopedias were all hand-copied and thus available mostly to wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning; they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.&lt;ref name="dotma"&gt;See "Encyclopedia" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The ''[[De expetendis et fugiendis rebus]]'' by [[Giorgio Valla]] was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated. The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the [[seven liberal arts]].

The term encyclopaedia was coined by 16th-century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Quintilian]], and combined the two Greek words "''enkyklios paideia''" into one word, έγκυκλοπαιδεία.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29gkuklopaidei%2Fa έγκυκλοπαιδεία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus Project: "f. l. [= ''falsa lectio'', Latin for "false reading"] for ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία"&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''enkyklios paideia'' (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word Encyclopedia came from him.

The first work titled in this way was the ''Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio'' written by [[Johannes Aventinus]] in 1517.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The English physician and philosopher, Sir [[Thomas Browne]] used the word 'encyclopaedia' in 1646 in the preface [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo1.html to the reader] to define his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'', a major work of the 17th-century scientific revolution. Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured scheme of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary, and cosmological worlds. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch, and German as well as Latin it went through no fewer than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.

Financial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. During the [[Renaissance]], middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. When publishing at the same rate became financially impossible, they turned to subscriptions and serial publications. This was risky for publishers because they had to find people that would pay all upfront or make payments. When this worked, capital would rise and there would be a steady income for encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws. Some publishers would copy another publisher’s work to produce an encyclopedia faster and cheaper so consumers did not have to pay a lot and they would sell more. Encyclopedias made it to where middle-class citizens could basically have a small library in their own house. Europeans were becoming more curious about their society around them causing them to revolt against their government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loveland|first=J.|date=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241898454_Why_Encyclopedias_Got_Bigger_and_Smaller|title=Why Encyclopedias Got Bigger … and Smaller|journal=Information &amp; Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=233–254|doi=10.1353/lac.2012.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th–19th centuries ===
[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|[[Encyclopédie]], 1773]]
The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus encyclopedia|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content "A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves".

During the 19th and early 20th century, many smaller or less developed languages{{which|date=December 2014}} saw their first encyclopedias, using French, German, and English role models. While encyclopedias in larger languages, having large markets that could support a large editorial staff, churned out new 20-volume works in a few years and new editions with brief intervals, such publication plans often spanned a decade or more in smaller languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== 20th century ===
Popular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and the ''[[Children's Encyclopaedia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.

In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book]]'' and ''[[Funk and Wagnalls]]''.

[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias]]
The second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields. This trend has continued. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]].

By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', published between 1993 and 2009, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwblMaEW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===
In 2001, [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]] launched [[Wikipedia]], a multilingual, [[Open-source software|open-source]], free [[online encyclopedia]] supported by the non-profit [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Unlike commercial online encyclopedias such as [[Britannica Online]], which are written by experts, Wikipedia is collaboratively edited by volunteers. As of &lt;!-- Don't turn this into an {{As of}} template, it breaks things --&gt;{{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there are {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} articles in the English Wikipedia. There are 287 different editions of Wikipedia.

A study by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2005 found that Wikipedia's science articles were roughly comparable in accuracy to those of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', containing the same number of serious errors and about 1/3 more minor factual inaccuracies, but Wikipedia's writing tended to be confusing and less readable.&lt;ref name="GilesJ2005Internet"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giles |first=Jim |authorlink=Jim Giles (reporter) |title=Internet encyclopedias go head to head|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=438|issue=7070|pages=900–901|date=December 2005|pmid=16355180|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/438900a.html|doi=10.1038/438900a|bibcode=2005Natur.438..900G}}{{subscription required}}

Many academics, historians, teachers, and journalists reject Wikipedia as a reliable source of information, and Wikipedia is itself not a reliable source according to its own standards because of its openly editable [[wiki]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20060923/news_lz1n23wiki.html | title=Wikipedia co-founder looks to add accountability, end anarchy | work= [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] | date=September 23, 2006 | accessdate=January 16, 2017 | author=Sidener, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criticism of Wikipedia|Critics]] argue Wikipedia exhibits [[systemic bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1932-8036| volume = 5| issue = 0| pages = 21| last1 = Reagle| first1 = Joseph| last2 = Rhue| first2 = Lauren| title = Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Britannica| journal = International Journal of Communication| accessdate = 2018-11-01| date = 2011-08-08| url = https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/777}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.20164/abstract | title=Analyzing and visualizing the semantic coverage of Wikipedia and its authors | accessdate=June 2, 2015 | doi=10.1002/cplx.20164 | volume=12 | journal=Complexity | pages=30–40| arxiv=cs/0512085 | bibcode=2007Cmplx..12c..30H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia is by far the largest web-based encyclopedia, but it is not the only one in existence. There are several much smaller, usually more specialized, encyclopedias on various themes, sometimes dedicated to a specific geographic region or time period.&lt;ref&gt;Sideris A., [https://www.academia.edu/481168/The_Encyclopedic_Concept_in_the_Web_Era= "The Encyclopedic Concept in the Web Era"], in Ioannides M., Arnold D., Niccolucci F. and K.

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1958''' was the third [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The contest took place in [[Hilversum]], [[Netherlands]], following the country's win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957 Contest]], forming the convention that the winning country of the previous Eurovision Song Contest hosts the following year's contest. The event was held on Wednesday 12 March 1958 at [[Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep|AVRO Studios]]. The winner was [[France]] with the song "[[Dors, mon amour]]", performed by [[André Claveau]], written by [[Pierre Delanoë]] and composed by [[Hubert Giraud (composer)|Hubert Giraud]]. At 46 years and 76 days of age, Claveau became the oldest victor of the contest until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official Celebration. Carlton Books, 2015. ISBN 978-1-78097-638-9. Pages 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten countries participated, with [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] making its début and [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]] winning the contest for the first time. The United Kingdom was the first choice to stage the contest; however, following a failure to get an agreement from various artistic unions, the BBC withdrew their bid in the summer of 1957 and the United Kingdom did not enter for the second and last time to date, having also missed the first contest two years earlier.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=250963|title=Shining a light on the United Kingdom: 60 Years at Eurovision|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with 1956, it was the second contest (and last contest to date) that has not featured a single song in the English language. The 1958 contest continued with the policy implemented the year before where each country was limited to one song entry. This policy has been retained to date.&lt;ref name=ESC1958&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision History – Hilversum 1958|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=275#Participants|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:522701-Studiogebouw 's-Gravelandseweg 52.jpg|thumb|left|200px|AVRO Studios, Hilversum - host venue of the 1958 contest.]]
Hilversum, a municipality and a town in the province of [[North Holland]], is known as the "Media Capital" of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ESC1958"/&gt; Hilversum had become the centre of broadcasting and radio in the Netherlands in the 1920s when Dutch radio company ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Nederlandse Seintoestellen Fabriek|nl}}'' settled there, and today the media sector stands as one of the top employers in the municipality of Hilversum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From Hilvertshem to Hilversum|url=http://www.hilversum.nl/Vrije_tijd_en_toerisme/Geschiedenis/Van_Hilvertshem_tot_Hilversum|publisher=Hilversum Mediastad|accessdate=23 October 2012|language=nl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726170521/http://www.hilversum.nl/Vrije_tijd_en_toerisme/Geschiedenis/Van_Hilvertshem_tot_Hilversum|archivedate=26 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of the Dutch Radio Company in Hilversum in the 1920s, almost all other radio stations in the Netherlands followed suit with television following in the 1950s, thus making Hilversum at the end of the 1950s the best venue in the Netherlands to produce and broadcast such an international TV-transmitted event as the Eurovision Song Contest, while on the other hand TV was still a challenging advanced technology in general within Europe.

One such media network was the host of the event, [[Nederlandse Televisie Stichting]]. The venue of the contest was the studio of AVRO (''Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep'' or "General Association of Radio Broadcasting"), a building complex for the media's network among the media buildings within Hilversum, and which belonged to the Dutch public broadcasting association operating within the framework of the [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting|Nederlandse Publieke Omroep]] system.

== Format ==
The contest was held in one of the Avro studio halls. The hall contained a very small stage to function as a slightly higher stand for the singers, with the program being shot from the stage floor up. Outside of frame were the microphones' and other technical devices' wires which went through the studio's lower floor at the foot of the stage. The decorative emphasis was on the stage background, the stage front and the left side from the stage from the spectator's view where the orchestra and where the performers and host's stairway entrance were located. The rear of the stage had interchangeable backgrounds for each song to add context to each song's lyrics. The centre-front of the stage, the left area from the stage with the orchestra and stairway entrance were decorated with tulips, of which the Netherlands are known for.&lt;ref name="ESC1958" /&gt;

The juries were not in the studio as in 1956. For the 1958 event, they remained in their own countries, listening to the event. Once the songs had all been sung, juries announced their results via telephone in reverse order of presentation, as in the previous year. The Italian entry was not picked up properly in some of the other countries, which meant that after all the other songs had been presented, [[Domenico Modugno]] had to perform his song again. It was the only year that the host country finished in last place until 57 years later in 2015 and again in 2018, and the first time more than one country was placed last. The interval act was music by the [[Metropole Orkest]], under the direction of maestro Dolf van der Linden. There were two interval acts, one in the middle of the competing songs performances and one after all the rest of the competing performances were shown.

== Participating countries ==
{{Further|List of countries in the Eurovision Song Contest}}
[[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]], a country that would later be one of the most successful in the contest, debuted this year. The [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] decided to withdraw from the contest after initially planning to submit an entry.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

After the contest, the Italian entry ''"Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu"'' (subsequently known as ''"Volare"'') by Domenico Modugno went on to become a worldwide hit. During the [[1st Grammy Awards]], held on 4 May 1959 at [[Hollywood]]'s Beverly Hilton Hotel, "Nel blu dipinto di blu" received two awards, for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5EUaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xCUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5473,2630104&amp;dq=grammy&amp;hl=en|title=And Now the Grammy Awards|date=24 May 1959|author=Dornbrook, Don|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The song is the only foreign-language recording to achieve this honour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.grammy.com/news/grammy-rewind-1st-annual-grammy-awards| publisher = www.grammy.com | accessdate =22 January 2012 | title = GRAMMY Rewind: 1st Annual GRAMMY Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the only song to have competed in the Eurovision Song Contest and received a Grammy Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8g0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=volare+modugno+billboard&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7iofT9jkCOan4gTlhtyyDw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=volare%20modugno%20billboard&amp;f=false | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate =24 January 2012 | title = International Pull of Grammys Veries In Key Markets - Grammy Facts | date = 6 March 1999 | page =101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song also reached the No.1 spot in the [[Billboard (magazine)|US-American Billboard Charts]], making it one of the most successful Eurovision songs in the history of the contest. The song was also voted the second best Eurovision entry of all time at the 50th anniversary show "[[Congratulations (Eurovision)|Congratulations]]" in 2005.

==Synopsis==

===Act One===

Kate Carl, an American artist, is invited to paint the portrait of the Empress of China, Cixi. When she arrives in China she hears many rumours about the Empress. She also meets George Morrison, an English journalist on the train to Beijing. He tells her not to be intimidated by the rumours that they heard from the locals. After meeting the Empress, she was asked by the Empress when the work on the portrait can begin. Kate then tells her that she must know her before painting the portrait as art is a two way process. The empress is then suspicious of her at first, but begins her story which unfolds back fifty years ago when she was a young girl...

The empress who was known as Yehernara as a young girl, yearns to become the Emperor's escort after the then empress was pregnant. As was the custom, the Emperor would start to look for a new escort. Yehenara desperately wanted to be chosen by the Emperor to be his escort, and she was indeed chosen. After three months, she was pregnant and the emperor started choosing yet another escort. Yehernara was then taken to the Summer Palace as it was said to be the best place to give birth to a child, where she gave birth to a son, Tung Chih. This was the Emperor's first son and was very important to the dynasty. However, as was the custom, the baby was taken away from Yehenara to be brought up by the court. 

Prince Tun, the emperor's scheming brother was devastated by the birth of Tung Chih as he had plans to take the throne for himself. However, whilst still at the Summer Palace, the British attacked and destroyed the Palace. The Royal party fled to the Winter Palace. By then, the Emperor was becoming very weak and was dying. Yehenara knew that if he died without naming Tung Chih as his heir, Prince Tun would claim the throne and her son's and her life would be in grave danger. She was prevented from finding her son so that Prince Tun would be the next Emperor but she found her son and rushed to the Emperor's chamber. No one could stop her while she was carrying the Emperor's son. With his last breath, the Emperor named Tung Chih as his successor and Yehenara as Regent.

===Act Two===

A few years later, Tung Chih grew up to be a rebellious young man. He was tempted by Prince Tuan, the son of Prince Tun, to go to the brothels. Indulging in his new-found freedom he became ill with syphilis. Yehenara was helpless to do anything but wipe his feverish brow with her handkerchief as he died. Again Prince Tun saw a chance for power but was thwarted as Yehenara quickly named her nephew, Kuang Hsu, as the next Emperor. 

All this time Kate writes to Morrison about all these events. He is amazed that the Empress is being so open and notes that the stories the Empress has told Kate contradict all the rumours he has heard. After that he wonders how he is going to write a book on the Empress. Meanwhile, the story continues... 

She tells Kate that Kuang Hsu became an ambitious Emperor, determined to reform China. But this led to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and China was crippled by the internal conflict. Despite everything Yehenara has tried to do, she is surrounded by loss and failure. 

Kate meets with Morrison. She is falling in love and Morrison continues to be fascinated by everything she tells him about the Empress. The day arrives when Kate is to show the Empress the completed portrait, but the Empress was furious as a newspaper stated her to be very evil to the extent that she killed Tung Chih with a smallpox laden handkerchief. She thought that Kate has betrayed her, but Kate then finds out Morrison has betrayed her instead and the reason is to get a bigger market for opium in China as the opium war didn't do the trick.

After learning the truth, Kate was devastated as she had fallen in love in Morrison. The story then draws to a close and Kate was back in the museum and the people had started to stream in. After seeing the portrait, the people continues their thinking of Empress Cixi as a dragon lady. Even though Kate tries hard to tell her story, nobody wants to listen. The musical ends with both Yehernara and the Empress looking at the portrait and telling her that their real story has been told.

==Differences between the three runs==

Some scenes were being altered or deleted as the musical was being extended so as to attract more people to watch it. 
*In the original run (2002), Prince Tuan was shot dead but in 2003 and 2006, Prince Tun was the one being shot.
*In 2002, Prince Tun was telling the empress to allow him to lead a battle else the allied troops launch an attack after dusk. But in 2003 and 2006, it was Yehernara as there was another song to be sung by her, Why Dream of Love, which was added in 2003.
*In 2002, it did not show the stages where Kuang Hsu were growing up, but in 2003 and 2006, there were a scene where Kuang Hsu was reading a book when he was a little boy, before becoming a teenager and finally, an adult.

Lilly Zislin is the creative director of the festival &lt;ref name="Southern Living"/&gt;

Shortly before the festival's opening, the Gulf Coast was hit by the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], which impacted its attendance and general public perception of the area. The festival was attended by 13,000–15,000 people per day in 2010.&lt;ref name="tuscaloosa"&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Hughes Cobb|title=Hangout Music Fest brings thousands to Gulf Coast |date=May 18, 2012|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20120518/ent/120519768 |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendance in 2011 had to be capped at 35,000 per day, an unprecedented number for the second year of a music festival in the region, due to safety concerns.&lt;ref name="fox10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fox10tv.com/dpp/news/local_news/baldwin_county/gulf-shores-preps-for-music-festival |title=Gulf Shores preps for music festival |author=Libby Amos |date=May 13, 2011  |publisher=Fox 10 ([[WALA-TV]]) |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pressreg1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hangout Music Festival, Day 1: Beautiful weather, beautiful venue, epic performances (photos, video) |author=Lawrence F.

In 2015, [[Goldenvoice]], the company behind [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], entered into a joint venture to produce Hangout Fest.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/13/business/media/coachella-organizers-in-deal-with-hangout-music-festival.html|title=Coachella Organizers in Deal With Hangout Music Festival|author=Ben Sisario|date=January 12, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic Impact ==
The city receives over $700,000 in direct tax revenue each year &lt;ref&gt;http://local15tv.com/news/local/gulf-shores-makes-ready-for-hangout-fest-kickoff&lt;/ref&gt; plus a franchise fee of one percent of gross festival ticket revenue beginning with the 2017 festival, and increasing to three percent in 2019.&lt;ref name="al.com"&gt;http://www.al.com/news/beaches/index.ssf/2014/10/hangout_fest_assembly_permit_e.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the festival signed a 10 year agreement with the city to continue through at least 2020.&lt;ref name="al.com"/&gt;

A study conducted in 2013 by M. [[Keivan Deravi]], a professor of economics at [[Auburn University]], shows that the festival infuses over $31 million dollars into the local economy and reaches an estimated 564 million through social media, TV outlets and live-streaming video of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/live/2013/12/hangout_festival_injects_31_mi.html|title=Hangout Festival injects $31 million into local economy, study finds|work=AL.com|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 festival was projected to have a $47.5 million dollar impact &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2014/06/stage_set_in_gulf_shores_for_h.html|title=Stage set in Gulf Shores for vote on Hangout Fest 5-year permit renewal; surveys, talks reveal support|work=AL.com|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Katrina}}
The [[disaster recovery]] response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] included federal government agencies such 
as the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG), state and local-level agencies, federal and National Guard soldiers, non-governmental organizations, charities, and private individuals. Tens of thousands of volunteers and troops responded or were deployed to the disaster - most in the affected area but also throughout the U.S. at shelters set up in at least 19 states.

==Overview==
Monetary donations were way below the records set by the tsunami and 9/11 relief efforts in the U.S. In a reversal of usual positions, the U.S. received international aid and assistance from numerous countries.  The National Disaster Medical System had activated essentially all teams in the country, and pre-staged multiple Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs), Disaster Mortuary Assistance Teams (DMORTs), and Veterinary Medicine Response Teams (VMATs) in Houston and Atlanta the day prior to, and the day of, landfall. When the levees were reported to have broken, the DMATs were moved to Baton Rouge on Tuesday, August 30, and as the needs were identified, teams were moved out that afternoon to the Super Dome, and that night to the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. Three DMATs arrived around 0200 hours on Wednesday morning, Aug 31, and set up a field hospital Base of Operations in Concourse D, and began offloading rescuees from helicopters, and providing all levels of medical care. Additional DMATs were deployed there as the volume and tempo of patient arrivals increased, as the hospitals in the city began to evacuate their patients. Over 3,000 patients were cared for, and as DOD Medevac assets began arriving, patients were handed over and moved out to over a dozen cities. This operation peaked during the weekend of September 3 and 4, and was completed by mid-week. Over 20,000 evacuees were also flown out by the civilian air-fleet drafted into service, and 25 deaths occurred there, mostly elderly nursing home and hospice evacuees.

More than 10,000 [[United States National Guard|Army]] and [[Air National Guard]]smen and 7,200 active-duty troops were stationed in the [[Gulf Coast]] region to assist with hurricane relief operations with some remaining several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050903/ap_on_re_us/katrina_national_guard&lt;/ref&gt; The military relief effort, known as ''Joint Task Force Katrina'', was commanded by [[Lieutenant General]] [[Russel L. Honoré]], commander of the [[US First Army]]. At President Bush's urging, the U.S. Senate quickly approved $10.5&amp;nbsp;billion in aid for victims September 1, 2005. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] voted and approved on the measure Friday, September 2, 2005 without any debate. President Bush requested an additional $51.8&amp;nbsp;billion on September 7. Congress approved that funding package the next day.&lt;ref name = 184_Katrina1&gt;{{cite web| title = After Katrina: 184 Infantry Soldiers to the Rescue| url = http://spectrummagazine.net/pdfs/2005_10_SpectrumArchive.pdf| publisher= The Spectrum, October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2005, following the havoc caused by [[Hurricane Rita]], the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] named Brig. Gen. [[Douglas Pritt]] of the [[41st Brigade Combat Team]], Oregon Army National Guard, head of Joint Task Force Rita (formally called JTF Ponchartrain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kgw.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8CQSDL80.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018105553/http://www.kgw.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8CQSDL80.html |archivedate=October 18, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katu.com/news/story.asp?ID=79878&lt;/ref&gt; The fourteen hundred Oregonian soldiers and airmen, including the 1st Battalion of the 186th Infantry which is designated a quick response unit, were joined by engineers and military police from Louisiana, a [[Stryker]] Brigade from [[Pennsylvania]], and an engineering battalion from [[Missouri]]. It is their mission to provide relief support for all of the areas in Texas and Louisiana effected by the two storms and to remove obstructions that might otherwise hinder help to those effected.

Governments of many countries have offered help to the U.S. for disaster relief, including the governments of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] and [[Mexico]], with Canada even offering to accept Katrina evacuees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,372482-3,00.html|title="Katrina"-Folgen: Nachrichten vor 12 Uhr|date=September 1, 2005|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to asking for federal funds, President Bush has enlisted the help of former presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George H.W. Bush]] to raise additional voluntary contributions, much as they did after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and [[tsunami]].

Many had been critical of the slow response, with many people (particularly in New Orleans) left without [[drinking water|water]] and food for three to five days after the storm. Among the first to express criticism of the management of the crisis had been [[The Pentagon]], who complained only a day after Katrina hit that bureaucratic red tape from the Bush administration and the FEMA (newly reorganized under the [[Homeland Security Department]]) had caused the delay of a scheduled and authorized military [[hospital ship]] from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], among other related and prepared active military crisis response procedures.


==Timeline==
{{main article|Timeline of Hurricane Katrina}}

On Friday, August 26, the [[National Hurricane Center]] predicted for the first time that Katrina would become a [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4]] storm, and thus exceed the design limits of the New Orleans levees.

[[File:Fema827map.gif|frame|Map of Louisiana parishes eligible for Category B assistance due to September 27 authorization]]
On Saturday, August 27, President Bush declared a state of emergency under the authority of the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act|Stafford Act]] for the inland parishes of Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fema.gov/news/eventdfrns.fema?id=4786 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050919091027/http://www.fema.gov/news/eventdfrns.fema?id=4786 |archivedate=September 19, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Sunday, August 28, Katrina became a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/at200512.asp|title=Tropical Storm Lee|work=Weather Underground}}&lt;/ref&gt; And eventually evolved into a Category Five storm the very same day, with winds blowing at about 175&amp;nbsp;mph (280 kph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/22522-hurricane-katrina-facts.html|title=Hurricane Katrina: Facts, Damage &amp; Aftermath|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] decided not to declare a mandatory evacuation of the city, and instead opened up the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] to those who couldn't leave the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/katrina/evacuation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 550 National Guard troops were stationed inside the Superdome to screen evacuees for weapons
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05240/561722.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=The poor and frail flock to Superdome for safety from Katrina | first=Mary | last=Foster | date=August 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that point, it was known that the strength of the hurricane would almost certainly exceed the levees' design capacity, and therefore the possibility for major flooding was real. If the levees did fail, people throughout the city would find it very difficult to obtain food and water. If authorities had wanted to pre-position food, the Superdome would have been a logical place, as the population knew it was a designated central location. The Louisiana National Guard delivered enough food for 15,000&amp;nbsp;people for 3&amp;nbsp;days.

President Bush declared an emergency in six counties of Alabama

Monday, August 29, at 6:10 am local time, Katrina made landfall. The Louisiana National Guard had called almost 3,500 of its members to state active duty as of 7 a.m.  Army Lt. Col. Pete Schneider reported a successful evacuation from the city, crediting the Louisiana Guard's partners in neighboring states for carrying out "a coordinated effort" that incorporated lessons learned from past evacuations.  Schneider said during an interview today with Fox News the state stood ready to house evacuees at the Superdome "for as long as it takes", reporting that although the massive structure's protective lining tore in the hurricane's Category&amp;nbsp;4 winds, the roof itself appears to be intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil/news/Aug2005/20050829_2559.html|title=United States Department of Defense|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louisiana has 65 percent of its troops available for state missions; Mississippi, 60 percent; Alabama, 77 percent; and Florida, 74 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil/news/Aug2005/20050829_2564.html|title=United States Department of Defense|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Bataan (LHD-5);10080504.jpg|thumb|[[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS Bataan]] performed Louisiana relief operations.]]
[[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS Bataan]] was positioned near New Orleans prior to Katrina making landfall, and began relief operations on August 30.

The next day,  Tuesday, August 30, An estimated 7,500 National Guard troops from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi were on duty, supporting civil authorities, distributing generators, providing medical care, and setting up shelters for displaced residents. As of 8 a.m., almost 3,800 Louisiana Army and Air Guard members were on duty to remove debris, provide security and shelter, distribute water, food and ice, and offer medical and law-enforcement support. The Louisiana Guard was coordinating with Florida, Georgia and Texas to secure two UH-60 Black Hawk and five CH-47 Chinook helicopters to support their operations. In Mississippi, more than 1,900 Guard troops were providing similar support, basing their operations at Camp Shelby. In Florida, more than 700 Florida Guard members were on active duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil/news/Aug2005/20050830_2570.html|title=United States Department of Defense|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, the number of military units were on duty in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida rose to almost 8,300. Joint Task Force Katrina is setting up at Camp Shelby, Miss., as the Defense Department's focal point to support the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts.&lt;ref name="dod.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil/news/Aug2005/20050831_2576.html|title=United States Department of Defense|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The JTF Katrina Joint Force Maritime Component Command (JFMCC), under command of Rear Admiral Joseph Kilkenny, is established at Naval Air Station Pensacola to oversee (1) maritime coordination of rescue operations and delivery of relief supplies to the entire Gulf Coast, (2) operational support for FEMA and civil authorities as requested, (3) coordination of all U.S. and Coalition maritime forces afloat, (4) coordination of all Naval aircraft tasking, and (4) restoration of all naval shore facilities in the Gulf Coast area. The JTF Katrina JFMCC was later shifted to New Orleans upon arrival of USS IWO JIMA and the Deployable Joint Command and Control [[DJC2]] operations center.  USS IWO JIMA also served as the Presidential Support Platform, JTF Katrina Forward, and Joint Rescue Coordination Center while import New Orleans. Rear Admiral Kilkenny and staff later served as JTF Rita JFMCC providing support to Hurricane Rita disaster recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 050831-N-8154G-141.jpg|thumb|Superdome supplies, Aug 31]]
First report of relief supplies delivered to Superdome.

The guardsmen remain under their respective governors' control, which enables them to provide law-enforcement support in the affected regions—something the [[Posse Comitatus Act]] prohibits active-duty forces from doing within the United States.&lt;ref name="dod.mil"/&gt;

By Thursday, September 1, The National Guardsmen accompanied by buses (475 in all) and supply trucks arrived at the Superdome.  Media reports "few buses" there.{{Cn|date=January 2018}}

FEMA director [[Michael D. Brown|Brown]] said that he had only earlier that day learned that the New Orleans Convention Center had contained thousands of people without food or water for 3–4&amp;nbsp;days. He said trucks were on the way and should be there "any time". Brown did not give ordinary people the permission to drive the buses delivered by the National Guard. Which led to the issue of there be no certified bus drivers. At this point major news sources had been reporting on the situation for a few days.

By Friday, September 2, seven days after firm predictions of a Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane, a convoy of several dozen trucks and buses rolled into New Orleans carrying food, water, and other supplies. Some of these trucks were PLS manufactured &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/fact_files_site/pls/|title=The United States Army - Page not found|publisher=|access-date=September 3, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050919112622/http://www.army.mil/fact_files_site/pls/|archive-date=September 19, 2005|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Oshkosh Truck Corporation]]. These transports can carry more than 15 tons of cargo and can travel in {{convert|4|ft|m}} of water.

For comparison, when the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004]] tsunami struck the politically fractured city of [[Banda Aceh]] without warning, [[Indonesia]]n officials not only knew about the situation on the ground, but delivered 175 tons of food only 2&amp;nbsp;days after the disaster. This was due to the fact that the transports were of a worldwide effort, whereas the Katrina relief effort was handled by the US Federal government, alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/12/28/world/main663622.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Tsunami Toll Tops 55,000 | date=December 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Guard Deployment===

Since the hurricane passed through, the governors of Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Louisiana; as well as California and Texas, collectively called to duty more than 10,000 guard troops.&lt;ref name="184_Katrina1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=184_Katrina2&gt;{{cite web |title=Joint Task Force California Press Accounts of the California State Military Forces' Response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita |url=http://californiamilitaryhistory.org/CMHP20-116.pdf |work=California Military State Publication |date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kansastag.gov/AdvHTML_doc_upload/Annual%20Report%202005.pdf Kansas National Guard 2005 Annual Report, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coast Guard===
[[File:New Orleans Survivor Flyover.jpg|thumb|250px|A U.S. Coast Guard aircrewman searches for survivors in New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina.]]

The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] responded by moving as many helicopters as it could to the affected areas, calling in aircraft from as far away as [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]]. 500 [[United States Coast Guard Reserve|Coast Guard reservists]] were called to active duty, and many of the hundreds of small boats in the fleet were sent to help. Coast Guard helicopters flew around-the-clock rescue missions. The Coast Guard was one of the first federal agencies to begin rescue operations, despite the fact that almost half the local Coast Guard personnel lost their own homes in the hurricane. They rescued or evacuated more than 33,500&amp;nbsp;people, six times as many as they saved in all of 2004. According to an article in [[Time (magazine)|Time]], in the famously decimated [[St. Bernard Parish]], east of New Orleans, Sheriff Jack Stephens says the Coast Guard was the only federal agency to provide any significant assistance for a full week after the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The amphibious assault ships carried [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] and [[Sikorsky SH-60 Sea Hawk|SH-60 Sea Hawk]] [[helicopter]]s which were already being used in search and rescue operations. ''Harry S. Truman'' was used as the command center for Naval operations in the area.
The Navy also arranged to send eight civilian 14-person [[Fly-boat|swift boat]] rescue teams to the disaster zone using [[C-5 Galaxy]] cargo planes.

[[Lieutenant General|Lt. Gen.]] [[Russel L. Honoré]] of the [[United States Army|Army]] was appointed to run a temporary special command, known as Joint Task Force (JTF) Katrina, to coordinate all military responses to the effort, which was based at [[Camp Shelby]] in [[Mississippi]].

The [[United States Air Force]] responded by sending [[search and rescue]], [[medical evacuation|aeromedical evacuation]], relief supplies as well as medical care to the affected areas. Keesler AFB was evacuated prior to impact, however out of the students training on the base around 400 volunteered to stay back and clean up the base. Thanks to their efforts the base was operational 6 months earlier than expected. The Air Force has rescued over 4,000&amp;nbsp;people to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123011679 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717071207/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123011679 |title=Air Force rescues top 4,000 mark |archivedate=July 17, 2012 |work=archive.is |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force has also evacuated more than 25,000&amp;nbsp;people in need of medical care from [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]].

Nine million packaged meals have been airlifted into the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story_print.asp?storyID=123011608 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724075723/http://www.af.mil/news/story_print.asp?storyID=123011608 |title=More active, Guard troops join Katrina response |archivedate=July 24, 2012 |work=archive.is |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Air National Guard was also a major presence at The SuperDome (which evacuated more than 25,000 survivors from the area). The 136th Security Forces Squadron, answered the call, flying into the local Naval Airstaion, from Ft. Worth (Carswell JRB) Texas, via C130 Troop Transport. This unit was already in position, within 48 hours after being placed on alert.

==Government non-military==

===Federal===
Some [[disaster recovery]] response to Katrina began before the storm, with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a [[mortuary]] team with refrigerated trucks. However, the federal government's overall lack of response has been widely criticized since the events occurred.

President George W. Bush asked Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]] of the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated Michael Brown, head of the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region.

FEMA deployed all 28 of its [[FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force|Urban Search &amp; Rescue Task Forces]] with 11 going to Mississippi and 7 to Louisiana.  The remaining 10 US&amp;R Task Forces were deployed to Texas staging areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=FEMA | date=September 3, 2005 | title=National Urban Search And Rescue Teams Deployed | url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=18582 | accessdate=August 28, 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926210829/http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=18582 | archivedate=September 26, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA also deployed 29 [[Disaster Medical Assistance Team]]s (DMAT); 5 [[Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team]]s (DMORT); 2 [[Veterinary Medical Assistance Team]]s (VMAT); and 1 [[FEMA Mental Health Team|Mental Health Team]] to Louisiana and 10 DMATs, 5 DMORTS, 2 VMATS, and 1 Mental Health Team to Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=FEMA | date=September 4, 2005 | title=Hurricane Katrina Response And Recovery Update | url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=18602 | accessdate=August 29, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926022707/http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=18602 | archive-date=September 26, 2006 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FEMA also partnered with the Department of Transportation to send 1700 trucks of water, ice, and ready-to-eat meals. The [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] was also sending 390 trucks carrying water, tarpaulins, and even mobile homes and forklifts. The [[United States Public Health Service]] was activated and sent dozens of officers to supervise medical response. Though the hurricane closed several airports for some time to come, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] rushed to reopen one runway at [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]] so that relief flights could begin.

On Friday, September 2, 2005, Reuters published an article stating that five Silver Fox UAVs (the same UAVs being used in Iraq and Afghanistan for intelligence gathering) equipped with thermal imaging technology is going to be used in the search and rescue missions in New Orleans. Pennsylvanian Republican Representative Curt Weldon stated that he was able to bypass government bureaucracy and obtain the UAVs from an unnamed private company. Weldon stated that the UAVs were being shipped to Baton Rouge and requested deployment of US military personnel who is capable of operating the UAVs and that they can be in operation within hours of arrival.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050902/tc_nm/weather_katrina_drones_dc&amp;printer=1&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lives Saved—11,500
* Citizens Evacuated—25,000
* Water distributed by FEMA—6.7&amp;nbsp;million liters

Several [[Carnival Cruise Lines|Carnival Cruise]] ships have been chartered by the American government to provide housing for those who require it. The ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' reported on September 4, 2005 that the authorities had requested that aid workers not disclose the final destination of those making the transit because a few had caused a ruckus upon finding that they were heading to a location that they held in disfavor.

===State and local===
Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco's New Orleans Hurricane Relief Foundation was created on August 30, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;ref&lt;/ref&gt;
Local governments across the U.S. sent aid in the form of ambulances, search teams and disaster supplies. Shelters to house those displaced were established as far away as [[Utah]].	 
The Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism contacted travelers having reservations at state parks to see if the travelers would voluntarily give up their reservations to persons fleeing Katrina, primarily in the southern part of the state where refugees had already taken shelter (at [[Lake Chicot State Park]], just across the Louisiana state line, a 26-member family from New Orleans, including a grandmother on oxygen, occupied seven of the park's cabins). In any event, refugees at state parks would not be evicted for prior reservations, and those with reservations but no room would either get space at another state park or a gift certificate.

Arkansas Visitors Information Centers in Texarkana, El Dorado, Helena, and Lake Village directed refugees to shelters and hotels/motels with available space.

Governor [[Mike Huckabee]] issued a proclamation releasing $75,000 of state funds to assist shelters in 14 southern and delta counties in Arkansas.  At least 850 members of the Arkansas National Guard have been activated and sent to Louisiana and Mississippi. Governor Huckabee also announced that the state Departments of Health and Human Services and Emergency Management as well as the Arkansas Pharmacists Association will provide free emergency prescriptions and access to dialysis machines.

Schools and colleges across the country enrolled students displaced by the storm despite uncertainty over where funding would come from. U.S. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said on September 12 that 372,000 elementary and high school students had been displaced. Over 715 schools were closed with at least 36 heavy damaged or completely destroyed. About 100,000 college students were also displaced and at least 15 colleges were still closed at that time. Primary and secondary schools are required to educate any "homeless" students in their district and 25 states reported having taken in Katrina victims. FEMA declared that opening temporary schools and hiring mental health counselors would be reimbursable but the hiring of extra teachers and buying of books would not be.

1000 firefighters volunteered to be sent to the affected region, with their home towns picking up the tab to provide cover in their absence. FEMA had them handing out leaflets, while on September 5 the first assignment for a 50-strong team from Atlanta was "to stand beside President Bush as he tours devastated areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3004197|title=Utah Local News|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=September 9, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910042150/http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3004197|archive-date=September 10, 2005|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AmeriCorps===
[[AmeriCorps]] sent several crews to Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana in response to Hurricane Katrina and [[Hurricane Rita]]. The crews originated from two main organizations, the [[National Civilian Community Corps]] (NCCC) and the Washington Conservation Corps (WCC), as well as from smaller Americorps organizations such as Americorps St. Louis' Emergency Response Team (ERT). The crews performed a number of relief tasks for hurricane survivors, including support on the FEMA/[[Carnival Cruise Lines]] shelter ship, tarping damaged roofs, and debris removal. As of the beginning of 2006, AmeriCorps teams have been involved in the rebuilding efforts in Louisiana and Mississippi. As of May 2006, AmeriCorps reported that it would continue to send relief to affected areas.

==Non-governmental organizations==
[[File:Hurricane Katrina Supplies-Panorama.jpg|thumb|Many local charities are pitching in to help send supplies to victims of hurricane Katrina.]]
&lt;!-- This section is for organizations actually working in the hurricane zone. Fund-raising links should be added to External links. --&gt;

===American Red Cross===
[[File:Katrina-14501.jpg|thumb|American Red Cross personnel attending refugees in the [[Reliant Astrodome]].]]
The [[American Red Cross]] mobilized the largest relief effort in its 124-year history to aid the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Local Chapters across the nation mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers for immediate deployment to the disaster region.

In the first two weeks after the storm, the Red Cross had brought 74,000 volunteers who provided shelter to 160,000 evacuees and more than 7.5&amp;nbsp;million hot meals. More than 250 Emergency Response Vehicles (ERVs) were sent to provide food and water to victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.redcross.org/article/0,1072,0_312_4495,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 2, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907063343/http://www.redcross.org/article/0,1072,0_312_4495,00.html |archive-date=September 7, 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 11, 75,000 evacuees remained in 445 shelters in 19 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/news/ds/hurricanes/katrina_facts.html|title=Types of Disasters - Types of Emergencies|author=|work=American Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that date, the Red Cross was calling for 40,000 new volunteers to relieve those who initially responded. Disaster response classes were training tens of thousands across the country.

The [[American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund]] collected donations from the public for the relief effort. By September 28, they had raised about one billion dollars in cash and pledges, surpassing the rate of donation for the Asian tsunami and September 11 attacks. This is ten times more money than the next largest amount collected by a charity, the Salvation Army. The Red Cross estimated that its response would cost some $2&amp;nbsp;billion of which $100&amp;nbsp;million was expected to be reimbursed by FEMA, while the rest would need to come from donations. [[Yahoo!]], [[Google]] and later [[Amazon.com]] set up donation pages for the Red Cross.

As the Red Cross had raised the vast majority of donations and its response is limited to disaster aid and not to recovery, some charities suggested that the Red Cross share money with groups engaged in rebuilding efforts.

===Amateur radio operators===

The president of the [[ARRL|American Radio Relay League]], Jim Haynie, sent a message to all [[amateur radio]] operators noting that the situation in New Orleans and other affected areas is "simply too dangerous and no one is being allowed in".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2005/09/01/2/?nc=1&lt;/ref&gt;  Many media outlets say communications infrastructure is overloaded and destroyed in many places in the disaster area.  During the storm, amateur operators gave weather reports to the [[National Hurricane Center]] in Florida using HF radio.  Operators are also handling Health &amp; Welfare messages for organizations such as the [[Salvation Army]] and [[Red Cross]].  Many amateur radio organizations are staging outside the affected area getting ready to deploy into the city and suburbs.

On September 1, the [[American Red Cross]] asked the ARRL to help provide radio and amateur support for its 35 kitchens and 250 shelters.  By September 3, the ARRL had set up amateur radio operations at the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Headquarters in Montgomery Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===America's Second Harvest===

America's Second Harvest (now known as [[Feeding America]]) responded to the efforts by collecting over 33 million pounds of food specifically for Katrina relief. Since the food bank in New Orleans was non-operational for a short period of time after the hurricane hit, a temporary warehouse was set up in [[Baker, Louisiana]]. This operation distributed food to people who were in need before the hurricane as well as people now displaced but Katrina's wreckage.

Second Harvesters Food Bank of Greater New Orleans which is a part of America's Second Harvest was operation within a few days and coordinating efforts with the staff in Baker, LA.

===Camp Hope===
[[Camp Hope]] is a volunteer camp located in [[Violet, Louisiana|Violet, LA]], which has housed volunteers in the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort of St. Bernard Parish since June 1, 2006. The economic recovery of the Parish is dependent on the removal of debris to facilitate the return of both residents and businesses.

The mission of Camp Hope is to house and facilitate volunteer relief efforts in St Bernard Parish and around the New Orlean's area. Those efforts include managing and participating in the removal of health and safety hazards from properties throughout St Bernard parish with the assistance of the local, state, federal, volunteer and non-governmental agencies.

As of August 16, 2006, volunteers in St. Bernard had completed 1,668 homes in the Parish.

===Family information websites===
Several websites were set up to help family members find out information about each other in the chaos. Some include the Red Cross, The Weather Channel, local newspapers, Craigslist, and others. Yahoo set up 100 Internet-linked computers at the Astrodome and developed a meta-search of evacuee registration websites. On September 11, despite having reunited several families, the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] had a list of 1,600 children listed as missing by their parents, or who were seeking their families.

Problems were that many survivors had no internet access, let alone electrical power, let alone computers or even computer literacy. There were also many sites so a searcher would have to go through several and sort through the many different search protocols and syntax. Another problem in theory is fraud, and another problem is that many sites only included last and first names which in a mass of several hundred thousand displaced persons obviously included many duplicates.{{or|date=December 2012}}

=== Other organizations ===
Many charities immediately began fund-raising efforts on behalf of Katrina victims and survivors.
[[File:FEMA - 15102 - Photograph by Win Henderson taken on 08-31-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|thumb|A woman evacuee is given food by a Salvation Army volunteer]]

[[The Salvation Army]] responded to the immediate needs of the survivors. Eventually 5.6 million meals were served, 3.3 million people were assisted, and nearly $400 million donated. The Army’s immediate response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] included the mobilization of more than 178 canteen feeding units and 11 field kitchens which together have served more than 5.7 million hot meals, 8.3 million sandwiches, snacks &amp; drinks. Its [[SATERN]] ([[Salvation Army Team Emergency Radio Network]]) network of amateur ham-radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000 survivors. And, [[The Salvation Army]] pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals.

The New York Regional Association of Grantmakers (now Philanthropy New York) published a Donors' Guide for individuals and organizations looking for philanthropic options for Gulf Coast recovery &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In addition to the Red Cross, numerous charity and relief organizations stepped up their activities to aid hurricane victims.  The [[United Methodist Church]]  provided volunteers to help muck out homes and rebuild affected areas.  According to the church's volunteer service arm, [[UMVIM]], over thirty thousand United Methodist volunteers have worked in the affected areas since Katrina. [[Southern Baptist Disaster Relief]] mobilized hundreds of units from across the US. Southern Baptist Disaster relief manned massive feeding units, shower and laundry facilities, assessment teams, Mud-Out, and chainsaw and debris removal teams across the affected area. The [[Catholic Charities]] activated a disaster response plan. The plan targeted areas outside of the disaster that are providing refugee relief and agencies located in or nearby are mobilizing to assist the needy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operation Blessing]] began organizing to ship food and relief supplies into the affected areas, as it has done in disaster zones around the world before. [[America's Second Harvest]], a [[food bank]] that operates in many communities, began coordinating efforts to ship food donations to coastal areas. [[Habitat for Humanity]] announced plans to check on all Habitat-built homes and their residents, and then turn to providing assistance to Habitat families, partners, and volunteers in need of help. The [[American Public School Endowments]] began collecting funds to rebuild schools in the affected area, and to aid schools suffering from an onslaught of refugees.  [[Mercy Corps]] is accepting donations and sending a team of emergency relief experts to the Gulf region to offer financial and technical assistance for immediate and longer-term relief and recovery efforts. [[Conservative Mennonites]] sent many volunteer laborers to help with cleaning and rebuilding of homes affected.

Initially, the United States had been reluctant to accept donations and aid from foreign countries.  However, this policy was reversed, and as the reports of damage grew more grim, the United States accepted the foreign aid. Countries and organizations that offered to send aid mentioned by the State Department included [[Afghanistan]], [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Bahrain]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Dominica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], the [[European Union]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], [[Guyana]], [[Honduras]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Mexico]], [[NATO]], [[Nepal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand response to Hurricane Katrina|New Zealand]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Nigeria]], [[Norway]], [[Organization of American States]], [[Oman]], [[OPEC]], [[Pakistan]], [[Paraguay]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Qatar]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], [[UAE]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[United Nations]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. Other countries not on this list have also offered aid, but the State Department mentioned that they had not been asked. Later, the US State Department said all offers were being examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Notable offers from international organizations include the [[United Nations]], which was ready to send supply high-energy biscuits, generators, planes, tents along with experienced staff members; and Paris-based [[International Energy Agency]] agreeing to make 60&amp;nbsp;million barrels oil available to help the United States weather the economic problems caused by Hurricane Katrina.

==Cultural and sporting responses==
The [[National Hockey League]], along with the [[National Hockey League Players Association]], have donated [[US dollar|$]]1&amp;nbsp;million. An [[auction]] of game worn [[wikt:jersey|jersey]]s, from the [[2005–06 NHL season]] opening night, will also be held.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhl.com/news/2005/09/234098.html{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Football League]] donated $1&amp;nbsp;million, as did the [[New York Yankees]] baseball organization.  The [[New York Jets]] and [[New York Giants]] also allowed the [[2005 LSU Tigers football team]] play their home games at [[Giants Stadium]] while both the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] and the [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center]] were being used as a refuge for victims of the hurricane, and [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)]] was being used by the [[New Orleans Saints]] for their home games. [[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]], an hour-long, music and celebrity driven broadcast was aired on September 2, 2005 by [[NBC]].
[[Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast]], an hour long [[simulcast]] [[benefit concert]] aired on September 9, 2005 worldwide. A four and a half-hour long benefit concert titled [[ReAct Now: Music &amp; Relief]] was broadcast by [[MTV]], [[VH1]] and [[Country Music Television|CMT]] on September 10, 2005. [[Céline Dion]], the Canadian singer, also donated $1&amp;nbsp;million.

==Scam artist responses==
In the wake of a large outpouring of support, many [[Confidence trick|scam artists]] took advantage of the public's willingness to provide money and other resources to victims of the hurricane. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] reported &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival''' is the world's largest [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] film and media arts festival,&lt;ref name="Wente2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesse Wente on the cultural importance of Indigenous film festivals|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2696575529|website=CBC|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en-CA|date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; held annually in [[Toronto]] in the month of October. The festival focuses on the film, video, radio, and new media work of Indigenous, [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal]] and [[First Peoples]] from around the world. The festival includes screenings, parties, panel discussions, and cultural events.

As an organization, imagineNATIVE supports the creation of new works through their commissioning program, and national outreach to and for Indigenous communities through various off-site programs throughout the year. ImagineNative also commissions industry reports on the status of Indigenous film production in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=imagineNATIVE Study on Indigenous Film|url=http://www.isuma.tv/imaginenative/imaginenative-study-indigenous-film|website=IsumaTV|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was founded in 1998 by Cynthia Lickers-Sage in her capacity as the Aboriginal outreach coordinator for [[Vtape]] as a venue for the exhibition of short film and video work by Aboriginal artists. While initially operated through Vtape, the festival subsequently became an independent organization.&lt;ref name="Quanz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quanz|first1=Katherine|editor1-last=Druick|editor1-first=Zoë|editor2-last=Cammaer|editor2-first=Gerda|title=Cinephemera : archives, ephemeral cinema, and new screen histories in canada.|date=2014|publisher=Mcgill-Queens Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9780773544475|chapter=Preserving Aboriginal Films and Videos: The Archival Practices of Vtape and ISUMATV}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early programmer for the festival was [[Ojibwe|Ojibway]] critic and journalist Jesse Wente,&lt;ref name="Wente 2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indigenous filmmakers need to control storytelling, says Jesse Wente|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/imaginenative-moving-beyond-the-hollywood-indian-1.3809142/indigenous-filmmakers-need-to-control-storytelling-says-jesse-wente-1.3813879|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=[[CBC Radio]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who continued in his role as programmer through 2010.&lt;ref name="Wente bio 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=CBC.ca {{!}} Metro Morning {{!}} About Jesse Wente|url=http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/columnists/pop/bio/2010/01/24/about-jesse-wente/|website=www.cbc.ca|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Jason Ryle]] took on the role of the festival's executive director.&lt;ref name="TFS 2014" /&gt;

== Awards ==
The 2001 winner for Best Film went to ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]'' by [[Inuit]] filmmaker [[Zacharias Kunuk]].&lt;ref name="CEAtanarjuat"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McIntosh|first1=Andrew|title=Atanarjuat (The Fast Runner)|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/atanarjuat-the-fast-runner/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film was the first feature dramatic film in an Indigenous language by an Inuit director.&lt;ref name="NMAIKunuk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atanarjuat/The Fast Runner {{!}} National Museum of the American Indian|url=http://filmcatalog.nmai.si.edu/title/1709/|website=filmcatalog.nmai.si.edu|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 festival focused on [[Inuit]] and northern films, with a special focus on films from [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name="ZeheriCBC2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zerehi|first1=Sima Sahar|title=Greenland films in the spotlight this year at imagineNATIVE festival|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/greenland-films-imaginenative-festival-1.3810247|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=[[CBC News]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Award winners for that year included ''Bonfire'', a film by Russian Sakha director [[Dmitry Davydov (filmmaker)|Dmitry Davydov]], for Best Dramatic Feature; [[Maliglutit (Searchers)|''Maliglutit'']] by Inuit director Zacharias Kunuk for Best Indigenous Language Production; and ''[[Angry Inuk]]'', directed by [[Alethea Arnaquq-Baril]], which won Best Documentary Feature.&lt;ref name="CBC2016winners"&gt;{{cite news|last1=CBC News|author1-link=CBC News|title=Inuit, Arctic films big winners at 2016 imagineNATIVE festival|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/inuit-arctic-films-big-winners-at-imaginenative-1.3819179|accessdate=5 March 2017|work=[[CBC News]]|publisher=CBC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commissions ==

===NFB/imagineNATIVE Interactive Partnership===
NFB/imagineNATIVE Interactive Partnership was started in 2012 for the commissioning and production of new digital and interactive works by established Indigenous artists. Works produced through this program include ''De Nort'' (2012) by the ITWE Collective, ''Similkameen Crossroads'' (2013) by [[Tyler Hagan]], ''Ice Fishing'' (2014) by [[Jordan Bennett (artist)|Jordan Bennett]] and ''Red Card'' (2016) by [[Cara Mumford]].

===Stolen Sisters Digital Initiative===

The Stolen Sisters Digital Initiative (SSDI) was a 2012 imagineNATIVE artistic commission and national exhibition of four, one-minute digital works by award-winning Canadian Indigenous filmmakers. The commissioned works were created to reflect and respond to the [[Stolen Sisters]], a term adopted by the Aboriginal community and larger social justice organizations of the struggle to find answers for the hundreds of unsolved cases of [[Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women|missing and murdered Indigenous women]] across Canada. The four commissioned works were:
* ''Like it Was Yesterday'' by Calgary-based artists [[Jesse Gouchey]] and [[Xstine Cook]] 
* ''Snare'' by Vancouver-based [[Anishinaabe]] artist [[Lisa Jackson (filmmaker)|Lisa Jackson]]
* ''When it Rains'' by the [[Métis]]/[[Chippewa Cree]] filmmaker Cara Mumford 
* ''Your Courage Will Not Go Unnoticed'' by the [[Gitxsan]]/[[Lax Gibu]] artist and journalist [[Angela Sterritt]]

This was the first time the Festival partnered to present a simultaneous national exhibition. Working with [[Amnesty International]] Canada and Pattison Onestop, a national media company, the short videos were exhibited throughout Toronto’s subway system, on display screens in 33 shopping centres across Canada, at the [[Calgary International Airport]], and at the [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]] leading up to and during the 2012 imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival.&lt;ref name="ArtToronto2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=STOLEN SISTERS {{!}} ARTORONTO|url=http://www.artoronto.ca/?p=15445|website=www.artoronto.ca|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NationTalk"&gt;{{cite web|title=imagineNATIVE’s Stolen Sisters Digital Initiative|url=http://nationtalk.ca/story/imaginenatives-stolen-sisters-digital-initiative|website=NationTalk|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zwei Indianer Aus Winnipeg===
In 2009, the festival commissioned ''Zwei Indianer Aus Winnipeg'', a short film by [[Saulteaux]]  filmmaker [[Darryl Nepinak]]. The film subsequently screened at the 2009 [[Berlinale]].&lt;ref name="NMAINepinak"&gt;{{cite web|title=Darryl Nepinak {{!}} National Museum of the American Indian|url=http://filmcatalog.nmai.si.edu/person/3086/|website=filmcatalog.nmai.si.edu|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFGHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Winnipeg Film Group : History|url=https://www.winnipegfilmgroup.com/about/history/|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embargo Collective===
In March 2008, imagineNATIVE formed the Embargo Collective, an international group of seven Indigenous artists for the purposes of collaborating and challenging one another to create seven new films. Collective members included [[Helen Haig-Brown]], [[Heiltsuk]]/Mohawk filmmaker and actress [[Zoe Leigh Hopkins]] and Anishnaabe filmmaker [[Lisa Jackson (filmmaker)|Lisa Jackson]]. The resulting films were subsequently screened at the 2010 Berlinale. Following this, Brown's ''The Cave'' was awarded a top-ten recognition at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and was screened at the 2011 [[Sundance Festival]], while Jackson's ''Savage'' won a 2011 Genie Award for best live action short drama.&lt;ref name="NSI 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special short film program spotlighting Canadian Aboriginal women filmmakers to close imagineNATIVE 2014 {{!}} National Screen Institute - Canada (NSI)|url=http://www.nsi-canada.ca/2014/10/special-short-film-program-spotlighting-canadian-aboriginal-women-filmmakers-to-close-imaginenative-2014/#|website=National Screen Institute - Canada (NSI)|accessdate=5 March 2017|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Embargo Collective II focused on women filmmakers. It was curated by [[Danis Goulet]], and included Hopkins, [[Blackfoot]]/[[Sami people|Sami]] filmmaker [[Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers]], Alethea Arnaquq-Baril and filmmaker [[Caroline Monnet]]. Among the films produced that year was ''Roberta''.&lt;ref name="TFS 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Das|first1=Prerana|title=Evolution in Indigenous filmmaking {{!}} Toronto Film Scene|url=http://thetfs.ca/article/evolution-indigenous-filmmaking/|website=thetfs.ca|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Programs ==

===imagineNATIVE Film + Video Tour===
The imagineNATIVE Film + Video Tour provides regional and remote communities access to Indigenous-made film and video from Canada and abroad. In addition to bringing a Festival-favourite feature presentation to these communities, the Tour encourages youth to explore the creation of film and video through a Youth-focused film and video program, discussion and hands-on video-making workshops. The video-making workshops assist and lead youth to create and edit short videos using readily-available technology such as cellphones and webcams.  The videos are featured on imagineNATIVE’s website and open to public voting, sending the winner to Toronto for the imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival.

===indigiFLIX Community Screening Series===
The indigiFLIX Community Screening Series, presented by imagineNATIVE, is hosted in cultural and community centres to reach a broader [[First Nations]], [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], [[Inuit]] and non-Native audience beyond the annual Festival in Toronto. Films are selected from past imagineNATIVE Festivals in an effort to keep these important films alive and accessible to the Indigenous community. imagineNATIVE is committed to supporting artists through payment of industry-standard artist fees for all works presented.

===Canadian Indigenous Film Producer Mini-Lab===
The Canadian Indigenous Film Producer Mini-Lab was started as a program to develop skills and talent for emerging Indigenous producers. Among its alumni are Cara Mumford, [[Michelle Latimer]] and [[Jeremy Torrie]].&lt;ref name="OnScreenMan"&gt;{{cite web|title=OSM Member Jeremy Torrie Selected for Canadian Indigenous Film Producer Mini-Lab {{!}} On Screen Manitoba|url=http://onscreenmanitoba.com/osm-member-jeremy-torrie-selected-for-canadian-indigenous-film-producer-mini-lab/|website=onscreenmanitoba.com|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminum]] tubes purchased by the nation of [[Iraq]] were intercepted in [[Jordan]] in 2001.  In September 2002 they were publicly cited by the [[White House]] as evidence that Iraq was actively pursuing an [[atomic weapon]].  Prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], many questioned the validity of the claim.  After the invasion, the [[Iraq Survey Group]] determined that the best explanation for the tubes' use was to produce conventional 81-mm rockets; no evidence was found of a program to design or develop an 81-mm aluminum rotor [[uranium centrifuge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/DuelferRpt/Volume_2.pdf#page=159|title=Comprehensive Revised Report with Addendums on Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (Duelfer Report), Volume 2, Nuclear section|pages=21–30|author=[[Iraq Survey Group]]|date=30 September 2004|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=3 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The order and shipment==
In 2000, Iraq ordered, via a company in [[Jordan]], 60,000 high-strength [[aluminum]] tubes manufactured from [[7075 aluminum|7075-T6 aluminum]] with an outer diameter of 81&amp;nbsp;mm, and an inner diameter of 74.4&amp;nbsp;mm, a wall thickness of 3.3&amp;nbsp;mm and a length of 900&amp;nbsp;mm, to be manufactured in China. These tubes were classified as controlled items by the [[United Nations]] and Iraq was not permitted to import them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iraq/nuke-prewar_intel_2003.htm Pre-War Intelligence on Iraq's Nuclear Program (2003)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The order was placed with an Australian company, International Aluminum Supply (IAS), which was associated with Kam Kiu Propriety Limited, a subsidiary of the Chinese company that would do the manufacturing. Concerned that the tubes might be related to Iraqi efforts to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program, Garry Cordukes, the director of the company, contacted the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS). In turn, ASIS notified US intelligence services.

ASIS also asked Cordukes to obtain a sample of the tubes for examination.  He obtained one and handed it over to the ASIS.

On May 23, 2001, a container load of about 3,000 aluminum tubes left the factory in southern China. It traveled on a barge to Hong Kong.  The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was watching its progress, as was the ASIS.  In July 2001, the tubes were seized in [[Jordan]] by the Jordanian secret police and the CIA, according to a CIA presentation later that year.&lt;ref name="ABC-2003"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/transcripts/s976015.htm "Spinning the Tubes"], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq also attempted to acquire aluminum tubes of the same type in late 2002 and early 2003, with negotiations still going on with a Syrian company when the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]] began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/report/2004/isg-final-report/isg-final-report_vol2_nuclear-05.htm Iraq Survey Group Final Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claims made to other governments==
In late 2001, a small group of agents from the CIA went to Canada, Britain and Australia, to present information to the intelligence agencies and politicians of those countries.  The CIA agents said the tubes were destined to become the rotors in a [[gas centrifuge]] program to create [[enriched uranium]] for nuclear weapons. The CIA agents acknowledged there was another possible use for the tubes - as artillery rocket casings, but argued that the specifications sought by Iraq were far greater than they would need for rockets.&lt;ref name="ABC-2003"/&gt;

==September 2002 claims==
On September 8, 2002, Michael R. Gordon and [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] published a story in the [[New York Times]] titled "U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest for A-Bomb Parts":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the last 14 months, Iraq has sought to buy thousands of specially designed aluminum tubes, which American officials believe were intended as components of centrifuges to enrich uranium. American officials said several efforts to arrange the shipment of the aluminum tubes were blocked or intercepted but declined to say, citing the sensitivity of the intelligence, where they came from or how they were stopped. The diameter, thickness and other technical specifications of the aluminum tubes had persuaded American intelligence experts that they were meant for Iraq's nuclear program, officials said, and that the latest attempt to ship the material had taken place in recent months. The attempted purchases are not the only signs of a renewed Iraqi interest in acquiring nuclear arms. President Hussein has met repeatedly in recent months with Iraq's top nuclear scientists and, according to American intelligence, praised their efforts as part of his campaign against the West.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''...'''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bush administration officials say the quest for thousands of high-strength aluminum tubes is one of several signs that Mr. Hussein is seeking to revamp and accelerate Iraq's nuclear weapons program. Officials say the aluminum tubes were intended as casing for rotors in centrifuges, which are one means of producing highly enriched uranium. The Washington Times reported in July that Iraq sought to acquire stainless steel for centrifuges on one occasion. Officials say that the material sought was special aluminum tubes and that Iraq sought to acquire it over 14 months.

==Internal U.S. Intelligence evaluations==

===Central Intelligence Agency===
In July 2002, in the run up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the CIA reported to Congress that "Iraq's efforts to procure tens of thousands of proscribed high-strength aluminum tubes are of significant concern.  All intelligence experts agree that Iraq is seeking nuclear weapons and that these tubes could be used in a centrifuge enrichment program.  Most intelligence specialists assess this to be the intended use, but some believe that these tubes are probably intended for conventional weapons programs."&lt;ref name=CIAreport2&gt;[https://www.odci.gov/cia/reports/721_reports/jan_jun2002.html Jun 2002 ODCI (CIA) Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930043217/https://www.odci.gov/cia/reports/721_reports/jan_jun2002.html |date=2006-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003, the language in the CIA's report to Congress was similar, but provided a bit more detail about conventional weapons: "Iraq's efforts to procure tens of thousands of proscribed high-strength aluminum tubes were of significant concern.  All intelligence experts agreed that Iraq remained intent on acquiring nuclear weapons and that these tubes, if modified, could be used in a centrifuge enrichment program.  Most intelligence specialists assessed this to be the intended use, but some believed that these tubes were probably intended for use as casings for tactical rockets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/cia_july_dec2002.htm#4 Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions, 1 July Through 31 December 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2003, following the March invasion of Iraq, the CIA said in a report to Congress that "We are not yet at the point where we can draw comprehensive or final conclusions about the extent of Iraq's prewar WMD program."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.odci.gov/cia/reports/721_reports/jan_jun2003.htm#iraq&lt;/ref&gt;  It repeated this language in its report in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.odci.gov/cia/reports/721_reports/july_dec2003.htm#iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, David Corn of ''The Nation'' reported that [[Valerie Plame]] was involved in CIA work to determine the use of aluminum tubes purchased by Iraq.  According to Corn, one of her actions was a trip to Jordan "to work with Jordanian intelligence officials who had intercepted a shipment of aluminum tubes heading to Iraq that CIA analysts were claiming--wrongly--were for a nuclear weapons program. (The analysts rolled over the government's top nuclear experts, who had concluded the tubes were not destined for a nuclear program.)".&lt;ref name=corn&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060918/corn | title=What Valerie Plame Really Did at the CIA | author=David Corn | publisher=The Nation (web only) | date=September 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Department of Energy===
On September 20, 2002, The [[United Press International]] reported that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... doubts about the quality of some of the evidence that the United States is using to make its case that Iraq is trying to build a nuclear bomb emerged Thursday. While National Security Adviser Condi Rice stated on September 8 that imported aluminum tubes 'are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs' a growing number of experts say that the administration has not presented convincing evidence that the tubes were intended for use in uranium enrichment rather than for artillery rocket tubes or other uses. Former U.N. weapons inspector [[David Albright]] said he found significant disagreement among scientists within the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and other agencies about the certainty of the evidence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 2006, Representative [[Heather Wilson]], a member of the House Intelligence Committee, disclosed that she had learned, in 2002, that the Department of Energy disputed whether those tubes could be used in the centrifuges needed to enrich uranium for bomb fuel. Wilson said that she had questioned CIA officials about the aluminum tubes at classified briefings for members of Congress, prior to the October 11, 2002, vote in Congress to authorize force against Iraq.  Wilson told ''The Albuquerque Tribune'' that she did not publicly disclose the Energy Department's doubts about the aluminum tubes before Congress voted because the information was classified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abqtrib.com/news/2006/sep/11/wilson-i-probed-iraq-proof/ "Wilson: I questioned Iraq evidence: Congresswoman voted for war despite disputes of CIA's proof"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205194352/http://abqtrib.com/news/2006/sep/11/wilson-i-probed-iraq-proof/ |date=2012-02-05 }},  ''Albuquerque Tribune'', September 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate ===
In early October 2002, President Bush was given a one-page summary report of a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] on the issue of whether Saddam's procurement of high-strength aluminum tubes was for the purpose of developing a nuclear weapon (the NIE was declassified on July 18, 2003, and presented at a White House background briefing on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/cia/product/iraq-wmd.html Key Judgments: Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). The report stated that the Department of Energy and the State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] believed that the tubes were "intended for conventional weapons," while other intelligence agencies, including some at the CIA, believed that the tubes were intended for nuclear enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotstory.nationaljournal.com/articles/0302nj1.htm|title=What Bush Was Told About Iraq|last=Waas|first=Murray|date=March 2, 2006|work=National Journal|accessdate=6 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609215348/http://www.nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2006/0302nj1.htm|archivedate=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French intelligence assessments==
A June 4, 2003, article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that "[[French intelligence]] had seized a separate shipment of tubes to the US, and tested their tolerance by spinning them to 98,000 revolutions per minute, concluding they were too sophisticated to have alternative uses."  ''[[The Times]]'' also reported that Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] was denied permission by French political authorities from using this information in his February 5, 2003, speech before the [[U.N. Security Council]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In a speech before the [[New America Foundation|New America Foundation American Strategy Program Policy Forum]] on October 19, 2005, Colonel [[Lawrence Wilkerson]] (Ret.), a former [[Chief of staff (politics)|Chief of Staff]] for the [[State Department]] from 2002–2005, commented on this.  According to Wilkerson, "The French came in the middle of my deliberations at the CIA and said, we have just spun aluminum tubes, and by God, we did it to this RPM, et cetera, et cetera, and it was all, you know, proof positive that the aluminum tubes were not for mortar casings or artillery casings, they were for centrifuges. Otherwise, why would you have such exquisite instruments? We were wrong.  We were wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newamerica.net/files/Doc_File_2644_1.pdf |title=Weigning the uniqueness of the Bush Administration's national security  decision-making process: boon or danger to american democracy? |date= October 19, 2005 |publisher= New America Foundation |location= |page=15 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== President Bush's State of the Union address ==
In his January 28, 2003, State of the Union address, Bush stated: "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production."

==Colin Powell at the UN==
On February 5, 2003, [[Colin Powell]] spoke to the [[United Nations Security Council]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since 1998, [Saddam's] efforts to reconstitute his nuclear program have been focused on acquiring the third and last component, sufficient fissile material to produce a nuclear explosion. To make the fissile material, he needs to develop an ability to enrich uranium. Saddam Hussein is determined to get his hands on a nuclear bomb. He is so determined that he has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high-specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries, even after inspections resumed. These tubes are controlled by the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] precisely because they can be used as centrifuges for enriching uranium. By now, just about everyone has heard of these tubes, and we all know that there are differences of opinion. There is controversy about what these tubes are for. Most U.S. experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Other experts, and the Iraqis themselves, argue that they are really to produce the rocket bodies for a conventional weapon, a multiple rocket launcher. Let me tell you what is not controversial about these tubes. First, all the experts who have analyzed the tubes in our possession agree that they can be adapted for centrifuge use. Second, Iraq had no business buying them for any purpose. They are banned for Iraq. I am no expert on centrifuge tubes, but just as an old Army trooper, I can tell you a couple of things: First, it strikes me as quite odd that these tubes are manufactured to a tolerance that far exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable rockets. Maybe Iraqis just manufacture their conventional weapons to a higher standard than we do, but I don't think so. Second, we actually have examined tubes from several different batches that were seized clandestinely before they reached [[Baghdad]]. What we notice in these different batches is a progression to higher and higher levels of specification, including, in the latest batch, an anodized coating on extremely smooth inner and outer surfaces. Why would they continue refining the specifications, go to all that trouble for something that, if it were a rocket, would soon be blown into shrapnel when it went off?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Summer 2003 concerns ==
In the summer of 2003, an informal review of classified government records by Deputy National Security Adviser [[Stephen Hadley]] concluded that Bush had been directly and repeatedly apprised of the deep rift within the intelligence community over whether Iraq wanted the high-strength aluminum tubes for a nuclear weapons program or for conventional weapons.

According to the March 30, 2006, [[National Journal]] article that reported on this review, Hadley was most concerned about the October 2002 one-page summary of a National Intelligence Estimate prepared specifically for President Bush (see section above).

The review by Hadley was to be part of a damage-control effort launched after former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph C. Wilson IV]] alleged that Bush's claims regarding uranium purchases were not true. After the review was completed, [[Karl Rove]], President Bush's chief political adviser, allegedly cautioned other White House aides that Bush's 2004 re-election prospects would be severely damaged if it was publicly disclosed that he had been personally warned that a key rationale for going to war had been challenged within the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationaljournal.com/articles/0330nj1.htm|title=Insulating Bush|last=Waas|first=Murray|date=March 30, 2006|work=[[National Journal]]|accessdate=6 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115185028/http://news.nationaljournal.com/articles/0330nj1.htm|archivedate=15 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence==
The report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq discussed the controversy. Part III, Intelligence Community Analysis of Iraq's Nuclear Program, states:

===Tube specifications===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 2001, the [US intelligence community] became aware that Iraq was attempting to procure 60,000 high-strength aluminum tubes manufactured from [[7075 aluminum|7075-T6 aluminum]], with an outer diameter of 81 mm, and inner diameter of 74.4 mm, a wall thickness of 3.3 mm and a length of 900 mm. The tubes were to be anodized using chromic acid and were to be shipped, wrapped in wax paper and separated from each other. Seven-thousand series aluminum alloy is extremely hard and strong and when formed into a tube of more than 75 mm in diameter, is a controlled item under the Nuclear Suppliers Group and Annex I11 of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687|UNSCR 687]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 707|707]] which Iraq is prohibited from importing because it could have nuclear applications. [page 5]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Department of Energy===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Based on the reported specifications, the tubes could be used to manufacture gas centrifuge rotor cylinders for uranium enrichment. However, our analysis indicates that the specified tube diameter, which is half that of the centrifuge machine Iraq successfully tested in 1990, is only marginally large enough for practical centrifuge applications, and other specifications are not consistent with a gas centrifuge end use. Moreover, the quantity being sought suggests preparations for large-scale production of centrifuge machines, for which we have not seen related procurement efforts - and the tubes’ specifications suggest a centrifuge design quite different from any Iraq is known to have.  ... While the gas centrifuge application cannot be ruled out, we assess that the procurement activity more likely supports a different application, such as conventional ordnance production. For example, the tube specifications and quantity appear to be generally consistent with their use as launch tubes for man-held anti-armor rockets or as tactical rocket casings. Also, the manner in which the procurement is being handled (multiple procurement agents, quotes obtained from multiple suppliers in diverse locations, and price haggling) seems to better match our expectations for a conventional Iraqi military buy than a major purchase for a clandestine weapons-of-mass destruction program. However, we have not identified an Iraq-specific, military, or other noncentrifuge application that precisely matches the tube specifications. [page 6]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--
==Continuing controversy==

The report has raised questions as to whether the Bush Administration was aware of dissenting opinions by different agencies with regards to the purpose for the aluminum tubes.

In the report, the following statement is made:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Conclusion 42. The Director of Central Intelligence was not aware of the views of all intelligence agencies on the aluminum tubes prior to September 2002 and, as a result, could only have passed the Central Intelligence Agency's view along to the President until that time. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As was revealed in the review, the CIA's view was that "the tubes were probably intended for an Iraqi uranium enrichment centrifuge program" and that they "have little use other than for a uranium enrichment program."

Prior to the invasion, the CIA report to Congress clearly said that the tubes may have uses other than for a centrifuge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8839">[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 052.jpg|thumb|right|St [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that raising prices in response to high demand was a type of theft.]]
The '''just price''' is a theory of [[ethics]] in [[economics]] that attempts to set standards of fairness in transactions. With intellectual roots in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosophy]], it was advanced by [[Thomas Aquinas]] based on an argument against [[usury]], which in his time referred to the making of any rate of [[interest]] on [[loan]]s. It gave rise to the contractual principle of ''[[laesio enormis]]''.

{{Thomism}}

==Unjust price: a kind of fraud==
The argument against usury was that the lender was receiving income for nothing, since nothing was actually lent, rather the money was exchanged. And, a dollar can only be fairly exchanged for a dollar, so asking for more is unfair.  Aquinas later expanded his argument to oppose any unfair earnings made in trade, basing the argument on the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]]. The Christian should "do unto others as you would have them do unto you", meaning he should trade value for value. Aquinas believed that it was specifically immoral to raise prices because a particular buyer had an urgent need for what was being sold and could be persuaded to pay a higher price because of local conditions:

:If someone would be greatly helped by something belonging to someone else, and the seller not similarly harmed by losing it, the seller must not sell for a higher price: because the usefulness that goes to the buyer comes not from the seller, but from the buyer's needy condition: no one ought to sell something that doesn't belong to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Si vero aliquis multum iuvetur ex re alterius quam accepit, ille vero qui vendidit non damnificatur carendo re illa, non debet eam supervendere. Quia utilitas quae alteri accrescit non est ex vendente, sed ex conditione ementis, nullus autem debet vendere alteri quod non est suum. . .''&lt;/ref&gt;
::&amp;mdash; ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'', 2-2, q. 77, art. 1

Aquinas would therefore condemn practices such as raising the price of building supplies in the wake of a [[natural disaster]]. Increased demand caused by the destruction of existing buildings does not add to a seller's costs, so to take advantage of buyers' increased willingness to pay constituted a species of [[fraud]] in Aquinas's view.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, ''Summa Theologica'', [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/sth3061.html#42226 2ª-2ae q. 77 pr.]: "''Deinde considerandum est de peccatis quae sunt circa voluntarias commutationes. Et primo, de fraudulentia quae committitur in emptionibus et venditionibus ...''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas believed all gains made in trade must relate to the labour exerted by the merchant, not to the need of the buyer. Hence, he condoned moderate gain as payment even for unnecessary trade, provided the price were regulated and kept within certain bounds:

:...there is no reason why gain [from trading] may not be directed to some necessary or even honourable end; and so trading will be rendered lawful; as when a man uses moderate gains acquired in trade for the support of his household, or even to help the needy...

==Later reinterpretations of the doctrine==
In Aquinas' time, most products were sold by the immediate producers (i.e. farmers and craftspeople), and wage-labor and banking were still in their infancy. The role of merchants and money-lenders was limited. The later [[School of Salamanca]] argued that the just price is determined by common estimation which can be identical with the market price -depending on various circumstances such as relative bargaining power of sellers and buyers- or can be set by public authorities{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. With the rise of [[Capitalism]], the use of just price theory faded, largely replaced by the [[microeconomic]] concept of [[supply and demand#history|supply and demand]] from [[John Locke|Locke]], [[James Denham-Steuart|Steuart]], [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], and especially [[Adam Smith]]. In modern economics regarding [[Returns (economics)#rent|returns]] to the means of production, [[Returns (economics)#interest|interest]] is seen as payment for a valuable service, which is the use of the money, though most banking systems still forbid excessive [[interest rate]]s.

Likewise, during the rapid expansion of capitalism over the past several centuries the theory of the just price was used to justify popular action against merchants who raised their prices in years of dearth. The Marxist historian [[E. P. Thompson]] emphasized the continuing force of this tradition in his pioneering article on the "[[moral economy|Moral Economy]] of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=E. P. |date=February 1971 |title=The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century |journal=Past &amp; Present |volume= |issue=50 |pages=76–136 |jstor=650244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other historians and sociologists have uncovered the same phenomenon in variety of other situations including peasants riots in continental Europe during the nineteenth century and in many developing countries in the twentieth. The political scientist [[James C. Scott]], for example, showed how this ideology could be used as a method of resisting authority in ''The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Subsistence and Rebellion in Southeast Asia''.&lt;ref&gt;(Yale, 1976; {{ISBN|9780300021905}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Laesio enormis''==
{{main|Laesio enormis|Inequality of bargaining power}}
Although the Imperial Roman Code, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' had stated that the parties to an exchange were entitled to try to outwit one another,&lt;ref&gt;Code 4, 44, 2&lt;/ref&gt; the view developed that a contract could be unwound if it was significantly detrimental to one party: if there were abnormal harm (''laesio enormis''). This meant that if an agreement was significantly imbalanced to the detriment of one party, the courts would decline to enforce it, and have jurisdiction to reverse [[unjust enrichment]]. Through the 19th century, the codifications in France and Germany declined to adopt the principle while common law jurisdictions attempted to generalise the doctrine of [[freedom of contract]]. However, in practice, and increasingly over the 20th century and early 21st century, the law of [[consumer protection]], [[tenancy]] contracts, and [[labour law]] was regulated by statute to require fairness in exchange. Certain terms would be compulsory, others would be regarded as unfair, and courts could substitute their judgment for what would be just in all the circumstances.

On 10 October  2012, at  the [[Mexico–United States border]] near [[Nogales, Arizona]], [[U.S. Border Patrol]] agent Lonnie Swartz fired 16 shots&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23" /&gt; at '''José Antonio Elena Rodríguez''', killing him,&lt;ref name=shots&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/magazine/10-shots-across-the-border.html|title=10 Shots Across the Border|last=Binelli|first=Mark|date=2016-03-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that [[Criminal rock throwing|young men threw rocks]] at him and other law enforcement agents.

After the incident, the law enforcement  agencies stated the Mexican civilians were trying to stop them from confiscating a shipment of contraband drugs  as well as moving immigrants across the border.

Rodriguez was hit 10 times by the patrol officer's shots.&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carranza|first1=Rafael|last2=O'Dell|first2=Rob|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yuhas|first=Alan|date=31 May 2015|title=Justice for José?

==Incident==
Around 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday 10 October, 2012, John Zuñiga, a police officer in [[Nogales, Arizona]],  received a call reporting "suspicious activity" on International Street, a road running directly along the  border. Getting to the scene, Zuñiga heard from another police officer from Nogales, Quinardo Garci, that  two men carrying "bundles taped to their backs" had climbed the fence into the United States. Identifying the bundles, on the basis of similar incidents in the past, as most probably containing [[marijuana]], they called out for back up.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;

After several [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs]] agents arrived, they saw the two men scaling the fence back into Mexico, empty-handed and with nothing on their backs. They commanded the two men to climb back down. At that time, Garcia and Zuñiga stated in their reports that they saw "rocks flying through the air"&lt;ref name="tucson.com"&gt;{{Cite website|title=Border agent's murder trial postponed|url=http://tucson.com/news/border-agent-s-murder-trial-postponed/article_561ac027-ef47-5d29-8d01-9c073669afff.html|format=|date=2016-01-05|author=Perla Trevizo|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|postscript=|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the assorted agents and also heard "gunfire," although they were unable to identify its source.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"/&gt; 

In the days following the incident, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] agency stated that
:After verbal commands from agents to cease [assaulting the agents with rocks] were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm. One of the subjects appeared to have been hit.

The person hit was José Antonio Elena Rodríguez, a 16-year old resident of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales, Mexico]]. He was unarmed, standing on the Mexican side of the border on a sidewalk on Calle Internacional street, in front of a doctor’s office, below a sign reading "Medical Emergencies" in Spanish. He was hit from behind by 10 bullets.&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"/&gt; The [[autopsy]] revealed that gunshot wounds to the head, [[lung]]s, and [[artery|arteries]] killed him.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR1"/&gt; 

==Trial==
U.S. Border Patrol agent Lonnie Ray Swartz was charged with [[second degree murder]] for the killing of José Rodríguez. It was the first time a US law enforcement officer was brought up on charges related to a killing that took part across the US-Mexican border, despite there having been a number of similar incidents in the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=NPR1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis|first=Charles|date=4 January 2015|title=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Has Killed Nearly 50 People in 10 Years.

In the trial, which began in late 2015 at the Evo A. DeConcini U.S. Courthouse, the defendant claimed he had used deadly force because Rodriguez "had been throwing rocks."&lt;ref name=shots/&gt; Although a witness testified that Rodríguez was not throwing rocks at the law enforcement officers, evidence showed that he was, along with other youths and men. Prosecutors acknowledged that Rodríguez was throwing rocks across the border but stated "he did not deserve to die" for this.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mistrial announced for U.S. border agent linked to teenager's fatal shooting|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mistrial-us-border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-manslaughter-charges-today-2018-04-23/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=CBS News|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Customs and Border Protection refused to release surveillance-camera footage of the incident.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

After the testimony by Emma Lew, the director of the medical examiner in [[Miami-Dade County]], Florida, who stated that Swartz's first shot "likely hit the boy in the middle of his back as he was running," the prosecution rested its case in the trial on 5 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040518_swartz_trial/swartz-trial-defense-struggles-with-first-witness-after-prosecution-rests/|title=

On 23 April 2018, Swartz was acquitted of the charge for second-degree murder; the jury was [[deadlock]]ed on lesser charges.&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael  |last2=O'Dell |first2=Rob |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=24 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
==Aftermath==
The judge presiding on the trial, [[Raner Collins]], declared a [[mistrial]]. The head of the Tucson union for Border Patrol officers, stated, after the jury's decision was announced, that "justice was properly served" and that the union was "pretty happy with it."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt; 

After the jury's decision was reported in the news, protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Tucson late Monday afternoon, and blocked off the intersection in front of it. Among those participating in the protest was the mother of Carlos LaMadrid, another Mexican teen who, in 2011, had been shot and killed by Border Patrol agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/05/11/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-retried-death-jose-antonio-elena-rodriguez/602687002/|title=Border Patrol agent will be retried in fatal cross-border shooting of teen|date=11 May 2018|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=20 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar incidents==
A 2015 review by the Border Patrol's [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] department reviewed 67 shooting incidents that resulted in 19 people dying, during the period from January 2010 through October 2012. The review found agents guilty of criminal conduct in 3 of the incidents. Two agents faced disciplinary action in the form of an "oral reprimand."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

The '''King Biscuit Blues Festival''' is an annual, multi-day [[blues]] festival, held in [[Helena, Arkansas]], United States.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books Limited|location=Dubai|page=219|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from ''[[King Biscuit Time]]'', which was the longest running radio show. [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]] and other musicians played live on KFFA every weekday, pausing for King Biscuit flour commercials and announcements of their next night time performances. Jim O'Neal, the editor of ''[[Living Blues]]'' magazine at the time and an authority on blues history, said, "The King Biscuit hour was the thing that really crystallized blues music in this area.  [[Muddy Waters]] and [[B.B. King]] would come home from working in the fields every day just to listen to the King Biscuit hour. The festival was temporarily renamed '''Arkansas Blues and Heritage Festival''' from 2005 to 2010 due to  problems arising out of rights of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koon |first=David |url=http://www.arktimes.com/Articles/ArticleViewer.aspx?ArticleID=ccc275ec-a2f4-41cc-9e05-7530f835039b |title=Fighting over a 'Biscuit' &amp;#124; Arkansas Reporter &amp;#124; Arkansas news, politics, opinion, restaurants, music, movies and art |publisher=Arktimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was started in 1986 under the guidance of the "Main Street Helena" organization, which is part of the "[[Main Street, USA]]" program.  Its purpose was to revitalize the downtown area of the [[Mississippi River]] port city. [[Lonnie Shields]] appeared at the inaugural festival.&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Skelly |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lonnie-shields-mn0000278350/biography |title=Lonnie Shields &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=1956-04-17 |accessdate=2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lalita Park building collapse''' occurred at 8:15 p.m. local time on 15 November 2010 in the [[India]]n capital of [[New Delhi]]. The 15-year-old building was in the [[Lalita Park]] neighborhood, near [[Laxmi Nagar (Delhi)|Lakshmi Nagar]] in [[East Delhi]] close to the [[Yamuna River]]. The building housed about 200 people, mostly poor migrant families, but also some small businesses.

==Collapse==
A fifth floor was under construction.&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-16/delhi/28224245_1_building-collapse-amrit-singh-lalita-park|title=Toll in Delhi building collapse mounts to 66|date=Nov 16, 2010|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was two floors higher than legally allowed, and its foundation had been weakened by water damage from recent flooding in the region. At least 67 people were killed and 73 were injured in the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Scores-Killed-Injured-in-Building-Collapse-in-New-Delhi-108369469.html|title=Scores Killed, Injured in New Delhi Building Collapse|date=16 November 2010|publisher=VOA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A magisterial inquiry into the incident was ordered. Under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code, a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder was registered against the building's owner, Amrit Singh. Singh fled but was later captured. The [[Government of Delhi]] announced an [[ex-gratia]] of Rs 2 [[lakh]] each to the families of those killed and Rs 1 lakh to the injured.&lt;ref name="tt"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4468">The '''Letters from the Segovia Woods''' denote two sets of letters [[Philip II of Spain]] sent to his Regent [[Margaret of Parma]], rejecting requests to abolish the ordinances outlawing [[heresy]] in the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] on 17 and 20 October 1565, and  31 July 1566. His intransigence in this matter contributed to the outbreak of the [[Eighty Years' War]].

==Background==
Philip had continued the policy of repression of heretics instituted by his father, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] with great vigor. However, this policy met with mounting opposition in the Netherlands. In 1565 the Council of State therefore sent its prominent member, [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]] to the Spanish court to personally plead for a relaxation of these policies. He did not receive an immediate answer.

At the time Philip divided his time between several places in Spain (the construction of [[El Escorial]] had only recently been started). One of his favorite houses was ''La Casa del Bosque de Segovia'', a mansion in the woods near [[Segovia]]. Of course, his voluminous correspondence used this place in the dateline when he sojourned there. There are therefore thousands of "letters from the Segovia woods" extant, but the two sets concerning the religious-policy question he sent subsequent to Egmont's visit from this place have become associated with their dateline in Dutch and English historiography.

==Developments in 1565 and 1566==
The two letters from October 1565, which arrived in Brussels at the beginning of November,&lt;ref&gt;Kossman and Mellink, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; were actually replies to Margaret's letters from July 1565, in which she made a number of requests concerning the relaxation of the [[Inquisition]] and the treatment of certain [[Anabaptists]] who had been convicted and sentenced, but for whom she requested mercy. In all cases he rejected her requests. There is a certain annoyed undertone in these letters as he refers to earlier letters, in which, he thought, he had made his orders already quite clear.&lt;ref&gt;Kossman and Mellink, pp. 53-56&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters did little to calm down the unrest in the Netherlands. In December 1565 a group of nobles started a political movement, the [[Compromise of Nobles]], in direct reaction to the letters. Also, on 24 January 1566, one of the leading members of the Council of State, the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]], expressed his discontent with Philip's religious policies and threatened to resign. Matters came to a head when 400 members of the Compromise presented a petition to Margaret on 5 April 1566, again asking for relaxation of the ordinances against heresy.

Margaret then sent two members of the Council of State, the Marquis of Bergen and the Baron de Montigny, brother of the [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn|Count of Hoorn]], to Spain with the petition to plead for a positive response. However, after having listened to these gentlemen, Philip indicated in a second set of letters from the Segovia Woods, dated 31 July 1566, that he saw no reason to relent. He also explicitly prohibited the convocation of the [[States General of the Netherlands]] as Margaret had advised.&lt;ref&gt;Kossman and Mellink, pp. 69-75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{main|Beeldenstorm}}
While awaiting Philip's reply to the petition, the government in Brussels had already suspended the enforcement of the ordinances. This had emboldened the Calvinists in the country (many of whom returned from exile because of the milder political climate) and they started to organize open-air religious meetings which attracted large crowds. Though initially peaceful, these eventually led to social unrest when Philip's reply had been received. In August and September, a wave of riotous attacks on churches, destroying religious art and fittings, the so-called Iconoclastic Fury or {{lang-nl|[[Beeldenstorm]]}} went over much of the country and Calvinists seized power in a few cities, like [[Valenciennes]]. These insurrections motivated Philip to send over an army under the command of the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] in 1567. His repressive measures ignited the [[Dutch Revolt]].

# The [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]] was formed in 1908 and was the major rugby league competition of New South Wales from its [[1908 NSWRFL season|inception in 1908]] until [[1994 NSWRL season|1994]], by which time its powers had expanded to run the code as a nationwide competition, eventually leading to the competition being played under the auspices of the [[Australian Rugby League]] in 1995. The success of Rugby League in Australia attracted the attention of global media organisation, [[News Corporation]] which led to the advent of the [[Super League war]]. [[Super League (Australia)]] ran a competition in 1997 which attracted 10 teams throughout the nation in [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997]], but was insuccessful and merged with the [[Australian Rugby League]] to form the [[National Rugby League]] for the following season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dazrl.awardspace.info/h_league_origins.htm|title=Origins of the Game of Rugby League |publisher=Darryl's Rugby League |date=2011 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival''' is the largest and longest-running showcase of [[domestic sheep]] and [[wool]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A Mild and Woolly Adventure; 'Hobbyist' Farmers Tend Flocks In Effort to Reconnect With Land  |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-415179.html |quote=In Maryland, some enterprising farmers have turned the Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival into what organizers say is the largest and longest-running event of ... |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=March 24, 2001 |accessdate=2009-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 festival was the 37th consecutive.

==History==

The '''Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration''' was a 2001 concert show by [[Michael Jackson]]. It was staged in [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] on September 7 and 10, 2001. In late November 2001, the [[CBS]] television network aired the concerts as a two-hour special in honor of [[Michael Jackson]]'s thirtieth year as a solo entertainer (his first solo single, "[[Got to Be There (song)|Got to Be There]]", was recorded in [[1971 in music|1971]]). The show was edited from footage of the two performances.

The shows sold out in five hours. Ticket prices were among the most expensive ever for an event; the best seats cost $10,000 and included a dinner with Michael Jackson and a signed poster. The show was choreographed by [[Glenn Douglas Packard]] and Brian Thomas, who were nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Choreography. It was presented by [[David Gest]], [[World Events Productions|World Events LLC]] and [[Clear Channel Entertainment]] in conjunction with [[American Airlines]], [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] and [[Amazon.com]]. Jackson reportedly earned $7.5 million for each of the two concerts. The concert official Boxscore was $10,072,105 for both concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boxscore Top 10 Concert Grosses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=billboard+2001&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gnCRT6vADK_k6QGEs5yeBA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=billboard%202001&amp;f=false|work=Page 14|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To some fans, Jackson appeared more disoriented in the first concert as he only did one short [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]] and improvised the ending of the "[[Billie Jean]]" performance. In 2011, presenter David Gest claimed that Jackson was on drugs during the concerts in the documentary ''[[Michael Jackson: The Life of an Icon]]''.  However, Jackson himself said that he had not rehearsed for the first concert. In his book ''You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes'', brother Jermaine Jackson said that Jackson was taking [[Demerol]], a pain relieving medicine with psychotropic effects. The show attracted numerous celebrities, including basketball players, actors, and other musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagecollect.com/events/m-jackson-30th-anniversary---archival-pictures----star-max----114750-photos-114750/page-4|title=Pictures From|website=imagecollect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concert would also be the final one where Jackson performed with his brothers onstage.

==Aftermath==
On [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], Jackson was scheduled for a meeting at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], but overslept and did not make it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Was Michael Jackson almost in WTC on 9/11?|url = https://www.today.com/popculture/was-michael-jackson-almost-wtc-9-11-2D80555837|date = 2011-09-14|accessdate = 2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the attacks, Jackson sponsored a charity concert titled [[United We Stand: What More Can I Give]]. The concerts were held in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[New York City]]. Other featured artists that also performed in the benefit concert were the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Krystal Harris]], [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[James Brown]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Billy Gilman]], [[O-Town]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[Christina Milian]], [[Carole King]], [[Al Green]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Bette Midler]], [[CeCe Peniston]], [[Aerosmith]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], [[NSYNC]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[Train (band)|Train]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Mariah Carey]], and [[Mary J. Blige]]. In addition, his sister [[Janet Jackson]] performed with him. 

This event marked Randy Jackson's final concert with his brothers. He would contribute backup vocals for Jackson's final song, [[This Is It (Michael Jackson song)|This is It]], along with his brothers Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine, before announcing his retirement from entertainment. From 2012-13, the remaining brothers (without Randy or Michael) reunited for the [[Unity Tour]], which was held in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Oceania]].

'''Mir Jafar bin Mir Hasan Dasni''' ({{lang-ku|Mîr Ceferê Dasnî}}, {{lang-ar|الأمير جعفر بن الأمير حسن الداسني}}), also known as '''Jafar bin Faharjis''', was a [[Yazidi]] and was member of the [[ethno-religious]] group of the Yazidis leader who in 838 launched an uprising against [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mutasim]] in the area north of [[Mosul]]. After being defeated at Babagesh he resided in castles in Dasin.&lt;ref&gt;M. Th. Houtsma, 1993, E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936: Volume 4 - Page 1136, Brill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bois, 1966, The Kurds, Khayats, University of Michigan, 159 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Mutasim in response sent an army under command of Abdullah bin Ans al-Azdi, resulting in an armed confrontation between the [[Arabic people|Arab]] army and [[Kurdish people|Kurds]]. Due to the difficulty of the terrain, the Arab army proved unsuccessful, suffered heavy casualties and a number of its commanders including Abdullah's uncle Ishaq bin Ans and his father-in-law were killed.

Mutassim had purchased a [[Khazar]] slave, called [[Itakh]]. He appointed him as commander of his army. Itakh defeated Mir Jafar's troops in 841 and killed many Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Alan Brook, 2009, The Jews of Khazaria, page 184, Rowman and Littlefield Publishers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid being captured alive, Mir Jafar committed suicide by drinking poison.

Starting in the 1240s, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] made repeated '''invasions of [[Syria (region)|Syria]]''' or attempts thereof. Most failed, but they did have some success in 1260 and 1300, capturing [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] and destroying the [[Ayyubid dynasty]]. The Mongols were forced to retreat within months each time by other forces in the area, primarily the Egyptian [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]]. Since 1260, it had been described as the '''Mamluk-Ilkhanid War'''.

==First invasion==
During the governorship of Bachu in Persia, the Mongolian army under Yisaur attacked Syria in 1244. The reasons for the attack are unclear, but it may have been in retaliation for the Syrian participation on the Seljuk side in the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]].&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Benson ''The Mongol campaigns in Asia'', p.179&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn 1244, Yisaur concentrated the Mongol forces in the upper Tigris valley where they subjugated the Kurdish province of Akhlat. Moving across, the Mongolian army encountered no resistance and ravaged the area en route. The fortified cities were untaken in his advance because Yisaur was not prepared for siege assault. Passing through the territory of the city of Urfa, he crossed the Euphrates.

He marched directly to Aleppo but went as far as Hailan before the climate impaired his army's movements. Yisaur sent envoys to Aleppo to demand submission of tribute, which Malik agreed to pay. The same demand were sent to Bohemond of Antioch who chose not to fight them instead of defiance.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Curtin ''The Mongols: A history'', p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

Yisaur withdrew his force back up the Euphrates valley and received the submission of Malatia. In Egypt, Sultan [[as-Salih Ayyub]] decided to acquiesce to the results and made no attempt to raise an army to encounter the Mongols who had invaded his dominions in Syria.

In 1251, as an expediency to buy peace, Sultan [[an-Nasir Yusuf]] sent his representatives to Mongolia for the election of Möngke and agreed to make Syria a vassal state of the Mongol Empire.

==1260 invasion==
In 1255 Hulagu sought to further expand the Empire into the Middle East under orders from his older brother, the Great Khan [[Möngke Khan|Möngke]]. Hulagu's forces subjugated multiple peoples along the way, most notably the center of the Islamic Empire, [[Baghdad]], which was completely [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|sacked in 1258]], destroying the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].  From there, the Mongol forces proceeded into Syria.

In 1260, [[Egypt]] was under the control of the [[Bahri Mamluks]], while most of the Levant (aside from the [[Crusader states]]) was still under the control of [[Ayyubid]] princes. The Mongols, for their part, had combined their forces with that of their Christian vassals in the region, the [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgians]]; the army of [[Cilician Armenia]] under [[Hethum I, King of Armenia]]; and the Franks of [[Bohemond VI of Antioch]]. In what is described by the 20th-century historians [[René Grousset]] and [[Lev Gumilev]] as the "yellow crusade" (''Croisade Jaune''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vasiliev|first1=Alexander A.|title=History of the Byzantine Empire, 324–1453|date=1958|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299809269|page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gumilev|first1=Lev Nikolaevich|title=Searches for an Imaginary Kingdom: The Legend of the Kingdom of Prester John|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521322146|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; the combined forces captured the city of [[Aleppo]], and then on March 1, 1260, under the Mongol Christian general [[Kitbuqa]], took [[Damascus]]. The last Ayyubid king, [[An-Nasir Yusuf]], was captured by the Mongols near [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in 1260. However, Hulagu promised him that he would appoint An-Nasir Yusuf as his [[viceroy]] in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Egypt: Islamic Egypt, 640-1517'', p.255&lt;/ref&gt; With the Islamic power center of Baghdad and Syria gone, the center of Islamic power transferred to the [[Mamluk]]s in [[Cairo]].

Hulagu's intention at that point was to continue south through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to Egypt, to engage the Mamluks.  However, Möngke died in late 1259, requiring Hulagu to return to Karakorum to engage in the councils on who the next Great Khan would be.  Hulagu departed with the bulk of his forces, leaving only about 10,000 Mongol horsemen in Syria under Kitbuqa.  Some of Kitbuqa's forces engaged in raids southwards towards Egypt, reaching as far as Gaza, where a Mongol garrison was established with 1,000 troops.

The Mamluks took advantage of the weakened state of the Mongol forces, and, negotiating a passive alliance with the remnants of the Crusader forces in [[Acre (city)|Acre]], advanced northwards to engage the Mongols at the pivotal [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in September 1260. The Mamluks achieved a decisive victory, Kitbuqa was executed, and the battle established a high-water mark for the Mongol conquests. In previous defeats, the Mongols had always returned later to re-take the territory, but they were never able to avenge the loss at Ayn Jalut. The border of the Mongol Ilkhanate remained at the [[Tigris River]] for the duration of Hulagu's dynasty. Sultan An-Nasir and his brother were executed after Hulagu heard the news of the defeat of Kitbuqa at [[Ain Jalut]].

In December 1260, Hulagu sent 6,000 troops back into Syria, but they were defeated at the [[First Battle of Homs]].

==Abbasid Caliphate in Cairo and the rebellion in Mosul==
After the fall of [[Baghdad]] in 1258, a few of [[Abbasid]] princes fled to Syria and Egypt. There, the Abbasids still maintained a feeble show of authority, confined to religious matters, under the Mamluks. But their authority was limited to being figureheads. First of the Caliphs in [[Cairo]], [[Al-Mustansir II of Cairo|Al-Mustansir II]] was dispatched to [[Iraq]] by Baibars. The Caliph was reinforced with Syrian auxiliaries and the [[Bedouin]]s. However, he was totally crushed by the Mongol vanguard in South Iraq in 1262. The Mongol [[protecrate]] and ruler of [[Mosul]], Badr al-Din's sons sided with the Mamluks and rebelled against the rule of Hulagu. This led to the destruction of the city state and the Mongols finally suppressed the rebellion in 1265.

==1271 invasion==
[[File:EdwardICrusadeMap.jpg|thumb|The Mamluks under Baibars (yellow) fought off the Franks and the Mongols during the [[Ninth Crusade]].]]
The second Mongol invasion of Syria took place in October 1271, when 10,000 Mongols and Seljuk auxiliaries moved southwards from [[Rûm]] and captured Aleppo; however they retreated back beyond the Euphrates when the Mamluk leader [[Baibars]] marched on them from Egypt.

==Area alliances==
In the second half of the 13th century, [[Mongol Empire#The Mongol Empire during the reign of Kublai Khan|civil war had erupted in the Mongol Empire]]. In the Middle East, this manifested as conflict between the Mongols of the [[Golden Horde]], and the Mongols of the [[Ilkhanate]], who battled over claims on [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. Both the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate sought to strengthen their position via trade agreements or other types of alliances with other powers in the area. In 1261, [[Berke]] of the Golden Horde allied with the [[Mamluk]] Sultan [[Baibars]],&lt;ref&gt;Ryley-Smith in ''Atlas of the Crusades'', p.112 (French Edition): "When the Golden Horde allied with the Mamluks, the Ilkhanate looked towards an alliance with the Christians"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The alliance which Berke had created between the Mongols and the Mamluks against the Ilkhanate remained constant", Morgan, p.144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Mongols of Iran were all but encircled by a chain of alliances linking the Mamluks to the Golden Horde, and this power to Kaidu", Setton, p.529&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The friendship between Egypt and the Golden Horde, which would last until the conclusion of peace between the Mamluks and the Il-Khan in 1320" ''The New Cambridge Medieval History'', page 710, by David Abulafia - 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In order to fight their common enemy [the Ilkhanate], the Kipchack Mongols and the Mamluks entered into an alliance." Luisetto, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; against their common enemy the Ilkhanate.  This alliance was both strategic, and also in terms of trade exchanges, as the Egyptians had been the Golden Horde's long-standing trade partner and ally in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Mantran, Robert (Fossier, Robert, ed.) "A Turkish or Mongolian Islam" in ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Middle Ages: 1250-1520'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, the Mongols of the Ilkhanate sought (unsuccessfully) [[Franco-Mongol alliance|an alliance with the Franks of Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Mongols and the West''&lt;/ref&gt; but did form a [[Byzantine-Mongol alliance]] with the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]].

===Conflict between the Golden Horde and the Il-Khans===
{{main|Berke–Hulagu war}}
[[File:Siege of Tripoli Painting (1289).jpg|thumb|Mamluks offensive at the [[Fall of Tripoli (1289)|Fall of Tripoli]] in 1289.]]
The two Western Mongol realms, the [[Golden Horde]] and the [[Il-Khanate]], were already in open war. The roots of the conflict were related to battles between the descendants of [[Genghis Khan]] over the control of the Empire. The immediate successor to Genghis Khan was his son [[Ögedei]], but the leadership was then taken by force by the descendants of Genghis' son [[Tolui]]. During the reign of [[Kublai Khan]] (son of Genghis' son [[Tolui]]), descendants of Genghis's other sons [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], and [[Jochi]] sought to oppose the rule of Kublai.  The [[Ilkhanate]] had been founded by [[Hulagu]], another of Tolui's sons, who was therefore loyal to Kublai.  The [[Golden Horde]] had been founded by Genghis' son [[Jochi]], following the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]]. Genghis had designated several of the territories south of the [[Caucasus]] to Jochi, specifically [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljukid Sultanate]].&lt;ref name="Luisetto, p.155"&gt;Luisetto, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Hulagu, with the backing of his brother the Great Khan Kublai, invaded and captured these territories in 1256, even installing his capital in the center of the disputed territories, at [[Maragha]]. [[Berke]], the leader of the [[Golden Horde]], could not tolerate this infringement of his inheritance,&lt;ref name="Luisetto, p.155"/&gt; and a drawn-out conflict between the two Mongol realms continued well into the 14th century.&lt;ref name="The Mongols, David Morgan, p.144"&gt;''The Mongols'', David Morgan, p.144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic and religious affinities===
Various affinities led to a more or less natural alliance between the Mongols of the Golden Horde and the Mamluks of Egypt.  The Mamluks' Empire had been founded by former slaves bought from the [[Kipchack]] territory of southern Russia, which was now an important segment of the Mongol Golden Horde. There were therefore already cultural affinities between large segments of the Mongol Horde and the ruling elite of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;"It is a fact of crucial importance that the Mamluks of Egypt and the Mongols of the Golden Horde were natural allies (…) simply because the ruling class of Egypt and an important and influential segment of the Golden Horde belonged in fact to the same ethnic group." A History of the Crusades, Kenneth Meyer Setton, p.527&lt;/ref&gt; Berke's Turkic subjects also spoke the same Turkic language as the Mamluks.&lt;ref&gt;Setton, p.527&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, the Golden Horde, under [[Berke]]'s leadership, was the first of the Mongol states to convert to Islam,&lt;ref name="The Mongols, David Morgan, p.144"/&gt; which lent to solidarity with the Islamic realms to the south.&lt;ref&gt;By ultimately becoming Muslims, the Mongols of the Golden Horde conspicuously identified themselves with their Turkish subjects and with the people to the south, rather than with the Christian Russians to the North" Morgan, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Il-Khan rulers were highly favourable to Christianity, and did not commit to Islam until 1295, when the Ilkhan [[Ghazan]], a descendant of Tolui, formerly converted when he took the throne.&lt;ref&gt;"On the contrary, Hulagu, accompanied by [[Dokuz Khatun]] greatly favoured Christianity", Luisetto, p.155-156&lt;/ref&gt; Even after his conversion though, he continued to battle the Mamluks for control of Syria, while simultaneously seeking an alliance with Christian Europe.

===Mamluk-Golden Horde rapprochement===
[[File:DisasterOfMari1266.JPG|thumb|right|The Mamluks defeated the Armenians and captured the [[Leo II, King of Armenia|prince Leo]] at the [[Battle of Mari|disaster of Mari]], 1266: illumination from ''[[Le Livre des Merveilles]]'', 15th century.]]
The Golden Horde entered into a defensive alliance with the Mamluks in Egypt, with the agreement being that each realm would intervene if the other was attacked by the Ilkhanate.&lt;ref&gt;"In order to fight their common enemy [the Ilkhanate], the Kipchack Mongols and the Mamluks entered into an alliance. This was based on a defensive rather than an offensive policy: if one of their territories was attacked, the second would fight for the other, on his own front, in order to create a diversion or weaken enough Persian troops so that their action would be stopped." Luisetto, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Before invading Syria in 1299, Ghazan was forced to send troops in the Caucasus, in order to reinforce his Christian-Mongol troops. These were so many soldiers who could not fight in Palestine.", Luisetto, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; This required the Il-khan to devote forces to both his northern and southern borders, and never use all forces in a single battle. On multiple occasions, the forces of the Ilkhanate would start a campaign towards Syria in the south, only to be forced to recall troops within a few months because of attacks from the Golden Horde in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Luisetto, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

==1281 invasion==
[[File:1281BattleOfHoms.JPG|thumb|The Mongols and the Armenians were defeated by the Mamluks at the [[Second Battle of Homs]] in 1281.]]
The third major invasion took place in 1281 under [[Abaqa Khan]]. Having crossed the Euphrates and captured Aleppo, the Mongols of the Ilkhanate moved as far south as [[Homs]] with 80,000 men before they were beaten back to the [[Euphrates]] river at the [[Second Battle of Homs]].

The Il-khan [[Tekuder]] (r. 1282-1284) was friendly to Islam, and sent a letter to the Mamluk sultan to broach the subject of peace, but Tekuder's envoy was arrested by the Mamluks. Tekuder's conversion to Islam and attempts to make peace with the Mamluks were not popular with the other nobles of the Ilkhanate.  When Tekuder's brother [[Arghun]] challenged him for the throne, Tekuder sought assistance in vain from the Mamluks, but was executed. Arghun (1284–91) took power, and as directed by the Great Khan [[Kublai]] (r.1260-94) continued Mongol attempts to conquer Syria.

==The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War: 1299–1303==
{{See also|Mongol raids into Palestine}}
[[File:BattleOfHoms1299.JPG|thumb|right|px200|1299, The [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]]. The Mongols under [[Ghazan]] defeated the Mamluks.]]
In late 1299, the Mongol Ilkhan [[Mahmud Ghazan]], son of Arghun, took his army and crossed the Euphrates river to again invade Syria. They continued south until they were slightly north of Homs,&lt;ref&gt;Demurger, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully took [[Aleppo]]. There, Ghazan was joined by forces from his vassal state of Cilician Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Demurger, p.142 (French edition) "He was soon joined by King Hethum, whose forces seem to have included Hospitallers and Templars from the kingdom of Armenia, who participate to the rest of the campaign."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mamluk relief force sent from [[Damascus]] met the Mongol army northeast of Homs, at the [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]] (sometimes called the Battle of Homs) in December 1299. The Mongols had some 60,000 troops, with about 40,000 Georgian and Armenian auxiliaries, and routed the Egyptian Mamluks with their much smaller force of 20,000-30,000 troops. The Mamluks retreated, and were harassed by Maronite and Druze bowmen who wanted independence from the Mamluks. One group of Mongols also split off from Ghazan's army, and pursued the retreating Mamluk troops as far as [[Gaza City|Gaza]],&lt;ref&gt;Demurger, p.142 "The Mongols pursued the retreating troops towards the south, but stopped at the level of Gaza"&lt;/ref&gt; pushing them back to Egypt.
[[File:1301FrancoMongolOffensiveLevant.jpg|thumb|250px|1300–1301 operations from [[Fall of Ruad|Ruad]] and Mongol offensives under [[Ghazan]]'s general Kutluka.]]
The bulk of Ghazan's forces then proceeded onward towards [[Damascus]]. Some of the populace of Damascus upon hearing of the Mongol approach had fled to Egypt, and the governor of the city, Arjawash, had entrenched himself deep inside the [[Citadel of Damascus]]. The Mongols besieged the city for ten days, which surrendered between December 30, 1299, and January 6, 1300, though its Citadel resisted.&lt;ref&gt;Demurger 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; Ghazan then withdrew most of his forces in February, promising to return in the winter of 1300–1301 to attack Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Demurger, p.146&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the withdrawal is believed to be either the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] Mongols invading their eastern borders, or the need to retreat to areas where there was better grazing room for the horses. The Mamluks had learned that the availability of pastures was important to the Mongols, and so had taken to burning pastureland so as to prevent the rapid advance of the Mongol cavalry. After Ghazan's main force withdrew, only about 10,000 horsemen remained in Syria, under the Mongol general [[Mulay]].

With the retreat of the majority of forces from both sides, for about three months, until the Mamluks returned in May 1300, Mulay's forces were in technical control over Syria,&lt;ref&gt;Demurger (p.146, French edition): "After the Mamluk forces retreated south to Egypt, the main Mongol forces retreated north in February, Ghazan leaving his general Mulay to rule in Syria".&lt;/ref&gt; and some Mongols engaged in raids as far south as Jerusalem and Gaza.&lt;ref name=schein-raid&gt;"Meanwhile the Mongol and Armenian troops raided the country as far south as Gaza." Schein, 1979, p. 810&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amitai, "Mongol Raids into Palestine (AD 1260 and 1300)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Arab historians however, like Moufazzal Ibn Abil Fazzail, an-Nuwairi and Makrizi, report that the Mongols raided the country as far as Jerusalem and Gaza"— Sylvia Schein, p.810&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Arab historian Yahia Michaud, in the 2002 book ''Ibn Taymiyya, Textes Spirituels I-XVI'', Chap XI, describes that there were some firsthand accounts at the time, of forays of the Mongols into Palestine, and quotes two ancient Arab sources stating that Jerusalem was one of the cities that was invaded by the Mongols&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Mamluks returned from Egypt, the remaining Mongols retreated with little resistance.

Also in early 1300, two Frankish rulers, [[Guy of Ibelin (died 1304)|Guy d'Ibelin]] and [[Jean II de Giblet]], had moved in with their troops from Cyprus in response to Ghazan's earlier call. They had established a base in the castle of [[Enfeh|Nephin]] in the lordship of Gibelet ([[Byblos]]) on the Syrian coast with the intention of joining him, but Ghazan was already gone.&lt;ref&gt;Demurger, p.144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"After Ghazan had left, some Christians from Cyprus arrived in Gibelet and Nefin, led by Guy, [[Count of Jaffa]], and Jean d'Antioche with their knights, and from there proceeded to go to Armenia where the camp of the Tatars was. But Ghazan was gone, so they had to return."|Le Templier de Tyr, 614. ''Le Templier de Tyr'', 614: "Et apres que Cazan fu partis aucuns crestiens de Chipre estoient ales a Giblet et a Nefin et en seles terres de seles marines les quels vous nomeray: Guy conte de Jaffe et messire Johan dantioche et lor chevaliers; et de la cuyderent aler en Ermenie quy estoit a lost des Tatars. Cazan sen estoit retornes: il se mist a revenir"&lt;/ref&gt; They also started to besiege the new city of Tripoli, but in vain,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Richard, p.481&lt;/ref&gt; and then returned to Cyprus.

In late 1300, Ghazan's forces had dealt with the distraction of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] invasion on their northern border, and once again turned their attention to Syria. They crossed the Euphrates river between December 14, 1300 and November 1, 1301. Again, the Mamluk army in Syria withdrew without engaging in combat, which resulted in a panic in Damascus when they heard of the new threat from the Mongols. The Syrians of Hamat were able to achieve a small victory against the Mongols at a battle near Aleppo by the post of Hamat. This created order in Damascus, enough for the governor to send for a larger relief force from Egypt. However, the Mongols had already left Syria due to a death in [[Ghazan Khan]]'s family.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Bahri Dynasty 1250 - 1382 (AD).PNG|thumb|right|200px|Dominion of Bahri Mamluks (red)]]
The Ilkhanate returned to Syria in 1303, travelling unopposed down the Levant until they reached Damascus. However, near Damascus they were once again soundly defeated by the Mamluks at the [[Battle of Marj al-Saffar (1303)|Battle of Marj al-Saffar]] in April 1303.

==Final Stage: 1312==
In 1313, the new khan of the Ilkhanate, [[Öljaitü]], pursued an aggressive policy to consolidate his rule, subduing the Caspian Province of Gilan and destroying the autonomous principality of Herat. Encouraged by the defection of some Syrian emirs, Öljaitü decided to cross the Euphrates in 1312 to attack the Mamluk Sultanate. He laid siege to the heavily fortified town of Rahbat. After about a month of fighting in which they suffered heavy casualties, the Mongols ultimately failed to take the fortified place and withdrew. This was to be the last major Mongol incursion into the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Saunders, "History of the Mongol Conquests," page 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josef W. Meri, "Medieval Islamic Civilization," page 573&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty of Aleppo==
[[File:Mongol dominions1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Mongol world, ca. 1300. The gray area is the later [[Timur|Timurid empire]].]]
Following the defeat of the Mongol ruler [[Ghazan]] and the progressive conversion of the Il-Khanate to [[Islam]], the Mongols finally were amenable to ceasing hostilities. The first contacts to establish a treaty of peace were communicated via the slave trader al-Majd al-Sallami. After the initial communications, more formal letters and embassies were exchanged.&lt;ref name="Meri, p.541"&gt;Meri, p.541&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the Ilkhanate ruler [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]], who was following the advice of his custodian [[Chupan]], the treaty with the Mamluks was ratified in 1322/1323.

Following the treaty and a period of peace, the Il-Khanate further disintegrated, and effectively disappeared during the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Meri, p.541"/&gt;

'''Natal Luz''', which literally means “Christmas of Lights”, is an annual Christmas festivity in Gramado, [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natalluzdegramado.com.br/pt/home/natal-luz-gramado.php Official Website of the Festival] Retrieved 11 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The festival began in 1986 as a small concert conducted by [[Eleazar de Carvalho]], one of the country’s most celebrated orchestra conductors. Over the years, it has grown into Brazil’s largest Christmas event.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Diane. “Christmas in Brazil: A Magnificent Celebration of Light.”Ornamentshop.com.http://www.ornamentshop.com/xmas_trivia/christmas_traditions_in_brazil.asp Retrieved 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Natal Luz is celebrated in Gramado, a city in Rio Grande do Sul. [[Gramado]] has been labeled the country’s Christmas capital, an honor it has held for over 20 years. The celebration gathers around 1.5 million people every year &lt;ref&gt;Evans, Jess. “W-DMX Joins Natal Luz Gramado Party.” LSi Online.http://www.lsionline.co.uk/news/story/W-DMX-joins-Natal-Luz-Gramado-party/-A4F4XF Retrieved 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and runs from November 12 to January 13,&lt;ref&gt;Cutting, Leo. “Gramado, Brazil’s Christmas Capital.” The Rio Times.http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-travel/exploring-gramado-brazils-christmas-capital/ Retrieved 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the longest [[Christmas]] festivals in the world.

==Highlights and Attractions==
The celebration of the Natal Luz consists of a wide array of events and attractions,&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Diane. “Christmas in Brazil: A Magnificent Celebration of Light.”Ornamentshop.com Retrieved 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;   including one that allows visitors to feel how it is to be inside a Christmas tree. The so-called magic Christmas tree is 99-foot tall and has over 3,500 ornaments, 2,600 string lights, 1,000 strobe lights, and an artificial snow machine. The festivities also include tree lighting shows, contests, games, parades, reindeer exhibits, musical performances, and dramatic readings of classic holiday plays, such as the “Fantastic Christmas Factory”, a musical about a child who was able to witness the wonders of Christmas coming to life. 

One of the most anticipated events of the Natal Luz is the Nativitaten.&lt;ref&gt;Lima, Leandra. “Gramado: Natal Luz IluminaAsRuas de Cidade(Natal Luz Lights Up Gramado Streets).”O Globo.Boa Viagem.http://oglobo.globo.com/boa-viagem/gramado-natal-luz-ilumina-as-ruas-da-cidade-6748372 Retrieved 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Held at the center of the Joaquina Rita Bier Lake, the celebration involves a floating lights show, a performance by choirs, tenors, sopranos, and Brazil’s musicians as well as circus acts, amid a display of fireworks . The performance is usually divided into five acts, which depict the journey of mankind throughout history, from the creation of the world, the birth of Jesus Christ, the coming of darkness, all the way through to the day of salvation. 

Another event people look forward to is the Tannenbaumfest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natalluzdegramado.com.br/pt/home/natal-luz-gramado.php Official Website of the Festival] Retrieved 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; where local Gramado business owners compete to create the most beautiful Christmas tree in the city. The trees are placed in the Avenida Borges de Medeiros for everyone to see. The decorated trees are evaluated by a panel of judges, and the winners are announced at an awarding ceremony in December. The trees are left on display until the end of the Natal Luz. 
There have also been special events during this three-month festival. The most notable of these happened in 2009, when 2,000 of the city’s inhabitants worked hand-in-hand to create a jigsaw puzzle made from a million lamps.&lt;ref&gt;Baldussi, Davi. “Christmas in Gramado.”The Rio Times.http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-travel/christmas-in-gramado/ Retrieved 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The jigsaw puzzle completion was celebrated with a pyrotechnic display, which used over 10,000 fireworks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3214">'''''Operation Red Card''''' is the name given to a two-month Asia-wide [[copyright infringement|anti-piracy]] operation that was conducted by the Motion Picture Association (MPA) (the international arm of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]) which resulted in the seizure of 6.7 million pirated discs in 12 countries across the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. The operation took place between May to mid-July 2006, resulting in 915 arrests and the seizure of 1,483 optical disc burners.

There were 1,919 raids conducted in 12 countries throughout Asia.  
* In [[China]], 405 raids resulted in the seizure of over 1.96 million discs.
* Raids in [[Indonesia]] brought in 305 [[Optical disc recording technologies|DVD burners]] and 2.16 million discs.
* In [[Malaysia]], there were 128 arrests and 1.18 million [[optical discs]] seized in 455 raids.

The MPAA has been conducting anti-piracy sweeps on a twice a year basis, with more than 2,500 arrests and the seizure of over 23 million illegal videos so far.

According to the MPAA, its members—which encompass all of the major film studios in Hollywood—lost $1.2 billion a year in revenue due to piracy and illegal downloading.{{ref|cite news |first= Mike |last= Ellis |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= ASIA-WIDE MOVIE PIRACY OPERATIONS NET RECORD 6.7 MILLION PIRATE DISCS, 915 ARRESTS |url= http://www.mpaa.org/press_releases/2006_07_25.pdf|work= MPA Asia-Pacific |publisher= Motion Picture Association of America |date= 2006-07-25|accessdate= 2006-07-25}}

The name ''Operation Red Card'' is a reference to the red card issued by a referee to a player ejected from a [[football]] game for unsportsmanlike conduct or repeated [[Foul (football)|fouls]].

On May 1, 2011, an image purporting to show a dead bin Laden was broadcast on Pakistani television. Although the story was picked up by much of the British press, as well the [[Associated Press]], it was swiftly removed from websites after it was exposed as a fake on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/osama-bin-laden-photo-fake|title=Osama bin Laden corpse photo is fake|author=Amelia Hill|publisher=Guardian|location=London|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militarytimes.com/blogs/battle-rattle/2011/05/02/bin-laden-death-photo-fake|title=Bin Laden death photo: FAKE!|publisher=MilitaryTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, the [[Obama administration]] announced it would not release any images of Bin Laden's dead body.&lt;ref&gt;Montopoli, Brian (2011-05-04). "[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20059739-503544.html?tag=breakingnews Obama: I won't release bin Laden death photos]." ''[[CBS News]]''. Retrieved 2011-05-04.&lt;/ref&gt; The administration had considered releasing the photos to dispel rumors of a hoax, at the risks of perhaps prompting another attack by [[al Qaeda]] and of releasing very graphic images to people who might find them disturbing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8500635/Osama-bin-Laden-killed-live.html|title=Osama bin Laden killed: live coverage|publisher=Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several photos of the aftermath of the raid were given to [[Reuters]] by an anonymous Pakistani security official, but though all appeared to be authentic, they were taken after the U.S. forces had left and none of them included evidence regarding bin Laden's fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Chris | last = Allbritton |author2=John Boyle | title = Photos show three dead men at bin Laden raid house | date = 4 May 2011 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/04/us-binladen-pakistan-photos-idUSTRE7437KK20110504 | work = [[Reuters]] | accessdate = 2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, it was reported that an al-Qaeda website acknowledged bin Laden's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/05/al-qaeda-confirms-osama-bin-ladens-death-in-internet-statement/1|title=Al-Qaeda confirms bin Laden's death, threatens new attacks|author=Douglas Stanglin|publisher=USA Today|date=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] senator and [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] member [[Jim Inhofe]] stated he had viewed "gruesome" photographs of bin Laden's corpse, and later confirmed that the body "was him", adding, "He's history".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/05/11/congress.bin.laden.photos/index.html?hpt=T1 Members of Congress see bin Laden photos], CNN.com, May 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of physical evidence==
The primary source of skepticism about the U.S. government's story has been its own refusal to provide any physical evidence to substantiate its claim.  Although the Abbottabad raid has been described in great detail by U.S. officials, no physical evidence constituting actual proof of his death has been offered to the public, neither to journalists nor to independent third parties who have requested this information through the [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA).&lt;ref name="FOIA1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/05/associated-press-case-releasing-bin-laden-photo/37510/|title=The Associated Press's Case for Releasing the Bin Laden Photo|author=John Hudson|publisher=The Atlantic Wire|date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous organizations filed FOIA requests seeking at least a partial release of photographs, videos, and/or DNA test results, including [[The Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], [[CBS News]], [[Judicial Watch]], [[Politico]], [[Fox News]], [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]], and [[NPR]].&lt;ref name="FOIA2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/05/look-whos-foiaing-bin-laden-death-photo/37493/|title=A Look at Who's FOIAing the Bin Laden Death Photo|author=John Hudson|publisher=The Atlantic Wire|date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of filing their FOIA request, The Associated Press said:
{{Quote|text=This information is important for the historical record.  That's our view.|sign=Michael Oreskes, Senior Managing Editor, The Associated Press&lt;ref name="FOIA1"/&gt;}}

On April 26, 2012, a US federal judge decided in the case ''Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Defense, et al'' that the DoD did not need to release any evidence to the public.

==Burial at sea==
Doubts about bin Laden's death were fueled by the U.S. military's disposal of his body at sea, though U.S. officials maintained that the burial was necessary because arrangements could not be made with any country to bury bin Laden within 24 hours, as dictated by [[Islamic funeral|Muslim practice]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Muslim practice has not always been followed by the U.S. in the past. For example, the bodies of [[Uday Hussein]] and [[Qusay Hussein]], sons of [[Saddam Hussein]], were held for 11 days before being released for burial.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/bin-laden-body-buried-sea|title=Bin Laden's body buried at sea|author=Brian Whitaker|publisher=Guardian|location=London|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that instance, however, several Iraqi cities were reluctant to grant a gravesite for Saddam Hussein's sons.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

The decision to bury bin Laden at sea was questioned by terrorists and by some [[9/11]] survivors and the relatives of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fuse.tv/news/articles/?article=0gePetL1FLfCe |title=Muslims furious about Osama sea burial – Daylife |publisher=Fuse.tv |accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-security/2011/0503/Osama-bin-Laden-s-burial-at-sea-critics-range-from-9-11-families-to-militants|title=Osama bin Laden's burial at sea: critics range from 9/11 families to militants.|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Peter Romaniuk of [[John Jay College]] described the burial at sea as a way to forestall further questions. He stated: "Obviously they’re going to be under pressure to show a body or produce further evidence, but this was a way of taking that issue off the table."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; A stated advantage of a burial at sea is that the site is not readily identified or accessed, thus preventing it from becoming a focus of attention or "terrorist shrine".&lt;ref name="ref-41"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/05/osama-bin-laden-body-headed-for-burial-at-sea-officials-say.html | title = Osama Bin Laden Body Headed for Burial at Sea, Officials Say | publisher = ABC News | date = May 2, 2011 | accessdate = May 2, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110502113045/http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/05/osama-bin-laden-body-headed-for-burial-at-sea-officials-say.html | archivedate = May 2, 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
{{see also|Reactions to the death of Osama bin Laden}}

===In Pakistan===
Senior Pakistani officials disseminated the theory that no firefight ever took place, and that whoever the U.S. forces captured, they executed him outside the compound, and took his body away on a helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;Yusufzai, Mushtaq (2011-05-04). [http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/05/04/147782.html Bin Laden’s daughter confirms her father shot dead by US Special Forces in Pakistan]. ''Al-Arabiya''. Retrieved 2011-05-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hamid Gul]], the former head of Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), stated in an interview with [[Cable News Network|CNN]] that he believed bin Laden had died many years ago, and that the official death story given out by the American media was a hoax.&lt;ref name="Gul"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://inthearena.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/05/fmr-pakistani-intel-chief-obama-lying/|title=Former Pakistani intel chief: Obama lying|publisher=CNN|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he thinks the American government knew about bin Laden's death for years, "They must have known that he had died some years ago so they were waiting. They were keeping this story on the ice and they were looking for an appropriate moment and it couldn't be a better moment because President Obama had to fight off his first salvo in his next year's election as he runs for the presidential and for the White House and I think it is a very appropriate time to come out, bring this out of the closet."&lt;ref name="Gul"/&gt;

Yet another scenario was reported in an article in the [[Urdu]] newspaper ''[[Ausaf]]'', which quoted military sources as saying, "Bin Laden has been killed somewhere else. But since the US intends to extend the Afghan war into Pakistan, and accuse Pakistan, and obtain a permit for its military's entry into the country, it has devised the [assassination] scenario."&lt;ref name="Guard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/05/osama-bin-laden-conspiracy-theories|title=Osama bin Laden death: The conspiracy theories|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|first1=Patrick|last1=Kingsley|first2=Sam|last2=Jones|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=May 5, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bashir Qureshi, who lives close to the compound where bin Laden was shot and whose windows were blown out in the raid, was dismissive. "Nobody believes it. We've never seen any Arabs around here, he was not here."&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8489304/Osama-bin-Laden-killed-conspiracy-theories-proliferate-in-wake-of-raid.html|title=Osama bin Laden killed: conspiracy theories proliferate in wake of raid|publisher=Telegraph | location=London|date=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Iran===
A number of Iranians said they believed that bin Laden was working with the U.S. during the entire war on terror. Ismail Kosari, an Iranian MP, said that bin Laden "was just a puppet controlled by the [[Zionist]] regime in order to present a violent image of Islam after the [[September 11 attacks]]", and that his death "reflects the passing of a temporary US pawn, and symbolizes the end of one era and the beginning of another in American policy in the region".&lt;ref name="Iran"/&gt; Another MP, Javad Jahangirzadeh, said he believed that it was the U.S. that had carried out the terrorist attacks, and bin Laden was the main source of help.

===In Turkey===
Berkan Yashar, a Turkish politician, stated that bin Laden died of natural causes on June 26, 2006 and was buried. The Americans, he claims, dug out bin Laden's body and displayed it, falsely telling the world that he was killed in an assault.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/05/19/242057/osama-bin-laden-died-of-natural-causes/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seymour Hersh===
On May 21, 2015, [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer prize winning]] journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] [[Seymour Hersh#Death of Osama bin Laden|published a 10,000 word report]] (later a book -- ''The Killing of Osama bin Laden'') challenging most aspects of the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Operation Neptune Spear|official account of Osama's death]].&lt;ref name="Seymour M. Hersh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KObL-Hersh"&gt;The story was later released as a book. {{cite book|last1=Hersh|first1=Seymour M.|title=The Killing of Osama bin Laden|date=2016|publisher=Verso}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other things, the report claims that the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) had kept bin Laden under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006, and that when the US discovered this Pakistani Army chief [[Pervez Kayani]] and ISI director [[Ahmad Shuja Pasha]] helped the U.S. in killing, not capturing bin Laden.&lt;ref name="hersh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Independent"/&gt; 
Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources stated that the U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a "walk-in", a former ISI officer who came to the US embassy in Islamabad in 2010&lt;ref name="NYRoB-29-9-2016"/&gt; seeking the $25 million reward, and not through tracking a courier. This claim had been previously reported by R.J. Hillhouse and was confirmed afterwards by NBC news.&lt;ref name=hersh /&gt;&lt;ref name="intercepthersh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBChersh"/&gt; The White House denied Hersh's report.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt;

Pakistani journalist [[Ahmed Rashid]] in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' finds the cooperation between the CIA and ISI that Hersh describes "inconceivable", in part because 2011 was "the worst year in US-Pakistan relations since the late 1980s" and "hatred and mistrust" between the CIA and ISI was "acute"—something Hersh does not mention in his article/book.&lt;ref name="NYRoB-29-9-2016"/&gt; Among the incidents that occurred in Pakistan in the months before the killing of bin Laden were the killing of two Pakistanis by [[Raymond Allen Davis incident|Raymond Davis]] a CIA contractor; numerous death threats against the Islamabad CIA station chief after his name was leaked (purportedly by the ISI); the cessation of the issuing of  visas for US officials, following which the entire US consulate in Lahore was shut down and moved to Islamabad over concerns about security;&lt;ref name="NYRoB-29-9-2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rashid|first1=Ahmed|title=Sy Hersh and Osama bin Laden: The Right and the Wrong [complete article behind paywall]|journal=New York Review of Books|date=September 29, 2016|volume=63 |issue=14|pages=30, 32|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/09/29/sy-hersh-osama-bin-laden-right-and-wrong/|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased US anger over the refusal of Pakistan to exert pressure on the Taliban and Haqqani group; the death of 40 Pakistanis including many civilians and later 24 Pakistani soldiers from US drone strikes, the cut off of US supplies to Afghanistan by Pakistan.&lt;ref name="NYRoB-29-9-2016"/&gt; Further adding to the implausibility of Hersh's theory, according to Rashid, is the unlikeliness that either the US would have "calmly accepted"  Pakistan's hiding/protecting bin Laden, or that the dozens of Pakistani military, police, fire and bureaucrats—whose silence/complicity would have been required for a successful conspiracy—would have cooperated with the American incursion. While there was little or no disapproval by the Pakistan public over Bin Laden's long residency in Pakistan, the US attack on the compound of bin Laden was so unpopular that just the failure of the military to detect and go after the US helicopters ignited outrage among the media, the public and the civilian government.&lt;ref name="NYRoB-29-9-2016"/&gt;

Andrew Anthony in ''[[The Guardian]]'' called Hersh's theories "forceful but unconvincing".&lt;ref name="guardian-18-4-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anthony|first1=Andrew|title=The Killing of Osama bin Laden by Seymour M Hersh – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/18/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden-review-seymour-m-hersh-abbottabad-syria-sarin-al-nusra-government|accessdate=6 October 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zach Dorfman]] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Hersh's judgment "mixed, at best".  (Rashid, Anthony, and Dorfman were also skeptical of another theory expounded in Hersh's book—that the [[Ghouta chemical attack]] that killed hundreds of Syrian civilians where instigated not by the Syrian government, but by rebels aided by Turkey working as [[agents provocateurs]], blaming the Syrian government in hopes of forcing the Obama administration to enter the war against the government.&lt;ref name="dorfman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dorfman|first1=Zach|title=Review 'The Killing of Osama Bin Laden' by Seymour Hersh details a grave threat to our democracy|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-0417-killing-bin-laden-20160417-story.html|accessdate=6 October 2016|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Internet===
[[Facebook]] groups formed discussing a rumor, in what has been dubbed the "death hoax".&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwch.com/la-fg-bin-laden-conspiracy-20110503,0,1392179.story|title=Bin Laden's sea burial fuels conspiracy theories|publisher=kwch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some blogs theorised that the raid and killing were faked, in a conspiracy to attempt to deflect questions about [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|President Obama's citizenship]], or to boost Obama's approval ratings and guarantee his popularity during the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

On [[Russia Today]], radio host [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] claimed that bin Laden had been dead for nearly ten years, and that his body had been kept in liquid nitrogen so that it can be used as a propaganda tool at a future politically expedient time. In 2002, he claimed that an anonymous White House source had told him that bin Laden "is frozen, literally frozen and that he would be rolled out in the future at some date".&lt;ref name="ev"/&gt; In a separate interview in 2002, [[Steve Pieczenik]] told Jones that bin Laden had been dead for months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/report-of-bin-ladens-death-spurs-questions-from-conspiracy-theorists/2011/05/02/AF90ZjbF_story.html|title=Report of bin Laden’s death spurs questions from conspiracy theorists|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|first=Emily|last=Wax|date=May 2, 2011|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones also pointed to similar comments made by former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] in 2003, "Yes we have been told by intelligence that they’ve got him, Bush may roll him out but because they exposed that at the election they didn’t do it".&lt;ref name="ev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economicvoice.com/alex-jones-claims-bin-laden-mission-is-a-fake/50019671#axzz1LOEJW1a7|title=Alex Jones claims Bin Laden ‘mission’ is a fake|publisher=Economic Voice|first=Richard|last=Davis|date=May 3, 2011|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones further voiced doubts about the official story of bin Laden's death on his radio show telling his listeners, "My friends, this is a complete and total hoax."&lt;ref name="Travis"/&gt;

The Iranian network [[Press TV]] interviewed [[Webster Tarpley]] and Stephen Lendman, who both doubted the official story of bin Laden's death. Tarpley said he believed bin Laden had been dead for a long time. He also claimed that the public was deceived by a staged announcement.&lt;ref name="PressTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/178338.html|title=US seeks to Balkanize Mideast|publisher=Press TV|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Tarpley and Lendman suggested that Obama's announcement was also an excuse to involve the United States in wars with Pakistan and Middle Eastern nations.&lt;ref name="PressTV"/&gt;

[[Andrew Napolitano]], the host of the [[Fox Business]] program ''[[Freedom Watch]]'', said bin Laden's death could not be verified and insinuated that Obama was using the death of bin Laden to save his "lousy presidency."&lt;ref&gt;CNN: [http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-05/politics/birthers.deathers_1_bin-deathers-radio-host?_s=PM:POLITICS 'Deathers' take over where 'birthers' left off.]  May 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''[[Mediaite]]'' criticized Napolitano's remarks, opining that "such conspiracy talk is ultimately beneath Napolitano and his often enlightened discussions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Matt|title=Judge Napolitano On Bin Laden’s Death: Is Obama ‘Pulling A Fast One’ To Save ‘Lousy Presidency’?|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/judge-napolitano-on-bin-laden-is-obama-pulling-a-fast-one-to-save-lousy-presidency/|newspaper=Mediaite|date=03-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian deputy Leader of the Opposition and MP, [[Thomas Mulcair]], stated in an interview with [[CBC Television]] that "I don't think from what I've heard that those pictures [of bin Laden's body] exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Conspiracy theory: NDP deputy leader Mulcair doubts U.S. has bin Laden photos |author= |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gsjUBZTF0SjtjJdJ_aD4_7gqlbEQ?docId=6758076 |newspaper=[[The Canadian Press]] |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks were picked up by dozens of U.S. media outlets,&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaszor|first=Daniel|title=NDP MP Thomas Mulcair questions Bin Laden pictures|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/05/04/ndp-mp-thomas-mulcair-questions-bin-laden-kill/|newspaper=National Post|date=04-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized by various Canadian politicians.&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOStar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Press|first=The Canadian|title=Conspiracy theory: NDP deputy leader Mulcair doubts U.S. has bin Laden photos|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/985972--conspiracy-theory-ndp-deputy-leader-mulcair-doubts-u-s-has-bin-laden-photos|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=04-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|last=Payton|first=Laura|title=NDP deputy leader doubts bin Laden photos exist|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/05/04/pol-mulcair-osama.html|newspaper=CBC|date=04-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ibbitson|first=John|title=NDP’s deputy leader doubts existence of bin Laden photos|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ndps-deputy-leader-doubts-existence-of-bin-laden-photos/article2010535/|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=04-05-11|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An official statement from the [[Taliban]] stated that the lack of photos or video footage is suspicious, as their own sources close to bin Laden had not confirmed or denied his death, and that "when the Americans killed [[Dadullah|Mullah Dadullah]] (Taliban’s chief military commander) they publicly showed the footage".&lt;ref name="IExpress"&gt;{{cite news |title=Conspiracy Theories |author= |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Conspiracy-Theories/786136/ |newspaper=[[Indian Express]] |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Damara or Farmer's Shed.jpg|thumb|Damara]]
A ''damara'' is a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for a shelter or a shed made of [[bamboo]] and [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]] that was built on ricefields as a protection for farmers from the sun or rain during planting and harvesting seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festivals in Nueva Ecija|url=http://www.mysmartschools.ph/web/gintoanginaani/f%20pagibang%20damara.htm|publisher=Ginto ang Inaani}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers and landlords particularly in the city of San Jose many years ago are building this shelter before the planting season and they demolish ''(ginigiba)'' it after the harvest time as they celebrates together for the bountiful harvest. This is where the word ''Pagibang Damara'' (shed ready to be demolished) was adopted by the people of San Jose City, [[Nueva Ecija]]  as they celebrates and gives thanks for their good harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://punto.com.ph/data/pdf/vol5no83.pdf|newspaper=Punto|date=November 23–24, 2011|title=Trade officials upbeat on Ecija SMEs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today,the people of San Jose City now celebrates together as one big family unlike the older days which the people celebrates separately.

'''''Pawprints of Katrina: Pets Saved and Lessons Learned''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[author]] and [[journalist]] [[Cathy Scott]] that documents the author's experience with an animal welfare group and the rescue and reunions of lost animals with their owners in the [[Gulf region]]. The book, with a foreword by [[actor]] [[Ali MacGraw]], was released in August 2008 on the third anniversary of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

More than 200 stories with photos by [[Clay Myers (photographer)|Clay Myers]] detail rescues, examinations, treatment, reunions, and follow-up care by volunteers.

==Summary==
The book begins on September 11, 2005, at a freeway off-ramp used as a boat launch, with [[New York City Parks Enforcement Patrol|New York City Parks Enforcement]] (Search &amp; Rescue 
Team) Department's Captain Scott Shields, known for the efforts of his search-and-rescue dog, Bear, at the World Trade Center on 9/11.

An excerpt from that chapter describes the moment: "Before we set out on a boat to look for stranded pets, the captain asked us to take a moment to remember those lost on 9/11. There, standing amidst the rubble of Hurricane Katrina with the black water just a few feet from us, we bowed our heads, and not a sound was heard. No cars. No lawnmowers. No birds. No planes. No trains. No voices. Not even the couple of dogs rescued and then tied with leashes to the off-ramp railing, awaiting transport, uttered a sound. It was as if, at that brief but somber point in time, they, too, acknowledged the loss of life. It was a poignant moment, observing those lost in the largest terrorist attack on American soil while we were in the thick of rescuing animals in the wake of the biggest natural disaster in U.S. history. The Crescent City was devoid of life, except for those of us out rescuing that day and, of course, the animals left behind."

A story included in the book about Red, a partially paralyzed [[pit bull|pit-bull terrier]], was covered by [[CNN]]'s [[Anderson Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/27/acd.01.html CNN, "Hurricane Katrina: Six Months Later," February 27, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; A gray cat whose owner drove 10 hours to reunite with his cat and covered in the book was featured by ''[[Dateline NBC]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bestfriends.org/index.cfm?page=specialreports&amp;catid=04061773-BDB9-396E-9001EF6EC01318A4&amp;mode=entry&amp;entry=5C084A02-BDB9-396E-99F051AC6BD8F0CB&amp;stid=2 Best Friends news site, "Dateline in the reuniting business," September 15, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewer Steve Donoghue noted, in ''[[Open Letters Monthly|Open Letters: A Monthly Arts and Literature Review]]'', "...this will certainly be the definitive account of Katrina animal rescue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=extprofile&amp;fid=14280 ''Open Letters Monthly'', "Review: Pawprints of Katrina," June 20, 2008 (scroll down)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pope Joan''', 855–857, (''Ioannes Anglicus'') was, according to popular legend, a woman who reigned as [[pope]] for a few years during the [[Middle Ages]]. Her story first appeared in chronicles in the 13th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe. The story was widely believed for centuries, but most modern scholars regard it as fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boureau |first=  Alain|translator= Lydia G.

X. |date= April 2013 |title= Why Pope Joan? |journal= Catholic Historical Review|publisher= |volume= 99|issue= 2|pages= 219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most versions of her story describe her as a talented and learned woman who disguised herself as a man, often at the behest of a lover. In the most common accounts, due to her abilities, she rose through the church hierarchy and was eventually elected pope. Her sex was revealed when she gave birth during a procession, and she died shortly after, either through murder or natural causes. The accounts state that later church processions avoided this spot, and that the Vatican removed the female pope from its official lists and crafted a ritual to ensure that future popes were male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |pages= 1–2|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Noble|first= Thomas F.

[[Jean de Mailly]]'s chronicle, written around 1250, contains the first mention of an unnamed female pope, and it inspired several more accounts over the next several years. The most popular and influential version is that interpolated into [[Martin of Opava]]'s ''Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum'', later in the 13th century. Martin introduced details that the female pope's birth name was John Anglicus of [[Mainz]], that she reigned in the 9th century, and that she entered the church to follow her lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |pages= 6–7|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was generally accepted as true until the 16th century, when a widespread debate among Catholic and Protestant writers called the story into question; various writers noted the implausibly long gap between Joan's supposed lifetime and her first appearance in texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |page= 14|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Noble|first= Thomas F.

==Legend==
The earliest mention of a female pope appears in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Jean de Mailly]]'s chronicle of [[Metz]], ''Chronica Universalis Mettensis'', written in the early 13th century. In his telling, the female pope is not named, and the events are set in 1099. According to Jean:

{{quote|Query: Concerning a certain Pope or rather female Pope, who is not set down in the [[list of popes]] or Bishops of Rome, because she was a woman who disguised herself as a man and became, by her character and talents, a curial secretary, then a Cardinal and finally Pope. One day, while mounting a horse, she gave birth to a child. Immediately, by Roman justice she was bound by the feet to a horse's tail and dragged and stoned by the people for half a league, and, where she died, there she was buried, and at the place is written: "Petre, Pater Patrum, Papisse Prodito Partum" [Oh Peter, Father of Fathers, Betray the childbearing of the woman Pope]. At the same time, the four-day fast called the "fast of the female Pope" was first established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breverton|first=Terry|authorlink=Terry Breverton|title=Breverton's Phantasmagoria: A Compendium of Monsters, Myths and Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2n5YdVTW0z8C&amp;pg=PT81|year=2011|publisher=Lyons Press|isbn=978-0762770236|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Jean de Mailly|Chronica Universalis Mettensis}}

Jean de Mailly's story was picked up by his fellow Dominican [[Stephen of Bourbon]], who adapted it for his work on the ''Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost''. However, the legend gained its greatest prominence when it appeared in the third ''recension'' (edited revision) of [[Martin of Opava]]'s ''Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum'' later in the 13th century. This version, which may have been by Martin himself, is the first to attach a name to the figure, indicating that she was known as "John Anglicus" or "John of Mainz." It also changes the date from the 11th to the 9th century, indicating that Joan reigned between [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] and [[Pope Benedict III|Benedict III]] in the 850s. According to the ''Chronicon'':

{{quote|John Anglicus, born at Mainz, was Pope for two years, seven months and four days, and died in Rome, after which there was a [[Sede vacante|vacancy in the Papacy]] of one month. It is claimed that this John was a woman, who as a girl had been led to Athens dressed in the clothes of a man by a certain lover of hers. There she became proficient in a diversity of branches of knowledge, until she had no equal, and, afterward in Rome, she taught the liberal arts and had great masters among her students and audience. A high opinion of her life and learning arose in the city; and she was chosen for Pope. While Pope, however, she became pregnant by her companion. Through ignorance of the exact time when the birth was expected, she was delivered of a child while in procession from [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] to the [[Lateran]], in a lane once named Via Sacra (the sacred way) but now known as the "shunned street" between the [[Colosseum]] and [[Basilica of San Clemente|St Clement's church]]. After her death, it is said she was buried in that same place. The Lord Pope always turns aside from the street, and it is believed by many that this is done because of abhorrence of the event. Nor is she placed on the list of the Holy Pontiffs, both because of her female sex and on account of the foulness of the matter.|Martin of Opava|Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum}}

One version of the ''Chronicon'' gives an alternative fate for the female pope. According to this, she did not die immediately after her exposure, but was confined and deposed, after which she did many years of penance. Her son from the affair eventually became [[Bishop of Ostia]], and ordered her entombment in his cathedral when she died.

Other references to the female pope are attributed to earlier writers, though none appears in manuscripts that predate the ''Chronicon''. The one most commonly cited is [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]] (d. 886), a compiler of ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', who was a contemporary of the female Pope by the ''Chronicon'''s dating. However, the story is found in only one unreliable manuscript of Anastasius. This manuscript, in the [[Vatican Library]], bears the relevant passage inserted as a footnote at the bottom of a page. It is out of sequence, and in a different hand, one that dates from after the time of Martin of Opava. This "witness" to the female pope is likely to be based upon Martin's account, and not a possible source for it. The same is true of [[Marianus Scotus]]'s ''Chronicle of the Popes'', a text written in the 11th century. Some of its manuscripts contain a brief mention of a female pope named Johanna (the earliest source to attach to her the female form of the name), but all these manuscripts are later than Martin's work. Earlier manuscripts do not contain the legend.

Some versions of the legend suggest that subsequent popes were subjected to an examination whereby, having sat on a so-called ''sedia stercoraria'' or "dung chair" containing a hole, a cardinal had to reach up and establish that the new pope had [[testicle]]s, before announcing "''Duos habet et bene pendentes''" ("He has two, and they dangle nicely"),&lt;ref name="Clément1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clément|first=Catherine|title=Opera: The Undoing of Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dc4HeHS3ulMC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1999|publisher=U of Minnesota P|isbn=978-0-8166-3526-9|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "''habet''" ("he has them") for short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leroy|first=Fernand|title=Histoire de naître: de l'enfantement primitif à l'accouchement médicalisé|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aqgvIsStVsC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2001|publisher=De Boeck Supérieur|isbn=978-2-8041-3817-2|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were associated legends as well. In the 1290s, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Robert of Uzès]] recounted a vision in which he saw the seat "where, it is said, the pope is proved to be a man". Pope Joan has been associated with marvelous happenings. [[Petrarch]] (1304&amp;ndash;74) wrote in his ''Chronica de le Vite de Pontefici et Imperadori Romani'' that after Pope Joan had been revealed as a woman:

{{quote|... in Brescia it rained blood for three days and nights. In France there appeared marvelous locusts, which had six wings and very powerful teeth. They flew miraculously through the air, and all drowned in the British Sea. The golden bodies were rejected by the waves of the sea and corrupted the air, so that a great many people died.|Petrarch|Chronica de le Vite de Pontefici et Imperadori Romani}}

However, the attribution of this work to Petrarch may be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronica delle vite de pontefici et imperatori romani|url=http://www.franklin.library.upenn.edu/record.html?id=FRANKLIN_3544172|website=Franklin: Penn Libraries Catalog|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=24 January 2015|quote=The attribution to Petrarch is doubtful.

[[Image:La Papessa.jpg|thumb|upright|An untitled [[The High Priestess|popess]] on the ''Rosenwald Sheet'' of uncut [[Tarot]] woodcuts. Early 16th-century. Now in [[National Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] ]]
From the mid-13th century onward, the legend was widely disseminated and believed. Joan was used as an ''[[exemplum]]'' in [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] preaching. [[Bartolomeo Platina]], the scholar who was prefect of the Vatican Library, wrote his ''Vitæ Pontificum Platinæ historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX'' in 1479 at the behest of his patron, [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The book contains the following account of the female Pope:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pope John VIII: John, of English extraction, was born at Mentz ([[Mainz]]) and is said to have arrived at popedom by evil art; for disguising herself like a man, whereas she was a woman, she went when young with her paramour, a learned man, to Athens, and made such progress in learning under the professors there that, coming to Rome, she met with few that could equal, much less go beyond her, even in the knowledge of the scriptures; and by her learned and ingenious readings and disputations, she acquired so great respect and authority that upon the death of [[Pope Leo IV]] (as Martin says) by common consent she was chosen pope in his room. As she was going to the Lateran Church between the [[Colosseum|Colossean Theatre]] (so called from [[Nero]]'s Colossus) and St. Clement's her travail came upon her, and she died upon the place, having sat two years, one month, and four days, and was buried there without any pomp. This story is vulgarly told, but by very uncertain and obscure authors, and therefore I have related it barely and in short, lest I should seem obstinate and pertinacious if I had admitted what is so generally talked. I had better mistake with the rest of the world, though it be certain, that what I have related may be thought not altogether incredible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Woodcut illustration of Pope Joan - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pope Joan giving birth. Woodcut from a German translation by Heinrich Steinhöwel of Giovanni Boccaccio's ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', printed by Johannes Zainer at Ulm ca. 1474 ([[British Museum]])]]
References to the female Pope abound in the later [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]]. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] wrote about her in ''[[De mulieribus claris|De Mulieribus Claris]]'' (1353).&lt;ref&gt;Ch. 99: "De Ioannae Anglica Papa;" it begins succinctly "Ioannes esto Vir nomine videbature, sexu tamen fœmina fuit."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adam of Usk]] (1404) gives her a name, Agnes, and furthermore mentions a statue in Rome that is said to be of her. This statue had never been mentioned by any earlier writer anywhere; presumably it was an actual statue that came to be taken to be of the female pope. A late-14th-century edition of the ''Mirabilia Urbis Romae'', a guidebook for pilgrims to Rome, tells readers that the female Pope's remains are buried at St. Peter's. It was around this time that a long series of busts of past Popes was made for the [[Siena Cathedral|Duomo of Siena]], which included one of the female pope, named as "Johannes VIII, Foemina de Anglia" and included between Leo IV and Benedict III.

At his trial in 1415, [[Jan Hus]] argued that the Church does not necessarily need a pope, because, during the pontificate of "Pope Agnes" (as he also called her), it got on quite well. Hus's opponents at this trial insisted that his argument proved no such thing about the independence of the Church, but they did not dispute that there had been a female pope at all.

==During the Reformation==
In 1587, [[Florimond de Raemond]], a magistrate in the [[parlement]] de Bordeaux and an [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], published his first attempt to deconstruct the legend, ''Erreur Populaire de la Papesse Jeanne'' (also subsequently published under the title ''L'Anti-Papesse''). The tract applied humanist techniques of textual criticism to the Pope Joan legend, with the broader intent of supplying sound historical principles to ecclesiastical history, and the legend began to come apart, detail by detail. Raemond's ''Erreur Populaire'' went through successive editions, reaching a fifteenth as late as 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tinsley | first = Barbara Sher |date=Autumn 1987 | title = Pope Joan Polemic in Early Modern France: The Use and Disabuse of Myth | journal = Sixteenth Century Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–98 | issn = 0361-0160 | doi=10.2307/2540724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1601, [[Pope Clement VIII]] declared the legend of the female pope to be untrue. The famous bust of her, inscribed ''Johannes VIII, Femina ex Anglia,'' which had been carved for the series of papal figures in the [[Siena Cathedral|Duomo di Siena]] about 1400 and was noted by travelers, was either destroyed or recarved and relabeled, replaced by a male figure, that of [[Pope Zachary]].&lt;ref name="ShePope"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stanford | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Stanford | title = The She-Pope: a quest for the truth behind the mystery of Pope Joan | year = 1999 | publisher = Arrow | isbn = 978-0-7493-2067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of Pope Joan was "effectively demolished" by [[David Blondel]], a mid-17th century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] historian, who suggested that Pope Joan's tale may have originated in a satire against [[Pope John XI]], who died in his early 20s.&lt;ref name="ODP"/&gt; Blondel, through detailed analysis of the claims and suggested timings, argued that no such events could have happened.&lt;ref name="ODP"/&gt;

The 16th-century Italian historian [[Onofrio Panvinio]], commenting on one of [[Bartolomeo Platina]]'s works that refer to Pope Joan, theorized that the story of Pope Joan may have originated from tales of [[Pope John XII]]; John reportedly had many mistresses, including one called Joan, who was very influential in Rome during his pontificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 4|last= McClintock |first= John |author2=James Strong |year= 1882 |publisher= Harper|location= |isbn= |page= 980|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lX4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA980&amp;lpg=PA980#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  Biography: or, Third division of "The English encyclopedia"|last= Knight |first= Charles |year= 1867|publisher= Bradbury, Evans &amp; Co.|location= |isbn= |page= 633|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0MNPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT218&amp;lpg=RA1-PT218&amp;dq=pope+Joan&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Reformation]], various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writers took up the Pope Joan legend in their anti-Catholic writings, and the Catholics responded with their own polemic.  According to [[Pierre Gustave Brunet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/lapapessejeanne01brungoog|title=La Papesse Jeanne: Étude Historique et Littéraire|author=Pierre Gustave Brunet|editor=Gay|editor2=Doucé|location=Brussels|year=1880|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Various authors, in the 16th and 17th centuries, occupied themselves with Pope Joan, but it was from the point of view of the polemic engaged in between the partisans of Lutheran or Calvinist reform and the apologists of Catholicism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An English writer, Alexander Cooke, wrote a book entitled ''Pope Joane: A Dialogue between a Protestant and a Papist'', which purported to prove the existence of Pope Joan by reference to Catholic traditions.&lt;ref name=Rustici&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuuJCOq0mSMC&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England|last1=Rustici |first1=Craig M.|publisher=University of Michigan Press|date=2006|page=43|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was republished in 1675 as ''A Present for a Papist: Or the Life and Death of Pope Joan, Plainly Proving Out of the Printed Copies, and Manscriptes of Popish Writers and Others, That a Woman called Joan, Was Really Pope of Rome, and Was There Deliver'd of a Bastard Son in the Open Street as She Went in Solemn Procession''.&lt;ref name=Rustici/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A present for a papist: or, The history of the life of pope Joan|date=1740|publisher=Olive Payne|location=Cornhill, London|pages=1–88|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJgHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book gives an account of Pope Joan giving birth to a son in plain view of all those around, accompanied by a detailed engraving showing a rather surprised looking baby peeking out from under the Pope's robes. Even in the 19th century, authors such as Ewaldus Kist and [[Karl Hase]] discussed the story as a real occurrence. However, other Protestant writers, such as [[David Blondel]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], rejected the story.

==Modern analysis and critique==
[[File:Bonifacio Bembo.jpg|thumbnail|The [[The High Priestess|Popess tarot card]] from the [[Visconti-Sforza]] tarot deck, c. 1450]]

Most modern scholars dismiss Pope Joan as a medieval [[legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/pope.htm | title = The lady was a pope: A bestseller revives the outlandish tale of Joan | first = Lewis | last = Lord | date = 24 July 2000 | work = U.S. News Online | publisher = [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5oQsXy9eD?url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/pope.htm | archivedate = 23 March 2010 | accessdate = 2010-03-22 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Britain's preeminent historians dismisses the myth with a logical assessment of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, John Julius. Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy. 2011. ‘Pope Joan’ Chapter VI, pp. 63–70. {{ISBN|978-0-679-60499-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford Dictionary of Popes''&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kelly | first = J.N.D. | title = Oxford Dictionary of Popes | year = 2005 | origyear = 1988 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=0-19-861433-0 | pages=331–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; declares that there is "no contemporary evidence for a female Pope at any of the dates suggested for her reign", but nonetheless acknowledges that Pope Joan's legend was widely believed for centuries, even by Catholics.

The 1910 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' elaborated on the historical timeline problem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Between Leo IV and Benedict III, where Martinus Polonus places her, she cannot be inserted, because Leo IV died 17 July 855, and immediately after his death Benedict III was elected by the clergy and people of Rome; but, owing to the setting up of an [[Antipope]], in the person of the deposed Cardinal Anastasius, he was not consecrated until 29 September. Coins exist which bear both the image of Benedict III and of Emperor [[Lothair I|Lothair]], who died 28 September 855; therefore Benedict must have been recognized as pope before the last-mentioned date. On 7 October 855, Benedict III issued a charter for the Abbey of Corvey. [[Hincmar]], Archbishop of Reims, informed Nicholas I that a messenger whom he had sent to Leo IV learned on his way of the death of this Pope, and therefore handed his petition to Benedict III, who decided it (Hincmar, ep. xl in P.L., CXXXVI, 85). All these witnesses prove the correctness of the dates given in the lives of Leo IV and Benedict III, and there was no [[interregnum]] between these two Popes, so that at this place there is no room for the alleged Popess.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08407a.htm | title = Popess Joan | first = J.P. | last = Kirsch | year = 1910| work = The Catholic Encyclopedia | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | location = New York | accessdate = 2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has also been noted that enemies of the papacy in the 9th century make no mention of a female pope. For example, [[Photios I of Constantinople]], who became [[Patriarch]] in 858 and was deposed by [[Pope Nicholas I]] in 863, was an enemy of the pope. He vehemently asserted his own authority as patriarch over that of the pope in Rome, and would have made the most of any scandal of that time regarding the papacy; but he never mentions the story once in any of his voluminous writings. Indeed, at one point he mentions "Leo and Benedict, successively great priests of the Roman Church".&lt;ref name="pardoe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pardoe | first = Rosemary and Darroll | title = The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan. The First Complete Documentation of the Facts behind the Legend | url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/PopeJoanHome.html | accessdate = 2010-03-22 |date=August 1988 | publisher = Crucible | isbn = 978-1-85274-013-9 | chapter=Chapter 3: 'Did Joan exist?' | chapterurl = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/PopeJoan3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosemary and Darroll Pardoe, authors of ''The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan'', theorize that if a female pope did exist, a more plausible time frame is 1086 and 1108, when there were several antipopes; during this time the reign of the legitimate popes [[Pope Victor III|Victor III]], [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], and [[Pope Paschal II|Paschal II]] was not always established in [[Rome]], since the city was occupied by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and later sacked by the [[Normans]].&lt;ref name="pardoe"/&gt; This also agrees with the earliest known version of the legend, by [[Jean de Mailly]], as he places the story in the year 1099. De Mailly's "account" was acknowledged by his companion [[Stephen of Bourbon]].

[[Peter Stanford]], a British writer and former editor of ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'', concluded in ''The Legend of Pope Joan: In Search of the Truth'' (2000) "Weighing all th[e] evidence, I am convinced that Pope Joan was an historical figure, though perhaps not all the details about her that have been passed on down the centuries are true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legend of Pope Joan|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8050-3910-8|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanford's work has been criticised as "credulous" by one mainstream historian.&lt;ref&gt;"The Medieval Popes", by Vincent DeMarco, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=oneTAgAAQBAJ ''Misconceptions about the Middle Ages''] ed. Stephen Harris, Bryon L. Grigsby; [[Routledge]], 18 Feb 2008, p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=oneTAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=peter%20stanford%20pope%20joan&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 68]&lt;/ref&gt;
Against the lack of historical evidence to her existence, the question remains as to why the Pope Joan story has been popular and widely believed. [[Philip Jenkins]] in ''[[The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice]]'' suggests that the periodic revival of what he calls this "anti-papal legend" has more to do with [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] wishful thinking than historical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Philip | authorlink = Philip Jenkins | title = The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = 17 April 2003 | page = 89 | isbn = 0-19-515480-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sede stercoraria'', the throne with a hole in the seat, now at [[St. John Lateran]] (the formal residence of the popes and center of Catholicism), is to be considered. This and other toilet-like chairs were used in the consecration of [[Pope Pascal II]] in 1099.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boureau|first1=Alain|title=La Papesse Jeanne|date=1988|publisher=Aubier|location=Paris|page=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one is still in the [[Vatican Museums]], another at the [[Musée du Louvre]]. The reason for the configuration of the chair is disputed. It has been speculated that they originally were Roman [[bidet]]s or imperial birthing stools, which because of their age and imperial links were used in ceremonies by Popes intent on highlighting their own imperial claims (as they did also with their [[Latin]] title, ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'').&lt;ref name="Norwich 2011 63"/&gt;

Alain Boureau quotes the humanist Jacopo d'Angelo de Scarparia, who visited Rome in 1406 for the enthronement of [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]]. The pope sat briefly on two "pierced chairs" at the Lateran: "... the vulgar tell the insane fable that he is touched to verify that he is indeed a man", a sign that this corollary of the Pope Joan legend was still current in the Roman street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boureau|first1=Alain|title=La Papesse Jeanne|date=1988|publisher=Aubier|location=Paris|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval popes, from the 13th century onward, did indeed avoid the direct route between the Lateran and St Peter's, as Martin of Opava claimed. However, there is no evidence that this practice dated back any earlier. The origin of the practice is uncertain, but it is quite likely that it was maintained because of widespread belief in the Joan legend, and it was thought genuinely to date back to that period.

Although some medieval writers referred to the female pope as "John VIII", a genuine [[Pope John VIII]] reigned between 872 and 882. Due to the Dark Ages' lack of records, confusion often reigns in the evaluation of events.

A problem sometimes connected to the Pope Joan legend is the fact that there is no [[Pope John XX]] in any list. It is said this reflects a renumbering of the popes to exclude Joan from history. Historians have known since [[Louis Duchesne]]'s critical edition of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' that the "renumbering" was actually due to a misunderstanding in the textual transmission of the official papal lists. In the course of the 11th century, in the time after [[Pope John XIX|John XIX]], the entry for [[Pope John XIV|John XIV]] had been misread as referring to two different popes of this name. These two popes then came to be distinguished as ''Iohannes XIV'' and ''Iohannes XIV bis'' ("John XIV the second").

The existence of a second Pope John XIV was widely accepted in the 13th century, hence the numbering of Popes John XV through XIX was regarded as being erroneous. When Petrus Hispanus was elected pope in 1276 and chose the papal name John, he decided to correct this error by skipping the number XX. He numbered himself [[Pope John XXI|John XXI]], thus acknowledging the presumed existence of John XIV "bis" in the 10th century.

In 2018, an analysis of several silver coins from the 850s A.D, done by researchers from [[Flinders University]] indicated that they were inscribed with the name Johannes Anglicus. From the dating of the 850s, when there were missing papal records, led the researchers to believe the legend was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/female-pope-0010644|title= Researchers Find Physical Evidence for the Existence of a Female Pope|last= Whelan|first= Ed|date= 3 September 2018|website= www.ancient-origins.net|publisher= Ancient Origins|access-date= 24 October 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.livescience.com/63598-female-pope-joan-medieval-coins.html|title= Legends of a Medieval Female Pope May Tell the Truth|last= Choi|first= Charles Q.|date= 16 September 2018|website= www.livescience.com|publisher= Purch|access-date= 24 October 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Pope Joan has remained a popular subject for fictional works. Plays include [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]'s ''Päpstin Johanna'' (1813), a fragment by [[Bertolt Brecht]] (in ''Werke''. Bd. 10), and a [[monodrama]], ''Pausin Johanna'' by Cees van der Pluijm (1996).

The Greek author [[Emmanuel Rhoides]]' 1866 novel, ''The Papess Joanne'', was admired by [[Mark Twain]] and [[Alfred Jarry]] and freely translated by [[Lawrence Durrell]] as ''The Curious History of Pope Joan'' (1954). The American [[Donna Woolfolk Cross]]'s 1996 [[historical romance]], ''[[Pope Joan (novel)|Pope Joan]]'', was recently made into a German musical as well as the movie described below. Other novels include Wilhelm Smets's ''Das Mährchen von der Päpstin Johanna auf’s Neue erörtert'' (1829), [[Marjorie Bowen]]'s ''Black Magic'' (1909), Ludwig Gorm's ''Päpstin Johanna'' (1912),  Yves Bichet's ''La Papesse Jeanne'' (2005), and Hugo N. Gerstl's ''Scribe: The Story of the Only Female Pope'' (2005).

There have been two films based on the story of Pope Joan: ''[[Pope Joan (1972 film)|Pope Joan]]'' (1972), directed by [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]], was titled ''The Devil's Imposter'' in the US. In 2009, it was recut to include more of [[John Briley]]'s original script and released as ''She... who would be Pope''. Also in 2009, another film with the title ''[[Pope Joan (2009 film)|Pope Joan]]'' was released, this one a German, British, Italian and Spanish production directed by [[Sönke Wortmann]] and produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]], based on Cross's novel.

The play ''[[Top Girls]]'' by [[Caryl Churchill]] featured Pope Joan as a character, who was invited to a restaurant along with other historically important women in the past by a modern-day woman, Marlene, to discuss the restriction of [[feminism]] in the past.

Pope Joan is referenced in the video game ''[[Persona 5]]'', as the inspiration for Johanna, one of the titular personas (cognitive beings used by humans to battle demons) belonging to Makoto Niijima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Persona® 5|url=http://atlus.com/persona5/characters-makoto.html|website=atlus.com|publisher=ATLUS|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maldives]] [[national day]] (also known as '''Qaumee''' (national) '''Dhuvas''' (day) in [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]), is an important day, as it is observed to celebrate the victory of [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam]] over the Portuguese occupation in the year 1573. According to the [[Islamic calendar]], the National Day of Maldives falls on the 1st of [[Rabi'_al-awwal|Rabee ul Awwal]], the third month of [[Islamic Calendar|Hijri]] (Islamic) calendar.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Home Affairs "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.homeaffairs.gov.mv/?page_id=106|title= Maldives National Day |publisher=|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6Edu1VlK9|archivedate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1558, Portuguese colonial power attacked Maldives and killed the Sultan of the Maldives and established its colonial rule.

{{nihongo|'''''Kuroshio Maru'''''|黒潮丸|lead=yes}} was a [[tank ship|tanker]] that was built in 1938 for Japanese owners. She was chartered by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during [[World War II]]: the ship was sunk in January 1945 at [[Kaohsiung|Takao]], [[Formosa]] by American aircraft. Salvaged in 1946, she was allocated as a [[prize (law)|war prize]] to China and renamed '''''Yung Hao''''' ({{zh|c=容浩}}), but was forced to remain at [[Hong Kong]] by the British. She was requisitioned by the [[Admiralty]] during the [[Korean War]] and allocated to the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]]. She was to have been named '''RFA ''Surf Pilot''''' but due to her poor condition she did not serve in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She served as '''''Surf Pilot''''', a tender to {{HMS|Terror|shore establishment|6}} until 1958 and was subsequently scuttled off [[Pulau Aur]], [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] in 1960.

==Description==
''Kuroshio Maru'' was built as a tanker for carrying oil in bulk and assessed at {{GRT|10,519}} and {{NRT|6,206}}. Her length was {{convert|504.7|ft|m}}, breadth {{convert|66.0|ft|m}} and depth {{convert|37.5|ft|m}},&lt;ref name=LR1939&gt;{{cite book|title=Lloyd's Register, Steamers and Motorships|date=1939|publisher=[[Lloyd's Register]]|location=London|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=39b0505.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2015|quote=Listed as ''Kurosio Maru'' (sic)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was reported to displace 10,383 tons.&lt;ref name=CF/&gt; The geared [[steam turbine#Marine propulsion|steam turbine]] engine, placed [[aft]], was manufactured by [[IHI Corporation|Ishikawajima Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co]], [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=LR1939 /&gt; It was capable of propelling her at {{convert|17|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

==History==
===Japanese service===
''Kuroshio Maru'' was built as [[yard number]] 264 by Harima Zōsen KK, [[Aioi, Hyōgo|Aioi]], [[Harima]] for Chigai Kisen KK, [[Tokyo]]. She was laid down on 21 January 1938 and was launched on 8 December. Completion was on 28 February 1939.&lt;ref name=CF/&gt; Her port of registry was Tokyo. The Japanese Official Number 45674 and [[Code Letters]] JZPM were allocated.&lt;ref name=LR1939 /&gt; She was operated by Tyugai Kaiun KK between Japan and the west coast of the United States.&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/Kuroshio_t.htm |title=KUROSHIO MARU: Tabular Record of Movement |publisher=Combined Fleet |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 1941, ''Kuroshio Maru'' was requisitioned on [[bareboat charter|charter]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. She entered to Tama Zosen shipyard on 22 August for conversion work. On 5 September she was registered as a naval auxiliary ship. The conversion work was completed on 17 October and she was subsequently assigned to the [[Combined Fleet]]. She sailed from [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] on 30 November for [[Pulau Condore Island]]. ''Kuroshio Maru'' arrived at Sasebo on 16 February 1942 and was then sent to [[Kobe]] for a refit by [[Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation]].&lt;ref name=RFA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalrfa.org/rfa-surf-pilot |title="RFA" Surf Pilot |publisher=RFA Historical Organization |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charter to the Imperial Japanese Navy was terminated on 1 May and ''Kuroshio Maru'' was returned to her owners.  She was chartered afresh on 23 May by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and refitted by Harima Zosensho KK.&lt;ref name=CF/&gt; She sailed between Japan, China, [[Formosa]], [[French Indochina]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], the Philippines and [[Singapore]] over the next few years carrying oil, troops and military cargo.&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt; On 10 September 1942 she collided with the [[coastal trading vessel|coaster]] {{SS|Zuiun Maru||2}}, which sank.&lt;ref name=CF/&gt; ''Kuroshio Maru'' was bombed and sunk on 9 January 1945 at [[Kaohsiung|Takao]], Formosa by aircraft of [[Task Force 38]], [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=KM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?133738 |title=Kuroshio Maru (+1945) |publisher=Wrecksite |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was removed from the Imperial Japanese Army list on 1 March.&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt;

===Post-war history===
In 1946, the ship was refloated and allocated as a [[prize (law)|war prize]] to China and placed under the ownership of [[China Merchants Steam Navigation Company]], [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt; In 1947 she was sent to the [[Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock]] for repairs. New electrical systems and radar were fitted and her accommodation was rebuilt.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt; During that time the ship was transferred to the China Tanker Co Ltd, [[Hong Kong]] and re-entered service in 1950 as ''Yung Hao'' with China still claiming ownership.&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt; Her crew defected to the Communist Chinese side in March 1951.&lt;ref name=Times110451&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Seizure of tanker in Hongkong |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=11 April 1951 |page_number=3 |issue=51972 |column=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 1951, an emergency [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet meeting]] was held by the [[Hong Kong Government]] to discuss the ship. Four days later, the [[Chinese Government]] reiterated its claim to the ship, stating that it held the [[British Government]] liable for any interference in the free movement of the vessel, leading to the lodging of a claim for compensation.&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt; ''Yung Hao'' was requisitioned by the British [[Admiralty]] on 7 April to prevent her falling into Chinese hands on orders from [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]] Sir [[Alexander Grantham]].&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST100451&gt;{{cite news |title=Crew ordered off ship |newspaper=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |page=3 |date=10 April 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the issue was raised in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. Answering a question from [[Ernest Kinghorn]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] [[Jim Griffiths|James Griffiths]] stated that the requisitioning had been done in consultation with the British Government and was to prevent [[North Korea]]n and Chinese forces using the ship.&lt;ref name=Hansard&gt;{{ukhansard | house=HC | date=13 April 1951 | vol=486 | cc=111W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was discovered that ''Yung Hao'''s engine had been disabled, so she was towed from Hong Kong to Singapore, with a [[Royal Navy]] crew for the voyage, by {{ship|RFA|Salvalour|A494|6}}, escorted by {{HMS|Charity|R29|6}}, arriving on 24 April 1951.&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=TM140451&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27010892 |title=Communist ship for Singapore |newspaper=The Mercury |location=Hobart, Tasmania |page=4 |date=14 April 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese called her seizure an act of [[piracy]], robbery and open provocation.&lt;ref name=NMHMA170451&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article139503411 |title=Hongkong Accused Of Piracy |newspaper=Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners' Advocate |location=Newcastle, New South Wales |page=1 |date=17 April 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NC190451&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158793437 |title=Protest on seizure of Red vessel |newspaper=The Newcastle Sun |location=Newcastle, New South Wales |page=5 |date=19 April 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; China requisitioned all property belonging to the British-owned [[Asiatic Petroleum Company]] in retaliation for the seizure of the ship.&lt;ref name=E010551&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52813877 |title=China grabs oil company |newspaper=Examiner |location=Launceston, Tasmania |page=6 |date=1 May 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention was that she would be repaired and sailed to the United Kingdom for use by the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] as RFA ''Surf Pilot''. However, she was discovered to be in a poor condition and was instead used as a [[tender (boat)|tender]] to the shore establishment {{HMS|Terror|shore establishment|6}} at Singapore. Her future was "under consideration" in 1958, and in March 1960 she was scuttled off [[Pulau Aur]], [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] ({{coord|2|33|N|104|40|E|display=inline, title}}).&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=CF/&gt;&lt;ref name=GS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gs-diving.com/latest-news/aur-tanker-indentified/ |title=Aur Tanker Identified |publisher=GS Diving |date=13 November 2011 |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 1987, the British and Chinese governments reached an agreement over the vessel and the requisitioning and a treaty to this effect was later signed in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name=RFA/&gt;

'''The Summer Slaughter Tour''' is an annual [[heavy metal music]] tour held every year since 2007. It originated in North America in 2007 and has toured in Canada in 2008, Europe in 2008, and Australia and New Zealand in 2009. Billed as "The Most Extreme Tour of the Year", Summer Slaughter has earned a reputation as being one of the few summer tours to cater exclusively to fans of extreme forms of metal music. Starting in 2012, Summer Slaughter began to add more progressive metal bands to their lineups, seeing [[Between the Buried and Me]] co-headline with [[Cannibal Corpse]]. [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]] also played Summer Slaughter 2012, and came back during Summer Slaughter 2013, along with progressive metal bands [[Animals as Leaders]] and [[The Ocean (band)|The Ocean]]. The focus on progressive metal that year was controversial and many people were "into" heavy metal music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kzsc.org/blog/2013/04/16/a-critical-analysis-of-the-summer-slaughter-butthurt/ |title=A Critical Analysis of the Summer Slaughter Butthurt - Music News &amp;#124; KZSC Santa Cruz |website=Kzsc.org |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and death metal focused lineups returned in 2014, seeing [[Morbid Angel]] headline.

==Fan-voted openers==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
In 2011, the Summer Slaughter Tour offered their fans the opportunity to vote on who would open the tour. The choices for 2011 were [[Dawn Of Ashes]], [[Revocation]], [[Neuraxis]], [[Conducting From The Grave]], [[The Contortionist]], [[Within The Ruins]], [[Volumes (band)|Volumes]], [[Augury]], [[7 Horns 7 Eyes]], [[Rings of Saturn (band)|Rings of Saturn]], and Struc/tures. [[Within the Ruins]] ultimately received the most votes and thus won the opening spot for the tour. That same year [[Conducting From The Grave]], The Contortionist, Rings of Saturn, Volumes, and Struc/tures all toured together on what was billed as the Slaughter Survivors Tour. This tour also included [[Scale the Summit]], who had not been part of the voting.

For the 2012 edition of the Summer Slaughter Tour, fans were once again given the chance to vote on the opening act. The choices for 2012 were [[Aegaeon (band)|Aegaeon]], [[Battlecross]], [[Cerebral Bore]], [[Enfold Darkness]], [[Fallujah (band)|Fallujah]], [[Fit For An Autopsy]], [[Hour of Penance]], [[I Declare War (band)|I Declare War]], [[Pathology (band)|Pathology]], and [[Vildhjarta]]. The opening slot for the 2012 tour went to Cerebral Bore, and Pathology, Enfold Darkness, Fallujah, Fit For An Autopsy, and Aegaeon also joined the 2012 Slaughter Survivors Tour.

The choices for the 2013 tour were [[Abiotic (band)|Abiotic]], [[As They Burn]], [[Dark Sermon]], [[Erra (band)|Erra]], Fit For An Autopsy, [[Howl (American band)|Howl]], [[Intervals (band)|Intervals]], [[Into The Flood (band)|Into the Flood]], [[King Conquer]], [[Last Chance To Reason]], [[My Bitter End]], [[Nekrogoblikon (band)|Nekrogoblikon]], Rings Of Saturn, [[Syqem]], [[Soreption]], [[Today I Caught the Plague]], and [[Thy Art Is Murder]]. Thy Art Is Murder was the chosen band. However, since they were nearly tied with Rings of Saturn by a few votes, the organizers decided to put both Rings of Saturn and Thy Art Is Murder on the bill. [[Vektor (band)|Vektor]] were put on the initial ballot by their record label without the band's knowledge or approval, and upon discovering this, had to withdraw due to incompatible scheduling. The Slaughter Survivors Tour didn't occur in 2013, and didn't return in 2014 either.

Summer Slaughter 2014 didn't see the tour offer an opportunity to vote on openers; rather, the opener was chosen by Headbang for the Highway showcase, and Boreworm was selected. [[Mayhem Festival]] also uses the Headbang for the Highway showcase to select bands.

{{Campaignbox War of the Two Peters}}

The '''War of the Two Peters''' ({{lang-es|La Guerra de los Dos Pedros}}, {{lang-ca|Guerra dels dos Peres}}) was fought from 1356 to 1375 between the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]. Its name refers to the rulers of the countries, [[Peter of Castile]] and [[Peter IV of Aragon]]. One historian has written that "all of the centuries-old lessons of border fighting were used as two evenly matched opponents dueled across frontiers that could change hands with lightning speed."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Donald J. Kagay, "The Defense of the Crown of Aragon during the War of the Two Pedros (1356-1366)," ''The Journal of Military History'', Volume 71, Number 1, January 2007, pp. 11-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Jaume Mateu - Peter IV the Ceremonious - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Peter IV, King of Aragon by Gonçal Peris Sarrià &amp; Jaume Mateu (1427)]]
[[File:Estatua de Pedro I el Cruel (M.A.N.) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Alabaster]] sculpture of Peter the Cruel, from 1504]]
At the beginning of the fourteenth century, Castile was suffering from unrest caused by its [[Castilian Civil War|civil war]], which was fought between the local and allied forces of the reigning king, Peter of Castile, and his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trastámara]] over the right to the crown.

Peter IV of Aragon supported Henry of Trastámara. Henry was, in turn, supported by the French commander [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] and his "free companies" of troops. Peter of Castile was supported by the [[Kingdom of England|English]]. The War of the Two Peters can thus be considered an extension of the wider [[Hundred Years' War]] as well as the [[Castilian Civil War]].

Peter of Castile sought to claim the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], which included parts of [[Murcia]], [[Elche]], [[Alicante]], and [[Orihuela]]. Peter of Aragon wished to dominate the [[Mediterranean]] in opposition to Castile and Castile's ally [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpz.es/ifc/libros/Ubietoweb/fichasubieto/65.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609194413/http://www.dpz.es/ifc/libros/Ubietoweb/fichasubieto/65.html |date=June 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A naval incident between the two powers had already caused tension: [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[galley]]s, armed by Mossèn Francesc de Perellós, who had [[letters of marque]] from the Aragonese king, aided France against England, and also managed to capture two [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] ships at [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]]. Genoa was an ally of Castile. Peter of Castile, leading the Castilian fleet, caught up to Perellós at [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]] but was unable to capture him.

==War==
===1356–1363===
The war lasted from 1356 to 1375, prolonged because Peter of Castile lost his throne to Henry of Trastámara. The war primarily took place on the border between Castile and Aragon, namely Aragonese border towns such as [[Teruel]], which fell to the Castilians.

In 1357, Castile penetrated Aragon and conquered [[Tarazona]] on March 9; on May 8, they arranged a temporary truce.

At the beginning of 1361, the Castilians conquered the fortresses of [[Verdejo]], [[Torrijos, Spain|Torrijos]], [[Alhama de Murcia|Alhama]], and other places. However, the ''peace of Terrer'' (sometimes called the ''peace of Deza'') was negotiated on May 18, 1361, in which all conquered places and castles were returned to their original lords. [[Bernardo de Cabrera]], ambassador of the Aragonese king, negotiated the peace. Peter IV married his daughter [[Constance of Aragon, Queen of Sicily|Constance]] to [[Frederick III the Simple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uv.es/~ivorra/Historia/SXIV/1360.htm |title=1360 - 1365 |publisher=Uv.es |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1362, Peter of Castile met with [[Charles II of Navarre]] at [[Soria]], and mutual aid was promised. Peter also contracted an alliance with [[Edward III of England]] and Edward's son [[Edward, the Black Prince|The Black Prince]].

With these negotiations complete, the Castilian king invaded Aragonese territory without officially declaring war, and the conflict commenced again.  The Aragonese king was at [[Perpignan]] without troops, and thus caught off guard.  The Castilians took the castles of [[Arize]], [[Atece]], Terrer, [[Moros, Spain|Moros]], [[Cetina, Spain|Cetina]], and [[Alhama de Murcia|Alhama]]. Peter of Castile was unable to take [[Calatayud]], even though he attacked it with all types of [[siege machines]]. Without taking his conquests any further, he returned to [[Seville]].

In 1363 Castile continued the war against Aragon, and again occupied Tarazona. Peter of Castile received reinforcements from [[Portugal]] and [[Navarre]]. Meanwhile, the Aragonese king negotiated a treaty with [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and a secret treaty with Henry II of Castile. Pedro of Castile then conquered [[Cariñena (DO)|Cariñena]], [[Teruel]], [[Segorbe]], [[Morvedre]], [[Almenara, Castellón|Almenara]], [[Xiva de Bunyol|Xiva]], and [[Bunyol]].

The [[Holy See|papal]] [[nuncio]] [[Jean de la Grange]] arranged the ''peace of [[Morvedre]]'' ([[Sagunt]]) (July 2, 1363) between the two kings.  The peace was not ratified, however, and hostilities continued. The Castilians penetrated the [[Kingdom of Valencia]] in 1363, and conquered [[Alicante]], [[Caudete]], [[Elda]], [[Gandia]], and other places.

===1363–1369===
From 1365 to 1369 Peter of Castile was preoccupied with maintaining his position on the Castilian throne against Henry of Trastámara.

The [[Castilian Civil War]] began in 1366 and Peter of Castile was dethroned. He was assailed by his illegitimate brother [[Henry of Trastámara]] at the head of a host of soldiers of fortune, including [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] and [[Hugh Calveley]]. Peter abandoned the kingdom without daring to give battle, after retreating several times (first from [[Burgos]], then from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and finally from [[Seville]]) in the face of the oncoming armies. Peter fled with his treasury to Portugal, where he was coldly received by his uncle, King [[Peter I of Portugal]], and thence to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in northern Spain, where he ordered the murder of Suero, the archbishop of [[Santiago de Compostela|Santiago]], and the [[Dean (religion)|dean]], Perálvarez. 

Peter of Castile was overthrown in 1369.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=6624&amp;voz_id_origen=13418 |title=Guerra de los dos Pedros (1356-1369) - Página de voz - Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa OnLine |publisher=Enciclopedia-aragonesa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion of Valencia===
The [[Kingdom of Granada]] supported Peter of Castile in the War of the Two Peters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deremilitari.org/REVIEWS/Villalon_100YW.htm |title=Villalon and Kagay - The Hundred Years War: A Wider Focus |publisher=Deremilitari.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Castilian troops and their [[Al-Andalus|Moorish allies]] invaded southern [[kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], which suffered low-level ravaging and political instability. The Castilians unsuccessfully laid siege to [[Orihuela]] in 1364.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/13247 |title=If these walls could talk |publisher=Thinkspain.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the war==
The war finally ended with the Peace of Almazán, in 1375, leaving no clear victor. Castile recovered ''[[comarca]]s'' that had passed under Aragonese rule, such as the lordship of [[Molina de Aragón|Molina]]. A marriage was contracted between [[Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Castile|Eleanor of Aragon]], daughter of Peter IV of Aragon, and [[John I of Castile]], the successor of Henry II of Castile.

The misery of the war was compounded by the [[Black Death]] and other natural disasters, such as [[drought]] and a plague of [[locust]]s.  These events ruined the Aragonese economy, leading to a decrease of the country’s population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv3.cat/historiesdecatalunya/personatges/per102337822.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221020638/http://www.tv3.cat/historiesdecatalunya/personatges/per102337822.htm |date=December 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[cathedral of Tarazona]] was destroyed during the war and not rebuilt until much later.

However, the war is believed to have led to the establishment of administrative and military forces that would ultimately result in a unified Castile and Aragon in the next century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Annual '''[[wine]] [[festivals]]''' celebrate [[viticulture]] and usually occur after the harvest of the grapes which, in the northern hemisphere, generally falls at the end of September and runs until well into October or later. They are common in most [[wine regions]] around the world and are to be considered in the tradition of other harvest festivals.

The Egyptian god [[Osiris]] was dedicated to wine, but the oldest historically documented wine festivals can be traced back to the Greek celebrations for their wine god [[Dionysos]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. The typical ingredients of a wine festival include wine drinking, grape pressing, regional foods, music and, in many areas, religious ritual.

==In culture==
[[Image:Colline novaresi.jpg|thumb|right|Fields of grape vines]]

The [[grape]], and the extraction of its juice to produce wine, is more than a flavorsome food or drink. Both grapes and wine have immense cultural significance in many cultures, and often religious significance too.
