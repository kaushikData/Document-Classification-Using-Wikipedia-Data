'''21''' ('''twenty-one''') is the [[natural number]] following [[20 (number)|20]] and preceding [[22 (number)|22]].

==In mathematics==
21 is:

* a [[Blum integer]], since it is a semiprime with both its prime factors being [[Gaussian prime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A016105|title=Sloane's A016105 : Blum integers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Fibonacci number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000045|title=Sloane's A000045 : Fibonacci numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Harshad number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005349|title=Sloane's A005349 : Niven (or Harshad) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Motzkin number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001006|title=Sloane's A001006 : Motzkin numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[triangular number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000217|title=Sloane's A000217 : Triangular numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an [[octagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000567|title=Sloane's A000567 : Octagonal numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[composite number]], its proper [[divisor]]s being [[1 (number)|1]], [[3 (number)|3]] and [[7 (number)|7]].
* the sum of the first six natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21), making it a triangular number.
* the sum of the divisors of the first 5 [[positive integers]].
* the smallest non-trivial example of a Fibonacci number whose digits are Fibonacci numbers and whose digit sum is also a Fibonacci number.
* a [[repdigit]] in base 4 (111&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).
* the smallest natural number that is not close to a power of 2, 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where the range of closeness is ±''n''.
* the smallest number of differently sized squares needed to [[squaring the square|square the square]].&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Bouwkamp, and A. J. W. Duijvestijn, "Catalogue of Simple Perfect Squared Squares of Orders 21 Through 25." Eindhoven University of Technology, Nov. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the largest ''n'' with this property: for any positive integers ''a'',''b'' such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''n'', at least one of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt; is a terminating decimal. See a brief proof below.
{{Collapse top|title=|width=80%}}
Note that a necessary condition for ''n'' is that for any ''a'' coprime to ''n'', ''a'' and ''n'' - ''a'' must satisfy the condition above, therefore at least one of ''a'' and ''n'' - ''a'' must only have factor 2 and 5.

Let &lt;math&gt;A(n)&lt;/math&gt; donate the quantity of the numbers smaller than ''n'' that only have factor 2 and 5 and that are coprime to ''n'', we instantly have &lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi(n)}{2} &lt; A(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

We can easily see that for sufficiently large ''n'', &lt;math&gt;A(n) \sim \frac{\log_2(n) \log_5(n)}{2} = \frac{\ln^{2}(n)}{2 \ln(2) \ln(5)}&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) \sim \frac {n} {e^\gamma\; \ln \ln n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A(n) = o(\varphi(n))&lt;/math&gt; as ''n'' goes to infinity, thus &lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi(n)}{2} &lt; A(n)&lt;/math&gt; fails to hold for sufficiently large ''n''.

In fact, For every ''n'' &gt; 2, we have
:&lt;math&gt;A(n) &lt; 1 + \log_2(n) + \frac{3 \log_5(n)}{2} + \frac{\log_2(n) \log_5(n)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) &gt; \frac {n} {e^\gamma\; \log \log n + \frac {3} {\log \log n}} &lt;/math&gt;
so &lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi(n)}{2} &lt; A(n)&lt;/math&gt; fails to hold when ''n'' &gt; 273 (actually, when ''n'' &gt; 33).

Just check a few numbers to see that ''n'' = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 21.

21 appears in the [[Padovan sequence]], preceded by the terms 9, 12, 16 (it is the sum of the first two of these).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000931|title=Sloane's A000931 : Padovan sequence|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''44''' ('''forty-four''')  is the [[natural number]] following [[43 (number)|43]] and preceding [[45 (number)|45]].

== In mathematics ==

'''Forty-four''' is a [[tribonacci number]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000073|title=Sloane's A000073 : Tribonacci numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[octahedral number]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005900|title=Sloane's A005900 : Octahedral numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of [[derangement]]s of 5 items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000166|title=Sloane's A000166 : Subfactorial or rencontres numbers, or derangements|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the greatest prime factor of 44&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 1937 is 149 and thus more than 44 twice, 44 is a [[Størmer number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005528|title=Sloane's A005528 : Størmer numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given [[Euler's totient function]], φ(44) = 20 and φ(69) = 44.

44 is a [[repdigit]]

In [[decimal]] notation (base 10), 44 is a [[palindromic number]] and a [[happy number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A007770|title=Sloane's A007770 : Happy numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This number is also the [[magic constant]] of [[Eight queens puzzle|n-Queens Problem]] for n = 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber= A006003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

65 is the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two distinct positive squares in two ways, 65 = 8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

It appears in the [[Padovan sequence]], preceded by the terms 28, 37, 49 (it is the sum of the first two of these).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000931|title=Sloane's A000931 : Padovan sequence|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only 65 known [[Euler's idoneal numbers]].

65 = 1&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

65 is the length of the hypotenuse of 4 different [[Pythagorean triple|Pythagorean triangles]], the lowest number to have more than 2:   65&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 16&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 63&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 33&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 56&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 39&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 52&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 25&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 60&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The first two are "primitive", and 65 is the lowest number to be the largest side of more than one such triple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3132">In mathematics, '''algebraic cobordism''' is an analogue of [[complex cobordism]] for smooth [[quasi-projective scheme]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. It was introduced by {{harvs|txt|first1=Marc|last1=Levine|author1-link=Marc Levine (mathematician) |first2=Fabien |last2= Morel |author2-link=Fabien Morel|year1= 2001|year2=2001b}}.

An oriented [[cohomology theory]] on the category of smooth quasi-projective schemes '''Sm''' over a field ''k'' consists of a [[contravariant functor]] ''A''* from '''Sm''' to commutative [[graded ring]]s, together with [[Pushforward (homology)|push-forward map]]s ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; whenever ''f'':''Y''→''X'' has relative dimension ''d'' for some ''d''. These maps have to satisfy various conditions similar to those satisfied by complex cobordism. In particular they  are "oriented", which means roughly that they behave well on [[vector bundle]]s; this is closely related to the condition that a [[generalized cohomology theory]] has a [[complex orientation]].

Over a field of characteristic 0, algebraic cobordism is the universal oriented cohomology theory  for smooth varieties. In other words there is a unique morphism of oriented cohomology theories from algebraic cobordism to any other oriented cohomology theory.

{{harvtxt|Levine|2002}} and {{harvtxt|Levine|Morel|2007}} give surveys of algebraic cobordism.

The algebraic cobordism ring of [[generalized flag variety|generalized flag varieties]] has been computed by {{harvtxt|Hornbostel|Kiritchenko|2011}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14707">'''Autonomous agency theory''' ('''AAT''') is a [[viable system theory]] (VST) which models autonomous social [[complex adaptive systems]].  It can be used to model the relationship between an agency and its environment(s), and these may include other interactive agencies. The nature of that interaction is determined by both the agency's external and internal attributes and constraints. Internal attributes may include immanent dynamic "self" processes that drive agency change.

== History ==
[[Stafford Beer]] coined the term ''viable systems'' in the 1950s, and developed it within his [[management cybernetics]] theories. He designed his [[viable system model]] as a diagnostic tool for organisational [[pathologies]] (conditions of social ill-health). This model involves a system concerned with operations and their direct management, and a [[meta-system]] that "observes" the system and controls it. Beer's work refers to [[Maturana]]'s concept of [[autopoiesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Maturana H.R., Varela F.J (1979). Autopoiesis and Cognition. Boston: Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science&lt;/ref&gt; which explains why living systems actually live. However, Beer did not make general use the concept in his modelling process.

In the 1980s Eric Schwarz developed an alternative model from the principles of complexity science. This not only embraces the ideas of autopoiesis (self-production), but also autogenesis (self-creation) which responds to a proposition that living systems also need to learn to maintain their viability. Self-production and self-creation are both networks of processes that connect an operational system of agency structure from which behaviour arises, an observing relational meta-system, this itself observed by an "existential" meta-meta-system. As such Schwarz' VST constitutes a different paradigm from that of Beer.

AAT is a development of Schwarz' paradigm through the addition of propositions setting it in a knowledge context.&lt;ref&gt;Yolles, M.I., 2006, Organizations as Complex Systems: an introduction to knowledge cybernetics, Information Age Publishing, Inc., Greenwich, CT, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

AAT is a generic modelling approach that has the capacity to anticipate future potentials for behaviour. Such [[anticipation]] occurs because behaviour in the agency as a living system is "[[Structure determination|structure determined]]",&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, H.R., 1988, Reality: the search for objectivity or the Quest for a compelling argument. Irish J. Psych. 9:25-82&lt;/ref&gt; where the structure itself of the agency is responsible for that anticipation. This is like anticipating the behaviour of both a tiger or a giraffe when faced with food options. The tiger has a structure that allows it to have speed, strength and sharp inbuilt weapons to kill moving prey, but the giraffe has a structure that allows it to acquire its food in high places in a way the tiger could not duplicate.  Even if a giraffe has the speed to chase prey, it does not have the resources to kill and eat it.
Agency generic [[structure]] is a substructure defined by three systems that are, in general terms, referred to as:
* [[existential]] (pattern of thematic relevance that is the consequence of experience);
* [[noumenal]] (representing the nature of a phenomenal effect subjectively through conceptual relationships)
* [[phenomenal]] (maintaining patterns of context related structural relevance connected with action, and constituting an origin for experience). 
These generic systems are ontologically distinct; their natures being determined by the context in which the autonomous agency exists. The substructure also maintains a superstructure that is constructed through context related propositional theory. Superstructural theory may include attributes of collective identity, cognition, emotion, personality; purpose and intention; self-reference, self-awareness, self-reflection, self-regulation and self-organisation. The substructural systems are connected by autopoietic and autogenetic networks of processes as shown in Figure 1 below.

 [[File:Figure 5 Living System formulated as a set of ontologically independent but interconnected substructural subsystems.png|Figure 1 - Living System formulated as a set of ontologically independent but interconnected substructural subsystems]]

The terminology becomes simplified when the existential system is taken to be culture, and it is recognised that Piaget's&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1950). The Psychology of Intelligence, Harcourt and Brace, New York&lt;/ref&gt; concept of [[Intelligence|operative intelligence]] is equivalent to autopoiesis, and his figurative intelligence to autogenesis. The noumenal system now becomes a personality system, and autonomous agency theory now becomes [[cultural agency theory]] (CAT).&lt;ref&gt;G.A.N.D. blog http://blog.gand.biz/2016/10/cultural-agency-theory-autonomous-agency-theory/&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally used to model plural situations like organisations or a nation states, when its personality system is taken to have normative characteristics (see also [[Normative personality]]),&lt;ref&gt;Yolles, M.I., Fink, G., Frieden, R. (2012). Organisations as Emergent Normative Personalities: part 2, predicting the unpredictable, Kybernetes, 41(7/8)1014-1050)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fink, G. Yolles, M. (2014) The Affective Agency: An Agency with Feelings and Emotions, http://ssrn.com/abstract=2463283&lt;/ref&gt; that is, driven by cultural norms as represented in Figure 2 below. This has developed further through [[mindset agency theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yolles|first1=M.I.|last2=Fink|first2=G.|title=Personality, pathology and mindsets: part 1 – Agency, Personality and Mindscapes|journal=Kybernetes|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=92–112|doi=10.1108/k-01-2013-0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling agency behaviour to be anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Yolles, M.I, Fink, G. (2014). Personality, pathology and mindsets: part 1 – Agency, Personality and Mindscapes, Kybernetes, 43(1) 92-112&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Figure 6 The Basic Substructural Schema for CAT.png|Figure 2 - Substructural Schema]]

A feature of this modelling approach is that the properties of the cultural system act as an [[attractor]] for the agency as a whole, providing constraint for the properties of its personality and operative systems. This attraction ceases with cultural [[instability]], when CAT reduces to [[Instrumentalis|instrumentality]] with no capacity to learn. Another feature is driven by possibilities of [[recursion]] permitted using Beer's proposition of viability law: every viable system contains and is contained in a viable system.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, S., (1959), Cybernetics and Management, English U. Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural agency theory ==

Cultural agency theory (CAT) as a development of AAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gua|first1=K.|last2=Yolles|first2=M.|last3=Fink|first3=G.|last4=Iles|first4=P.|title=The Changing Organisation: Agency Theory in a Cross-cultural Context|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is principally used to model organisational contexts that have at least potentially stable cultures. The existential system of AAT becomes the cultural system, the figurative system become a normative personality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yolles|first1=M.|title=Migrating Personality Theories Part 1: Creating Agentic Trait Psychology?|journal=Kybernetes|date=2009|volume=38|issue=6|pages=897–924|doi=10.1108/03684920910973153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the operative system now represents the organisational structure that facilitates and constrains behaviour.

The cultural system may be regarded as a (second order) "observer" of the instrumental couple that occurs between the normative personality and the operative system. The function of this couple is to manifest figurative attributes of the personality, like goals or ideology, operatively consequently influencing behaviour. This instrumental nature occurs through feedforward processes such that personality attributes can be processed for operative action. Where there are issues in doing this, feedback processes create imperatives for adjustment. This is like having a goal, and finding that it cannot be implemented, thereby having to reconsider the goal. This instrumental couple can also be seen in terms of the operative system and its first order "observing" system, the normative personality. So, while personality is a first order "observer" of CAT's operative system, it is ultimately directed by its second order cultural "observer" system.

A development of this has occurred using trait theory from psychology. Unlike other trait theories of personality, this adopts epistemic traits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yolles|first1=M.|last2=Fink|first2=G.|title=An Introduction to Mindset Agency Theory|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237074847_An_Introduction_to_Mindset_Agency_Theory|website=ResearchGate|publisher=Organisational Coherence and Trajectory Project|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that centres on values, an approach that tends to be more stable (since basic values tend to be stable) in terms of personality testing and retesting, than other approaches that use (for instance) agency preferences (like [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator|Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]]) that may change between test and retest. This trait theory for the normative personality is called mindset agency theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gua|first1=K.|last2=Yolles|first2=M.|last3=Fink|first3=G.|last4=Iles|first4=P.|title=The Changing Organisation: Agency Theory in a Cross-cultural Context|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a development of Maruyama's Mindscape Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mauyama|first1=M.|title=Mindscapes and Science Theories|journal=Current Anthropology|date=1980|volume=21|issue=5|pages=589–608|doi=10.1086/202539|url=http://heterogenistics.org/articles/Maruyama-Mindscapes_and_science_theories.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive process by which personality is represented through epistemic trait functions (called types), can be explained through both instrumental and epistemic [[rationality]],{{fact|date=January 2017}} where instrumental rationality (also referred to as utilitarian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Von Glasersfeld|first1=Ernest|title=Aspects of Radical Constructivism|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/constructivism/EvG/papers/191.pdf|website=Radical Constructivism|publisher=University of Vienna, Austria|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related to the expectations about the behaviour of other human beings or objects in the environment given some cognitive basis for those expectation) is independent of, if constrained by, epistemic rationality (related to the formation of beliefs in an unbiased manner, normally set in terms of believable propositions: due to their being strongly supported by evidence, as opposed to being agnostic towards propositions that are unsupported by "sufficient" evidence, whatever this means). Applications of CAT could be found in social, political and economical sciences, for instance recend studies analyzed Donald Trump and Theresa May personalities.

== Higher orders of autonomous agency ==
Stafford Beer's (1979) [[viable system model]] is a well-known diagnostic model that comes out of his [[management cybernetics]] paradigm. Related to this is the idea of first order and [[second order cybernetics]]. Cybernetics is concerned with [[Feedforward (management)|feedforward]] and [[feedback]] processes, and first order cybernetics is concerned with this relationship between the system and its environment. Second order cybernetics is concerned with the relationship between the system and its internal meta-system (that some refer to as "the observer" of the system). Von Foerster&lt;ref&gt;Von Foerster, H (1975). The Cybernetics of Cybernetics, Biological Computer Laboratory, Champaign/Urbana, republished (1995), Future Systems Inc., Minneaopolis, MN&lt;/ref&gt; has referred to second order cybernetics as the "cybernetics of cybernetics". While attempts to explore higher orders of cybernetics have been made,&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, P.J., Cohen, B. (2000). Doing time: the emergence of irreversibility, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 901(1):13–25&lt;/ref&gt; no development into a general theory of higher cybernetic orders has emerged from this paradigm. 
In contrast, extending the principles of autonomous agency theory, a generic model has been formulated for the generation of higher cybernetic orders,&lt;ref&gt;Yolles, M.I, Fink, G., 2015, A general theory of generic modelling and paradigm shifts: part 2 - cybernetic orders, Kybernetes, 44(2)299-310&lt;/ref&gt; developed using the concepts of recursion and incursion as proposed by Dubois.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois D. M. (1996), Introduction to the Symposium on General Methods for Modelling and Control, Proceedings of the 14th International Congress on Cybernetics, Namur, 1995, Published by the International Association of Cybernetics, pp. 383-388)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dubois, D, 2000, Review of Incursive Hyperincursive and Anticipatory Systems - Foundation of Anticipation in Electromagnetism, CASYS'99 - Third International Conference. Edited by Dubois, D.M. Published by The American Institute of Physics, AIP Conference Proceedings 517, pp3-30&lt;/ref&gt; The model is reflective, for instance, of processes of [[knowledge]] creation for community [[learning]]&lt;ref&gt;Conceição, S.C., Baldor, M.J., Desnoyers, C.A. (2009). Factors Influencing Individual Construction of Knowledge in an Online Community of Learning and Inquiry Using Concept Maps. Lupion Torres, P (Ed.) Handbook of Research on Collaborative Learning Using Concept Mapping (pp.100-117). Information Science Reference: Hershey, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[symbolic convergence theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Bormann, E. G. (1996). Symbolic convergence theory and communication in group decision making. In Hirokawa, RY, Scott Poole, M (Ed.), Communication and group decision making, Sage Publications: Thousand Oaks, CA. pp. 2, 81-113&lt;/ref&gt; This nth order theory of cybernetics links with "the cybernetics of cybernetics" by assigning to its second order cybernetic concept [[inferences]] that may arise from any higher order cybernetics that may exist, if unperceived. The network of processes in this general representation of higher cybernetic orders is expressed in terms of orders of autopoiesis, so that for instance autogenesis may be seen as a second order of autopoiesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">'''Benson Mates''' (May 19, 1919 in [[Portland, Oregon]]&amp;nbsp;– May 14, 2009 in [[Berkeley, California]]) was an [[American philosopher]], noted for his work in [[logic]], the history of philosophy, and [[skepticism]].  Mates studied philosophy and mathematics at the University of Oregon, Cornell University, and the University of California at Berkeley.  Some of his teachers included [[J. Barkley Rosser]], [[Harold Cherniss]], and [[Alfred Tarski]].  From 1948 until his retirement in 1989, he was a professor of philosophy at Berkeley.  He remained Professor Emeritus of philosophy at University of California at Berkeley until his death.

Mates's 1948 dissertation, "On the Logic of the Old Stoa", formed the basis for his 1953 book ''Stoic Logic'', of which [[Peter Geach]] wrote, "Stoic logic is a difficult subject [...] Dr. Mates's monograph is a strenuous and successful effort to overcome these difficulties."&lt;ref&gt;P.T. Geach, ''The Philosophical Review'', 64:1 (January 1955), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mates's 1965 book, ''Elementary Logic'', remains a widely used introductory textbook in symbolic logic.  His 1986 study of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] is also highly regarded.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Cover and Glenn Hartz, ''Noûs'', 24:1 (March 1990), p. 169: "Mates' book [is] the best work of its kind on Leibniz yet published."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his own philosophical work, Mates defends a stance akin to [[Pyrrhonian skepticism]].  He argues that the major problems of philosophy (such as the [[liar paradox]], the existence of an external world, and [[free will]]) are intelligible and non-trivial yet utterly defy solution.&lt;ref&gt;B. Mates, ''Skeptical Essays'' (University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 3&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the classical Pyrrhonists, however, Mates finds that skeptical arguments lead to unsatisfactory perplexity rather than [[ataraxia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3587">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bourbaki–Witt theorem''' in [[order theory]], named after [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] and [[Ernst Witt]], is a basic [[fixed point theorem]] for [[partially ordered set]]s. It states that if ''X'' is a non-empty [[chain complete]] [[poset]], and 

: &lt;math&gt;f : X \to X&lt;/math&gt; 

such that 

: &lt;math&gt;f (x) \geq x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,&lt;/math&gt;

then ''f'' has a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]. Such a function ''f'' is called ''inflationary'' or ''progressive''.

== Special case of a finite poset ==

If the poset ''X'' is finite then the statement of the theorem has a clear interpretation that leads to the proof. The sequence of successive iterates, 

: &lt;math&gt; x_{n+1}=f(x_n), n=0,1,2,\ldots, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is any element of ''X'', is monotone increasing. By the finiteness of ''X'', it stabilizes:

: &lt;math&gt; x_n=x_{\infty},&lt;/math&gt; for ''n'' sufficiently large. 

It follows that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; is a fixed point of ''f''.

== Proof of the theorem ==

Pick some &lt;math&gt;y \in X&lt;/math&gt;. Define a function ''K'' recursively on the ordinals as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\,K(0) = y&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\,K( \alpha+1 ) = f( K( \alpha ) ).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a [[limit ordinal]], then by construction 

:&lt;math&gt;\{ K( \alpha ) \ : \ \alpha &lt; \beta \}&lt;/math&gt; 

is a chain in ''X''. Define 

:&lt;math&gt;K( \beta ) = \sup \{ K( \alpha ) \ : \ \alpha &lt; \beta \}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is now an increasing function from the ordinals into ''X''. It cannot be strictly increasing, as if it were we would have an [[injective function]] from the ordinals into a set, violating [[Hartogs number|Hartogs' lemma]]. Therefore the function must be eventually constant, so for some 

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha , \ \ K( \alpha+1 ) = K ( \alpha ); &lt;/math&gt;

that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\,f( K( \alpha ) ) = K ( \alpha ).&lt;/math&gt;

So letting 

:&lt;math&gt;\,x = K ( \alpha ),&lt;/math&gt; 

we have our desired fixed point. [[Q.E.D.]]

==Applications==
The Bourbaki–Witt theorem has various important applications. One of the most common is in the proof that the [[axiom of choice]] implies [[Zorn's lemma]]. We first prove it for the case where ''X'' is chain complete and has no maximal element. Let ''g'' be a choice function on 

:&lt;math&gt;P(X) - \{ \varnothing \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Define a function 

:&lt;math&gt;f : X \to X&lt;/math&gt; 

by 

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = g( \{ y \ : \ y &gt; x \} ).&lt;/math&gt;

This is allowed as, by assumption, the set is non-empty. Then ''f''(''x'') &gt; ''x'', so ''f'' is an inflationary function with no fixed point, contradicting the theorem.

This special case of Zorn's lemma is then used to prove the [[Hausdorff maximality principle]], that every poset has a maximal chain, which is easily seen to be equivalent to Zorn's Lemma.

Bourbaki–Witt has other applications.  In particular in [[computer science]], it is used in the theory of [[computable function]]s.
It is also used to define recursive data types, e.g. linked lists, in [[domain theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4048">A '''cryptographic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-multilinear map''' is a kind of [[multilinear map]], that is, a function &lt;math&gt;e:G_1\times \cdots \times G_n \rightarrow G_T&lt;/math&gt; such that for any integers &lt;math&gt; a_1, \ldots, a_n &lt;/math&gt; and elements &lt;math&gt; g_i \in G_i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e(g_1^{a_1},\ldots,g_n^{a_n})=e(g_1,\ldots,g_n)^{\prod_{i=1}^n a_i}&lt;/math&gt;, and which in addition is efficiently computable and satisfy some security properties. It has several applications on cryptography, as [[key exchange]] protocols, [[ID-based encryption|identity-based encryption]], and [[broadcast encryption]]. There exist constructions of cryptographic 2-multilinear maps, known as bilinear maps,&lt;ref name="paringSurvey" /&gt; however, the problem of constructing such multilinear&lt;ref name="paringSurvey"/&gt; maps for &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; seems much more difficult&lt;ref name="bonehMultilinear" /&gt;   and the security of the proposed candidates is still unclear.&lt;ref name="AlbrechtSite" /&gt;

== Definition ==

=== For ''n'' = 2 ===
In this case, multilinear maps are mostly known as bilinear maps or parings, and they are usually defined as follows:&lt;ref name="KoblitzMenezes2005" /&gt;    Let &lt;math&gt;G_1, G_2&lt;/math&gt; be two additive cyclic groups of prime order &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;G_T&lt;/math&gt; another cyclic group of order &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; written multiplicatively. A pairing is a map: &lt;math&gt; e: G_1 \times G_2 \rightarrow G_T &lt;/math&gt;,  which satisfies the following properties:
; [[Bilinearity]]: &lt;math&gt; \forall a,b \in F_q^*,\ \forall P\in G_1, Q\in G_2:\ e(a P, b Q) = e(P,Q)^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
; [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|Non-degeneracy]]: If &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt; are generators of &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, then &lt;math&gt;e(g_1, g_2)&lt;/math&gt; is a generator of &lt;math&gt;G_T&lt;/math&gt;.
; Computability: There exists an efficient algorithm to compute &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

In addition, for security purposes, the [[discrete logarithm problem]] is required to be hard in both &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== General case (for any ''n'') ===
We say that a map &lt;math&gt;e:G_1\times \cdots \times G_n \rightarrow G_T&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-multilinear map if it satisfies the following properties:
# All &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;G_T&lt;/math&gt; are groups of same order;
# if &lt;math&gt;a_1, \ldots, a_n \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g_1, \ldots, g_n) \in G_1 \times \cdots \times G_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;e(g_1^{a_1},\ldots,g_n^{a_n})=e(g_1,\ldots,g_n)^{\prod_{i=1}^n a_i}&lt;/math&gt;;
# the map is non-degenerate in the sense that if &lt;math&gt;g_1, \ldots, g_n&lt;/math&gt; are generators of &lt;math&gt;G_1, \ldots, G_n&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, then  &lt;math&gt;e(g_1, \ldots, g_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a generator of &lt;math&gt;G_T&lt;/math&gt;
# There exists an efficient algorithm to compute &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

In addition, for security purposes, the [[discrete logarithm problem]] is required to be hard in &lt;math&gt;G_1, \ldots, G_n&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''de Finetti diagram''' is a [[ternary plot]] used in [[population genetics]]. It is named after the [[Italy|Italian]] [[statistics|statistician]] [[Bruno de Finetti]] (1906–1985) and is used to graph the [[genotype frequency|genotype frequencies]] of [[population]]s, where there are two [[allele]]s and the population is [[diploidy|diploid]]. It is based on an [[equilateral triangle]], and [[Viviani's theorem]] concerning any point within the triangle, and the three lines from that point that are perpendicular to the sides of the triangle. The sum of the lengths of the lines is a fixed value, regardless of the position of the point. This value (the sum of the lengths) is set to be 1.

==Applications in genetics==

The de Finetti diagram has been put to extensive use in population genetics by [[A.W.F. Edwards]] in his book ''Foundations of Mathematical Genetics''.  In its simplest form the diagram can be used to show the range of genotype frequencies for which [[Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium]] is satisfied (the curve within the diagram).  [[A.W.F. Edwards]] and [[Chris Cannings]] extended its use to demonstrate the changes that occur in allele frequencies under [[natural selection]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16702">'''Double-precision floating-point format''' is a [[computer number format]], usually occupying 64 bits in computer memory; it represents a wide [[dynamic range]] of numeric values by using a floating radix point.

Floating point is used to represent fractional values, or when a wider range is needed than is provided by [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] (of the same bit width), even if at the cost of precision. Double precision may be chosen when the range or precision of [[single-precision floating-point format|single precision]] would be insufficient.

In the [[IEEE 754-2008]] [[standardization|standard]], the 64-bit base-2 format is officially referred to as '''binary64'''; it was called '''double''' in [[IEEE 754-1985]]. IEEE 754 specifies additional floating-point formats, including 32-bit base-2 ''single precision'' and, more recently, base-10 representations.

One of the first [[programming language]]s to provide single- and double-precision floating-point data types was [[Fortran]]. Before the widespread adoption of IEEE 754-1985, the representation and properties of floating-point data types depended on the [[computer manufacturer]] and computer model, and upon decisions made by programming-language implementers. E.g., [[GW-BASIC]]'s double-precision data type was the [[64-bit MBF]] floating-point format.
{{Floating-point}}

==IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format: binary64==
Double-precision binary floating-point is a commonly used format on PCs, due to its wider range over single-precision floating point, in spite of its performance and bandwidth cost. As with [[Single-precision floating-point format|single-precision]] floating-point format, it lacks precision on integer numbers when compared with an integer format of the same size. It is commonly known simply as ''double''. The IEEE 754 standard specifies a '''binary64''' as having:
* [[Sign bit]]: 1 bit
* [[Exponent]]: 11 bits
* [[Significand]] [[precision (arithmetic)|precision]]: 53 bits (52 explicitly stored)
The sign bit determines the sign of the number (including when this number is zero, which is [[signed zero|signed]]).

The exponent field can be interpreted as either an 11-bit signed integer from −1024 to 1023 ([[2's complement]]) or an 11-bit unsigned integer from 0 to 2047, which is the accepted biased form in the IEEE 754 binary64 definition. If the unsigned integer format is used, the exponent value used in the arithmetic is the exponent shifted by a bias – for the IEEE 754 binary64 case, an exponent value of 1023 represents the actual zero (i.e. for 2&lt;sup&gt;e − 1023&lt;/sup&gt; to be one, e must be 1023). Exponents range from −1022 to +1023 because exponents of −1023 (all 0s) and +1024 (all 1s) are reserved for special numbers.

The 53-bit significand precision gives from 15 to 17 [[Significant figures|significant decimal digits]] precision (2&lt;sup&gt;−53&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1.11&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;). If a decimal string with at most 15 significant digits is converted to IEEE 754 double-precision representation, and then converted back to a decimal string with the same number of digits, the final result should match the original string. If an IEEE 754 double-precision number is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant digits, and then converted back to double-precision representation, the final result must match the original number.&lt;ref name="whyieee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF|title=Lecture Notes on the Status of IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic|author=William Kahan|date=1 October 1997|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208075518/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format is written with the [[significand]] having an implicit integer bit of value 1 (except for special data, see the exponent encoding below).  With the 52 bits of the fraction significand appearing in the memory format, the total precision is therefore 53 bits (approximately 16 decimal digits, 53 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(2) ≈ 15.955).  The bits are laid out as follows:

[[File:IEEE 754 Double Floating Point Format.svg]]

The real value assumed by a given 64-bit double-precision datum with a given [[Exponent bias|biased exponent]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; 
and a 52-bit fraction is
: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^{\text{sign}}(1.b_{51}b_{50}...b_{0})_2 \times 2^{e-1023} &lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^{\text{sign}}\left(1 + \sum_{i=1}^{52} b_{52-i} 2^{-i} \right)\times 2^{e-1023} &lt;/math&gt;

Between 2&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;=4,503,599,627,370,496 and 2&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;=9,007,199,254,740,992 the representable numbers are exactly the integers. For the next range, from 2&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;, everything is multiplied by 2, so the representable numbers are the even ones, etc. Conversely, for the previous range from 2&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;, the spacing is 0.5, etc.

The spacing as a fraction of the numbers in the range from 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; is 2&lt;sup&gt;n−52&lt;/sup&gt;.
The maximum relative rounding error when rounding a number to the nearest representable one (the [[machine epsilon]]) is therefore 2&lt;sup&gt;−53&lt;/sup&gt;.

The 11 bit width of the exponent allows the representation of numbers between 10&lt;sup&gt;−308&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;, with full 15–17 decimal digits precision. By compromising precision, the subnormal representation allows even smaller values up to about 5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−324&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Exponent encoding===
The double-precision binary floating-point exponent is encoded using an [[offset-binary]] representation, with the zero offset being 1023; also known as exponent bias in the IEEE 754 standard. Examples of such representations would be:
{|
|-
|''e''=&lt;code&gt;00000000001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;001&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=1:
|style="width: 0.4em"|
| &lt;math&gt;2^{1-1023}=2^{-1022}&lt;/math&gt;
|(smallest exponent for [[Normal number (computing)|normal numbers]])
|-
|''e''=&lt;code&gt;01111111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;3ff&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=1023:
|
|&lt;math&gt;2^{1023-1023}=2^{0}&lt;/math&gt;
|(zero offset)
|-
|''e''=&lt;code&gt;10000000101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;405&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=1029:
|
|&lt;math&gt;2^{1029-1023}=2^{6}&lt;/math&gt;
|
|-
|''e''=&lt;code&gt;11111111110&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;7fe&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=2046:
|
|&lt;math&gt;2^{2046-1023}=2^{1023}&lt;/math&gt;
|(highest exponent)
|}

The exponents &lt;code&gt;000&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;7ff&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; have a special meaning:
* &lt;code&gt;00000000000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;000&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used to represent a [[signed zero]] (if F=0) and [[Denormal number|subnormals]] (if F≠0); and
* &lt;code&gt;11111111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;7ff&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used to represent [[infinity|∞]] (if F=0) and [[NaN]]s (if F≠0),
where F is the fractional part of the [[significand]]. All bit patterns are valid encoding.

Except for the above exceptions, the entire double-precision number is described by:

&lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\text{sign}} \times 2^{e - 1023} \times 1.\text{fraction}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of [[Denormal number|subnormals]] (''e''=0) the double-precision number is described by:

&lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\text{sign}} \times 2^{1-1023} \times 0.\text{fraction} = (-1)^{\text{sign}} \times 2^{-1022} \times 0.\text{fraction}&lt;/math&gt;

[[NaN#Encoding|Encodings of qNaN and sNaN]] are not completely specified in [[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754]] and depend on the processor. Most processors, such as the [[x86]] family and the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] family processors, use the most significant bit of the significand field to indicate a quiet NaN; this is what is recommended by IEEE 754. The [[PA-RISC]] processors use the bit to indicate a signaling NaN.

By default, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rounds down, instead of up like [[single precision]], because of the odd number of bits in the significand.

In more detail:
 Given the hexadecimal representation 3FD5 5555 5555 5555&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;,
   Sign = 0
   Exponent = 3FD&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = 1021
   Exponent Bias = 1023 (constant value; see above)
   Fraction = 5 5555 5555 5555&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;
   Value = 2&lt;sup&gt;(Exponent − Exponent Bias)&lt;/sup&gt; × 1.Fraction – Note that Fraction must not be converted to decimal here
         = 2&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; × (15 5555 5555 5555&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;−52&lt;/sup&gt;)
         = 2&lt;sup&gt;−54&lt;/sup&gt; × 15 5555 5555 5555&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;
         = 0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125

===Execution speed with double-precision arithmetic===
Using double-precision floating-point variables and mathematical functions (e.g., sin, cos, atan2, log, exp and sqrt) are slower than working with their single precision counterparts. One area of computing where this is a particular issue is for parallel code running on GPUs. For example, when using [[Nvidia|NVIDIA]]'s [[CUDA]] platform, calculations with double precision take approximately 2 times longer to complete compared to those done using [[Single-precision floating-point format|single precision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-titan-v-110-teraflops,36085.html|title=Nvidia’s New Titan V Pushes 110 Teraflops From A Single Chip|date=2017-12-08|work=Tom's Hardware|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
Doubles are implemented in many programming languages in different ways such as the following. On processors with only dynamic precision, such as [[x86]] without [[SSE2]] (or when SSE2 is not used, for compatibility purpose) and with extended precision used by default, software may have difficulties to fulfill some requirements.

===C and C++===
C and C++ offer a wide variety of [[C data types#Basic types|arithmetic types]]. Double precision is not required by the standards (except by the optional annex F of [[C99]], covering IEEE 754 arithmetic), but on most systems, the &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; type corresponds to double precision. However, on 32-bit x86 with extended precision by default, some compilers may not conform to the C standard and/or the arithmetic may suffer from [[Rounding#Double rounding|double rounding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=323|title=Bug 323 – optimized code gives strange floating point results|author=|date=|website=gcc.gnu.org|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430012629/https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=323|archivedate=30 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common Lisp===
[[Common Lisp]] provides the types SHORT-FLOAT, SINGLE-FLOAT, DOUBLE-FLOAT and LONG-FLOAT.  Most implementations provide SINGLE-FLOATs and DOUBLE-FLOATs with the other types appropriate synonyms. [[Common Lisp]] provides exceptions for catching floating-point underflows and overflows, and the inexact floating-point exception, as per IEEE 754.  No infinities and NaNs are described in the ANSI standard, however, several implementations do provide these as extensions.

===JavaScript===
As specified by the [[ECMAScript]] standard, all arithmetic in [[JavaScript (programming language)|JavaScript]] shall be done using double-precision floating-point arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=ECMA-262 ECMAScript Language Specification | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262%205th%20edition%20December%202009.pdf | edition=5th | publisher=Ecma International | at=p. 29, §8.5 ''The Number Type'' | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313145717/http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262%205th%20edition%20December%202009.pdf | archivedate=2012-03-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- "shall be" instead of "is" because this may not be the case in practice on processors with only dynamic precision. For instance, Mozilla's Javascript engine had such a problem in the past: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=264912 --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], the '''Eguchi–Hanson space''' is a non-compact, [[self-dual]], asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) metric on the [[cotangent bundle]] of the 2-sphere ''T''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[holonomy group]] of this 4-real-dimensional [[manifold]] is SU(2), as it is for a Calabi-Yau   [[K3 surface]]. While the metric is generally attributed to the physicists Eguchi and Hanson,&lt;ref name="eguchi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eguchi|first=Tohru|author2=Hanson, Andrew J.|title=Selfdual solutions to Euclidean gravity|journal=Annals of Physics|year=1979|volume=120|pages=82–105|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-2213.pdf|bibcode = 1979AnPhy.120...82E |doi = 10.1016/0003-4916(79)90282-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was actually discovered independently by the mathematician Eugenio Calabi&lt;ref name="calabi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calabi|first=Eugenio|title=Métriques kählériennes et fibrés holomorphes|journal=Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure|year=1979|volume=Quatrième Série, 12|issue=2|pages=269–294|url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=ASENS_1979_4_12_2_269_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  around the same time.

The Eguchi-Hanson metric  has  [[Ricci tensor]] equal to zero, making it  a solution to the vacuum [[Einstein's equations|Einstein equations]] of general relativity, albeit with Riemannian rather than Lorentzian [[metric signature]]. It may be regarded as a [[resolution of singularities|resolution]] of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; singularity according to the [[ADE classification]] which is the singularity at the fixed point of the ''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[orbifold]] where the ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group inverts the signs of both complex coordinates in&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Aside from its inherent importance in pure [[geometry]], the space is important in [[string theory]]. Certain types of [[K3 surface]]s can be approximated as a combination of several Eguchi–Hanson metrics.

The Eguchi–Hanson metric is the prototypical example of a  [[gravitational instanton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1327">An '''enumerator''' is a [[Turing machine]] that lists, possibly with repetitions, elements of some set ''S'', which it is said to enumerate. A set enumerated by some enumerator is said to be [[recursively enumerable]].

==Formal definition==
An enumerator &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is usually represented as a 2-tape [[Turing machine]]. One working tape, and one print tape. It can be defined by a 7-tuple, following the notation of a [[Turing machine]]:
&lt;math&gt;E = \langle Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{print}, q_{reject}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of ''states''.
* &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of the ''output / print alphabet''
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of the ''working tape alphabet''
* &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the transition function. &lt;math&gt;\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\} \times \Sigma_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;q_0 \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the start state
* &lt;math&gt;q_{print} \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the print state.

'''Financial correlations''' measure the relationship between the changes of two or more financial variables over time. For example, the prices of [[equity (finance)|equity stocks]] and fixed interest bonds often move in opposite directions: when investors sell stocks, they often use the proceeds to buy bonds and vice versa. In this case, stock and bond prices are negatively correlated.

Financial correlations play a key role in modern [[finance]]. Under the [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM; a model recognised by a [[Nobel prize in economics|Nobel prize]]), an increase in diversification increases the return/risk ratio. Measures of risk include [[value at risk]], [[expected shortfall]], and portfolio return [[variance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Faff|first2=R.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Enhancing mean–variance portfolio selection by modeling distributional asymmetries|journal=Journal of Economics and Business|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.01.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148619516000047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial correlation and the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient==
There are several statistical measures of the degree of financial correlations. The [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] is sometimes applied to finance correlations. However, the limitations of Pearson correlation approach in finance are evident. First, linear dependencies as assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient do not appear often in finance. Second, linear correlation measures are only natural dependence measures if the joint distribution of the variables is [[elliptical distribution|elliptical]]. However, only few financial distributions such as the multivariate normal distribution and the multivariate student-t distribution are special cases of elliptical distributions, for which the linear correlation measure can be meaningfully interpreted. Third, a zero Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient does not necessarily mean independence, because only the two first moments are considered. For example, &lt;math&gt;Y = X^2 &lt;/math&gt; (''y''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0) will lead to Pearson correlation coefficient of zero, which is arguably misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | ssrn=1769302 |title = A Comparative Analysis or Correlation Approaches in Finance| last = Albanese | first = C. |author2=D. Li |author3=E. Lobachevskiy |author4=G. Meissner | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Pearson approach is unsatisfactory to model financial correlations, [[quantitative analyst]]s have developed specific financial correlation measures. Accurately estimating correlations requires the modeling process of marginals to incorporate characteristics such as [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]]. Not accounting for these attributes can lead to severe estimation error in the correlations and covariances that have negative biases (as much as 70% of the true values).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fantazzinni|first1=D.|title=The effects of misspecified marginals and copulas on computing the value at risk: A Monte Carlo study.|journal=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis,|date=2009|volume=53|issue=6|pages=2168–2188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a practical application in portfolio optimization, accurate estimation of the [[variance-covariance matrix]] is paramount. Thus, forecasting with Monte-Carlo simulation with the Gaussian copula and well-specified marginal distributions are effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Faff|first2=R.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Enhancing mean–variance portfolio selection by modeling distributional asymmetries|journal=Journal of Economics and Business|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.01.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148619516000047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correlation Brownian motions===
[[Steven L. Heston|Steven Heston]] applied a correlation approach&lt;ref&gt;Correlation Risk Modeling and Management: An Applied Guide. Gunter Meissner. Wiley 2014. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GH5nAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT81&amp;lpg=PT81&amp;dq=Steven+Heston+correlation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CjE4vRam4M&amp;sig=wcxHmgy0nvhWN95G5Y1dKZL4ZUU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eLjSU7TBH4rgsATK4ICABA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Steven%20Heston&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; to negatively correlate stochastic stock returns &lt;math&gt;\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)}&lt;/math&gt; and stochastic volatility &lt;math&gt;\ \sigma(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The core equations of the original [[Heston model]] are the two [[stochastic differential equations]], SDEs

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = \mu\, dt + \sigma(t)\,dz_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; (1)

and

: &lt;math&gt; d \sigma^2(t) = g[ \sigma_L ^2- \sigma ^2(t)]\,dt+\xi \sigma(t)\,dz_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; (2)

where S is the underlying stock, &lt;math&gt;\ \mu&lt;/math&gt; is the expected growth rate of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ \sigma(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the stochastic volatility of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; at time t. In equation (2), g is the mean reversion rate (gravity), which pulls the variance &lt;math&gt;\ \sigma^2(t)&lt;/math&gt; to its long term mean &lt;math&gt;\sigma_L^2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ \xi&lt;/math&gt; is the volatility of the volatility σ(t). dz(t) is the standard [[Brownian motion]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;dz(t)=\varepsilon_t \sqrt{dt}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ \varepsilon_t&lt;/math&gt; is [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|i.i.d.]], in particular &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_t&lt;/math&gt; is a random drawing from a standardized normal distribution n~(0,1). In equation (1), the underlying &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; follows the standard geometric Brownian motion, which is also applied in [[Black–Scholes model|Black–Scholes–Merton model]], which however assumes constant volatility. 
The correlation between the stochastic processes (1) and (2) is introduced by correlating the two Brownian motions &lt;math&gt;dz_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dz_2&lt;/math&gt;. The instantaneous correlation &lt;math&gt;\ \rho&lt;/math&gt; between the Brownian motions is

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Corr}[dz_1(t),dz_2(t)] = \rho \, dt &lt;/math&gt; (3).

The definition (3) can be conveniently modeled with the identity
 
: &lt;math&gt; dz_1(t)=\sqrt{\rho}dz_2(t)+\sqrt{1-\rho}\, dz_3(t)&lt;/math&gt; (4)

where &lt;math&gt;dz_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dz_3(t)&lt;/math&gt; are independent, and &lt;math&gt;dz(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dz(t')&lt;/math&gt; are independent, t ≠ t’.

A further financial correlation measure, {{According to whom|mainly applied to default correlation,|date=September 2013}} is the binomial correlation approach of Lucas (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Default Correlation and Credit Analysis | journal = Journal of Fixed Income | year = 1995 | first = D. | last = Lucas | volume = 4 | pages = 76–87| id = | doi = 10.3905/jfi.1995.408124 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; We define the binomial events &lt;math&gt;1_X=1_{\{\tau_X\le T\}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1_Y=1_{\{\tau_Y\le T\}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\tau_X&lt;/math&gt; is the default time of entity &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_Y&lt;/math&gt; is the default time of entity &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Hence if entity &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; defaults before or at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the random indicator variable &lt;math&gt;1_X&lt;/math&gt; will take the value in 1, and 0 otherwise. The same applies to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;P(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is the default probability of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; respectively, and &lt;math&gt;P(XY)&lt;/math&gt; is the joint [[probability of default]]. The standard deviation of a one-trial binomial event is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{P(X)-(P(X))^2}&lt;/math&gt;, where P is the probability of outcome X. Hence, we derive the joint default dependence coefficient of the binomial events &lt;math&gt;1_{\{\tau_X\le T\}}&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;1_{\{\tau_Y\le T\}}&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;\rho(1_{\{\tau_X\le T\}},1_{\{\tau_Y\le T\}})=\frac{P(XY)-P(X)P(Y)}{\sqrt{P(X)-(P(X))^2}\sqrt{P(Y)-(P(Y))^2}}&lt;/math&gt; (5).
By construction, equation (5) can only model binomial events, for example default and no default. The binomial correlation approach of equation (5) is a limiting case of the Pearson correlation approach discussed in section 1. As a consequence, the significant shortcomings of the Pearson correlation approach for financial modeling apply also to the binomial correlation model.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

====Copula correlations====
A fairly recent, famous as well as infamous correlation approach applied in finance is the [[copula (probability theory)|copula]] approach. Copulas go back to [[Abe Sklar|Sklar]] (1959).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Fonctions de répartition à n dimensions et leurs marges | journal = Publications de l'Institut de Statistique de L'Université de Paris | year = 1959 | first = A. | last = Sklar | authorlink = Abe Sklar | volume = 8 | pages = 229–231| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copulas were introduced to finance by Vasicek (1987)&lt;ref name='December 2002'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Loan Portfolio Value | journal = RISK magazine | year = 1987 | first = A. | last = Sklar|authorlink=Abe Sklar| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Li (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = On default correlation: a copula approach | journal = Journal of Fixed Income | year = 2000 | first = D. | last = Li | volume = 9 | pages = 119–149| id =|doi=10.3905/jfi.2000.319253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copulas simplify statistical problems. They allow the joining of multiple univariate distributions to a single multivariate distribution. Formally, a copula function C transforms an n-dimensional function on the interval [0,1] into a unit-dimensional one:

: &lt;math&gt; C : [0,1]^n \rarr [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; (6).

More explicitly, let &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; be a uniform random vector with &lt;math&gt;u_i = u_1,...,u_n, u_i\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i \in N&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a copula function &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt; C(u_1,\ldots,u_n)=F[F_1^{-1}(u_1),\ldots,F_n^{-1}(u_n)]&lt;/math&gt; (7)

where F is the joint cumulative distribution function and &lt;math&gt;\ F_i &lt;/math&gt;, ''i'' = 1, …, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the univariate marginal distributions. &lt;math&gt;F_i^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of &lt;math&gt;\ F_i &lt;/math&gt;. If the marginal distributions &lt;math&gt; F_i^{-1}(u_i)&lt;/math&gt; are continuous, it follows that C is unique. For properties and proofs of equation (11), see Sklar (1959) and Nelsen (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Nelsen | first1 = R. | title = An Introduction to Copulas | edition = 2 | publisher = Springer | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Numerous types of copula functions exist. They can be broadly categorized in one-parameter copulas as the Gaussian copula, and the Archimedean copula, which comprise Gumbel, Clayton and Frank copulas. Often cited two-parameter copulas are student-t, Fréchet, and Marshall-Olkin. For an overview of these copulas, see Nelsen (2006). 
{{According to whom|In finance, copulas are typically applied to derive correlated default probabilities in a portfolio,|date=September 2013}} for example in a [[collateralized debt obligation]], CDO. This was first done by Li in 2006. He defined the uniform margins u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;{{Clarify|reason=Why are these variables sometimes in math tags, and not here?|date=September 2013}} as cumulative default probabilities Q for entity i at a fixed time t, &lt;math&gt;Q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\ u_i = Q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; (8).

Hence, from equations (7) and (8) we derive the Gaussian default time copula CGD, 
: &lt;math&gt; C_{GD}(u_1,\ldots,u_n)=M_{n,R}[N_1^{-1}(Q_1(t)),\ldots,N_n^{-1}(Q_n(t))]&lt;/math&gt; (9).
In equation (9) the terms &lt;math&gt;N_i^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; map the cumulative default probabilities Q of asset i for time t, &lt;math&gt;Q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, percentile to percentile to standard normal. The mapped standard normal marginal distributions &lt;math&gt;N_i^{-1}Q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; are then joined to a single n-variate distribution &lt;math&gt;M_{n,R}&lt;/math&gt; by applying the correlation structure of the multivariate normal distribution with correlation matrix R. The probability of n correlated defaults at time t is given by &lt;math&gt;M_{n,R}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Copulae and the 2007–08 financial crisis====
Numerous non-academic articles have been written demonizing the copula approach and blaming it for the 2007/2008 global financial crisis, see for example Salmon 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recipe for Disaster: The Formula that Killed Wall Street | journal = Wired Magazine | year = 2009 | first = F. | last = Salmon| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The formula that felled Wall St | journal = The Financial Times | date = April 24, 2009 | first = S. | last = Jones| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lohr 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Wall Street's Math Wizards Forgot a Few Variables | journal = New York Times | date = September 12, 2009 | first = S. | last = Lohr| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|There are three main criticisms of the copula approach: (a) tail dependence, (b) calibration, (c) risk management}}.

(a) Tail dependence

In a crisis, financial correlations typically increase, see studies by Das, Duffie, Kapadia, and Saita (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Common Failings: How Corporate Defaults Are Correlated | journal = Journal of Finance | date = February 2007 | first = S. | last = Das |author2=D. Duffie |author3=N. Kapadia |author4=L. Saita | volume = LSII, No1| doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01202.x | pages=93–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Duffie, Eckner, Horel and Saita (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Frailty correlated default | journal = Journal of Finance | year = 2009 | first = D. | last = Duffie |author2=A. Eckner |author3=G. Horel |author4=L. Saita | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 2089–2123| id = | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01495.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and references therein. Hence it would be desirable to apply a correlation model with high co-movements in the lower tail of the joint distribution. It can be mathematically shown that the Gaussian copula has relative low tail dependence, as seen in the following scatter plots.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[File:Four Correlations.png|500px|center]] &lt;br /&gt;
 
Figure 1: Scatter plots of different copula models

As seen in Figure 1b, the student-t copula exhibits higher tail dependence and might be better suited to model financial correlations. Also, as seen in Figure 1(c), the Gumbel copula exhibits high tail dependence especially for negative co-movements. Assuming that correlations increase when asset prices decrease, the Gumbel copula might also be a good correlation approach for financial modeling.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

(b) Calibration

A further criticism of the Gaussian copula is the difficulty to calibrate it to market prices. In practice, typically a single correlation parameter (not a correlation matrix) is used to model the default correlation between any two entities in a collateralized debt obligation, CDO. Conceptually this correlation parameter should be the same for the entire CDO portfolio. However, traders randomly alter the correlation parameter for different [[tranches]], in order to derive desired tranche spreads. Traders increase the correlation for ‘extreme’ tranches as the equity tranche or senior tranches, referred to as the correlation smile. This is similar to the often cited implied volatility smile in the Black–Scholes–Merton model. Here traders increase the implied volatility especially for out-of-the money puts, but also for out-of-the money calls to increase the option price.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}.

In a mean-variance optimization framework, accurate estimation of the [[variance-covariance matrix]] is paramount. Thus, forecasting with Monte-Carlo simulation with the Gaussian copula and well-specified marginal distributions are effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Faff|first2=R.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Enhancing mean–variance portfolio selection by modeling distributional asymmetries|journal=Journal of Economics and Business|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.01.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148619516000047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing the modeling process to allow for empirical characteristics in stock returns such as auto-regression, asymmetric volatility, skewness, and kurtosis is important. Not accounting for these attributes lead to severe estimation error in the correlations and variances that have negative biases (as much as 70% of the true values).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fantazzinni|first1=D.|title=The effects of misspecified marginals and copulas on computing the value at risk: A Monte Carlo study.|journal=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis,|date=2009|volume=53|issue=6|pages=2168–2188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(c) Risk management

A further criticism of the Copula approach is that the copula model is static and consequently allows only limited risk management, see Finger (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Testing hedges under the standard tranched credit pricing model | journal = RiskMetrics Journal | date = Winter 2009 | first = C. | last = Finger| ssrn=1356015|id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Donnelly and Embrechts (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The devil is in the tails: actuarial mathematics and the subprime mortgage crisis | journal = ASTIN Bulletin |volume=40 |issue=1 | year = 2010 | first = C. | last = Donnelly |author2=Embrechts, P. | pages = 1–33| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original copulas models of Vasicek (1987) and Li (2000) and several extensions of the model as Hull and White (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Valuation of a CDO and an nth to Default CDS without Monte Carlo Simulation | journal = Journal of Derivatives | year = 2004 | first = J. | last = Hull |author2=A. White | volume = 2 | pages = 8–23| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Gregory and Laurent (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gregory | first1 = J. | last2 = Laurent | first2 = J-P. | title = RISK | chapter = In the core of correlation | date = October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; do have a one period time horizon, i.e. are static. In particular, there is no stochastic process for the critical underlying variables default intensity and default correlation. However, even in these early copula formulations, back testing and stress testing the variables for different time horizons can give valuable sensitivities, see Whetten and Adelson (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Bespoke – A Guide to Single-Tranche Synthetic CDOs | journal = Nomura Fixed Income Research | year = 2004 | first = M. | last = Whetten |author2=M. Adelson }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Meissner, Hector, and. Rasmussen (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Meissner | first1 = G. | last2 = Hector | first2 = R. | last3 = Rasmussen | first3 = T. | title = RISK books | chapter = Hedging CDOs in the one-factor Gaussian Copula Framework/The Definitive Guide to CDOs | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition, the copula variables can be made a function of time as in Hull, Predescu, and White (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hull|first=John C.|author2=Predescu, Mirela|author3=White, Alan|title=The Valuation of Correlation-Dependent Credit Derivatives Using a Structural Model|journal=|date=1 January 2005|ssrn=686481|doi=10.2139/ssrn.686481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This still does not create a fully dynamic stochastic process with drift and noise, which allows flexible hedging and risk management. The best solutions are truly dynamic copula frameworks, see section ‘Dynamic Copulas’ below.

====Irrational complacency====
Before the global 2007–08 financial crisis, numerous market participants trusted the copula model uncritically and naively.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, the 2007–08 crisis was less a matter of a particular correlation model, but rather an issue of "irrational complacency". In the extremely benign time period from 2003 to 2006, proper hedging, proper risk management and stress test results were largely ignored.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The prime example is AIG’s London subsidiary, which had sold [[credit default swaps]] and collateralized debt obligations in an amount of close to $500 billion without conducting any major hedging. For an insightful paper on inadequate risk management leading up to the crisis, see “A personal view of the crisis – Confessions of a Risk Manager” (The Economist 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confessions of a risk manager|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11897037|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=30 September 2013|date=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, if any credit correlation model is fed with benign input data as low default intensities and low default correlation, the risk output figures will be benign, ‘garbage in garbage out’ in modeling terminology.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

====Dynamic copulas====
A core enhancement of copula models are dynamic copulas, introduced by Albanese et al. (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=C. |last=Albanese |author2=O. Chen |author3=A. Dalessandro |author4=A. Vidler |title=Dynamic Credit Correlation Modeling (Working paper) |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = C. | last = Albanese |author2=A. Vidler | title = Dynamic Conditioning and Credit Correlation Baskets (Working paper) | year = 2007| id = | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "dynamic conditioning" approach models the evolution of multi-factor super-lattices, which correlate the return processes of each entity at each time step. Binomial dynamic copulas apply combinatorial methods to avoid Monte Carlo simulations. Richer dynamic Gaussian copulas apply Monte Carlo simulation and come at the cost of requiring powerful computer technology.

===Conditionally independent default (CID) correlation modeling===
In order to avoid specifying the default correlation between each entity pair in a portfolio a factorization is often applied.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This leads to conditionally independent default (CID) modeling. The most widely applied CID model is the one-factor Gaussian copula (OFGC) model. It was the de facto market model for pricing CDOs before the 2007/2008 global financial crisis.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The core equation of the OFGC model&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x_i=\sqrt{\rho}M+\sqrt{1-\rho}Z_i&lt;/math&gt; (10)
where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_i&lt;/math&gt; are random drawings from &lt;math&gt;N(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \le \rho \le 1&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the latent variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes interpreted as the asset value of i, see Turc, Very, Benhamou and Alvarez et al. (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = J. | last = Turc |author2=P. Very |author3=D. Benhamou |author4=V. Alvarez | title = Pricing with a Smile, (SG credit research paper)| year = 2005| id = | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also n~(0,1). The common factor &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the economic environment, possibly represented by the return of the S&amp;P 500. &lt;math&gt;Z_i&lt;/math&gt; is the idiosyncratic component, the ‘strength’ of entity i, possibly measured by entity i’s stock price return. From equation (10) we see, that the correlation between entities i is modeled indirectly by conditioning the latent variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; on the common factor &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. For example, for p =1, the latent variables of all entities &lt;math&gt;i=1,...,n, \ x_i=M&lt;/math&gt;, so the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are identical in each simulation. For p = 0, all latent variable for all entities &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,n,\ x_i=Z_i&lt;/math&gt;, hence the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are independent. Importantly, once we fix the value of M, the defaults of the n entities are (conditionally on M) mutually independent.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

As of 2010, the OFGC is the basis for credit risk management in [[Basel II]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The benefits of the model are simplicity and intuition. One of the main shortcomings of the model is that traders when pricing CDOs randomly alter the correlation parameter for different CDO tranches to achieve desired tranche spreads. However conceptually, the correlation parameter should be identical for the whole portfolio.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Contagion default modeling===
Contagion default modeling can be viewed as a variation of CID modeling. As discussed in section 2.3, in the CID framework, correlation is modeled by conditioning on a common market factor M, which impacts all entities to the same degree. The lower the random drawing for M, the higher is the default intensity of all entities (unless ρ = 0). Hence CID modeling can elucidate default clustering. In contrast, contagion approaches model the default intensity of an entity as a function of the default of another entity. Hence contagion default modeling incorporates counterparty risk, i.e. the direct impact of a defaulting entity on the default intensity of another entity. In particular, after a default of a particular entity, the default intensity of all assets in the portfolio increases. This default contagion then typically fades exponentially to non-contagious default intensity levels. See the papers of Davis and Lo (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. | last2 = Lo | first2 = V. | title = Quantitative Finance 1 | chapter = Infectious Defaults | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jarrow and Yu (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Counterparty risk and the Pricing of Defaultable Securities | journal = Journal of Finance | year = 2001 | first = R. | last = Jarrow |author2=Yu, F. | volume = 56| doi=10.1111/0022-1082.00389|id = | pages=1765–1799}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pioneered contagion default modeling.

==Top–down correlation approaches==
Within the credit correlation modeling framework, a fairly new correlation approach is top–down modeling. Here the evolution of the portfolio intensity distribution is derived directly, i.e. abstracting from the default intensities of individual entities. Top-down models are typically applied in practice if:

* The default intensities of the individual entities are unavailable or unreliable.
* The default intensities of the individual entities are unnecessary. This may be the case when evaluating a homogeneous portfolio such as an index of homogeneous entities.
* The sheer size of a portfolio makes the modeling of individual default intensities problematic.

Top–down models are typically more parsimonious, computationally efficient and can often be calibrated better to market prices than bottom–up models. Although seemingly important information such as the default intensities of individual entities is disregarded, a top-down model can typically better capture properties of the portfolio such as volatility or correlation smiles. In addition, the default information of individual entities can often be inferred by random thinning techniques, see Giesecke, Goldberg and Ding (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A top down approach to multi-name credit | journal = Operations Research | year = 2009 | first = K. | last = Giesecke |author2=L. Goldberg |author3=X. Ding | volume = 59| doi=10.1287/opre.1100.0855 | pages=283–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; for details.
 
Within the top-down framework, Schönbucher (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = P. | last = Schönbucher | title = Portfolio Losses and the terms structure of loss transition rates: A new methodology for the pricing of portfolio credit derivatives (Working paper) | year = 2006| id = | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; creates a time-inhomogeneous [[Markov chain|Markov-chain]] of transition rates. Default correlation is introduced by changes in the volatility of transition rates. For certain parameter constellations, higher volatility means faster transition to lower states as default, and as a consequence implies higher default correlation, and vice versa. Similarly, Hurd and Kuznetsov (2006a)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Affine Markov chain model of multifirm credit Migration | journal = Journal of Credit Risk | year = 2006 | first = T.R. | last = Hurd |author2=Kuznetsov, A. | volume = 2006a | issue = 3| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2006b)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Fast CDO computations in the Affine Markov chain model | journal = Journal of Credit Risk | year = 2006 | first = T.R. | last = Hurd |author2=Kuznetsov, A. | volume = 2006b| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; induce correlation by a random change in the speed of time. A faster speed of time means faster transition to a lower state, possibly default, and as a result increases default correlation, and vice versa. For a comparative analysis of correlation approaches in finance, see Albanese, Li, Lobachevskiy, and Meissner (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | ssrn = 1769302 | title = A Comparative Analysis or Correlation Approaches in Finance | accessdate =November 27, 2011 | last = Albanese | first = C.|author2=D.

To study computation we need a theory of finite structures."&lt;ref name=Immerman_history&gt;{{cite book | last = Immerman | first = Neil | authorlink = Neil Immerman | title = Descriptive Complexity | year = 1999 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | isbn = 0-387-98600-6 | page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the main application areas of FMT are: [[descriptive complexity|descriptive complexity theory]], [[database theory]] and [[Formal language|formal language theory]].  
* FMT is mainly about discrimination of structures.  The usual motivating question is whether a given class of structures can be described (up to isomorphism) in a given language.  For instance, can all cyclic graphs be discriminated (from the non-cyclic ones) by a sentence of the first-order [[logic of graphs]]?  This can also be phrased as: is the property "cyclic" FO expressible?

==Basic challenges==
A single finite structure can always be axiomatized in first-order logic, where axiomatized in a language L means described uniquely up to isomorphism by a single L-sentence.  Similarly, any finite collection of finite structures can always be axiomatized in first-order logic. Some, but not all, infinite collections of finite structures can also be axiomatized by a single first-order sentence.

===Characterisation of a single structure===
Is a language L expressive enough to axiomatize a single finite structure S?
[[Image:Math graph nikos house 01.gif|thumb|right|Single graphs (1) and (1') having common properties.]]

====Problem====
A structure like (1) in the figure can be described by FO sentences in the [[logic of graphs]] like

# Every node has an edge to another node: &lt;math&gt;\forall_x \exists_y G(x, y).&lt;/math&gt;
# No node has an edge to itself: &lt;math&gt;\forall_{x,y} (G(x, y) \Rightarrow x \neq y).&lt;/math&gt;
# There is at least one node that is connected to all others: &lt;math&gt;\exists_x \forall_y (x \neq y \Rightarrow G(x, y)).&lt;/math&gt;

However, these properties do not axiomatize the structure, since for structure (1') the above properties hold as well, yet structures (1) and (1') are not isomorphic.

Informally the question is whether by adding enough properties, these properties together describe exactly (1) and are valid (all together) for no other structure (up to isomorphism).

====Approach====
For a single finite structure it is always possible to precisely describe the structure by a single FO sentence.  The principle is illustrated here for a structure with one binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and without constants:
# say that there are at least &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1  =  \bigwedge_{i\ne j} \neg (x_i = x_j)&lt;/math&gt;
# say that there are at most &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_2  =  \forall_y \bigvee_{i} (x_i = y)&lt;/math&gt;
# state every element of the relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_3  =  \bigwedge_{(a_i, a_j) \in R} R(x_i, x_j)&lt;/math&gt;
# state every non-element of the relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_4  =  \bigwedge_{(a_i, a_j) \notin R} \neg R(x_i, x_j)&lt;/math&gt;

all for the same tuple &lt;math&gt;x_1 .. x_n&lt;/math&gt;, yielding the FO sentence &lt;math&gt;\exists_{x_1} \dots \exists_{x_n} (\varphi_1 \land \varphi_2 \land \varphi_3 \land \varphi_4)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Extension to a fixed number of Structures====
The method of describing a single structure by means of a first-order sentence can easily be extended for any fixed number of structures.  A unique description can be obtained by the disjunction of the descriptions for each structure.  For instance, for two structures &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with defining sentences &lt;math&gt;\varphi_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_B&lt;/math&gt; this would be

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_A \lor \varphi_B.&lt;/math&gt;

====Extension to an infinite structure====
By definition, a set containing an infinite structure falls outside the area that FMT deals with.  Note that infinite structures can never be discriminated in FO, because of the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which implies that no first-order theory with an infinite model can have a unique model up to isomorphism.

The most famous example is probably [[Non-standard model of arithmetic|Skolem's theorem]], that there is a countable non-standard model of arithmetic.

===Characterisation of a class of structures===
Is a language L expressive enough to describe exactly (up to isomorphism) those finite structures that have certain property P?
[[Image:Math graph nikos house 05.jpg|thumb|right|Set of up to n structures.]]

====Problem====
The descriptions given so far all specify the number of elements of the universe.  Unfortunately most interesting sets of structures are not restricted to a certain size, like all graphs that are trees, are connected or are acyclic.  Thus to discriminate a finite number of structures is of special importance.

====Approach====
Instead of a general statement, the following is a sketch of a methodology to differentiate between structures that can and cannot be discriminated.

'''1.''' The core idea is that whenever one wants to see if a Property P can be expressed in FO, one chooses structures A and B, where A does have P and B doesn't. If for A and B the same FO sentences hold, then P cannot be expressed in FO.  In short:

&lt;math&gt;A \in P, B \not\in P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \equiv B&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A \equiv B&lt;/math&gt; is shorthand for &lt;math&gt;A \models \alpha \Leftrightarrow B \models \alpha&lt;/math&gt; for all FO-sentences &amp;alpha;, and P represents the class of structures with property P.

'''2.''' The methodology considers countably many subsets of the language, the union of which forms the language itself. For instance, for FO consider classes FO[m] for each m.  For each m the above core idea then has to be shown.  That is:

&lt;math&gt;A \in P, B \not\in P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \equiv_m B&lt;/math&gt;

with a pair &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &amp;alpha; (in &amp;equiv;) from FO[m].  It may be appropriate to choose the classes FO[m] to form a partition of the language.

'''3.''' One common way to define FO[m] is by means of the [[quantifier rank]] qr(&amp;alpha;) of a FO formula &amp;alpha;, which expresses the depth of quantifier nesting.  For example, for a formula in [[prenex normal form]], qr is simply the total number of its quantifiers.  Then FO[m] can be defined as all FO formulas &amp;alpha; with qr(&amp;alpha;) ≤ m (or, if a partition is desired, as those FO formulas with quantifier rank equal to m).

'''4.''' Thus it all comes down to showing &lt;math&gt;A \models \alpha \Leftrightarrow B \models \alpha&lt;/math&gt; on the subsets FO[m].  The main approach here is to use the algebraic characterization provided by [[Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game]]s. Informally, these take a single partial isomorphism on A and B and extend it m times, in order to either prove or disprove &lt;math&gt;A \equiv_m B&lt;/math&gt;, dependent on who wins the game.

====Example====
We want to show that the property that the size of an orderered structure '''A'''=(A, ≤) is even, can not be expressed in FO.

'''1.''' The idea is to pick '''A''' &amp;isin; EVEN and '''B''' &amp;notin; EVEN, where EVEN is the class of all structures of even size.

'''2.''' We start with two ordered structures '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' with universes A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, 2, 3}.  Obviously '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;isin; EVEN and '''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;notin; EVEN.

'''3.''' For m = 2, we can now show* that in a 2-move [[Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game]] on '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' the duplicator always wins, and thus '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' cannot be discriminated in FO[2], i.e. '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; &amp;alpha; &amp;hArr; '''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; &amp;alpha; for every &amp;alpha; &amp;isin; FO[2].
            
'''4.''' Next we have to scale the structures up by increasing m.  For example, for m = 3 we must find an '''A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' such that the duplicator always wins the 3-move game.  This can be achieved by A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, ..., 8} and B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, ..., 7}.  More generally, we can choose A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, ..., 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;} and B&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, ..., 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;-1}; for any m the duplicator always wins the m-move game for this pair of structures*.

'''5.''' Thus EVEN on finite ordered structures cannot be expressed in FO.

(*) Note that the proof of the result of the [[Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game]] has been omitted, since it is not the main focus here.

==Applications==

===Database theory===
A substantial fragment of [[SQL]] (namely that which is effectively [[relational algebra]]) is based on first-order logic (more precisely can be translated in [[domain relational calculus]] by means of [[Codd's theorem]]), as the following example illustrates: Think of a database table "GIRLS" with the columns "FIRST_NAME" and "LAST_NAME".  This corresponds to a binary relation, say G(f, l) on FIRST_NAME X LAST_NAME.  The FO query '''{l : G('Judy', l)}''', which returns all the last names where the first name is 'Judy', would look in SQL like this:

 select LAST_NAME 
 from GIRLS
 where FIRST_NAME = 'Judy'

Notice, we assume here, that all last names appear only once (or we should use SELECT DISTINCT since we assume that relations and answers are sets, not bags).

Next we want to make a more complex statement.  Therefore, in addition to the "GIRLS" table we have a table "BOYS" also with the columns "FIRST_NAME" and "LAST_NAME". Now we want to query the last names of all the girls that have the same last name as at least one of the boys.  The FO query is '''{(f,l) : &amp;exist;h ( G(f, l) &amp;and; B(h, l) )}''', and the corresponding SQL statement is:

 select FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME 
 from GIRLS
 where LAST_NAME IN ( select LAST_NAME from BOYS );

Notice that in order to express the "&amp;and;" we introduced the new language element "IN" with a subsequent select statement.  This makes the language more expressive for the price of higher difficulty to learn and implement.  This is a common trade-off in formal language design.  The way shown above ("IN") is by far not the only one to extend the language. An alternative way is e.g. to introduce a "JOIN" operator, that is:

 select distinct g.FIRST_NAME, g.LAST_NAME 
 from GIRLS g, BOYS b
 where g.LAST_NAME=b.LAST_NAME;

First-order logic is too restrictive for some database applications, for instance because of its inability to express [[transitive closure]].  This has led to more powerful constructs being added to database query languages, such as [[recursive WITH]] in [[SQL:1999]].  More expressive logics, like [[fixpoint logic]]s, have therefore been studied in finite model theory because of their relevance to database theory and applications.

===Querying and search===
Narrative data contains no defined relations.  Thus the logical structure of text search queries can be expressed in Propositional Logic, like in:

 ("Java" AND NOT "island") OR ("C#" AND NOT "music")

Note that the challenges in full text search are different from database querying, like ranking of results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1788">In [[mathematics]], the '''fractional Laplacian''' is an operator which generalizes the notion of derivatives to fractional powers.

==Definition==

For &lt;math&gt;0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the fractional Laplacian of order s &lt;math&gt;(-\Delta)^s&lt;/math&gt; can be defined on functions &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as a [[Fourier multiplier]] given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}((-\Delta)^sf))(\xi) = |\xi|^{2s}\mathcal{F}(f)(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Fourier transform]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(f)&lt;/math&gt; of a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(f)(\xi) = \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^d}{f(x)e^{-ix\cdot\xi}\,dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

More concretely, the fractional Laplacian can be written as a [[singular integral operator]] defined by

:&lt;math&gt; (-\Delta)^sf(x) = c_{d,s}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^d}{\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{|x-y|^{d+2s}}\,dy} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_{d,s} = \frac{4^s\Gamma(d/2+s)}{\pi^{d/2}|\Gamma(-s)|} &lt;/math&gt;. These two definitions, along with several other definitions,&lt;ref&gt;Kwasnicki, Mateusz. "Ten equivalent definitions of the fractional Laplace operator". https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.07356.pdf"&lt;/ref&gt; are equivalent.

Some authors prefer to adopt the convention of defining the fractional Laplacian of order s as &lt;math&gt;(-\Delta)^{s/2}&lt;/math&gt; (as defined above), where now &lt;math&gt;0&lt;s&lt;2&lt;/math&gt;, so that the notion of order matches that of a [[pseudodifferential operator|(pseudo-)differential operator]].

'''Gerrit Mannoury''' (17 May 1867 &amp;ndash; 30 January 1956) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]], professor at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and [[communist]], known as the central figure in the [[Significs|signific circle]], a Dutch counterpart of the [[Vienna circle]].&lt;ref name="SvHA00"&gt;Jan Siegenbeek van Heukelom &amp; Gerard Alberts (2000).

== Biography ==
Gerrit Mannoury was born on 17 May 1867 in [[Wormerveer]], and died on 30 January 1956 in [[Amsterdam]]. On 8 August 1907 he married Elizabeth Maria Berkelbach van der Sprenkel, with whom he had three daughters and a son, Jan Mannoury. His father Gerrit Mannoury, a sea-captain, had died in China when he was three years old.&lt;ref name="HV98"&gt;Ger Harmsen, Gerrit Voerman (1998). [http://www.iisg.nl/bwsa/bios/mannoury.html "Gerrit Mannoury"]. In: ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme''. p. 137&amp;ndash;141.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Hogere Burgerschool]] (HBS) in Amsterdam, where he graduated in 1885. The same year he received a Teacher's Degree in Accounting and in Mechanics. In 1902 he also received a Teacher's Degree in Mathematics. Mannoury was a self-educated mathematician. Because he was a teacher he couldn't attend lessons at the University of Amsterdam. He did receive privat lessons from [[Diederik Korteweg]]. He was awarded a PhD in Mathematics late in life, in 1946, with [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] as his promotores.&lt;ref&gt;

Mannoury started working in [[primary education]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Bloemendaal]] and [[Helmond]]. In 1910 he started teaching at the Hoogere Burger School (HBS) at [[Vlissingen]]. In 1902 he had been appointed [[Privatdozent]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and in 1917 he was made professor there. He retired in 1937). He lectured on the philosophy of mathematics, and on mechanics, analytics and descriptive and projective geometry.&lt;ref name="SW88"&gt;Erik Heijerman (1988) "Relativism and significs: Gerrit Mannoury of the foundations of mathematics".

John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1988. p.247-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mannoury was, with [[Diederik Korteweg]], one of the most important teachers of [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] at Amsterdam University, Mannoury especially philosophically. The first appearance of the names "formalism" and "[[intuitionism]]" in Brouwer's writings, were in a review of Gerrit Mannoury's book ''Methodologisches und Philosophisches zur Elementar-Mathematik'' (Methodological and philosophical remarks on elementary mathematics) from 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brouwer/ "Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer"] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2003&amp;ndash;2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Two other Dutch scientists he inspired were philosopher and logician [[Evert W. Beth]] and psychologist [[Adriaan de Groot]].

He died in Amsterdam.

== Work ==
Mannoury's main inspirations were [[G. W. F. Hegel]], [[G.J.P.J. Bolland]] and [[F. H. Bradley]]. He was also inspired by the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], the French mathematician philosopher of science [[Henri Poincaré]] and the English positivism of [[Bertrand Russell]]. Mannoury combined a logical-mathematical way of thinking with a deep insight into the human soul.&lt;ref name="HV98"/&gt;

== Publications ==
Mannoury was a prolific and polymathic writer who published books, articles, reviews, and pamphlets.&lt;ref name="Wisse"&gt;Pieter Wisse ''[http://www.informationdynamics.nl/pwisse/htm/mannoury.htm Mannoury's significs, or a philosophy of communal individualism]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical physics]] and [[differential geometry]], a '''gravitational instanton''' is a four-dimensional [[complete metric|complete]] [[Riemannian manifold]] satisfying the [[vacuum]] [[Einstein equation]]s. They are so named because they are analogues in [[quantum gravity|quantum theories of gravity]] of [[instanton]]s in [[Yang&amp;ndash;Mills theory]]. In accordance with this analogy with [[instanton#Instantons in Yang&amp;ndash;Mills theory|self-dual Yang&amp;ndash;Mills instantons]], gravitational instantons are usually assumed to look like four dimensional [[Euclidean space]] at large distances, and to have a self-dual [[Riemann tensor]]. Mathematically, this means that they are asymptotically locally Euclidean (or perhaps asymptotically locally flat) [[hyperkähler manifold|hyperkähler 4-manifolds]], and in this sense, they are special examples of [[Einstein manifold]]s. From a physical point of view, a gravitational instanton is a non-singular solution of the vacuum [[Einstein equation]]s with ''positive-definite'', as opposed to [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|Lorentzian]], metric.

There are many possible generalizations of the original conception of a gravitational instanton: for example one can allow gravitational instantons to have a nonzero [[cosmological constant]] or a Riemann tensor which is not self-dual. One can also relax the boundary condition that the metric is asymptotically Euclidean.

There are many methods for constructing gravitational instantons, including the [[Gibbons&amp;ndash;Hawking Ansatz]], [[twistor theory]], and the [[hyperkähler quotient]] construction.

== Properties ==
* A four-dimensional [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]]–[[Einstein manifold]] has a self-dual [[Riemann tensor]].
* Equivalently, a self-dual gravitational instanton is a four-dimensional complete [[hyperkähler manifold]].
* Gravitational instantons are analogous to [[Instanton|self-dual Yang–Mills instantons]].

== Taxonomy ==
By specifying the 'boundary conditions', i.e. the asymptotics of the metric 'at infinity' on a noncompact Riemannian manifold, gravitational instantons are divided into a few classes, such as '''asymptotically locally Euclidean spaces''' (ALE spaces), '''asymptotically locally flat spaces''' (ALF spaces). There also exist ALG spaces whose name is chosen by induction.

== Examples ==
It will be convenient to write the gravitational instanton solutions below using left-invariant 1-forms on the [[three-sphere]] '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
(viewed as the group Sp(1) or SU(2)).  These can be defined in terms of [[Euler angles]] by

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_1 = \sin \psi \, d \theta - \cos \psi \sin \theta \, d \phi
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_2 = \cos \psi \, d \theta + \sin \psi \sin \theta \, d \phi
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_3 = d \psi + \cos \theta \, d \phi.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Taub&amp;ndash;NUT metric ===
{{main|Taub–NUT metric}}
:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = \frac{1}{4} \frac{r+n}{r-n} dr^2 + \frac{r-n}{r+n} n^2 {\sigma_3}^2 + \frac{1}{4}(r^2 - n^2)({\sigma_1}^2 + {\sigma_2}^2)
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Eguchi–Hanson metric ===

The [[Eguchi–Hanson space]] is important in many other contexts of geometry and theoretical physics. Its metric is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = \left( 1 - \frac{a}{r^4} \right) ^{-1} dr^2 + \frac{r^2}{4} \left( 1 - \frac{a}{r^4} \right) {\sigma_3}^2 + \frac{r^2}{4} (\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2).
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r \ge a^{1/4}&lt;/math&gt;.
This metric is smooth everywhere if it has no [[Gravitational singularity#Conical singularities|conical singularity]] at &lt;math&gt;r \rightarrow a^{1/4}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0, \pi&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt; this happens if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; has a period of &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt;, which gives a flat metric on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;; However, for &lt;math&gt;a \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; this happens if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; has a period of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Asymptotically (i.e., in the limit &lt;math&gt;r \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;) the metric looks like
:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dr^2 + \frac{r^2}{4} \sigma_3^2 + \frac{r^2}{4} (\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2) &lt;/math&gt;
which naively seems as the flat metric on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. However, for &lt;math&gt;a \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; has only half the usual periodicity, as we have seen. Thus the metric is asymptotically '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; with the identification &lt;math&gt;\psi\, {\sim}\, \psi + 2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[Cyclic group|Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[subgroup]] of [[SO(4)]], the rotation group of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the metric is said to be asymptotically 
'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

There is a transformation to another [[coordinate system]], in which the metric looks like
:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = \frac{1}{V(\mathbf{x})} ( d \psi + \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot d \mathbf{x})^2 + V(\mathbf{x}) d \mathbf{x} \cdot d \mathbf{x},&lt;/math&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt; \nabla V = \pm \nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}, \quad V = \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i| }.
&lt;/math&gt;
:(For a = 0, &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}|}&lt;/math&gt;, and the new coordinates are defined as follows: one first defines &lt;math&gt;\rho=r^2/4&lt;/math&gt; and then parametrizes &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; by the '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=(\rho \sin \theta \cos \phi, \rho \sin \theta \sin \phi,\rho \cos\theta) &lt;/math&gt;).

In the new coordinates, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; has the usual periodicity &lt;math&gt;\psi\  {\sim}\  \psi + 4\pi.&lt;/math&gt;

One may replace V by 
:&lt;math&gt;\quad V = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i|}.&lt;/math&gt;
For some ''n'' points &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i&lt;/math&gt;, ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2...,&amp;nbsp;''n''.
This gives a multi-center Eguchi&amp;ndash;Hanson gravitational instanton, which is again smooth everywhere if the angular coordinates have the usual periodicities (to avoid [[Gravitational singularity#Conical singularities|conical singularities]]). The asymptotic limit (&lt;math&gt;r\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;) is equivalent to taking all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i&lt;/math&gt; to zero, and by changing coordinates back to r, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and redefining &lt;math&gt;r\rightarrow r/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, we get the asymptotic metric

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dr^2 + \frac{r^2}{4} \left({d\psi\over n} + \cos \theta \, d\phi\right)^2 + \frac{r^2}{4} [(\sigma_1^L)^2 + (\sigma_2^L)^2]. &lt;/math&gt;

This is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, because it is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; with the angular coordinate &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; replaced by &lt;math&gt;\psi/n&lt;/math&gt;, which has the wrong periodicity (&lt;math&gt;4\pi/n&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt;). In other words, it is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; identified under &lt;math&gt;\psi\  {\sim}\  \psi + 4\pi k/n&lt;/math&gt;, or, equivalently, '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; identified under ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ~ &lt;math&gt;e^{2\pi i k/n}&lt;/math&gt; ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i'' = 1, 2.

To conclude, the multi-center Eguchi&amp;ndash;Hanson geometry is a [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]] Ricci flat geometry which is asymptotically '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. According to [[Calabi&amp;ndash;Yau manifold|Yau's theorem]] this is the only geometry satisfying these properties. Therefore, this is also the geometry of a '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; [[orbifold]] in [[string theory]] after its [[Gravitational singularity#Conical singularities|conical singularity]] has been smoothed away by its "blow up" (i.e., deformation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=hep-th/9603167|last1= Douglas|first1= Michael R.|title= D-branes, Quivers, and ALE Instantons|last2= Moore|first2= Gregory|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gibbons&amp;ndash;Hawking multi-centre metrics ===
&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = \frac{1}{V(\mathbf{x})} ( d \tau + \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot d \mathbf{x})^2 + V(\mathbf{x}) d \mathbf{x} \cdot d \mathbf{x},
&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;
\nabla V = \pm \nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}, \quad V = \varepsilon + 2M \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i | }.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to multi-Taub&amp;ndash;NUT, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k = 1&lt;/math&gt; is flat space, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k = 2&lt;/math&gt; is the Eguchi&amp;ndash;Hanson solution (in different coordinates).

'''Guillaume François Antoine, [[Marquis]] de l'Hôpital'''&lt;ref&gt;In the 17th and 18th centuries, the name was commonly spelled "l'Hospital", and he himself spelled his name that way. However, French spellings have [[Académie française|been altered]]: the silent 's' has been removed and replaced with the [[circumflex]] over the preceding vowel. The former spelling is still used in English where there is no circumflex.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-fr|ɡijom fʁɑ̃swa ɑ̃twan maʁki də lopital|lang}}; 1661 – 2 February 1704) was a French [[mathematician]]. His name is firmly associated with [[l'Hôpital's rule]] for calculating [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]s involving [[indeterminate form]]s 0/0 and ∞/∞. Although the rule did not originate with l'Hôpital, it appeared in print for the first time in his treatise on the [[infinitesimal calculus]], entitled ''[[Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Answering l'Hôpital's question, in a letter of 22 July 1694 [[Johann Bernoulli]] described the rule of computing the limit of a fraction whose numerator and denominator tend to 0 by differentiating the numerator and denominator. A commonly made claim that l'Hôpital attempted to get credit for discovering the l'Hôpital's rule is inaccurate, since in the preface to his textbook, l'Hôpital generally acknowledged Leibniz, Jakob Bernoulli and Johann Bernoulli as the sources of the results in it.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was a first systematic exposition of [[differential calculus]]. Several editions and translations to other languages were published and it became a model for subsequent treatments of [[calculus]].

== Biography ==

L'Hôpital was born into a military family. His father was Anne-Alexandre de l'Hôpital, a Lieutenant-General of the King's army, [[Count|Comte]] de Saint-Mesme and the [[:fr:Écuyer#Le premier écuyer|first squire]] of [[Gaston, Duke of Orléans]]. His mother was Elisabeth Gobelin, a daughter of Claude Gobelin, Intendant in the King's Army and Councilor of the State.

L'Hôpital abandoned a military career due to poor eyesight and pursued his interest in [[mathematics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13358210&amp;search_terms=DTL45|title=Solutio problematis physico mathematici|last=|first=|work=Acta Eruditorum|publisher=|year=1695|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=56|access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was apparent since his childhood. For a while, he was a member of [[Nicolas Malebranche]]'s circle in Paris and it was there that in 1691 he met young [[Johann Bernoulli]], who was visiting France and agreed to supplement his Paris talks on [[infinitesimal calculus]] with private lectures to l'Hôpital at his estate at [[Oucques]]. In 1693, l'Hôpital was elected to the [[French academy of sciences]] and even served twice as its vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;Yushkevich, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his accomplishments were the determination of the [[arc length]] of the [[logarithm]]ic graph,&lt;ref&gt;Unbeknownst to him, a solution had already been obtained by [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] in letters to Collins (1670–1671), ''ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the solutions to the [[brachistochrone problem]], and the discovery of a turning point [[singularity theory|singularity]] on the [[involute]] of a plane curve near an [[inflection point]].&lt;ref&gt;This singularity is a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]] of the second kind, in which both branches are [[concave mirror|concave]] from the same side. It was described in l'Hôpital's letter to Johann Bernoulli from May 1694, Yushkevich, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Hôpital exchanged ideas with [[Pierre Varignon]] and corresponded with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], and [[Jakob Bernoulli|Jacob]] and [[Johann Bernoulli]]. His ''Traité analytique des sections coniques et de leur usage pour la résolution des équations dans les problêmes tant déterminés  qu'indéterminés'' ("Analytic treatise on [[conic section]]s") was published posthumously in Paris in 1707.

In 1696 l'Hôpital published his book ''[[Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes]]'' ("Infinitesimal calculus with applications to curved lines"). This was the first textbook on [[infinitesimal calculus]] and it presented the ideas of [[differential calculus]] and their applications to [[differential geometry of curves]] in a lucid form and with numerous figures; however, it did not consider [[integral|integration]]. The history leading to the book's publication became a subject of a protracted controversy. In a letter from 17 March 1694, l'Hôpital made the following proposal to [[Johann Bernoulli]]: in exchange for an annual payment of 300 Francs, Bernoulli would inform l'Hôpital of his latest mathematical discoveries, withholding them from correspondence with others, including [[Varignon]]. Bernoulli's immediate response has not been preserved, but he must have agreed soon, as the subsequent letters show. L'Hôpital may have felt fully justified in describing these results in his book, after acknowledging his debt to Leibniz and the Bernoulli brothers, "especially the younger one" (Johann). Johann Bernoulli grew increasingly unhappy with the accolades bestowed on l'Hôpital's work and complained in private correspondence about being sidelined. After l'Hôpital's death, he publicly revealed their agreement and claimed credit for the statements and portions of the text of ''Analyse'', which were supplied to l'Hôpital in letters. Over a period of many years, Bernoulli made progressively stronger allegations about his role in the writing of ''Analyse'', culminating in the publication of his old work on [[integral calculus]] in 1742: he remarked that this is a continuation of his old lectures on differential calculus, which he discarded since l'Hôpital had already included them in his famous book. For a long time, these claims were not regarded as credible by many historians of mathematics, because l'Hôpital's mathematical talent was not in doubt, while Bernoulli was involved in several other priority disputes. For example, both [[Hieronymus Georg Zeuthen|H. G. Zeuthen]] and [[Moritz Cantor]], writing at the cusp of the 20th century, dismissed Bernoulli's claims on these grounds. However, in 1921 Paul Schafheitlin discovered a manuscript of Bernoulli's lectures on differential calculus from 1691–1692 in the [[Basel University]] library. The text showed remarkable similarities to l'Hôpital's writing, substantiating Bernoulli's account of the book's origin.

L'Hôpital's pedagogical brilliance in arranging and presenting the material remains universally recognized.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Regardless of the exact authorship (one should also note that the book was first published anonymously), ''Analyse'' was remarkably successful in popularizing the ideas of differential calculus stemming from Leibniz.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Personal life==
L'Hôpital married [[:fr:Marie-Charlotte de Romilley de La Chesnelaye|Marie-Charlotte de Romilley de La Chesnelaye]], also a member of the nobility, and the inheritor of large estates in [[Brittany]]. She shared his interest in mathematics. The marriage produced one son and three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLE0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA301 |page=301 |title=L’Hôpital's Analyse des infiniments petits: An Annotated Translation with Source Material by Johann Bernoulli |author1=Robert E Bradley |author2=Salvatore J.

A '''half range Fourier series''' is a [[Fourier series]] defined on an interval &lt;math&gt;[0,L]&lt;/math&gt; instead of the more common &lt;math&gt;[-L,L]&lt;/math&gt;, with the implication that the analyzed function &lt;math&gt;f(x), x\in[0,L]&lt;/math&gt; should be extended to &lt;math&gt;[-L,0]&lt;/math&gt; as either an [[even function|even]] (f(-x)=f(x)) or [[odd function]] (f(-x)=-f(x)).  This allows the expansion of the function in a series solely of sines (odd) or cosines (even).  The choice between odd and even is typically motivated by [[boundary condition]]s associated with a [[differential equation]] satisfied by &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example'''

Calculate the half range Fourier sine series for the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Since we are calculating a sine series,
&lt;math&gt; a_n=0\    \quad     \forall n&lt;/math&gt; 
Now,
&lt;math&gt; b_n= \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\pi \cos(x)\sin(nx)\,\mathrm{d}x
 = \frac{2n((-1)^n+1)}{\pi(n^2-1)}\quad      \forall n\ge 2 &lt;/math&gt;

When n is odd,
&lt;math&gt; b_n=0&lt;/math&gt;
When n is even,
&lt;math&gt;b_n={4n \over \pi(n^2-1)} &lt;/math&gt;
thus
&lt;math&gt;b_{2k}={8k \over \pi(4k^2-1)} &lt;/math&gt;

With the special case &lt;math&gt;b_1=0&lt;/math&gt;, hence the required Fourier sine series is

&lt;math&gt;\cos(x) =  {{8 \over \pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {n \over(4n^2-1)}\sin(2nx)} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Pierre René Jean Baptiste Henri Brocard''' (12 May 1845 &amp;ndash; 16 January 1922) was a [[France|French]] [[meteorologist]] and [[mathematician]], in particular a [[geometer]].&lt;ref name="bio2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mundomatematico.webcindario.com/proyecto_mactutor/biografias/b/bio_brocard.html |title=Pierre René Jean Baptiste Henri Brocard |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217224933/http://mundomatematico.webcindario.com/proyecto_mactutor/biografias/b/bio_brocard.html |archivedate=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known achievement is the invention and discovery of the properties of the [[Brocard points]], the [[Brocard circle]], and the [[Brocard triangle]], all bearing his name.&lt;ref name="wolfram"&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=BrocardPoints|title=Brocard Points}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary mathematician [[Nathan Court]] wrote that he, along with Émile Lemoine and [[Joseph Jean Baptiste Neuberg|Joseph Neuberg]], was one of the three co-founders of modern [[triangle geometry]].&lt;ref name="founder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/tg.html |title=Triangle Geometers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216045627/http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/tg.html |archivedate=2008-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is listed as an Emeritus at the [[International Academy of Science]],&lt;ref name="academy"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Academy of Science Fellows|url=http://www.science.edu/Membership/Fellows/Fellows.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]], and was an officer of the [[Légion d'honneur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ABE2896|title=Courbes géométriques remarquables (courbes spéciales) planes et gauches|first1=Henri|last1=Brocard|first2=T.|last2=Lemoyne|publisher=Vuibert (éd)|location=Paris|year=1919|edition=rééd. 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent most of his life studying [[meteorology]] as an officer in the [[French Navy]], but seems to have made no notable original contributions to the subject.&lt;ref name="bio2"/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years===
Pierre René Jean Baptiste Henri Brocard was born on 12 May 1845, in Vignot (a part of [[Commercy]]), [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] to Elizabeth Auguste Liouville and Jean Sebastien Brocard. He attended the [[Lycée]] in [[Marseilles]] as a young child, and then the [[Lycée]] in [[Strasbourg]]. After graduating from the Lycée he entered the [[Academy]] in [[Strasbourg]] where he was prepared for the examination for entrance to the prestigious [[École Polytechnique]] in [[Paris]], to which he was accepted in 1865.&lt;ref name="mainbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Printonly/Brocard.html|title=Pierre René Jean Baptiste Henri Brocard|first1=J. J.|last1=O'Connor|first2=E. F.|last2=Robertson|authorlink2=Edmund F. Robertson|date=August 2006|work=[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|MacTutor History of Mathematics]]|accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====École Polytechnique and military years====
[[Image:Ecole Polytechnique France seen from lake DSC03389.JPG|thumb|right|The [[École Polytechnique]].]]
Brocard attended the École Polytechnique from 1865 to 1867.&lt;ref name="Guggenbuhl article"/&gt;

As was the norm at the time, he, after graduation, became a technical [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[French military]], which had been reorganized in 1866. He acted as a [[meteorologist]] in the [[French navy]], and general technician as well.

Brocard soon saw active service, as [[Napoleon III]] declared [[war]] upon [[Prussia]]. Brocard was one of the 120,000 men under [[Marshal MacMahon]] led to [[Metz]] to free the [[French army]] of the [[Rhine river|Rhine]]. The French army, however, was defeated on 31 August at the [[Battle of Sedan]], and was taken prisoner along with approximately 83,000 other combatants.&lt;ref name="mainbio"/&gt;

===Middle years===
After Brocard was freed, he returned to his military position and continued teaching, publishing his mathematical articles in the most popular mathematical journal of that time, {{lang|fr|Nouvelles Correspondances Mathématiques}} (also called ''Nouvelles annales mathématiques'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|hdl=2027/mdp.39015065163720|title=''Notes de bibliographie des courbes géométriques'' T. 1|first=Henri|last=Brocard|publisher=Comte-Jacquet|location=Bar Le Duc|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ABQ9972|title=''Notes de bibliographie des courbes géométriques'' T. 2|first=Henri|last=Brocard|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Société Mathématique de France]] in 1873, just a year after its founding. In 1875, he was inducted into the French Association for the Advancement of Science as well as the French Meteorological Society. He was shortly after sent to northern [[Africa]], where he served as a military technician for the French forces stationed in [[Algiers]], the seat of French Africa. While in Algiers, Brocard founded the Meteorological Institute of Algiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Camus|url=http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc40.html}} (3rd paragraph, reference to institute mentioned)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guggenbuhl article"/&gt; Brocard also visited [[Oran]] while in northern Africa, which was occupied by the French in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Springer|first=|last=[[Michiel Hazewinkel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of Brocard points===
During a meeting of the French Association for the Advancement of Science, Brocard presented a self-written article entitled ''Etudes d'un nouveau cercle du plan du triangle'', his first paper on the [[Brocard points]], the [[Brocard triangle]], and the [[Brocard circle]], all of which today bear his name.&lt;ref name="Guggenbuhl article"&gt;{{harvtxt|Guggenbuhl|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1884 Brocard returned to France. He served with the Meteorological Commission in [[Montpellier]] before moving to [[Grenoble]] and lastly [[Bar-le-duc]]. He honorably retired from the French military in 1910 as a [[lieutenant colonel]]. His remaining two major publications were ''Notes de bibliographie des courbes géométriques'' (1897, 1899, published in two volumes)&lt;ref name="Guggenbuhl article"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Maria do Céu |last1=Silva |first2=António Leal |last2=Duarte |first3=Carlos Correia |last3=de Sá |title=Gallery: Francisco Gomes Teixeira |journal=CIM Bulletin |publisher=Centro Internacional de Matemática |volume=16 |date=June 2004 |url=http://at.yorku.ca/i/a/a/h/61.dir/number16.htm |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716134701/https://at.yorku.ca/i/a/a/h/61.dir/number16.htm |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Courbes géométriques remarquables'' (1920, posthumous 1967, also published in two volumes) which was written in collaboration with T. Lemoyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=H.|last1=Brocard|first2=T.|last2=Lemoyne|title=Courbes Géométriques Remarquables (Courbes Spéciales) Planes &amp; Gauches, Tome I|location=Paris|publisher=Librairie Vuibert|year=1919|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sEI7AQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brocard attended the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] at [[Zurich]] in 1897, [[Paris]] in 1900, [[Heidelberg]] in 1904, [[Rome]] in 1908, [[Cambridge, England]] in 1912, and [[Strasbourg]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="Guggenbuhl article"/&gt;

Brocard spent the last years of his life in [[Bar-le-Duc]]. He was offered the presidency of Bar-le-Duc's ''Letters, Sciences, and Arts Society'', of which he had been a longtime member and correspondent for several foreign academies of, but declined. He died on 16 January 1922 while on a trip to [[Kensington]], [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="mainbio"/&gt;

==Contributions==

===Brocard triangle, Brocard circle, and Brocard points===
[[Image:Brocard point.svg|thumb|left|A diagram of the [[Brocard point]].]]
{{main|Brocard points|Brocard circle|Brocard triangle}}
Brocard's most well-known contributions to mathematics are the [[Brocard point]]s, the [[Brocard circle]], and the [[Brocard triangle]]. The positive Brocard point (sometimes known as the first Brocard point) of a [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] plane [[triangle]] is the interior [[Point (geometry)|point]] of the triangle for which the three angles formed by two of the vertices and the point are equal. Their common value is the Brocard angle of the triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math Trek - Brocard points|url=http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_7_16_01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brocard circle of the triangle is a [[circle]] having a [[diameter]] of the [[line segment]] between the [[circumcenter]] and [[symmedian]]. It contains the [[Brocard points]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=BrocardCircle|title=Brocard Circle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brocard triangle of a [[triangle]] is a triangle formed by the [[Line-line intersection|intersection]] of [[Line (geometry)|line]] from a vertex to its corresponding [[Brocard point]] and a line from another vertex to its corresponding Brocard point and the other two points constructed using different combinations of vertices and Brocard points. The Brocard triangle is inscribed in the [[Brocard circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=FirstBrocardTriangle|title=First Brocard Triangle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other mathematical contributions===
Brocard published various other papers on [[mathematics]] during his time at [[Bar-le-duc]], none of which became as well known as ''Etudes d'un nouveau cercle du plan du triangle''. He also conjured up a famous unsolved problem thought to have no answers other than the three he provided. This problem is called [[Brocard's problem|Brocard's Problem]]. One other achievement of his is guessing at the meaning of the cryptic title of one of [[Girard Desargues]]' papers, ''DALG''. In his paper ''Analyse d'autographes et autres écrits de Girard Desargues'', he surmised that it stood for ''Des Argues, Lyonnais, Géometre'', which is the generally accepted title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Récréations Mathématiques (1624): A Study on its Authorship, Sources and Influence 2004 |url=http://logica.rug.ac.be/albrecht/thesis/Etten-intro.pdf |first=Alfred |last=Heefer }}{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meteorology===
[[Image:Algieruniversity.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Algiers]] administrates the Meteorological Society which Brocard founded. ]]
Though Brocard made no major notable original discoveries in [[meteorology]], he founded the Meteorological Institute in [[Algiers]] and served as a meteorological technician during his time in the French military. He also published several notable papers on meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henri Brocard Biography |url=http://202.38.126.65/navigate/math/history/Mathematicians/Brocard.html }}{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bio3"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pierre René Jean Baptiste Henri Brocard|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=29|issue=7|pages=278–9|date=August 1922|jstor=2299238}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-25--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jules Henri Poincaré''' ({{IPAc-en|p|w|æ̃|k|ɑː|ˈ|r|eɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/poincare "Poincaré"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi pwɛ̃kaʁe|lang|Fr-Henri Poincaré.ogg}};&lt;ref name="forvo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forvo.com/word/poincar%C3%A9/ |title=Poincaré pronunciation: How to pronounce Poincaré in French |publisher=forvo.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pronouncekiwi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pronouncekiwi.com/Henri%20Poincaré |title=Poincaré pronunciation: How to pronounce Poincaré in French |publisher=pronouncekiwi.com|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 29 April 1854&amp;nbsp;– 17 July 1912) was a French [[mathematician]], [[theoretical physicist]], engineer, and [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]]. He is often described as a [[polymath]], and in mathematics as "The Last Universalist,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=J. M. | last1=Ginoux | first2=C. | last2=Gerini | title=Henri Poincaré: A Biography Through the Daily Papers  | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4556-61-3 | doi=10.1142/8956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime.

As a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to [[Pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[celestial mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadamard, Jacques|authorlink=Jacques Hadamard|title=The early scientific work of Henri Poincaré|journal=The Rice Institute Pamphlet|date=July 1922|volume=9|issue=3|pages=111–183|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100592035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for formulating the [[Poincaré conjecture]], which was one of the most famous [[unsolved problems in mathematics]] until it was solved in 2002–2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]]. In his research on the [[three-body problem]], Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern [[chaos theory]]. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of [[topology]].

Poincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the [[Lorentz transformations]] in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to [[Hendrik Lorentz]] in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of [[Maxwell's equations]], an important step in the formulation of the theory of [[special relativity]]. In 1905, Poincaré first proposed [[gravitational wave]]s (''ondes gravifiques'') emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations.

The [[Poincaré group]] used in physics and mathematics was named after him.

==Life==
Poincaré was born on 29 April 1854 in Cité Ducale neighborhood, [[Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle]] into an influential family.&lt;ref&gt;Belliver, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; His father Leon Poincaré (1828–1892) was a professor of medicine at the [[University of Nancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sagaret, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher [[Emile Boutroux]]. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, [[Raymond Poincaré]], a fellow member of the [[Académie française]], who would serve as President of France from 1913 to 1920.&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;[http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/p/poincare.htm The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Jules Henri Poincaré article by Mauro Murzi&amp;nbsp;– Retrieved November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré was raised in the Roman Catholic faith, but later left the religion. He became a [[freethinker]], believing the universe to be sufficient truth and was said to be an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCabe (1945).

===Education===
[[File:Henri Poincaré maison natale Nancy plaque.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Plaque on the birthplace of Henri Poincaré at house number 117 on the Grande Rue in the city of Nancy.]]

During his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with [[diphtheria]] and received special instruction from his mother, Eugénie Launois (1830–1897).

In 1862, Henri entered the Lycée in [[Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Nancy]] (now renamed the {{ill|Lycée Henri-Poincaré|fr}} in his honour, along with [[Henri Poincaré University]], also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lycée and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a "monster of mathematics" and he won first prizes in the [[concours général]], a competition between the top pupils from all the Lycées across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as "average at best".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Carl, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the Lycée in 1871 with a bachelor's degree in letters and sciences.

During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.

Poincaré entered the [[École Polytechnique]] in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of [[Charles Hermite]], continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (''Démonstration nouvelle des propriétés de l'indicatrice d'une surface'') in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the [[École des Mines]], while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.&lt;ref&gt;F. Verhulst&lt;/ref&gt;

As a graduate of the École des Mines, he joined the [[Corps des Mines]] as an inspector for the [[Vesoul]] region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at [[Magny-lès-Jussey|Magny]] in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way.

At the same time, Poincaré was preparing for his [[Doctorate in Science]] in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of [[differential equations]]. It was named ''Sur les propriétés des fonctions définies par les équations aux différences partielles''. Poincaré devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the [[solar system]]. Poincaré graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1879.

[[Image:Young Poincare.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The young Henri Poincaré]]

===First scientific achievements===
After receiving his degree, Poincaré began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the [[Caen University|University of Caen]] in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of [[automorphic function]]s.

There, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulin d'Andesi (Louise Poulain d'Andecy) and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and Léon (born 1893).

Poincaré immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincaré was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the [[University of Paris]]; he accepted the invitation. During the years of 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in [[École Polytechnique]].

In 1881–1882, Poincaré created a new branch of mathematics: [[qualitative theory of differential equations]]. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in [[celestial mechanics]] and [[mathematical physics]].

===Career===
He never fully abandoned his mining career to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps de Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.

Beginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]). He was initially appointed as the ''maître de conférences d'analyse'' (associate professor of analysis).&lt;ref&gt;Sageret, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of Probability, and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.

In 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincaré was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the [[Académie française]] on 5 March 1908.

In 1887, he won [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II, King of Sweden]]'s mathematical competition for a resolution of the [[three-body problem]] concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See [[#Three-body problem|three-body problem]] section below.)

[[File:Poincaré gravestone.jpg|upright|thumb|The Poincaré family grave at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]
In 1893, Poincaré joined the French [[Bureau des Longitudes]], which engaged him in the [[Clock synchronization|synchronisation of time]] around the world. In 1897 Poincaré backed an unsuccessful proposal for the [[Decimal degrees|decimalisation of circular measure]], and hence time and [[longitude]].&lt;ref&gt;see Galison 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See [[#Work on relativity|work on relativity]] section below.)

In 1899, and again more successfully in 1904, he intervened in the trials of [[Alfred Dreyfus]]. He attacked the spurious scientific claims of some of the evidence brought against Dreyfus, who was a Jewish officer in the French army charged with treason by colleagues.

Poincaré was the President of the [[Société astronomique de France|Société Astronomique de France (SAF)]], the French astronomical society, from 1901 to 1903.&lt;ref name=BSAF1911&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9626551q/f616.item ''Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France'', 1911, vol. 25, pp. 581–586]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Students====
Poincaré had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, [[Louis Bachelier]] (1900) and [[Dimitrie Pompeiu]] (1905).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=34227 Mathematics Genealogy Project] North Dakota State University. Retrieved April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===

In 1912, Poincaré underwent surgery for a [[prostate]] problem and subsequently died from an [[embolism]] on 17 July 1912, in Paris. He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincaré family vault in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse|Cemetery of Montparnasse]], Paris.

A former French Minister of Education, [[Claude Allègre]], proposed in 2004 that Poincaré be reburied in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens only of the highest honour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041127160356/http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribunes/dossier/allegre/dossier.asp?ida=430274 Lorentz, Poincaré et Einstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Summary===
Poincaré made many contributions to different fields of pure and applied mathematics such as: [[celestial mechanics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[optics]], electricity, [[telegraphy]], [[capillarity]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[thermodynamics]], [[potential theory]], [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[theory of relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]].

===Three-body problem===
The problem of finding the general solution to the motion of more than two orbiting bodies in the solar system had eluded mathematicians since [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] time. This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]], where ''n'' is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The ''n''-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II, King of Sweden]], advised by [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]], established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each [[inverse-square law|according to Newton's law]], under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincaré, even though he did not solve the original problem. One of the judges, the distinguished [[Karl Weierstrass]], said, ''"This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics."'' (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu&lt;ref name=diacu&gt;{{Citation

{{main|Lorentz ether theory|History of special relativity}}

====Local time====
Poincaré's work at the Bureau des Longitudes on establishing international time zones led him to consider how clocks at rest on the Earth, which would be moving at different speeds relative to absolute space (or the "[[luminiferous aether]]"), could be synchronised. At the same time Dutch theorist [[Hendrik Lorentz]] was developing Maxwell's theory into a theory of the motion of charged particles ("electrons" or "ions"), and their interaction with radiation. In 1895 Lorentz had introduced an auxiliary quantity (without physical interpretation) called "local time"  &lt;math&gt;t^\prime = t-v x/c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A broader view of relativity: general implications of Lorentz and Poincaré invariance|volume=10|first1=Jong-Ping|last1=Hsu|first2=Leonardo|last2=Hsu|publisher=World Scientific|year=2006|isbn=978-981-256-651-5|page=37

and introduced the hypothesis of [[length contraction]] to explain the failure of optical and electrical experiments to detect motion relative to the aether (see [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Poincaré was a constant interpreter (and sometimes friendly critic) of Lorentz's theory. Poincaré as a philosopher was interested in the "deeper meaning". Thus he interpreted Lorentz's theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In [[s:The Measure of Time|The Measure of Time]] (1898), Poincaré said, "
A little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning. They can have one only as the result of a convention." He also argued that scientists have to set the constancy of the speed of light as a [[postulate]] to give physical theories the simplest form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Based on these assumptions he discussed in 1900 Lorentz's "wonderful invention" of local time and remarked that it arose when moving clocks are synchronised by exchanging light signals assumed to travel with the same speed in both directions in a moving frame.&lt;ref name=action&gt;{{Citation

{{Further|History of Lorentz transformations#Poincare|History of Lorentz transformations#Poincare2|label1=History of Lorentz transformations - Poincaré (1881)|label2=History of Lorentz transformations - Poincaré (1905)}}

In 1881 Poincaré described [[hyperbolic geometry]] in terms of Weierstrass coordinates of the [[hyperboloid model]]. There, he formulated transformations leaving invariant the [[Lorentz interval]] &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2-z^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;, which makes them mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz transformations in 2+1 dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Poincaré, H.|year=1881|title=Sur les applications de la géométrie non-euclidienne à la théorie des formes quadratiques|journal=Association Française Pour l'Avancement des Sciences|volume=10|pages=132–138|url=http://henripoincarepapers.univ-lorraine.fr/chp/hp-pdf/hp1881af.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Reynolds, W.

He discussed the "principle of relative motion" in two papers in 1900&lt;ref name=action /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

and named it the [[principle of relativity]] in 1904, according to which no physical experiment can discriminate between a state of uniform motion and a state of rest.&lt;ref name=louis&gt;{{Citation|author=Poincaré, Henri|year=1913|chapter=[[s:The Principles of Mathematical Physics|The Principles of Mathematical Physics]]|title=The Foundations of Science (The Value of Science)|pages=297–320|publisher=Science Press|place=New York|postscript=; article translated from 1904 original}} available in [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Foundations_of_Science.html?id=mBvNabP35zoC&amp;pg=PA297 online chapter from 1913 book]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1905 Poincaré wrote to Lorentz about Lorentz's paper of 1904, which Poincaré described as a "paper of supreme importance." In this letter he pointed out an error Lorentz had made when he had applied his transformation to one of Maxwell's equations, that for charge-occupied space, and also questioned the time dilation factor given by Lorentz.&lt;ref name="univ-lorraine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://henripoincarepapers.univ-lorraine.fr/chp/text/lorentz3.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006190045/http://henripoincarepapers.univ-lorraine.fr/chp/text/lorentz3.xml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 October 2014 |title=Letter from Poincaré to Lorentz, Mai 1905 |publisher=henripoincarepapers.univ-lorraine.fr|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a second letter to Lorentz, Poincaré gave his own reason why Lorentz's time dilation factor was indeed correct after all—it was necessary to make the Lorentz transformation form a group—and he gave what is now known as the relativistic velocity-addition law.&lt;ref name="univ-lorraine2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://henripoincarepapers.univ-lorraine.fr/chp/text/lorentz4.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006134323/http://henripoincarepapers.univ-lorraine.fr/chp/text/lorentz4.xml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 October 2014 |title=Letter from Poincaré to Lorentz, Mai 1905 |publisher=henripoincarepapers.univ-lorraine.fr|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Poincaré later delivered a paper at the meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris on 5 June 1905 in which these issues were addressed. In the published version of that he wrote:&lt;ref name=short&gt;{{Citation | author=Poincaré, H. | year=1905 | title=Sur la dynamique de l'électron (On the Dynamics of the Electron) | journal=Comptes Rendus | volume =140 | pages =1504–1508}} (Wikisource translation)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form:
::&lt;math&gt;x^\prime = k\ell\left(x + \varepsilon t\right)\!,\;t^\prime = k\ell\left(t + \varepsilon x\right)\!,\;y^\prime = \ell y,\;z^\prime = \ell z,\;k = 1/\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and showed that the arbitrary function &lt;math&gt;\ell\left(\varepsilon\right)&lt;/math&gt; must be unity for all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; (Lorentz had set &lt;math&gt;\ell = 1&lt;/math&gt; by a different argument) to make the transformations form a group. In an enlarged version of the paper that appeared in 1906 Poincaré pointed out that the combination &lt;math&gt;x^2+ y^2+ z^2- c^2t^2&lt;/math&gt; is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. He noted that a Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing &lt;math&gt;ct\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of [[four-vector]]s.&lt;ref name=long&gt;{{Citation

====Mass–energy relation====
Like [[Mass–energy equivalence#Electromagnetic rest mass|others]] before, Poincaré (1900) discovered a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying the conflict between the [[Newton's laws of motion|action/reaction principle]] and [[Lorentz ether theory]], he tried to determine whether the [[center of gravity]] still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included.&lt;ref name=action /&gt; He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious [[fluid]] (''fluide fictif'') with a mass density of ''E''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If the [[center of mass frame]] is defined by both the mass of matter ''and'' the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it's neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.

However, Poincaré's resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a [[recoil]] from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a [[Lorentz boost]] (to order ''v''/''c'') to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow [[perpetual motion]], a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.

Poincaré himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904).&lt;ref name=louis /&gt; This time (and later also in 1908) he rejected&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1981, Secondary sources on relativity&lt;/ref&gt; the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized the ether solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:

{{quote|The apparatus will recoil as if it were a cannon and the projected energy a ball, and that contradicts the principle of Newton, since our present projectile has no mass; it is not matter, it is energy. [..] Shall we say that the space which separates the oscillator from the receiver and which the disturbance must traverse in passing from one to the other, is not empty, but is filled not only with ether, but with air, or even in inter-planetary space with some subtile, yet ponderable fluid; that this matter receives the shock, as does the receiver, at the moment the energy reaches it, and recoils, when the disturbance leaves it? That would save Newton's principle, but it is not true. If the energy during its propagation remained always attached to some material substratum, this matter would carry the light along with it and Fizeau has shown, at least for the air, that there is nothing of the kind. Michelson and Morley have since confirmed this. We might also suppose that the motions of matter proper were exactly compensated by those of the ether; but that would lead us to the same considerations as those made a moment ago. The principle, if thus interpreted, could explain anything, since whatever the visible motions we could imagine hypothetical motions to compensate them. But if it can explain anything, it will allow us to foretell nothing; it will not allow us to choose between the various possible hypotheses, since it explains everything in advance. It therefore becomes useless. }}

He also discussed two other unexplained effects: (1) non-conservation of mass implied by Lorentz's variable mass &lt;math&gt;\gamma m&lt;/math&gt;, Abraham's theory of variable mass and [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Kaufmann]]'s experiments on the mass of fast moving electrons and (2) the non-conservation of energy in the radium experiments of [[Madame Curie]].

It was [[Albert Einstein]]'s concept of [[mass–energy equivalence]] (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''E''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that resolved&lt;ref name=darrigol&gt;Darrigol 2005, Secondary sources on relativity&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré's paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Einstein, A. |year=1905b |title=Ist die Trägheit eines Körpers von dessen Energieinhalt abhängig? |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=18 |issue=13 |pages=639–643 |bibcode=1905AnP...323..639E |doi=10.1002/andp.19053231314 |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_18_639-641.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050124051500/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_18_639-641.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 January 2005 |df=dmy-all }}.

====Gravitational waves====
In 1905 Henri Poincaré first proposed [[gravitational waves]] (''ondes gravifiques'') emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Poincare/Poincare_pdf/Poincare_CR1905.pdf] (PDF) Membres de l'Académie des sciences depuis sa création : Henri Poincare. Sur la dynamique de l' electron.  Note de H. Poincaré. C.R. T.140 (1905) 1504–1508.&lt;/ref&gt;   ''"Il importait d'examiner cette hypothèse de plus près et en particulier de rechercher quelles modifications elle nous obligerait à apporter aux lois de la gravitation. C'est ce que j'ai cherché à déterminer ; j'ai été d'abord conduit à supposer que la propagation de la gravitation n'est pas instantanée, mais se fait avec la vitesse de la lumière."''

====Poincaré and Einstein====
Einstein's first paper on relativity was published three months after Poincaré's short paper,&lt;ref name=short /&gt; but before Poincaré's longer version.&lt;ref name=long /&gt; Einstein relied on the principle of relativity to derive the Lorentz transformations and used a similar clock synchronisation procedure ([[Einstein synchronisation]]) to the one that Poincaré (1900) had described, but Einstein's paper was remarkable in that it contained no references at all. Poincaré never acknowledged Einstein's work on [[special relativity]]. However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincaré's outlook obliquely in a letter to [[Hans Vaihinger]] on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger's general outlook to be close to his own and Poincaré's to be close to Vaihinger's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein |url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-trans/52 |publisher=Princeton U.P. |accessdate=13 December 2014}}  See also this letter, with commentary, in {{cite journal |last=Sass |first=Hans-Martin | authorlink = Hans-Martin Sass|date=1979 |title=Einstein über "wahre Kultur" und die Stellung der Geometrie im Wissenschaftssystem:  Ein Brief Albert Einsteins an Hans Vaihinger vom Jahre 1919 |journal=[[Zeitschrift für allgemeine Wissenschaftstheorie]] |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=316–319 |jstor=25170513 |language=de |doi=10.1007/bf01802352}}&lt;/ref&gt; In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincaré posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 called ''Geometrie und Erfahrung'' in connection with [[non-Euclidean geometry]], but not in connection with special relativity. A few years before his death, Einstein commented on Poincaré as being one of the pioneers of relativity, saying "Lorentz had already recognised that the transformation named after him is essential for the analysis of Maxwell's equations, and Poincaré deepened this insight still further ...."&lt;ref&gt;Darrigol 2004, Secondary sources on relativity&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assessments on Poincaré and relativity====
{{Further|History of special relativity|Relativity priority dispute}}
Poincaré's work in the development of special relativity is well recognised,&lt;ref name=darrigol /&gt; though most historians stress that despite many similarities with Einstein's work, the two had very different research agendas and interpretations of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Galison 2003 and Kragh 1999, Secondary sources on relativity&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection to signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to use the ether-concept in his papers and argued that clocks at rest in the ether show the "true" time, and moving clocks show the local time. So Poincaré tried to keep the relativity principle in accordance with classical concepts, while Einstein developed a mathematically equivalent kinematics based on the new physical concepts of the relativity of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Holton (1988), 196–206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hentschel (1990), 3–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), 216–217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darrigol (2005), 15–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katzir (2005), 286–288&lt;/ref&gt;

While this is the view of most historians, a minority go much further, such as [[E. T. Whittaker]], who held that Poincaré and Lorentz were the true discoverers of relativity.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker 1953, Secondary sources on relativity&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algebra and number theory===
Poincaré introduced [[group theory]] to physics, and was the first to study the group of [[Lorentz transformations]].&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, Selected works in three volumes. page = 682&lt;/ref&gt; He also made major contributions to the theory of discrete groups and their representations.
[[Image:Mug and Torus morph.gif|right|frame |50px |&lt;center&gt;Topological transformation of the torus into a mug &lt;center&gt;]]

===Topology===
The subject is clearly defined by [[Felix Klein]] in his "Erlangen Program" (1872): the geometry invariants of arbitrary continuous transformation, a kind of geometry. The term "topology" was introduced, as suggested by [[Johann Benedict Listing]], instead of previously used "Analysis situs". Some important concepts were introduced by [[Enrico Betti]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincaré. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;J. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history. pages = 419–435&lt;/ref&gt;

His research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of [[homotopy]] and [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]]. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the [[fundamental group]]. Poincaré proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of ''n''-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler–Poincaré theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.&lt;ref&gt;PS Aleksandrov, Poincaré and topology. pages = 27–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy and celestial mechanics===
[[File:N-body problem (3).gif|frame|left|150px |  &lt;center&gt; Chaotic motion in three-body problem (computer simulation).]]
Poincaré published two now classical monographs, "New Methods of Celestial Mechanics" (1892–1899) and "Lectures on Celestial Mechanics" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincaré showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V7mxZqjs5yUC&amp;pg=PA254 page 254]&lt;/ref&gt;

These monographs include an idea of Poincaré, which later became the base for mathematical "[[chaos theory]]" (see, in particular, the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]]) and the general theory of [[dynamical system]]s.
Poincaré authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincaré received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).&lt;ref&gt;A. Kozenko, The theory of planetary figures, pages = 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential equations and mathematical physics===
After defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincaré wrote a series of memoirs under the title "On curves defined by differential equations" (1881–1882).&lt;ref&gt;French: "Mémoire sur les courbes définies par une équation différentielle"&lt;/ref&gt; In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called "[[qualitative theory of differential equations]]". Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincaré investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincaré also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of [[mathematical physics]] and [[celestial mechanics]], and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century Vol = 3. page = 283 {{isbn|978-3764358457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century. pages = 162–174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
[[File:Henri Poincaré by H Manuel.jpg|thumb|right|Photographic portrait of H. Poincaré by Henri Manuel]]
Poincaré's work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincaré was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.

The mathematician Darboux claimed he was ''un intuitif'' (intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. He did not care about being rigorous and disliked logic. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}} (Despite this opinion, [[Jacques Hadamard]] wrote that Poincaré's research demonstrated marvelous clarity&lt;ref&gt;J. Hadamard. L'oeuvre de H. Poincaré. Acta Mathematica, 38 (1921), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and Poincaré himself wrote that he  &lt;!-- TODO: Add Poincaré's opinion on rigorousness, see http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook/American_Journal_of_Mathematics_1890_v12_1000084889#233 — Each time I can I'm absolute rigour --&gt; believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas.)

===Toulouse's characterisation===
Poincaré's mental organisation was not only interesting to Poincaré himself but also to Édouard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled ''Henri Poincaré'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;[http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAS9989.0001.001 Toulouse, Édouard, 1910. ''Henri Poincaré'', E. Flammarion, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Henri Poincare|author=Toulouse, E.|date=2013|publisher=MPublishing|isbn=9781418165062|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mpjWPQAACAAJ|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he discussed Poincaré's regular schedule:
* He worked during the same times each day in short periods of time. He undertook mathematical research for four hours a day, between 10&amp;nbsp;a.m. and noon then again from 5&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 7&amp;nbsp;p.m.. He would read articles in journals later in the evening.
* His normal work habit was to solve a problem completely in his head, then commit the completed problem to paper.
* He was ambidextrous and nearsighted.
* His ability to visualise what he heard proved particularly useful when he attended lectures, since his eyesight was so poor that he could not see properly what the lecturer wrote on the blackboard.

These abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:
* He was physically clumsy and artistically inept.
* He was always in a rush and disliked going back for changes or corrections.
* He never spent a long time on a problem since he believed that the subconscious would continue working on the problem while he consciously worked on another problem.

In addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincaré started from basic principles each time (O'Connor et al., 2002).

His method of thinking is well summarised as:

{{quote|text=''Habitué à négliger les détails et à ne regarder que les cimes, il passait de l'une à l'autre avec une promptitude surprenante et les faits qu'il découvrait se groupant d'eux-mêmes autour de leur centre étaient instantanément et automatiquement classés dans sa mémoire.'' (Accustomed to neglecting details and to looking only at mountain tops, he went from one peak to another with surprising rapidity, and the facts he discovered, clustering around their center, were instantly and automatically pigeonholed in his memory.)|sign=Belliver (1956)}}

===Attitude towards transfinite numbers===
Poincaré was dismayed by [[Georg Cantor]]'s theory of [[transfinite number]]s, and referred to it as a "disease" from which mathematics would eventually be cured.&lt;ref name="daub266"&gt;Dauben 1979, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;
Poincaré said, "There is no actual infinite; the Cantorians have forgotten this, and that is why they have fallen into contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The fact that renowned theoretical physicists like Poincaré, Boltzmann or Gibbs were not awarded the Nobel Prize is seen as evidence that the Nobel committee had more regard for experimentation than theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Elizabeth|title=Nobel: Always the Winners, Never the Losers|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=13 November 1998|volume=282|issue=5392|pages=1256–1257|doi=10.1126/science.282.5392.1256|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/282/5392/1256.%20full|bibcode = 1998Sci...282.1256C }}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nastasi|first1=Pietro|title=A Nobel Prize for Poincaré?|journal=Lettera Matematica|date=16 May 2013|volume=1|issue=1–2|pages=79–82|doi=10.1007/s40329-013-0005-1|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/888/art:10.1007/s40329-013-0005-1.pdf?originUrl=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40329-013-0005-1&amp;token2=exp=1443095857~acl=/static/pdf/888/art%3A10.1007%2Fs40329-013-0005-1.pdf?originUrl=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40329-013-0005-1*~hmac=e3b3232b522ae46f6a45a2cd546f3ebca45f455c206c3af2d2c7dd78495c4ce1|accessdate=24 September 2015}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Poincaré's case, several of those who nominated him pointed out that the greatest problem was to name a specific discovery, invention, or technique.&lt;ref name="gray-biography"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Poincaré had philosophical views opposite to those of [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], who believed that mathematics was a branch of [[logic]]. Poincaré strongly disagreed, claiming that [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] was the life of mathematics. Poincaré gives an interesting point of view in his book ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'':

{{quote|text=For a superficial observer, scientific truth is beyond the possibility of doubt; the logic of science is infallible, and if the scientists are sometimes mistaken, this is only from their mistaking its rule.}}

Poincaré believed that [[arithmetic]] is a [[Analytic/synthetic distinction|synthetic]] science. He argued that [[Peano's axioms]] cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' synthetic and not analytic. Poincaré then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of [[Immanuel Kant]] (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian [[set theory]], objecting to its use of [[Impredicativity|impredicative]] definitions{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

However, Poincaré did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincaré believed that the structure of [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean space]] can be known analytically. Poincaré held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as "[[conventionalism]]". Poincaré believed that [[Newton's first law]] was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author= Gargani Julien|title=Poincaré, le hasard et l'étude des systèmes complexes|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=2012|page=124
|url=http://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&amp;obj=livre&amp;no=38754}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincaré thought that we were so accustomed to [[Euclidean geometry]] that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to a non-Euclidean physical geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Science and Hypothesis|first1=Henri |last1=Poincaré |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-60206-505-5 |page=50

===Free will===
Poincaré's famous lectures before the Société de Psychologie in Paris (published as ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'', ''[[The Value of Science]]'', and ''Science and Method'') were cited by [[Jacques Hadamard]] as the source for the idea that creativity and invention consist of two mental stages, first random combinations of possible solutions to a problem, followed by a critical evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamard, Jacques. ''An Essay on the Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field''. Princeton Univ Press (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he most often spoke of a deterministic universe, Poincaré said that the subconscious generation of new possibilities involves [[Randomness|chance]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind in a kind of sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Method'', Chapter 3, Mathematical Discovery, 1914, pp.58&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Poincaré's two stages—random combinations followed by selection—became the basis for [[Daniel Dennett]]'s two-stage model of free will.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C. 1978. Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology. The MIT Press, p.293&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''hierarchy''' is a set-theoretical object, consisting of a [[preorder]] defined on a set. This is often referred to as an [[ordered set]], though that is an ambiguous term that many authors reserve for [[partially ordered set]]s or [[totally ordered set]]s. The term ''pre-ordered set'' is unambiguous, and is always synonymous with a mathematical hierarchy. The term ''hierarchy'' is used to stress a ''[[hierarchical]]'' relation among the elements.

Sometimes, a set comes equipped with a natural hierarchical structure. For example, the set of natural numbers ''N'' is equipped with a natural pre-order structure, where &lt;math&gt;n \le n'&lt;/math&gt; whenever we can find some other number &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;n + m = n'&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; is bigger than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; only because we can get to &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; ''using'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. This is true for any commutative monoid. On the other hand, the set of integers ''Z'' requires a more sophisticated argument for its hierarchical structure, since we can always solve the equation &lt;math&gt;n + m = n'&lt;/math&gt; by writing &lt;math&gt;m = (n'-n)&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013 |reason="The argument should be provided here in the text."}}

A mathematical hierarchy (a pre-ordered set) should not be confused with the more general concept of a [[hierarchy]] in the social realm, particularly when one is constructing computational models which are used to describe real-world social, economic or political systems. These hierarchies, or [[complex networks]], are much too rich to be described in the category [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Set Set] of sets.&lt;ref&gt;We may need a bigger [[topos]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is not just a pedantic claim; there are also mathematical hierarchies which are not describable using set theory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Another natural hierarchy arises in [[computer science]], where the word refers to [[poset|partially ordered set]]s whose elements are [[class (set theory)|classes]] of objects of increasing [[complexity]]. In that case, the preorder defining the hierarchy is the class-containment relation. [[Containment hierarchy|Containment hierarchies]] are thus special cases of hierarchies.

==Related terminology==
Individual elements of a hierarchy are often called '''levels''' and a hierarchy is said to be infinite if it has infinitely many distinct levels but said to '''collapse''' if it has only finitely many distinct levels.

==Example==
In [[theoretical computer science]], the [[time hierarchy]] is a classification of [[decision problem]]s according to the amount of time required to solve them.

'''Infinite divisibility''' arises in different ways in [[philosophy]], [[physics]], [[economics]], [[order theory]] (a branch of mathematics), and [[probability theory]] (also a branch of mathematics). One may speak of infinite divisibility, or the lack thereof, of [[matter]], [[space]], [[time]], [[money]], or abstract mathematical objects such as the [[continuum (theory)|continuum]].

== In philosophy ==

The idea of divisibility of matter  was first proposed by Indian philosopher [[Kanada (philosopher)]] around 500 BCE
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9RAwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA15&amp;dq=maharshi+Kanad#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Science Springboard 9th|isbn=9789332585164|last1=Education|first1=Pearson|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory is explored in [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|dialogue Timaeus]] and was also supported by [[Aristotle]]. [[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] gives a lucid account of infinite divisibility in the first few pages of his ''Atomism and its Critics''. There he shows how infinite divisibility involves the idea that there is some [[extended item]], such as an apple, which can be divided infinitely many times, where one never divides down to point, or to atoms of any sort. Many professional philosophers{{who|date=September 2012}} claim that infinite divisibility involves either a collection of ''an infinite number of items'' (since there are infinite divisions, there must be an infinite collection of objects), or (more rarely), ''point-sized items'', or both. Pyle states that the mathematics of infinitely divisible extensions involve neither of these — that there are infinite divisions, but only finite collections of objects and they never are divided down to point extension-less items.

Zeno [[Zeno's paradoxes#Arrow paradox|questioned]] how an arrow can move if at one moment it is here and motionless and at a later moment be somewhere else and motionless, like a motion picture.
{{quote|Zeno's reasoning, however, is fallacious, when he says that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. This is false, for time is not composed of indivisible moments any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html#752 |work=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics |author=Aristotle}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Aristotle|''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' VI:9, 239b5}}
In reference to Zeno's paradox of the arrow in flight, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] writes that "an infinite number of acts of becoming may take place in a finite time if each subsequent act is smaller in a convergent series":&lt;ref name="Ross1983" /&gt;
{{quote|The argument, so far as it is valid, elicits a contradiction from the two premises: (i) that in a becoming something (''res vera'') becomes, and (ii) that every act of becoming is divisible into earlier and later sections which are themselves acts of becoming. Consider, for example, an act of becoming during one second. The act is divisible into two acts, one during the earlier half of the second, the other during the later half of the second. Thus that which becomes during the whole second presupposes that which becomes during the first half-second. Analogously, that which becomes during the first half-second presupposes that which becomes during the first quarter-second, and so on indefinitely. Thus if we consider the process of becoming up to the beginning of the second in question, and ask what then becomes, no answer can be given. For, whatever creature we indicate presupposes an earlier creature which became after the beginning of the second and antecedently to the indicated creature. Therefore there is nothing which becomes, so as to effect a transition into the second in question.&lt;ref name="Ross1983"&gt;{{cite book |first=S.D. |last=Ross |year=1983 |title=Perspective in Whitehead's Metaphysics |series=Suny Series in Systematic Philosophy |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-87395-658-1 |lccn=82008332 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exbYBj8aO8QC&amp;pg=PA182 |pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;|A.N. Whitehead|''[[Process and Reality]]''}}

==In physics==

Until the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]], no distinction was made between the question of whether matter is infinitely divisible and the question of whether matter can be ''cut'' into smaller parts [[ad infinitum]].

As a result, the Greek word ''átomos'' (''ἄτομος''), which literally means "uncuttable", is usually translated as "indivisible". Whereas the modern atom is indeed divisible, it actually is uncuttable: there is no [[Partition of a set|partition]] of space such that its parts correspond to material parts of the atom. In other words, the quantum-mechanical description of matter no longer conforms to the cookie cutter paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=quant-ph/0009001v2 |title=Quantum Mechanics and the Cookie Cutter Paradigm|author=Ulrich Mohrhoff|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This casts fresh light on the ancient [[Logic|conundrum]] of the divisibility of matter. The multiplicity of a material object&amp;mdash;the number of its parts&amp;mdash;depends on the existence, not of delimiting surfaces, but of internal spatial relations (relative positions between parts), and these lack determinate values. According to the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, the particles that make up an atom&amp;mdash;[[quark]]s and [[electron]]s&amp;mdash;are [[point particle]]s: they do not take up space. What makes an atom nevertheless take up space is ''not'' any spatially extended "stuff" that "occupies space", and that might be cut into smaller and smaller pieces, ''but'' the [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminacy]] of its internal spatial relations.

Physical space is often regarded as infinitely divisible: it is thought that any region in space, no matter how small, could be further split. [[Time]] is similarly considered as infinitely divisible.

However, the pioneering work of [[Max Planck]] (1858&amp;ndash;1947) in the field of quantum physics suggests that there is, in fact, a minimum distance (now called the [[Planck length]], 1.616229(38)×10&lt;sup&gt;−35&lt;/sup&gt; metres) and therefore a minimum time interval (the amount of time which light takes to traverse that distance in a vacuum, 5.39116(13)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;44&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, known as the [[Planck time]]) smaller than which meaningful ''measurement'' is impossible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==In economics==

One [[dollar]], or one [[euro]], is divided into 100 cents; one can only pay in increments of a cent. It is quite commonplace for prices of some commodities such as gasoline to be in increments of a tenth of a cent per gallon or per litre. If gasoline costs $3.979 per gallon and one buys 10 gallons, then the "extra" 9/10 of a cent comes to ten times that: an "extra" 9 cents, so the cent in that case gets paid. Money is infinitely divisible in the sense that it is based upon the real number system. However, modern day coins are not divisible (in the past some coins were weighed with each transaction, and were considered divisible with no particular limit in mind). There is a point of precision in each transaction that is useless because such small amounts of money are insignificant to humans. The more the price is multiplied the more the precision could matter. For example, when buying a million shares of stock, the buyer and seller might be interested in a tenth of a cent price difference, but it's only a choice. Everything else in business measurement and choice is similarly divisible to the degree that the parties are interested. For example, financial reports may be reported annually, quarterly, or monthly. Some business managers run cash-flow reports more than once per day.

Although [[time]] may be infinitely divisible, data on securities prices are reported at discrete times.  For example, if one looks at records of stock prices in the 1920s, one may find the prices at the end of each day, but perhaps not at three-hundredths of a second after 12:47 PM. A new method, however, theoretically, could report at double the rate, which would not prevent further increases of velocity of reporting.  Perhaps paradoxically, technical mathematics applied to financial markets is often simpler if infinitely divisible time is used as an approximation. Even in those cases, a precision is chosen with which to work, and measurements are rounded to that approximation. In terms of human interaction, money and time are divisible, but only to the point where further division is not of value, which point cannot be determined exactly.

==In order theory==

To say that the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational number]]s is infinitely divisible (i.e. order theoretically [[Dense set|dense]]) means that between any two rational numbers there is another rational number.  By contrast, the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[integer]]s is not infinitely divisible.

Infinite divisibility does not imply gap-less-ness: the rationals do not enjoy the [[supremum|least upper bound property]].  That means that if one were to [[partition of a set|partition]] the rationals into two non-empty sets ''A'' and ''B'' where ''A'' contains all rationals less than some irrational number (''[[Pi|π]]'', say) and ''B'' all rationals greater than it, then ''A'' has no largest member and ''B'' has no smallest member.  The field of [[real number]]s, by contrast, is both infinitely divisible and gapless.  Any [[total order|linearly ordered set]] that is infinitely divisible and gapless, and has more than one member, is [[uncountable set|uncountably infinite]].  For a proof, see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]].  Infinite divisibility alone implies infiniteness but not uncountability, as the rational numbers exemplify.

==In probability distributions==

{{Main|infinite divisibility (probability)}}

To say that a [[probability distribution]] ''F'' on the real line is '''infinitely divisible''' means that if ''X'' is any [[random variable]] whose distribution is ''F'', then for every positive integer ''n'' there exist ''n'' [[statistical independence|independent]] [[identically distributed]] random variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; whose sum is equal in distribution to ''X'' (those ''n'' other random variables do not usually have the same probability distribution as ''X'').

The [[Poisson distribution]], the stuttering Poisson distribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first= Zhang | last= Huiming |author2=[[Lili Chu]] |author3=[[Yu Diao]]|title=Some Properties of the Generalized Stuttering Poisson Distribution and its Applications |journal=[[Studies in Mathematical Sciences]] |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=2012|pages=11–26 |doi=10.3968/j.sms.1923845220120501.Z0697}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[negative binomial distribution]], and the [[Gamma distribution]] are examples of infinitely divisible distributions — as are the [[normal distribution]], [[Cauchy distribution]] and all other members of the [[stable distribution]] family. The [[skew normal distribution|skew-normal distribution]] is an example of a non-infinitely divisible distribution. (See Domínguez-Molina and Rocha Arteaga (2007).)

Every infinitely divisible probability distribution corresponds in a natural way to a [[Lévy process]], i.e., a [[stochastic process]] { ''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''t'' ≥ 0 } with stationary independent increments (''stationary'' means that for ''s'' &lt; ''t'', the [[probability distribution]] of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; depends only on ''t'' &amp;minus; ''s''; ''independent increments'' means that that difference is [[statistical independence|independent]] of the corresponding difference on any interval not overlapping with [''s'', ''t''], and similarly for any finite number of intervals).

This concept of infinite divisibility of probability distributions was introduced in 1929 by [[Bruno de Finetti]].

'''John Casey''' (12 May 1820, [[Kilbehenny]], [[Co. Limerick]], [[Ireland]] – 3 January 1891, [[Dublin]]) was a respected [[Irish people|Irish]] [[geometry|geometer]].  He is most famous for [[Casey's theorem]] on a circle that is tangent to four other circles, an extension of the [[problem of Apollonius]].  However, he contributed several novel proofs and perspectives on [[Euclidean geometry]]. He and [[Émile Lemoine]] are considered to be the co-founders of the modern geometry of the circle and the triangle.
 
==Biography==
He was born in Kilbehenny, Limerick, Ireland and educated locally at Mitchelstown, before becoming a teacher under the Board of National Education. He later became headmaster of the Central Model Schools in [[Kilkenny|Kilkenny City]]. He subsequently entered [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in 1858, where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in 1861 and was awarded the degree of BA in 1862. He was then Mathematics Master at Kingston School (1862–1873), Professor of Higher Mathematics and Mathematical Physics at the newly founded [[Catholic University of Ireland]] (1873–1881) and Lecturer in Mathematics at University College, Dublin (1881–1891). In parallel, he also taught at St Patrick's Drumcondra (1876-1885), which was not uncommon for UCD staff up till the 1930s.

==Honours and awards==
In 1869, Casey was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws by [[Dublin University]]. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in June, 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27casey%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] and in 1880 became a member of its council. In 1878 the Academy conferred upon him the much coveted Cunningham Gold Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mocavo.com/Proceedings-of-the-Royal-Irish-Academy-2/125174/142#141| title= Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, 1878|accessdate = 10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was also acknowledged by the Norwegian Government, among others. He was elected a member of the Societe Mathematique de France in 1884 and received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the [[Royal University of Ireland]] in 1885.

In [[applied mathematics]], '''lambda-connectedness ''' (or '''&amp;lambda;-connectedness''') deals with partial connectivity for a [[discrete space]].

Assume that a function on a discrete space (usually a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]) is given. A degree of connectivity (connectedness) will be defined to measure the connectedness of the space with respect to the function. It was invented to create a new method for image [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]]. The method has expanded to handle other problems related to uncertainty for incomplete information analysis.

IEEE Conf on System, Man and Cybernetics 2000, pp 1157–1562, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambda-connectedness1"&gt;L. Chen, O. Adjei, lambda-connectedness and its applications, Journal of Scientific and Practical Computing

For a digital image and a certain value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, two pixels are called &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connected if there is a path linking those two pixels and the connectedness of this path is at least &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness is an equivalence relation.&lt;ref name="fuzzy subfiber"&gt;L. Chen, H.D. Cheng, and J. Zhang, Fuzzy subfiber and its application to seismic lithology classification, Information Sciences: Applications, Vol 1, No 2, pp 77–95, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Connectedness is a basic measure in many areas of mathematical science and social sciences. In graph theory, two vertices are said to be connected if there is a path between them. In [[topology]], two points are connected if there is a continuous
function that could move from one point to another continuously. In management science, for example, in an institution,
two individuals are connected if one person is under the supervision of the other. Such connected relations only describe either full connection or no connection. lambda-connectedness is introduced to measure incomplete or fuzzy relations between two vertices, points, human beings, etc.

In fact, partial relations have been studied in other aspects. [[Random graph]] theory allows one to assign a [[probability]] to each edge of a graph. This method assumes, in most cases, each edge has the same probability. On the other hand, [[Bayesian networks]] are often used for inference and analysis when relationships between each pair of states/events, denoted by vertices, are known. These relationships are usually represented by conditional probabilities
among these vertices and are usually obtained from outside of the system.

&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness is based on graph theory; however, graph theory only deals with vertices and edges with or without weights. In order to define a partial, incomplete, or fuzzy connectedness, one needs to assign a function on the vertex in the graph. Such a function is called a potential function. It can be used to represent the intensity of an image, the surface of a ''XY''-domain, or the utility function of a management or economic network.

==Basic concepts==

A generalized definition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness can be described as follows: a simple system &lt;math&gt;\langle G,\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is called a potential function of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\langle G,\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an image, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a 2D or 2D grid space and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an intensity function. For a color image, one can use &lt;math&gt;f=(\text{red},\text{green},\text{blue})&lt;/math&gt; to represent &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.
 
A neighbor connectivity will be first defined on a pair of adjacent points. Then one can define the general connectedness for any two points.

Assume &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\rho(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is used to measure the neighbor-connectivity of x,y where x and y are adjacent.
In graph ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E''), a finite sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; is called a path, if &lt;math&gt;(x_i,x_{i+1})\in E&lt;/math&gt;.

The path-connectivity &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of a path &lt;math&gt;\pi=\pi(x_1,x_n)=\{x_1,x_2,...,x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;
is defined as
 
: &lt;math&gt; \beta_\rho(\pi(x_1,x_n)) =  \min \{ \alpha_{\rho}(x_i,x_{i+1}) | i=1,\ldots,n-1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
 
Finally,  the degree of connectedness (connectivity) of two vertices x,y with respect to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
 
: &lt;math&gt; C_\rho(x,y) = \max \{ \beta(\pi(x,y)) | \pi \text { is a (simple) path}. \}&lt;/math&gt;
 
For a given &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, point &lt;math&gt;p=(x,\rho(x))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=(y,\rho(y))&lt;/math&gt; are said to be &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connected if &lt;math&gt;C_{\rho}(x,y)\ge \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness is a equivalence relation. It can be used in image segmentation.

'''''Letters to a Young Mathematician'''''  ({{ISBN|0-465-08231-9}}) is a 2006 book by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], and is part of Basic Books' ''[[Art of Mentoring]]'' series. Stewart mentions in the preface that he considers this book an update to [[G.H. Hardy]]'s ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''.

The book is made up of letters to a fictional correspondent of Stewart's, an aspiring mathematician named Meg. The roughly chronological letters follow Meg from her high school years up to her receiving [[tenure]] from an American university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0425/p14s02-bogn.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews of the book were generally positive. [[Fernando Q. Gouvêa]]'s review for the [[Mathematical Association of America|MAA]] calls it "full of good advice, much of it direct and to the point" and later, that "while it won't change the world, it may well help some young people decide to be (or not to be) mathematicians." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.maa.org/reviews/StewartLetters.html&lt;/ref&gt; In Emma Carberry's review for the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]], reacted differently, saying that "one does not so much feel the benefit of a ream of practical advice, but rather of exposure to the inner realm of mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/notices/200705/rev-carberry-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' was harsher, however, saying that "there is a general lack of information ... [and] too much jargon" and that it "suffers from being written entirely for a US audience", but even this review finds a bright note, "The letter in which Stewart tells Meg how to teach undergraduates should be compulsory reading for all lecturers and tutors." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7098/full/442030b.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12437">[[file:Leonhard Euler.jpg|thumb|200px|Leonhard Euler (1707–1783)]]In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], there are a large number of topics named in honor of Swiss mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707–1783), who made many important discoveries and innovations. Many of these items named after Euler include their own unique function, equation, formula, identity, number (single or sequence), or other mathematical entity.  Many of these entities have been given simple and ambiguous names such as '''Euler's function''', '''Euler's equation''', and '''Euler's formula'''.

Euler's work touched upon so many fields that he is often the earliest written reference on a given matter. In an effort to avoid naming everything after Euler, some discoveries and theorems are attributed to the first person to have proved them ''after'' Euler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2008 |title=Euler's Gem: The polyhedron formula and the birth of topology |first=David S. |last=Richeson |edition=illustrated |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12677-7 |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LB_6VogerHIC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22person+after+Euler%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2004 |title=Differential equations and boundary value problems |first1=C.

'''Maria Margaret Klawe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɑː|v|eɪ}} {{respell|KLAH|vay}}; born 1951) is a computer scientist and the fifth president of [[Harvey Mudd College]] (since July 1, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maria Klawe Named Fifth President of Harvey Mudd College|url=http://www.hmc.edu/headline/Klawe.html|work=HMC Spotlight|publisher=Harvey Mudd College|accessdate=March 29, 2013|date=January 17, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629201223/http://www.hmc.edu/headline/Klawe.html|archivedate=June 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Born in Toronto in 1951, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. She was previously Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science at [[Princeton University]].

==Biography==
Klawe was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. She lived in [[Scotland]] from ages 4 to 12, and then returned to Canada, living with her family in [[Edmonton, Alberta]].&lt;ref name="mdtm"&gt;{{citation|title=Microsoft did the math, chose her|first=Alana|last=Semuels|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 15, 2009|page=B2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Klawe studied at the [[University of Alberta]], dropped out to travel the world, and returned to earn her [[B.Sc.]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="mdtm"/&gt; She stayed at Alberta for her graduate studies, and in 1977 she earned her [[Ph.D.]] there in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=43243}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the mathematics faculty at [[Oakland University]] as an assistant professor in 1977 but only stayed for a year. She started a second Ph.D., in computer science, at the [[University of Toronto]], but was offered a faculty position there before completing the degree.&lt;ref name="mdtm"/&gt; When she made the decision to get a Ph.D in computer science she had never studied the subject before. There weren't many undergraduate classes at the time so she enrolled in upper-level courses and studied about 16 hours a day to do well. She spent eight years in the industry, serving at [[IBM]]'s [[Almaden Research Center]] in [[San Jose, California]], first as a research scientist, then as manager of the [[Discrete Mathematics]] Group and manager of the Mathematics and Related Computer Science Department. She and her husband [[Nick Pippenger]] then moved to the [[University of British Columbia]], where she stayed for 15 years and served as head of the [[UBC computer science|Department of Computer Science]] from 1988 to 1995, vice president of student and academic services from 1995 to 1998, and dean of science from 1998 to 2002.
From UBC she moved to Princeton and then Harvey Mudd College, where she is the first woman president.&lt;ref name=Ezarik&gt;{{cite web|last=Ezarik |first=Melissa |title=Diamond in the Mudd: the many facets of Maria Klawe, Harvey Mudd College's new leader |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=148056309 |work=The Free Library |accessdate=February 23, 2015 |date=July 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flynn&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Flynn |title=Bits and Beauty |newspaper=[[Metro Silicon Valley]] |date=February 18, 2015 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When she arrived at Mudd only about 30% of students and faculty were female. Today about 45% of the students and over 40% of the faculty are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cra.org/cra-w/interview-with-maria-klawe/|title=Interview with Maria Klawe - CRA Women|website=cra.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a citizen of the United States  on January 29, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Klawe Becomes U.S. Citizen|url=http://www.hmc.edu/newsandevents/klawe_uscitizen.html|work=HMC Spotlight|publisher=Harvey Mudd College|accessdate=March 29, 2013|date=February 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120803214311/http://www.hmc.edu/newsandevents/klawe_uscitizen.html|archivedate=August 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009, she joined the [[board of directors]] of the [[Microsoft Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fried|first=Ina|title=Microsoft adds new board member|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-10192053-75.html|work=CNET|accessdate=March 29, 2013|date=March 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy for technical women==
{{Listen|filename=WomenInTech Maria Klawe-HQ 2-HQ.ogg| title=Maria Klawe (As Told By U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith)}}
Klawe has been heavily involved with increasing the representation of women in STEM fields.&lt;ref name = "nyt women in stem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morehead|first=James|title=Harvey Mudd College President Maria Klawe on Women in Science, Math and Engineering|url=http://onedublin.org/2011/09/10/harvey-mudd-college-president-maria-klawe-on-women-in-science-math-and-engineering/|work=OneDublin.org|accessdate=March 29, 2013|date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Klawe was the dean at UBC, she became the NSERC-IBM chair for Women in Science and Engineering. She was in charge of increasing female participation in science and engineering. During her five years as the chair appointment she increased female computer science majors from 16% to 27% and increased the number of female computer science faculty from 2 to 7. In 1991, together with [[Nancy Leveson]], she founded [[CRA-W]] (The [[Computing Research Association]]'s Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research) and served as its first co-chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cra.org/cra-w/about/co-chairs/ | title = Past and Present Chairs of CRA-W}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a personal friend of [[Anita Borg]] and served as the chair of the Board of Trustees of the [[Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology]] from 1996 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://anitaborg.org/news/archive/transitions/ | title = Transitions | accessdate = October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klawe was a huge advocate for salary negotiation by women, disagreeing with Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella, when he said "It's not really about asking for a raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will give you the right raise. That might be one of the initial 'super powers,' that quite frankly, women (who) don't ask for a raise have. It's good karma. It will come back."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Perfect Case Against Microsoft CEO's Remark That Women Shouldn't Ask For Raises|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/3037056/strong-female-lead/the-overlooked-leadership-lessons-in-the-microsoft-ceos-conference-fumble|website = Fast Company|accessdate = 2015-10-14|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klawe's believes that  women should take an entry level computer science course during their first year at college that focuses on portraying the field as fun and engaging rather than trying to convince women to stay. She believes that if programming courses are taken at the middle school level then they have another four years of high school for peer pressure to get them disinterested again."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science-jan-june12-womenscience_04-26/|title=Bridging the Gender Gap: Why More Women Aren't Computer Scientists, Engineers|newspaper=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is what she does at Harvey Mudd. She attributes the lack of women in technical fields due to how the media portrays women. In an interview with PBS she explains how TV shows in the 1970s showed men along with women who had successful careers such as doctors or lawyers and that caused the number of women going into medicine skyrocket.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;  Klawe emphasizes that the introductory courses offered need to be presented in a problem-solving environment, not a competitive one where a few males dominate the conversation. Klawe believes the "testosterone culture" prevents women from continuing on with CS because the males that know everything scare away anyone who is trying to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.engineeringstudents.org/?p=4391|title=Harvey Mudd President Maria Klawe: How to Close the Engineering Gender Gap|website=The Accelerator|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Klawe is working on helping biology majors learn computer science by working with UCSD to create a biology themed introductory computer science course. Another project she's working on is an online course called MOOC aimed at 10th grade students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2013/05/01/178810710/How-One-College-Is-Closing-The-Tech-Gender-Gap|title=How One College Is Closing The Computer Science Gender Gap|newspaper=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klawe has also exhibited her watercolors.&lt;ref name=Ezarik/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flynn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rachel |last=Lee |title=A colorful blend of art and science |newspaper=[[Mountain View Voice]] |date=February 20, 2015 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It turns out that its transition functions depend functionally on local changes of coordinates in the base [[manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; together with their partial derivatives up to order at most &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Natural bundles have finite order|last=Palais|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Palais |last2=Terng |first2=Chuu-Lian |author-link2= Chuu-Lian Terng|journal= Topology|volume=16|pages=271–277|year=1977|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of a natural bundle was introduced by [[Albert Nijenhuis]] as a modern reformulation of the classical concept of an arbitrary bundle of geometric objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Natural bundles and their general properties|author=A.

In mathematics, for example in the study of statistical properties of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], a '''null model''' is type of random object that matches one specific object in some of its features, or more generally satisfies a collection of constraints, but which is otherwise taken to be an unbiasedly random structure. The null model is used as a term of comparison, to verify whether the object in question displays some non-trivial features (properties that wouldn't be expected on the basis of chance alone or as a consequence of the constraints), such as community structure in graphs. An appropriate null model behaves in accordance with a reasonable [[null hypothesis]] for the behavior of the system under investigation.

One null model of utility in the study of [[complex networks]] is that proposed by Newman and Girvan, consisting of a randomized version of an original graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, produced through edges being rewired at random, under the constraint that the expected degree of each vertex matches the degree of the vertex in the original graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=M.E.J|first=Newman|author2=M.Girvan |title=Finding and evaluating community structure in networks|journal=Phys. Rev. E|year=2004|volume=69|issue=2|doi=10.1103/physreve.69.026113 |arxiv=cond-mat/0308217|bibcode=2004PhRvE..69b6113N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The null model is the basic concept behind the definition of [[Modularity (networks)|modularity]], a function which evaluates the goodness of partitions of a graph into clusters. In particular, given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and a specific community partition &lt;math&gt;\sigma:V(G)\rightarrow \{1,...,b\}&lt;/math&gt; (an assignment of a community-index &lt;math&gt;\sigma(v)&lt;/math&gt; (here taken as an integer from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) to each vertex &lt;math&gt;v\in V(G)&lt;/math&gt; in the graph), the modularity measures the difference between the number of links from/to each pair of communities, from that expected in a graph that is completely random in all respects other than the set of degrees of each of the vertices (the [[degree sequence]]). In other words, the modularity contrasts the exhibited community structure in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with that of a null model, which in this case is the [[configuration model]] (the maximally random graph subject to a constraint on the degree of each vertex).

'''Operations research''', or '''operational research''' in British usage,  is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/About-Operations-Research |title=About Operations Research |publisher=INFORMS.org |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the term 'operational analysis' is used in the British (and some British Commonwealth) military as an intrinsic part of capability development, management and assurance.  In particular, operational analysis forms part of the Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisals (COEIA), which support British defense capability acquisition decision-making.

It is often considered to be a sub-field of [[applied mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathontheweb.org/mathweb/mi-mathbyclass.html |title=Mathematics Subject Classification |publisher=American Mathematical Society |date= 23 May 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms [[management science]] and [[decision science]] are sometimes used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Systems analysis for computer-based information systems|series=West series in data processing and information systems|first=James C.|last=Wetherbe|publisher=West Pub. Co.|year=1979|isbn=9780829902280|quotation=A systems analyst who contributes in the area of DSS must be skilled in such areas as management science (synonymous with decision science and operation research), modeling, simulation, and advanced statistics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences, such as [[mathematical model]]ing, [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[mathematical optimization]], operations research arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems. Because of its emphasis on human-technology interaction and because of its focus on practical applications, operations research has overlap with other disciplines, notably [[industrial engineering]] and [[operations management]], and draws on [[psychology]] and [[Organizational studies|organization science]]. Operations research is often concerned with determining the [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of loss, risk, or cost) of some real-world objective. Originating in military efforts before World War II, its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries.&lt;ref name="hsor.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsor.org/what_is_or.cfm |title=What is OR |publisher=HSOR.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:Operation research study 01.svg|thumb|480px|Model of Operation research study, based on Stafford Beer (1959).&lt;ref&gt;Stafford Beer (1959). ''Cybernetic and Management''. English Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

==Overview==
Operational research (OR) encompasses a wide range of problem-solving techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decision-making and efficiency, such as [[simulation]], [[mathematical optimization]], [[queueing theory]] and other [[Stochastic process|stochastic-process]] models, [[Markov Decision Process|Markov decision processes]], [[Econometrics|econometric methods]], [[data envelopment analysis]], [[neural networks]], [[Expert System|expert systems]], [[decision analysis]], and the [[analytic hierarchy process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos044.htm |title=Operations Research Analysts |publisher=Bls.gov |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of these techniques involve the construction of mathematical models that attempt to describe the system. Because of the computational and statistical nature of most of these fields, OR also has strong ties to [[computer science]] and [[analytics]]. Operational researchers faced with a new problem must determine which of these techniques are most appropriate given the nature of the system, the goals for improvement, and constraints on time and computing power.

The major sub-disciplines in modern operational research, as identified by the journal ''Operations Research'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.informs.org/site/OperationsResearch/index.php?c=10&amp;kat=Forthcoming+Papers |title=OR / Pubs / IOL Home |publisher=INFORMS.org |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527093022/http://www.informs.org/site/OperationsResearch/index.php?c=10&amp;kat=Forthcoming+Papers |archivedate=27 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are:

* [[Financial engineering]]
* [[Manufacturing]], [[service science]]s, and [[supply chain management]]
* Policy modeling and public sector work

==History==
In the decades after the two world wars, the tools of operations research were more widely applied to problems in business, industry and society. Since that time, operational research has expanded into a field widely used in industries ranging from petrochemicals to airlines, finance, logistics, and government, moving to a focus on the development of mathematical models that can be used to analyse and optimize complex systems, and has become an area of active academic and industrial research.&lt;ref name="hsor.org"/&gt;

===Historical origins===
In the 17th century, mathematicians like [[Christiaan Huygens]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] ([[problem of points]]) tried to solve problems involving complex decisions with [[probability]]. Others in the 18th and 19th centuries solved these types of problems with [[combinatorics]]. [[Charles Babbage]]'s research into the cost of transportation and sorting of mail led to England's [[Uniform Penny Post|universal "Penny Post"]] in 1840, and studies into the dynamical behaviour of railway vehicles in defence of the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]]'s broad gauge.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Sodhi, "What about the 'O' in O.R.?" OR/MS Today, December, 2007, p. 12, http://www.lionhrtpub.com/orms/orms-12-07/frqed.html&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 20th century, study of inventory management could be considered the origin of modern operations research with [[Economic order quantity|economic order quantity]] developed by [[Ford W. Harris]] in 1913. Operational research may have originated in the efforts of military planners during World War I (convoy theory and [[Lanchester's laws]]). [[Percy Bridgman]] brought operational research to bear on problems in physics in the 1920s and would later attempt to extend these to the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Bridgman, The Logic of Modern Physics, The MacMillan Company, New York, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern operational research originated at the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment|Bawdsey Research Station]] in the UK in 1937 and was the result of an initiative of the station's superintendent, [[Albert Percival Rowe|A. P. Rowe]]. Rowe conceived the idea as a means to analyse and improve the working of the UK's [[early warning radar]] system, [[Chain Home]] (CH). Initially, he analysed the operating of the radar equipment and its communication networks, expanding later to include the operating personnel's behaviour. This revealed unappreciated limitations of the CH network and allowed remedial action to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/682073/operations-research/68171/History#ref22348 |title=operations research (industrial engineering) :: History – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists in the United Kingdom including [[Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] (later Lord Blackett OM PRS), [[Cecil Gordon (scientist)|Cecil Gordon]], [[Solly Zuckerman, Baron Zuckerman|Solly Zuckerman]], (later Baron Zuckerman OM, KCB, FRS), [[Conrad Hal Waddington|C. H. Waddington]], [[Owen Wansbrough-Jones]], [[Frank Yates]], [[Jacob Bronowski]] and [[Freeman Dyson]], and in the United States with [[George Dantzig]] looked for ways to make better decisions in such areas as [[logistics]] and training schedules

===Second World War===

The modern field of operational research arose during World War II. In the World War II era, operational research was defined as "a scientific method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis for decisions regarding the operations under their control".&lt;ref name=C67-3-4-48-para-1&gt;"Operational Research in the British Army 1939–1945, October 1947, Report C67/3/4/48, UK National Archives file WO291/1301&lt;br /&gt;Quoted on the dust-jacket of: Morse, Philip M, and Kimball, George E, ''Methods of Operation Research'', 1st edition revised, MIT Press &amp; J Wiley, 5th printing, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for it included operational analysis (UK Ministry of Defence from 1962)&lt;ref name=PROCATWO291&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=109&amp;CATLN=2&amp;Highlight=&amp;FullDetails=True UK National Archives Catalogue for WO291] lists a War Office organisation called [[Army Operational Research Group]] (AORG) that existed from 1946 to 1962. "In January 1962 the name was changed to Army Operational Research Establishment (AORE). Following the creation of a unified Ministry of Defence, a tri-service operational research organisation was established: the [[Defence Operational Research Establishment]] (DOAE) which was formed in 1965, and it the Army Operational Research Establishment based at West Byfleet."&lt;/ref&gt; and quantitative management.&lt;ref&gt;http://brochure.unisa.ac.za/myunisa/data/subjects/Quantitative%20Management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] close to 1,000 men and women in Britain were engaged in operational research. About 200 operational research scientists worked for the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 p. 117] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827004623/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Blackett]] worked for several different organizations during the war. Early in the war while working for the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) he set up a team known as the "Circus" which helped to reduce the number of [[anti-aircraft artillery]] rounds needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft from an average of over 20,000 at the start of the [[Battle of Britain]] to 4,000 in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA94 pp. 91–94] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827041022/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA94 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B 24 in raf service 23 03 05.jpg|thumb|A [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] in standard RAF green/dark earth/black night bomber finish as originally used by Coastal Command]]
In 1941, Blackett moved from the RAE to the Navy, after first working with [[RAF Coastal Command]], in 1941 and then early in 1942 to the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA109 p. 96,109] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002032938/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA109 |date=2 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackett's team at Coastal Command's Operational Research Section (CC-ORS) included two future [[Nobel prize]] winners and many other people who went on to be pre-eminent in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327234509/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA96 |date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They undertook a number of crucial analyses that aided the war effort. Britain introduced the [[convoy]] system to reduce shipping losses, but while the principle of using warships to accompany merchant ships was generally accepted, it was unclear whether it was better for convoys to be small or large. Convoys travel at the speed of the slowest member, so small convoys can travel faster. It was also argued that small convoys would be harder for German [[U-boat]]s to detect. On the other hand, large convoys could deploy more warships against an attacker. Blackett's staff showed that the losses suffered by convoys depended largely on the number of escort vessels present, rather than the size of the convoy. Their conclusion was that a few large convoys are more defensible than many small ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familyheritage.ca/Articles/victory1943.html |title="Numbers are Essential": Victory in the North Atlantic Reconsidered, March–May 1943 |publisher=Familyheritage.ca |date=24 May 1943 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While performing an analysis of the methods used by [[RAF Coastal Command]] to hunt and destroy submarines, one of the analysts asked what colour the aircraft were. As most of them were from Bomber Command they were painted black for night-time operations. At the suggestion of CC-ORS a test was run to see if that was the best colour to camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations in the grey North Atlantic skies. Tests showed that aircraft painted white were on average not spotted until they were 20% closer than those painted black. This change indicated that 30% more submarines would be attacked and sunk for the same number of sightings.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these findings Coastal Command changed their aircraft to using white undersurfaces.

Other work by the CC-ORS indicated that on average if the trigger depth of aerial-delivered [[depth charge]]s (DCs) were changed from 100 feet to 25 feet, the kill ratios would go up. The reason was that if a U-boat saw an aircraft only shortly before it arrived over the target then at 100 feet the charges would do no damage (because the U-boat wouldn't have had time to descend as far as 100 feet), and if it saw the aircraft a long way from the target it had time to alter course under water so the chances of it being within the 20-foot kill zone of the charges was small. It was more efficient to attack those submarines close to the surface when the targets' locations were better known than to attempt their destruction at greater depths when their positions could only be guessed. Before the change of settings from 100 feet to 25 feet, 1% of submerged U-boats were sunk and 14% damaged. After the change, 7% were sunk and 11% damaged. (If submarines were caught on the surface, even if attacked shortly after submerging, the numbers rose to 11% sunk and 15% damaged). Blackett observed "there can be few cases where such a great operational gain had been obtained by such a small and simple change of tactics".&lt;ref&gt;(Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA103 pp. 102,103])&lt;/ref&gt;

Bomber Command's Operational Research Section (BC-ORS), analyzed a report of a survey carried out by [[RAF Bomber Command]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For the survey, Bomber Command inspected all bombers returning from bombing raids over Germany over a particular period. All damage inflicted by German [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defences]] was noted and the recommendation was given that armour be added in the most heavily damaged areas. This recommendation was not adopted because the fact that the aircraft returned with these areas damaged indicated these areas were not vital, and adding armour to non-vital areas where damage is acceptable negatively affects aircraft performance. Their suggestion to remove some of the crew so that an aircraft loss would result in fewer personnel losses, was also rejected by RAF command. Blackett's team made the logical recommendation that the armour be placed in the areas which were completely untouched by damage in the bombers which returned. They reasoned that the survey was biased, since it only included aircraft that returned to Britain. The untouched areas of returning aircraft were probably vital areas, which, if hit, would result in the loss of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dirty Little Secrets of the Twentieth Century | publisher=[[Harper Paperbacks]] | author=James F. Dunnigan | year=1999 | pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story has been disputed,&lt;ref&gt;http://lesswrong.com/lw/bbv/examine_your_assumptions/&lt;/ref&gt; with a similar damage assessment study completed in the US by the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/01621459.1980.10477469|title = The Statistical Research Group, 1942–1945|journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume = 75|issue = 370|pages = 320–330|year = 1980|last1 = Wallis|first1 = W. Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the result of work done by [[Abraham Wald]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2288257|title = Abraham Wald's Work on Aircraft Survivability|journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume = 79|issue = 386|pages = 259|last1 = Mangel|first1 = Marc|last2 = Samaniego|first2 = Francisco J|doi = 10.2307/2288257|year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

When Germany organized its air defences into the [[Kammhuber Line]], it was realized by the British that if the RAF bombers were to fly in a [[bomber stream]] they could overwhelm the night fighters who flew in individual cells directed to their targets by ground controllers. It was then a matter of calculating the statistical loss from collisions against the statistical loss from night fighters to calculate how close the bombers should fly to minimize RAF losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/thousands.html |title=RAF History – Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "exchange rate" ratio of output to input was a characteristic feature of operational research. By comparing the number of flying hours put in by Allied aircraft to the number of U-boat sightings in a given area, it was possible to redistribute aircraft to more productive patrol areas. Comparison of exchange rates established "effectiveness ratios" useful in planning. The ratio of 60 [[Mine (naval)|mines]] laid per ship sunk was common to several campaigns: German mines in British ports, British mines on German routes, and United States mines in Japanese routes.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Milkman, Raymond H. |title=Operation Research in World War II |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] Proceedings |date=May 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operational research doubled the on-target bomb rate of [[B-29]]s bombing Japan from the [[Marianas Islands]] by increasing the training ratio from 4 to 10 percent of flying hours; revealed that wolf-packs of three United States submarines were the most effective number to enable all members of the pack to engage targets discovered on their individual patrol stations; revealed that glossy enamel paint was more effective camouflage for night fighters than traditional dull camouflage paint finish, and the smooth paint finish increased airspeed by reducing skin friction.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"/&gt;

On land, the operational research sections of the Army Operational Research Group (AORG) of the [[Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) were landed in [[Operation Overlord|Normandy in 1944]], and they followed British forces in the advance across Europe. They analyzed, among other topics, the effectiveness of artillery, aerial bombing and anti-tank shooting.

===After World War II===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
With expanded techniques and growing awareness of the field at the close of the war, operational research was no longer limited to only operational, but was extended to encompass equipment procurement, training, logistics and infrastructure. Operations Research also grew in many areas other than the military once scientists learned to apply its principles to the civilian sector. With the development of the [[simplex algorithm]] for [[linear programming]] in 1947&lt;ref name="pitt.edu"&gt;{{cite book|title=PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH |contribution=1.2 A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~jrclass/or/or-intro.html#history}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of computers over the next three decades, Operations Research can now "solve problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints. Moreover, the large volumes of data required for such problems can be stored and manipulated very efficiently."&lt;ref name="pitt.edu"/&gt;

==Problems addressed==
* [[Critical path analysis]] or [[project planning]]: identifying those processes in a complex project which affect the overall duration of the project

* [[Cutting stock problem]]: Cutting small items out of bigger ones.

Operational research is also used extensively in government where [[evidence-based policy]] is used.

==Management science==
{{main|Management science}}
In 1967 [[Stafford Beer]] characterized the field of management science as "the business use of operations research".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stafford Beer]] (1967) ''Management Science: The Business Use of Operations Research''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern times the term management science may also be used to refer to the separate fields of [[organizational studies]] or [[corporate strategy]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Like operational research itself, management science (MS) is an interdisciplinary branch of applied mathematics devoted to optimal decision planning, with strong links with economics, business, engineering, and other [[science]]s. It uses various [[science|scientific]] [[research]]-based principles, [[Strategy|strategies]], and [[analytical method]]s including [[mathematical model]]ing, statistics and [[numerical algorithm]]s to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems. Management scientists help businesses to achieve their goals using the scientific methods of operational research.

The management scientist's mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds. Of course, the techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to military, medical, public administration, charitable groups, political groups or community groups.

Management science is concerned with developing and applying [[scientific modeling|models]] and [[concept]]s that may prove useful in helping to illuminate management issues and solve managerial problems, as well as designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence.&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;[http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ What is Management Science?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914101120/http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ |date=14 September 2008 }} Lancaster University, 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of these models within the corporate sector became known as management science.&lt;ref name="UTK"&gt;[http://bus.utk.edu/soms/information/whatis_msci.html What is Management Science?] The University of Tennessee, 2006. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===
Applications are abundant such as in airlines, manufacturing companies, [[service organization]]s, military branches, and government. The range of problems and issues to which it has contributed insights and solutions is vast. It includes:&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;
* Scheduling (of airlines, trains, buses etc.)
* Assignment (assigning crew to flights, trains or buses; employees to projects; commitment and dispatch of power generation facilities)
* Facility location (deciding most appropriate location for new facilities such as warehouse; factory or fire station)
* Hydraulics &amp; Piping Engineering (managing flow of water from reservoirs)
* Health Services (information and supply chain management)
* Game Theory (identifying, understanding; developing strategies adopted by companies)
* Urban Design
* Computer Network Engineering (packet routing; timing; analysis)
* Telecom &amp; Data Communication Engineering (packet routing; timing; analysis)
&lt;ref&gt;http://nak-architecture.com/index.php/en/services/blog/55-urban-operations-research-uor&lt;/ref&gt;

Management is also concerned with so-called 'soft-operational analysis' which concerns methods for [[strategic planning]], strategic [[decision support]], [[problem structuring methods]]. 
In dealing with these sorts of challenges, mathematical [[modeling and simulation]] may not be appropriate or may not suffice. Therefore, during the past 30 years{{vague|date=November 2017}}, a number of non-quantified modeling methods have been developed. These include:{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* stakeholder based approaches including [[metagame analysis]] and [[drama theory]]
* [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] and various forms of [[influence diagram]]s
* cognitive mapping
* strategic choice 
* robustness analysis

In [[symplectic topology]] and [[dynamical system]]s, '''Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem''' (also known as '''Poincaré–Birkhoff fixed point theorem''' and '''Poincaré's last geometric theorem''') states that every area-preserving, orientation-preserving [[homeomorphism]] of an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] that rotates the two boundaries in opposite directions has at least two [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]].

== History ==
The Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem was discovered by [[Henri Poincaré]], who published it in a 1912 paper titled "Sur un théorème de géométrie", and proved it for some special cases. The general case was proved by [[George D. Birkhoff]] in his 1913 paper titled "Proof of Poincaré's geometric theorem".&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré last theorem. ''Encyclopedia of Mathematics''.

The '''''Princeton Lectures in Analysis''''' is a series of four [[mathematics]] textbooks, each covering a different area of [[mathematical analysis]]. They were written by [[Elias M. Stein]] and Rami Shakarchi and published by [[Princeton University Press]] between 2003 and 2011. They are, in order, ''Fourier Analysis: An Introduction''; ''Complex Analysis''; ''Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces''; and ''Functional Analysis: Introduction to Further Topics in Analysis''.

Stein and Shakarchi wrote the books based on a sequence of intensive undergraduate courses Stein began teaching in the spring of 2000 at [[Princeton University]]. At the time Stein was a mathematics professor at Princeton and Shakarchi was a graduate student in mathematics. Though Shakarchi graduated in 2002, the collaboration continued until the final volume was published in 2011. The series emphasizes the unity among the branches of analysis and the applicability of analysis to other areas of mathematics.

The ''Princeton Lectures in Analysis'' has been identified as a well written and influential series of textbooks, suitable for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students in mathematics.

== History ==
[[File:Elias Stein.jpeg|thumb|Elias M. Stein]]
The first author, [[Elias M. Stein]], is a [[mathematician]] who has made significant research contributions to the field of [[mathematical analysis]]. Before 2000 he had authored or co-authored several influential advanced textbooks on analysis.&lt;ref name=oconnor&gt;{{cite web |first1=J. J. |last1=O'Connor|first2=E. F. |last2=Robertson |title=Elias Menachem Stein |date=Feb 2010 |publisher=[[University of St Andrews]] |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Stein.html |accessdate=Sep 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the spring of 2000, Stein taught a sequence of four intensive undergraduate courses in analysis at [[Princeton University]], where he was a mathematics professor. At the same time he collaborated with Rami Shakarchi, then a graduate student in Princeton's math department studying under [[Charles Fefferman]], to turn each of the courses into a textbook. Stein taught [[Fourier analysis]] in that first semester, and by the fall of 2000 the first manuscript was nearly finished. That fall Stein taught the course in [[complex analysis]] while he and Shakarchi worked on the corresponding manuscript. Paul Hagelstein, then a [[postdoctoral scholar]] in the Princeton math department, was a teaching assistant for this course. In spring 2001, when Stein moved on to the [[real analysis]] course, Hagelstein started the sequence anew, beginning with the Fourier analysis course. Hagelstein and his students used Stein and Shakarchi's drafts as texts, and they made suggestions to the authors as they prepared the manuscripts for publication.&lt;ref name=fefferman&gt;{{cite news |first1=Charles |last1=Fefferman |authorlink1=Charles Fefferman |first2=Robert |last2=Fefferman |authorlink2=Robert Fefferman |first3=Paul |last3=Hagelstein |first4=Nataša |last4=Pavlović |first5=Lillian |last5=Pierce|author5-link=Lillian Pierce |title=Princeton Lectures in Analysis by Elias M.

Shakarchi earned his Ph.D. from Princeton in 2002&lt;ref name=duren&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Duran |authorlink=Peter Duren |title=Princeton Lectures in Analysis. By Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=115 |number=9 | date=Nov  2008 |pages=863–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to [[London]] to work in finance. Nonetheless he continued working on the books, even as his employer, [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|collapsed]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=fefferman/&gt; The first two volumes were published in 2003. The third followed in 2005, and the fourth in 2011. [[Princeton University Press]] published all four.&lt;ref name=ss1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss3/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss4/&gt;

== Contents ==

The volumes are split into seven to ten chapters each. Each chapter begins with an epigraph providing context for the material and ends with a list of challenges for the reader, split into Exercises, which range in difficulty, and more difficult Problems. Throughout the authors emphasize the unity among the branches of analysis, often referencing one branch within another branch's book. They also provide applications of the theory to other fields of mathematics, particularly [[partial differential equation]]s and [[number theory]].&lt;ref name=fefferman/&gt;&lt;ref name=duren/&gt;

''Fourier Analysis'' covers the [[Discrete Fourier transform|discrete]], [[Continuous Fourier transform|continuous]], and [[Discrete Fourier transform|finite]] [[Fourier transform]]s and their properties, including inversion. It also presents applications to partial differential equations, [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]], and other topics.&lt;ref name=ss1&gt;Stein &amp; Shakarchi, ''Fourier Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Lebesgue integration]] is not introduced until the third book, the authors use [[Riemann integration]] in this volume.&lt;ref name=duren/&gt; They begin with Fourier analysis because of its central role within the historical development and contemporary practice of analysis.&lt;ref name=gouvea/&gt;

''Complex Analysis'' treats the standard topics of a course in complex variables as well as several applications to other areas of mathematics.&lt;ref name=fefferman/&gt;&lt;ref name=shiu/&gt; The chapters cover the [[complex plane]], [[Cauchy's integral theorem]], [[meromorphic function]]s, connections to Fourier analysis, [[entire function]]s, the [[gamma function]], the [[Riemann zeta function]], [[conformal map]]s, [[elliptic function]]s, and [[theta function]]s.&lt;ref name=ss2&gt;Stein &amp; Shakarchi, ''Complex Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Real Analysis'' begins with [[measure theory]], Lebesgue integration, and [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] in [[Euclidean space]]. It then covers [[Hilbert space]]s before returning to measure and integration in the context of abstract measure spaces. It concludes with a chapter on [[Hausdorff measure]] and [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=ss3&gt;Stein &amp; Shakarchi, ''Real Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Functional Analysis'' has chapters on several advanced topics in analysis: [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]], [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], the [[Baire category theorem]], [[probability theory]] including [[Brownian motion]], [[several complex variables]], and [[oscillatory integral]]s.&lt;ref name=ss4&gt;Stein &amp; Shakarchi, ''Functional Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The books "received rave reviews indicating they are all outstanding works written with remarkable clarity and care."&lt;ref name=oconnor/&gt; Reviews praised the exposition,&lt;ref name=fefferman/&gt;&lt;ref name=duren/&gt;&lt;ref name=ziemer/&gt; identified the books as accessible and informative for advanced undergraduates or graduate math students,&lt;ref name=fefferman/&gt;&lt;ref name=duren/&gt;&lt;ref name=gouvea&gt;{{cite web |first=Fernando Q. |last=Gouvêa|authorlink= Fernando Q.

[[Peter Duren]] compared Stein and Shakarchi's attempt at a unified treatment favorably with [[Walter Rudin]]'s textbook ''Real and Complex Analysis'', which Duren calls too terse. On the other hand, Duren noted that this sometimes comes at the expense of topics that reside naturally within only one branch. He mentioned in particular geometric aspects of complex analysis covered in [[Lars Ahlfors]]'s textbook but noted that Stein and Shakarchi also treat some topics Ahlfors skips.&lt;ref name=duren/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19814">In [[statistics]], [[econometrics]], [[political science]], [[epidemiology]], and related disciplines, a '''regression discontinuity design (RDD)''' is a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design that elicits the [[causality|causal effects]] of interventions by assigning a cutoff or threshold above or below which an intervention is assigned. By comparing observations lying closely on either side of the threshold, it is possible to estimate the [[average treatment effect]] in environments in which [[randomization]] is unfeasible. First applied by [[Donald Thistlethwaite]] and [[Donald T. Campbell|Donald Campbell]] to the evaluation of scholarship programs,&lt;ref name="Thistlethwaite and Cambpell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thistlethwaite |first=D. |last2=Campbell |first2=D. |title=Regression-Discontinuity Analysis: An alternative to the ex post facto experiment |year=1960 |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=309–317 |doi=10.1037/h0044319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the RDD has become increasingly popular in recent years.&lt;ref name="Imbens and Lemieux"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Imbens |first=G. |last2=Lemieux |first2=T. |title=Regression Discontinuity Designs: A Guide to Practice |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=615–635 |doi=10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
The intuition behind the RDD is well illustrated using the evaluation of merit-based scholarships. The main problem with estimating the causal effect of such an intervention is the [[endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]] of performance to the assignment of [[Design of experiments|treatment]] (e.g. scholarship award): Since high-performing students are more likely to be awarded the merit scholarship ''and'' continue performing well at the same time, comparing the outcomes of awardees and non-recipients would lead to an upward [[selection bias|bias]] of the estimates. Even ''if'' the scholarship did not improve grades at all, awardees would have performed better than non-recipients, simply because scholarships were given to students who were performing well [[ex ante]].

Despite the absence of an [[experimental design]], a RDD can exploit [[exogenous]] characteristics of the intervention to elicit [[causality|causal effects]]. If all students above a given grade—for example 80%—are given the scholarship, it is possible to elicit the local treatment effect by comparing students around the 80% cut-off: The intuition here is that a student scoring 79% is likely to be very similar to a student scoring 81%—given the pre-defined threshold of 80%, however, one student will receive the scholarship while the other will not. Comparing the outcome of the awardee (treatment group) to the [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] outcome of the non-recipient (control group) will hence deliver the local treatment effect.

== Methodology ==
The two most common approaches to estimation using a RDD are [[nonparametric regression|nonparametric]] and parametric (normally [[polynomial regression]]).

=== Non-parametric estimation ===

The most common non-parametric method used in the RDD context is a local linear regression. This is of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;
Y = \alpha + \tau D + \beta_{1}(X-c) + \beta_{2}D(X-c) + \varepsilon ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the treatment cut-off and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a binary variable equal to one if &lt;math&gt;X \ge c&lt;/math&gt;. Letting &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; be the bandwidth of data used, we have &lt;math&gt; c - h \le X \le c + h &lt;/math&gt;. Different slopes and intercepts fit data on either side of the cutoff. Typically either a rectangular [[Kernel (statistics)|kernel]] (no weighting) or a triangular kernel are used. Research favors the triangular kernel&lt;ref name="Fan and Gijbels 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fan |last2=Gijbels|author2-link= Irène Gijbels |title=Local Polynomial Modelling and Its Applications |year=1996 |location=London |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=0-412-98321-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the rectangular kernel has a more straightforward interpretation.&lt;ref name="Lee and Lemieux 2010"/&gt;

The major benefit of using non-parametric methods in a RDD is that they provide estimates based on data closer to the cut-off, which is intuitively appealing. This reduces some bias that can result from using data farther away from the cutoff to estimate the discontinuity at the cutoff.&lt;ref name="Lee and Lemieux 2010" /&gt; More formally, local linear regressions are preferred because they have better bias properties&lt;ref name="Fan and Gijbels 1996"/&gt; and have better convergence.&lt;ref name="Porter 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Porter |title=Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model |year=2003 |work=Unpublished Manuscript |url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jrporter/reg_discont_2003.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the use of both types estimation, if feasible, is a useful way to argue that the estimated results do not rely too heavily on the particular approach taken.

=== Parametric estimation ===
An example of a parametric estimation is:
: &lt;math&gt;
Y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 c_i + \beta_3 c_i^2 + \beta_4 c_i^3 + \varepsilon ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;
x_i=
\begin{cases}
1\text{ if }c_i \geq \bar{c}\\
0\text{ if }c_i &lt; \bar{c}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the treatment cut-off.
Note that the polynomial part can be shortened or extended according to the needs.

=== Other examples ===
* Policies in which treatment is determined by an age eligibility criterion (e.g. pensions, minimum legal drinking age).&lt;ref name="Duflo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duflo |title=Grandmothers and Granddaughters: Old-age Pensions and Intrahousehold Allocation in South Africa |year=2003 |journal=World Bank Economic Review |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |doi=10.1093/wber/lhg013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarpenterDobkin2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carpenter |last2=Dobkin |title=The Minimum Legal Drinking Age and Public Health |year=2011 |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=133–156 |jstor=23049457 |pmc=3182479 |doi=10.1257/jep.25.2.133 |pmid=21595328}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elections in which one politician wins by a marginal majority.&lt;ref name="Lee 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |title=Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=675–697 |doi=10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Placement scores within education that sort students into treatment programs.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moss |first=B. G. |last2=Yeaton |first2=W. H. |last3=Lloyd |first3=J.E. | year= 2014 |title =Evaluating the Effectiveness of Developmental Mathematics by Embedding a Randomized Experiment Within a Regression Discontinuity Design.| journal= [[Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis]] |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages= 170–185|doi=10.3102/0162373713504988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Required assumptions ==
Regression discontinuity design requires that treatment assignment is "as good as random" at the threshold for treatment.&lt;ref name="Lee 2008"/&gt; If this holds, then it guarantees that those who just barely received treatment are comparable to those who just barely did not receive treatment, as treatment status is effectively random.

Treatment assignment at the threshold can be "as good as random" if there is randomness in the assignment variable and the agents considered (individuals, firms, etc.) cannot perfectly manipulate their treatment status. For example, if the treatment is passing an exam, where a grade of 50% is required, then this example is a valid regression discontinuity design so long as grades are somewhat random, due either to randomness of grading or randomness of student performance.

Students must not also be able to perfectly manipulate their grade so as to perfectly determine their treatment status. Two examples include students being able to convince teachers to "mercy pass" them, or students being allowed to re-take the exam until they pass. In the former case, those students who barely fail but are able to secure a "mercy pass" may differ from those who just barely fail but cannot secure a "mercy pass". This leads to [[selection bias]], as the treatment and control groups now differ. In the latter case, some students may decide to retake the exam, stopping once they pass. This also leads to [[selection bias]] since only some students will decide to retake the exam.&lt;ref name="Lee and Lemieux 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |last2=Lemieux |title=Regression Discontinuity Designs in Economics |year=2010 |journal=[[Journal of Economic Literature]] |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=281–355 |doi=10.1257/jel.48.2.281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testing the validity of the assumptions ===
It is impossible to definitively test for validity if agents are able to perfectly determine their treatment status. However, there are some tests that can provide evidence that either supports or discounts the validity of the regression discontinuity design.

==== Density test ====
[[File:McCrary (2008) Density Test on Data from Lee, Moretti, and Butler (2004).png|thumb|McCrary (2008)&lt;ref name="McCrary 2008" /&gt; density test on data from Lee, Moretti, and Butler (2004).&lt;ref name="Lee Moretti Butler 2004" /&gt;]]
McCrary (2008) suggested examining the density of observations of the assignment variable.&lt;ref name="McCrary 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCrary |title=Manipulation of the Running Variable in the Regression Discontinuity Design: A Density Test |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=698–714 |doi=10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a discontinuity in the density of the assignment variable at the threshold for treatment, then this may suggest that some agents were able to perfectly manipulate their treatment status.

For example, if several students are able to get a "mercy pass", then there will be more students who just barely passed the exam than who just barely failed. Similarly, if students are allowed to retake the exam until they pass, then there will be a similar result. In both cases, this will likely show up when the density of exam grades is examined. "Gaming the system" in this manner could bias the treatment effect estimate.

==== Continuity of observable variables ====
Since the validity of the regression discontinuity design relies on those who were just barely treated being the same as those who were just barely not treated, it makes sense to examine if these groups are similar based on observable variables. For the earlier example, one could test if those who just barely passed have different characteristics (demographics, family income, etc.) than those who just barely failed. Although some variables may differ for the two groups based on random chance, most of these variables should be the same.&lt;ref name="Lee Moretti Butler 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |last2=Moretti |last3=Butler |title=Do Voters Affect or Elect Policies? Evidence from the U.S. House |year=2004 |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=119 |issue=3 |pages=807–859 |doi=10.1162/0033553041502153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Falsification tests ====

===== Predetermined variables =====
Similar to the continuity of observable variables, one would expect there to be continuity in predetermined variables at the treatment cut-off. Since these variables were determined before the treatment decision, treatment status should have no effect on them. Consider the earlier merit-based scholarship example. If the outcome of interest is future grades, then we would not expect the scholarship to affect earlier grades. If a discontinuity in predetermined variables is present at the treatment cut-off, then this puts the validity of the regression discontinuity design into question.

===== Other discontinuities =====
If discontinuities are present at other points of the assignment variable, where these are not expected, then this may make the regression discontinuity design suspect. Consider the example of Carpenter and Dobkin (2011) who studied the effect of legal access to alcohol in the United States.&lt;ref name=CarpenterDobkin2011 /&gt; As access to alcohol increases at age 21, this leads to changes in various outcomes, such as mortality rates and morbidity rates. If mortality and morbidity rates also increase discontinuously at other ages, then it throws the interpretation of the discontinuity at age 21 into question.

==== Inclusion and exclusion of covariates ====
If parameter estimates are sensitive to removing or adding [[covariate]]s to the model, then this may cast doubt on the validity of the regression discontinuity design. A significant change may suggest that those who just barely got treatment differ in these [[covariate]]s from those who just barely did not get treatment. Including [[covariate]]s would remove some of this bias. If a large amount of bias is present, and the [[covariate]]s explain a significant amount of this, then their inclusion or exclusion would significantly change the parameter estimate.&lt;ref name="Lee and Lemieux 2010"/&gt;

Recent work has shown how to add covariates, under what conditions doing so is valid, and the potential for increased precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calonico|last2=Cattaneo|last3=Farrell|last4=Titiunik|title=Regression Discontinuity Designs Using Covariates|journal=working paper|date=2018|url=https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdrobust/Calonico-Cattaneo-Farrell-Titiunik_2016_wp.pdf?attredirects=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
* When properly implemented and analyzed, the RDD yields an unbiased estimate of the local treatment effect.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first= |title=Assignment to Treatment on the Basis of a Covariate |journal=Journal of Educational and Behavioural Statistics |year=1977 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–26 |doi=10.3102/10769986002001001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RDD can be almost as good as a randomised experiment in measuring a treatment effect.
* RDD, as a [[quasi-experiment]], does not require [[ex ante]] randomization and circumvents ethical issues of [[randomization|random assignment]].
*Well-executed RDD studies can generate treatment effect estimates similar to estimates from randomized studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1198/016214508000000733|title=Can Nonrandomized Experiments Yield Accurate Answers? A Randomized Experiment Comparing Random and Nonrandom Assignments|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=103|issue=484|pages=1334|year=2008|last1=Shadish|first1=William R.|last2=Clark|first2=M. H.|last3=Steiner|first3=Peter M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3102/0162373713504988|title=Evaluating the Effectiveness of Developmental Mathematics by Embedding a Randomized Experiment Within a Regression Discontinuity Design|journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis|volume=36|issue=2|pages=170–185|year=2014|last1=Moss|first1=B. G.|last2=Yeaton|first2=W. H.|last3=Lloyd|first3=J. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
* The estimated effects are only [[unbiased]] if the [[functional form]] of the relationship between the treatment and outcome is correctly modelled. The most popular caveats are non-linear relationships that are mistaken as a discontinuity.
* Contamination by other treatments. If another treatment occurs at the same cut-off value of the same assignment variable, then the measured discontinuity in the outcome variable may be partially attributed to this other treatment. For example, suppose a researcher wishes to study the impact of legal access to alcohol on mental health using a regression discontinuity design at the minimum legal drinking age. The measured impact could be confused with legal access to gambling, which may occur at the same age.

== Extensions ==

=== Fuzzy RDD ===
The [[identifiability|identification]] of causal effects hinges on the crucial assumption that there is indeed a sharp cut-off, around which there is a discontinuity in the probability of assignment from 0 to 1. In reality, however, cut-offs are often not strictly implemented (e.g. exercised discretion for students who just fell short of passing the threshold) and the estimates will hence be [[statistical bias|biased]].

In contrast to the sharp regression discontinuity design, a '''fuzzy regression discontinuity design''' (FRDD) does not require a sharp discontinuity in the probability of assignment but is applicable as long as the probability of assignment is different. The intuition behind it is related to the [[instrumental variable]] strategy and [[intention to treat]].

=== Regression kink design ===
When the assignment variable is continuous (e.g. student aid) and depends predictably on another observed variable (e.g. family income), one can identify treatment effects using sharp changes in the slope of the treatment function. This technique was coined ''regression kink design'' by Nielsen, Sørensen, and Tabe (2010), though they cite similar earlier analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nielsen |first=H. S. |last2=Sørensen |first2=T. |last3=Taber |first3=C. R. |title=Estimating the Effect of Student Aid on College Enrollment: Evidence from a Government Grant Policy Reform |journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy |volume=2 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=185–215 |doi=10.1257/pol.2.2.185 |jstor=25760068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They write, "This approach resembles the regression discontinuity idea. Instead of a discontinuity of in the level of the stipend-income function, we have a discontinuity in the slope of the function." Rigorous theoretical foundations were provided by Card et al. (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nonlinear Policy Rules and the Identification and Estimation of Causal Effects in a Generalized Regression Kink Design |first=David |last=Card |first2=David S. |last2=Lee |first3=Zhuan |last3=Pei |first4=Andrea |last4=Weber |work=NBER Working Paper No. w18564 |doi=10.3386/w18564 |year=2012 |ssrn=2179402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an empirical application by Bockerman et al. (2018). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Kink that Makes You Sick: The Effect of Sick Pay on Absence|first=Petri |last=Bockerman |first2=Ohto |last2=Kanninen |first3=Ilpo |last3=Suoniemi |work= Journal of Applied Econometrics, 33:4, 568-579.|doi=10.1002/jae.2620 |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Note that ''regression kinks'' (or ''kinked regression'') can also mean a type of [[segmented regression]], which is a different type of analysis.

He went up to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1866 and graduated [[senior wrangler]] in 1870: he was then elected to a college fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PNDY866R|name=Pendlebury, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed University Lecturer in Mathematics in 1888. He collected early mathematical books and printed music, donating his collections to his college and university. His presentation of a collection of music books and manuscripts to the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] stimulated the formation of the Music Faculty at Cambridge University.

In 1872, along with the guide Ferdinand Imseng and other climbers, he made the first ascent of the [[Monte Rosa]] east face from Macugnaga.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PNDY866R|name=Pendlebury, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8877">In [[information technology]] and [[computer science]], a program is described as '''stateful''' if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/stateless|title=What is stateless? - Definition from WhatIs.com|author=|date=|website=techtarget.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remembered information is called the '''state''' of the system.

The set of states a system can occupy is known as its [[state space]].  In a [[discrete system]], the state space is [[countable]] and often [[Finite set|finite]], and  the system's internal behaviour or interaction with its environment consists of separately occurring individual actions or events, such as accepting input or producing output, that may or may not cause the system to change its state.  Examples of such systems are [[digital logic]] circuits and components, [[Automata theory|automata]] and [[Formal language theory|formal language]], [[computer program]]s, and [[computer]]s.  The output of a digital circuit or computer program at any time is completely determined by its current inputs and its state.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book

==Digital logic circuit state==
[[Digital logic]] circuits can be divided into two types: [[combinational logic]], whose output [[Digital signal (electronics)|signals]] are dependent only on its present input signals, and [[sequential logic]], whose outputs are a function of both the current inputs and the past history of inputs.&lt;ref name="Kaeslin"&gt;{{cite book

  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | isbn = 0521882672}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In sequential logic, information from past inputs is stored in electronic memory elements, such as [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]].  The stored contents of these memory elements, at a given point in time, is collectively referred to as the circuit's ''state'' and contains all the information about the past to which the circuit has access.&lt;ref name="Srinath"&gt;{{cite book

Since each [[Semiconductor memory|binary memory element]], such as a flip-flop, has only two possible states, ''one'' or ''zero'', and there is a finite number of memory elements, a digital circuit has only a certain finite number of possible states. If '''''N''''' is the number of binary memory elements in the circuit, the maximum number of states a circuit can have is '''2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

==Program state==
Similarly, a computer program stores data in [[Variable (computer science)|variable]]s, which represent storage locations in the [[Computer memory|computer's memory]].  The contents of these memory locations, at any given point in the program's execution, is called the program's ''state''.&lt;ref name="Laplante"&gt;{{cite book

A more specialized definition of state is used for computer programs that operate serially or sequentially on [[Stream (computing)|streams of data]], such as [[parser]]s, [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]s, [[communication protocol]]s  and [[encryption]].  Serial programs operate on the incoming data characters or packets sequentially, one at a time. In some of these programs, information about previous data characters or packets received is stored in variables and used to affect the processing of the current character or packet.  This is called a "[[stateless protocol|stateful protocol]]" and the data carried over from the previous processing cycle is called the "state".  In others, the program has no information about the previous data stream and starts "fresh" with each data input; this is called a "[[stateless protocol]]".

[[Imperative programming]] is a [[programming paradigm]] (way of designing a [[programming language]]) that describes computation in terms of the program state, and of the statements which change the program state. In [[declarative programming]] languages, the program describes the desired results and doesn't specify changes to the state directly.

==Finite state machines==
The output of a sequential circuit or computer program at any time is completely determined by its current inputs and current state.  Since each [[binary digit|binary]] memory element has only two possible states, 0 or 1, the total number of different states a circuit can assume is finite, and fixed by the number of memory elements.  If there are ''N'' binary memory elements, a digital circuit can have at most 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct states.  The concept of state is formalized in an abstract mathematical [[model of computation]] called a [[finite state machine]],  used to design both sequential digital circuits and computer programs.

==Examples==
An example of an everyday device that has a state is a [[television set]].  To change the channel of a TV, the user usually presses a "channel up" or "channel down" button on the remote control, which sends a coded message to the set.  In order to calculate the new channel that the user desires, the digital tuner in the television must have stored in it the number of the ''current channel'' it is on.  It then adds one or subtracts one from this number to get the number for the new channel, and adjusts the TV to receive that channel.  This new number is then stored as the ''current channel''.  Similarly, the television also stores a number that controls the level of [[Loudness|volume]] produced by the speaker.  Pressing the "volume up" or "volume down" buttons increments or decrements this number, setting a new level of volume.  Both the ''current channel'' and ''current volume'' numbers are part of the TV's state.  They are stored in [[non-volatile memory]], which preserves the information when the TV is turned off, so when it is turned on again the TV will return to its previous station and volume level.

As another example, the state of a [[microprocessor]] is the contents of all the memory elements in it: the [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]s, [[processor register|storage register]]s, [[data cache]]s, and [[flag (computing)|flag]]s.  When computers such as laptops go into a [[hibernation (computing)|hibernation mode]] to save energy by shutting down the processor, the state of the processor is stored on the computer's [[hard disk]], so it can be restored when the computer comes out of hibernation, and the processor can take up operations where it left off.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8490">A '''time derivative''' is a [[derivative]] of a function with respect to [[time]], usually interpreted as the [[Derivative|rate of change]] of the value of the function.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alpha Chiang|Chiang, Alpha C.]], ''Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics'', McGraw-Hill, third edition, 1984, ch. 14, 15, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The variable denoting time is usually written as &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt;.

==Notation==
A variety of notations are used to denote the time derivative. In addition to the normal ([[Leibniz's notation|Leibniz's]]) notation,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dx} {dt}&lt;/math&gt;

A very common short-hand notation used, especially in physics, is the 'over-dot'. I.E.

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
(This is called [[Newton's notation]])

Higher time derivatives are also used: the [[second derivative]] with respect to time is written as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2x} {dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

with the corresponding shorthand of &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

As a generalization, the time derivative of a vector, say:

:&lt;math&gt; \vec V = \left[ v_1,\ v_2,\ v_3, \cdots \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

is defined as the vector whose components are the derivatives of the components of the original vector. That is,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d \vec V } {dt} = \left[ \frac{ d v_1 }{dt},\frac {d  v_2 }{dt},\frac {d  v_3 }{dt}, \cdots \right] \ . &lt;/math&gt;

==Use in physics==
Time derivatives are a key concept in [[physics]]. For example, for a changing [[position (vector)|position]] &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, its time derivative &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is its [[velocity]], and its second derivative with respect to time, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;, is its [[acceleration]]. Even higher derivatives are sometimes also used: the third derivative of position with respect to time is known as the [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]]. See [[motion graphs and derivatives]].

A large number of fundamental equations in physics involve first or second time derivatives of quantities. Many other fundamental quantities in science are time derivatives of one another:
* [[force]] is the time derivative of [[momentum]]
* [[Power (physics)|power]] is the time derivative of [[energy]]
* [[electric current]] is the time derivative of [[electric charge]]
and so on.

A common occurrence in physics is the time derivative of a [[vector (geometric)|vector]], such as velocity or displacement. In dealing with such a derivative, both magnitude and orientation may depend upon time.

===Example: circular motion===
{{See also|Uniform circular motion|Centripetal force}}
[[Image:polar rectangular.svg|thumb|300px|Relation between Cartesian coordinates (''x'',''y'') and [[polar coordinates]] (''r'',''θ'').]]
For example, consider a particle moving in a circular path. Its position is given by the displacement vector &lt;math&gt;r=x\hat{\imath}+y\hat{\jmath}&lt;/math&gt;, related to the angle, ''θ'', and radial distance, ''r'', as defined in the figure:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x &amp;= r  \cos\theta \\
y &amp;= r \sin\theta 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For purposes of this example, set {{Nowrap|1=''θ'' = ''t''}}. The displacement (position) at any time ''t'' is then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(t) = r\cos(t)\hat{\imath}+r\sin(t)\hat{\jmath}&lt;/math&gt;

This form shows the motion described by '''''r'''''(''t'') is in a circle of radius ''r'' because the ''magnitude'' of '''''r'''''(''t'') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{r}(t)| = \sqrt{\mathbf{r}(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}(t)}=\sqrt {x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 } = r\, \sqrt{\cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t)} = r&lt;/math&gt;

using the [[trigonometric identity]] {{Nowrap|1=sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''t'') + cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''t'') = 1}} and where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the usual euclidean dot product.

With this form for the displacement, the velocity now is found. The time derivative of the displacement vector is the velocity vector. In general, the derivative of a vector is a vector made up of components each of which is the derivative of the corresponding component of the original vector. Thus, in this case, the velocity vector is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{v}(t) = \frac {d\,\mathbf{r}(t) }{dt} &amp;= r \left[\frac{d\, \cos(t)}{dt}, \frac{d\, \sin(t)}{dt} \right] \\
 &amp;= r\ [ -\sin(t),\  \cos(t)] \\
 &amp;= [-y (t), x(t)].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the velocity of the particle is nonzero even though the magnitude of the position (that is, the radius of the path) is constant. The velocity is directed perpendicular to the displacement, as can be established using the [[dot product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{r} = [-y, x] \cdot [x, y] = -yx + xy = 0\, . &lt;/math&gt;

Acceleration is then the time-derivative of velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(t) = \frac {d\, \mathbf{v}(t)}{dt} = [-x(t), -y(t)] = -\mathbf{r}(t)\, .&lt;/math&gt;

The acceleration is directed inward, toward the axis of rotation. It points opposite to the position vector and perpendicular to the velocity vector. This inward-directed acceleration is called [[centripetal force|centripetal acceleration]].

==In differential geometry==

In [[differential geometry]], quantities are often expressed with respect to the local [[Curvilinear_coordinates#Covariant_and_contravariant_bases| covariant basis]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt;, where ''i'' ranges over the number of dimensions. The components of a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} &lt;/math&gt; expressed this way transform as a contravariant [[Tensor field|tensor]], as shown in the expression &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}=U^i\mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt;, invoking [[Einstein summation convention]]. If we want to calculate the time derivates of these components along a trajectory, so that we have &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}(t)=U^i(t)\mathbf{e}_i(t) &lt;/math&gt;, we can define a new operator, the invariant derivative &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt;, which will continue to return contravariant tensors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grinfeld|first1=Pavel|title=Tensor Calculus 6d: Velocity, Acceleration, Jolt and the New δ/δt-derivative|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx0oql3LIiU&amp;list=PLlXfTHzgMRULkodlIEqfgTS-H1AY_bNtq&amp;index=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{\delta U^i}{\delta t}   
     = \frac{d U^i}{d t} + V^j\Gamma^i_{jk} U^k \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V^j=\frac{d x^j}{d t} &lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;x^j&lt;/math&gt; being the ''j''th coordinate) captures the components of the velocity in the local covariant basis, and &lt;math&gt; \Gamma^i_{jk} &lt;/math&gt; are the [[Christoffel symbols]] for the coordinate system. Note that explicit dependence on ''t'' has been repressed in the notation. We can then write:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{d \mathbf{U}}{d t}   
     = \frac{\delta U^i}{\delta t} \mathbf{e}_i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

as well as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{d^2 \mathbf{U}}{d t^2}   
     = \frac{\delta^2 U^i}{\delta t^2} \mathbf{e}_i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the [[covariant derivative]], &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{\delta U^i}{\delta t}   
     = V^j \nabla_{j} U^i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Use in economics==

In [[economics]], many theoretical models of the evolution of various economic variables are constructed in [[continuous time]] and therefore employ time derivatives. See for example [[exogenous growth model]] and &lt;ref&gt;Romer, David, ''Advanced Macroeconomics'', McGraw-Hill, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ch. 1-3&lt;/sup&gt;.  One situation involves a [[stocks and flows|stock variable]] and its time derivative, a [[stocks and flows|flow variable]].  Examples include: 

* The flow of net [[fixed investment]] is the time derivative of the [[capital stock]].
* The flow of [[inventory investment]] is the time derivative of the stock of [[inventories]].
* The growth rate of the [[money supply]] is the time derivative of the money supply divided by the money supply itself.

Sometimes the time derivative of a flow variable can appear in a model:

* The growth rate of [[output (economics)|output]] is the time derivative of the flow of output divided by output itself.
* The growth rate of the [[labor force]] is the time derivative of the labor force divided by the labor force itself.

And sometimes there appears a time derivative of a variable which, unlike the examples above, is not measured in units of currency:

* The time derivative of a key [[interest rate]] can appear.
* The [[inflation rate]] is the growth rate of the [[price level]]&amp;mdash;that is, the time derivative of the price level divided by the price level itself.

In [[mathematics]], the adjective '''trivial''' is frequently used for [[Category theory|objects]] (for example, [[group (mathematics)|group]]s or [[topological space]]s) that have a very simple structure. The noun '''triviality''' usually refers to a simple technical aspect of some proof or definition. The origin of the term in mathematical language comes from the medieval [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] curriculum. The antonym '''nontrivial''' is commonly used by engineers and mathematicians to indicate a statement or theorem that is not obvious or easy to prove.

==Trivial and nontrivial solutions==
In mathematics, the term trivial is frequently used for objects (for examples, groups or topological spaces) that have a very simple structure.

Examples  are as follows:
*[[empty set]]: the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] containing no or null members.
*[[trivial group]]: the mathematical [[group (mathematics)|group]] containing only the [[identity element]].
*[[trivial ring]]: a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] defined on a [[singleton set]].
''Trivial'' can also be used to describe solutions to an [[equation]] that have a very simple structure, but for the sake of completeness cannot be omitted. These solutions are called the '''trivial solutions'''.  For example, consider the [[differential equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;y'=y&lt;/math&gt;
where ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[derivative]] is ''y''&amp;prime;. The trivial solution is
:''y'' = 0, the [[0 (number)#Related mathematical terms|zero function]]
while a '''nontrivial''' solution is
:''y'' (''x'') = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[exponential function]].

The differential equation &lt;math&gt;f''(x)=-\lambda f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;f(0) = f(L) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is important in math and physics, for example describing a [[particle in a box]] in quantum mechanics, or [[standing wave]]s on a string. It always has the solution &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This solution is considered obvious and is called the "trivial" solution. In some cases, there may be other solutions ([[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s), which are called "nontrivial".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YRT0W31HbTwC&amp;pg=PA309 Introduction to partial differential equations with applications, by Zachmanoglou and Thoe, p309]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, mathematicians often describe  [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] as asserting that there are no nontrivial integer solutions to the equation &lt;math&gt;a^n + b^n = c^n&lt;/math&gt; when ''n'' is greater than 2.  Clearly, there ''are'' some solutions to the equation.  For example, &lt;math&gt;a=b=c=0&lt;/math&gt; is a solution for any ''n'', but such solutions are all obvious and uninteresting, and hence "trivial".

==In mathematical reasoning==
''Trivial'' may also refer to any easy [[Proof by exhaustion|case]] of a proof, which for the sake of completeness cannot be ignored.  For instance, proofs by [[mathematical induction]] have two parts: the "base case" that shows that the theorem is true for a particular initial value such as ''n'' = 0 or ''n'' = 1 and then an inductive step that shows that if the theorem is true for a certain value of ''n'', it is also true for the value ''n'' + 1.  The base case is often trivial and is identified as such, although there are situations where the base case is difficult but the inductive step is trivial. Similarly, one might want to prove that some property is possessed by all the members of a certain set.  The main part of the proof will consider the case of a nonempty set, and examine the members in detail; in the case where the set is empty, the property is trivially possessed by all the members, since there are none.  (See also [[Vacuous truth]].)

A common joke in the mathematical community is to say that "trivial" is synonymous with "proved"—that is, any theorem can be considered "trivial" once it is known to be true.  Another joke concerns two mathematicians who are discussing a theorem; the first mathematician says that the theorem is "trivial".  In response to the other's request for an explanation, he then proceeds with twenty minutes of exposition.  At the end of the explanation, the second mathematician agrees that the theorem is trivial.  These jokes point out the subjectivity of judgments about triviality.  The joke also applies when the first mathematician says the theorem is trivial, but is unable to prove it himself. Often, as a joke, the theorem is then referred to as "intuitively obvious".  Someone experienced in [[calculus]], for example, would consider the statement that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 x^2\, dx = \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; to be trivial. To a beginning student of calculus, though, this may not be obvious at all.

Triviality also depends on context. A proof in [[functional analysis]] would probably, given a number, trivially assume the existence of a larger number. When proving basic results about the natural numbers in [[elementary number theory]] though, the proof may very well hinge on the remark that any natural number has a successor (which should then in itself be proved or taken as an [[axiom]], see [[Peano's axioms]]).

=== Trivial proofs ===
In some texts, a ''trivial proof'' refers to a statement involving a [[Material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]] where the [[consequent]], or ''Q'', in ''P''→''Q'', is always true.&lt;ref name="Chartrand"&gt;{{cite book|last3=Zhang|first1=Gary|last1=Chartrand|author1-link=Gary Chartrand|first2=Albert D.|last2=Polimeni|first3=Ping|author3-link=Ping Zhang (graph theorist)|title=Mathematical proofs : a transition to advanced mathematics|year=2008|publisher=Pearson/Addison Wesley|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-3-2139053-0|page=68|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Here, the proof follows simply from noting that ''Q'' is always true, as the implication is then true regardless of the truth value of the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]], ''P''.&lt;ref name="Chartrand" /&gt;

A related concept is a [[vacuous truth]], where the antecedent, ''P'', in the material implication ''P''→''Q'' is always false.&lt;ref name="Chartrand" /&gt;  Here, the implication is always true regardless of the truth value of the consequent, ''Q''.&lt;ref name="Chartrand" /&gt;

== Examples ==
*In [[number theory]], it is often important to find [[divisor|factors]] of an integer number N. Any number N has four obvious factors: ±1 and ±N. These are called "trivial factors". Any other factor, if any exist, would be called "nontrivial".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lIvPz7k41SEC&amp;pg=PA250 Number theory for computing, by Song Y. Yan, p250]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed matrix, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is an unknown vector, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; is the zero vector, has an obvious solution &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;. This is called the "trivial solution". If it has other solutions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\neq\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, they would be called "nontrivial"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KWAqz3m2xYUC&amp;pg=PA502 Mathematics for engineers and scientists, by Alan Jeffrey, p502]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the mathematics of [[group theory]], there is a very simple group with just one element in it; this is often called the "trivial group". All other groups, which are more complicated, are called "nontrivial".
*In [[graph theory]] the trivial graph is a graph which has only 1 vertex and no edges.
*[[Database theory]] has a concept called [[functional dependency]], written &lt;math&gt; X \to Y &lt;/math&gt;. The dependence &lt;math&gt; X \to Y &lt;/math&gt; is true if ''Y'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', so this type of dependence is called "trivial". All other dependences, which are less obvious, are called "nontrivial".
* It can be shown that [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]] has zeros at the negative even numbers -2, -4, ... Though the proof is comparatively easy, this result would still not normally be called trivial; however, it is in this case, for its ''other'' zeros are not generally known and have important applications and involve open questions (such as the Riemann hypothesis); and so, the negative even numbers are called the trivial zeros, and any other zeros are called non-trivial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6129">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], the '''tube lemma''' is a useful tool in order to prove that the finite product of [[compact space]]s is compact. It is in general, a concept of [[point-set topology]].

Before giving the lemma, one notes the following terminology:

* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[topological spaces]] and ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is the product space, a slice in ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is a set of the form {''x''}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' for ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''
* A tube in ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is just a [[Base (topology)|basis element]], ''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'', in ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' containing a slice in ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y''

'''Tube Lemma:''' Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces with ''Y'' compact, and consider the [[Product topology|product space]] ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y''. If ''N'' is an open set containing a slice in ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'', then there exists a tube in ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' containing this slice and contained in ''N''.

Using the concept of [[closed map]]s, this can be rephrased concisely as follows: if ''X'' is any topological space and ''Y'' a compact space, then the projection map ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X'' is closed.

'''Generalized Tube Lemma:''' Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces and consider the product space ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y''. Let ''A'' be a compact subset of ''X'' and ''B'' be a compact subset of ''Y''. If ''N'' is an open set containing ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''B'', then there exists ''U'' open in ''X'' and ''V'' open in ''Y'' such that &lt;math&gt;A\times B\subset U\times V\subset N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples and properties==

1. Consider ''R'' × ''R'' in the product topology, that is the [[Euclidean plane]], and the open set ''N'' = { (''x'', ''y'') : |''x''·''y''| &amp;lt; 1 }.  The open set ''N'' contains {0} × ''R'', but contains no tube, so in this case the tube lemma fails.  Indeed, if ''W'' × ''R'' is a tube containing {0} × ''R'' and contained in ''N'', ''W'' must be a subset of (−1/''x'', +1/''x'') for all positive integers ''x'' which means ''W'' = {0} contradicting the fact that ''W'' is open in ''R'' (because ''W'' × ''R'' is a tube). This shows that the compactness assumption is essential.

2. The tube lemma can be used to prove that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are compact topological spaces, then ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is compact as follows:

Let {''G''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;} be an open cover of ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y''; for each ''x'' belonging to ''X'', cover the slice {''x''}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' by finitely many elements of {''G''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;} (this is possible since {''x''}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is compact being [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to ''Y''). Call the union of these finitely many elements ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. By the tube lemma, there is an open set of the form ''W''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' containing {''x''}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' and contained in ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. The collection of all ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''x'' belonging to ''X'' is an open cover of ''X'' and hence has a finite subcover ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. Then for each ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is contained in ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. Using the fact that each ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the finite union of elements of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and that the finite collection (''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'')&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;(''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'') covers ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y'', the collection ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is a finite subcover of ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''Y''.

3. By example 2 and induction, one can show that the finite product of compact spaces is compact.

4. The tube lemma cannot be used to prove the [[Tychonoff theorem]], which generalizes the above to infinite products.

==Proof==
The tube lemma follows from the generalized tube lemma by taking &lt;math&gt;A=\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=Y&lt;/math&gt;. It therefore suffices to prove the generalized tube lemma. By the definition of the product topology, for each &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\in A\times B&lt;/math&gt; there are open sets &lt;math&gt;U_{a,b}\subset X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{a,b}\subset Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\in U_{a,b}\times V_{a,b}\subset N&lt;/math&gt;. Fix some &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(V_{a,b}:b\in B)&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is compact, this cover has a finite subcover; namely, there is a finite &lt;math&gt;B_0(a)\subset B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;V'_{a}:=\bigcup_{b\in B_0(a)} V_{a,b}\supset B&lt;/math&gt;. Set &lt;math&gt;U'_a:=\bigcap_{b\in B_0(a)} U_{a,b}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;B_0(a)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;U'_a&lt;/math&gt; is open. Also &lt;math&gt;V'_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is open. Moreover, the construction of &lt;math&gt;U'_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V'_a&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\{a\}\times B\subset U'_a\times V'_a\subset N&lt;/math&gt;. We now essentially repeat the argument to drop the dependence on &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;A_0\subset A&lt;/math&gt; be a finite subset such that &lt;math&gt;U'':=\bigcup_{a\in A_0}U'_a\supset A&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;V'':=\bigcap_{a\in A_0}V'_a&lt;/math&gt;. It then follows by the above reasoning that &lt;math&gt;A\times B\subset U''\times V''\subset N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U''\subset X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V''\subset Y&lt;/math&gt; are open, which completes the proof.
