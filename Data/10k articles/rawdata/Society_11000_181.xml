In 2006 there were 11,000 couples in Italy on the waiting lists of various adoption agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/italy/story/0,,2000691,00.html] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

As in most jurisdictions, prospective adoptive parents are required to undergo assessment and must show that they will make suitable parents. Italian law&lt;ref&gt;Art. 6 of law 184/83 (modified by law 149/2001)&lt;/ref&gt; requires adopters to be married (or living together) for at least 3 years. There are also restrictions on the age difference between the prospective parents and the child or children they wish to adopt.  On June 22, 2016, the possibility of stepchild adoption by LGBT couples was confirmed by the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] in a decision published on 22 June 2016.&lt;ref name="repubblica.it"&gt;{{it icon}}{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/06/22/news/cassazione_si_a_stapchild_adoption-142563271/?refresh_ce|title=Cassazione, via libera alla stepchild adoption in casi particolari|work=Repubblica}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Italian law prohibits adoption by [[Single-parent|single parents]], unless one of the parents inherited custody of the child through either [[legal separation]] or death of a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adoptionpolicy.org/pdf/eu-italy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to statistical data published by the Italian Commissione per le Adozioni Internazionali,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commissioneadozioni.it/media/68239/prereport_adozioni2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 was the year with the highest number of international adoptions by Italian couples. The Commission for International Adoptions, chaired by Undersecretary Senator [[Carlo Giovanardi]], granted entry in Italy to 4130 children from 58 countries, up from 3964 in 2009 (4.2% increase), 639 of which were [[special needs]] children.

The first country of origin is the [[Russian Federation]] with 707 children, but there was a particularly high increase in the number of children from [[Colombia]], who numbered 592 compared to 444 of 2009. Colombia is therefore the second largest country of origin, followed by [[Ukraine]] with 426 adoptions, [[Brazil]] with 318, [[Ethiopia]] with 274, [[Vietnam]] with 251 and [[Poland]] with 193.

There was a significant increase of children from [[Latin America]] (+16.34%) and Asia (+34.71%) despite changes in domestic laws taking place in countries such as Vietnam, [[Cambodia]] and [[Nepal]]. Children from [[Africa|African countries]] numbered 443.

The Italian region with the highest number of adoptions is [[Lombardy]], followed by [[Latium]], [[Tuscany]] and [[Veneto]], but a significant increase was noted in the southern regions, especially [[Campania]], [[Apulia]], [[Calabria]] and [[Sardinia]]. The only region where international adoptions in 2010 decreased by 14% was [[Sicily]].

Foreign children adopted by Italian couples in 2010 were on average 6 years old, up from 5.9 in 2009.

'''Agropolis Fondation''', extended name "Montpellier Agricultural Sciences and Sustainable Development” was created in France on Feb. 21st, 2007 by the three initial founding institutions [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]], [[CIRAD]], and [[SupAgro|Montpellier SupAgro]].
&lt;br&gt;It constitutes the legal frame of the thematic network for advanced research (RTRA) “Agricultural Sciences and Sustainable Development”, a network of research units (further described below), selected in 2006 together with twelve other networks for advanced research in various disciplines (''e.g.'' [[Paris School of Economics]]) by the French Ministry for Research and higher education.
&lt;br&gt;The Foundation is to promote the development of scientific projects of international level (research programmes and education through research) in the field of agronomy and sustainable development in relation to both North and South issues.

== Scientific frame of the network ==
The network scientific priorities relate to the following global issues :
*An increased demand for plants, for both food and non-food purposes
*The necessary adaption of crops to climate change
*The prevention of risks such as plant pests and diseases, diminishing natural resources, risks related to food safety, social risks…

The network is composed of high level scientific teams, organized in two tightly connected fields :
*Plant integrative biology, in the broadest sense: genetics and genomics, plant breeding, ecophysiology; plant pests and diseases, integrated crop protection, population ecology…
*Socio-technical dynamics of innovation : agri-environmental innovation, food industry innovation, social innovation and social management of innovation

The thematics involved are centering on the plant : the plant, from the gene to the whole plant ; the plant in its environment; plant products and their food and non-food uses…

==A network of research Units==
In 2007, the network is composed of 29 research units (including 19 joint research units and 10 in-house research units);

Approx. 780 scientists are involved : 
*580 scientists belonging to the three initial founding institutions (500 working in Montpellier and Avignon and 80 scientists abroad).
*200 scientists from partner institutions of the joint research units ([[CNRS]], IRD, the [[University of Montpellier]] I and II, the [http://www.univ-avignon.fr/ University of Avignon], and [http://www.iamm.fr/index.php CIHEAM-IAMM])

==Aims of the Foundation==

The Foundation is aiming at

*increasing the international openness, attractiveness and renown of the Montpellier agronomic research complex especially by attracting high level foreign scientists and by contributing to the development of international cooperation projects.
*stimulating the collaboration between the research units in the network.
*strengthening the offer in education through research especially towards students from emerging and developing countries

To fulfill these aims, the foundation will support incoming high level foreign scientists, finance post-doctoral and doctoral positions,  contribute to the development of structuring technological projects (''i.e.'' technical platforms, shared equipment…),  support thematic training sessions and scientific events of international importance, as well as various others actions (release from teaching duties, support for the setting up of international projects …).

The Foundation’s actions are to be linked to those of the [[Agropolis International]] association to allow Montpellier institutions involved in agricultural sciences as a whole (totalizing approx. 2300 scientists) to reach the same international repute as other agricultural research institutes at European (e.g. [[Wageningen University]], with 1400 scientists) or international (e.g. the  [[CGIAR]] centers network, with 1800 scientists) level.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations." [[Emma Goldman]]. "What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, — follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg."

Capitalism is generally considered by scholars to be an [[economic system]] that includes [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], creation of goods or services for [[profit (economics)|profit]] or [[income]], the [[Capital accumulation|accumulation of capital]], [[Competition (economics)|competitive markets]], [[voluntary exchange]], [[wage labor]] and has generally been opposed by anarchists historically.&lt;ref&gt;Heilbroner, Robert L.

Most anarchist commentators do not consider [[anarcho-capitalism]] as a legitimate form of anarchism due to perceived coercive characteristics of capitalism. In particular, they argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion in violation of anarchist principles.&lt;ref name=AFAQV1&gt;{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Iain|title=An Anarchist FAQ, Volume I|year=2007|publisher=[[AK Press]]|isbn=978-1-902593-90-6|url=http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|chapter=Section F - Is "anarcho"-capitalism a type of anarchism?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128135116/http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|archivedate=2012-01-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFAQinfoshop&gt;{{cite web|title=Section F - Is "anarcho"-capitalism a type of anarchism? |url=http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionF |work=[[An Anarchist FAQ]] |publisher=[[Infoshop.org]] |accessdate=3 December 2011 |author=Iain McKay |date=21 January 2010 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205172644/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionF |archivedate=5 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalists argue that capitalism is the absence of coercion and therefore fully compatible with the philosophy of anarchism. Furthermore, they claim that an effort to put a stop to what they consider voluntary hierarchy is inconsistent with the philosophical tradition of freedom present in anarchist thought.&lt;ref name=AFAQV2&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Andrew|title=[[The Capitalist Manifesto: The Historic, Economic and Philosophic Case for Laissez-faire]], |year=2005|publisher=[[University of America]]|isbn=0-7618-3221-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarchist criticisms of capitalism==
{{see also|Criticism of capitalism#Anarchist criticisms of capitalism}}
=== Private property ===
There is some debate about the question of private property and economic organization. [[Social anarchists]] claim that the existence of [[private property]] results in [[wage slavery]] while certain [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] argue for private property and wages owned and controlled directly by workers themselves in the form of [[worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms and associations]].&lt;ref&gt;quoted by James J. Martin. Men Against the State, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, pp. 190-1&lt;/ref&gt; For Proudhon, "strong workers' associations…would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1984, p. 230 and p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wage labor===

Traditional individualist anarchists, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] (who identified his [[American individualist anarchism]] as "anarchistic socialism") are opposed to both capitalism and [[Anarcho-communism|anarchist-communism]]. They support [[wage labor]] as long as the employers and employees are paid equally for equal hours worked&lt;ref&gt;Cheyney, Ryan C. Social Justice and the Right to the Labor Product. Political Theory, Vol. 8, No. 4. (Nov., 1980), p. 506&lt;/ref&gt; and neither party has authority over the other (this approach was put into practice in American individualist anarchist colonies such as [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]], which was organized by [[Josiah Warren]]). By following this principle, no individual profits from the labor of another. Tucker described the wages received in such an employer-employee relationship as the individual laborer's "full product". He envisioned that in such a society, every worker would be self-employed and own their own private means of production, free to walk away from employment contracts. Tucker called communist-anarchism "pseudo-anarchism" because it opposes wages and private property, fearing that collectivization would subdue individuals to group mentality and rob workers of the full product of their labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker37.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407014846/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker37.html |archivedate=2005-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Preamble to the Constitution of the [[Anarcho-Syndicalism|Syndicalist]] [[Industrial Workers of the World]] labor union states unequivocally:&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of the conservative motto, "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work," we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, "Abolition of the wage system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/culture/official/preamble.shtml |title=Preamble to the IWW Constitution &amp;#124; Industrial Workers of the World |website=Iww.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Equality===
Many anarcho-capitalists believe that inequality is not a major concern so long as everyone has "equality of opportunity". Anarcho-capitalist [[Murray Rothbard]] argued "the 'rightist' libertarian is not opposed to inequality".&lt;ref&gt;For a New Liberty, p. 47For a New Liberty, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that because of a person's self-ownership, that any freedom given up in a ''laissez-faire'' marketplace would be a voluntary contract (consent) and believe there is nothing authoritarian about capitalist employer-employee relationships in such a condition: "There is nothing authoritarian, dictatorial or exploitative in the relationship. Employees order employers to pay them amounts specified in the hiring contract just as much as employers order employees to abide by the terms of the contract".&lt;ref&gt;Markets, Entrepreneurs and Liberty, p. 136, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray Rothbard defines equality as "A and B are 'equal' if they are identical to each other with respect to a given attribute…There is one and only one way, then, in which any two people can really be 'equal' in the fullest sense: they must be identical in all their attributes"&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. Egalitarianism as a Revolt against Nature and Other Essays, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and argues "men are not uniform, [...] the species, mankind, is uniquely characterised by a high degree of variety, diversity, differentiation: in short, inequality".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. Egalitarianism as a Revolt against Nature and Other Essays, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; This runs counter the concept of equality amongst most social and mutualist anarchists. Most anarchists would argue that freedom without equality simply gives more freedom to those who are supposedly "superior" and that equality without freedom is a form of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. What is Property? p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ABC of Anarchism, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chomsky Reader, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchist Alexander Berkman argued:

{{quotation|Equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity…Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse, in fact. Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality. Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse, and only the repression of this free diversity results in levelling, in uniformity and sameness. Free opportunity and acting out your individuality means development of natural dissimilarities and variations…Life in freedom, in anarchy will do more than liberate man merely from his present political and economic bondage. That will be only the first step, the preliminary to a truly human existence.&lt;ref&gt;Berkman, Alexander. The ABC of Anarchism, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Some anarcho-capitalists, who consider themselves part of the individualist anarchist tradition, draw upon the writings of early individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker and [[Lysander Spooner]] who argued that unequal wealth would not equal an unequal society. However, said anarchists believed that equality of condition, equality of access to the means of production and equal opportunity would counteract any potential tyranny in a market society. "Spooner and Godwin insist that inequality corrupts freedom. Their anarchism is directed as much against inequality as against tyranny" and "[w]hile sympathetic to Spooner's individualist anarchism, they [Rothbard and [[David D. Friedman]]] fail to notice or conveniently overlook its egalitarian implications".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Newman, Liberalism at Wit's End, p. 74, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker himself argued for a society with "the greatest amount of liberty compatible with equality of liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic issues==
{{main|Anarchist economics}}
Some anarchists object to the portrayal of economics as a "value-free science": {{quote|[A]ll the so-called laws and theories of political economy are in reality no more than statements of the following nature: 'Granting that there are always in a country a considerable number of people who cannot subsist a month, or even a fortnight, without accepting the conditions of work imposed upon them by the State, or offered to them by those whom the State recognizes as owners of land, factories, railways, etc., then the results will be so and so.' So far middle-class political economy has been only an enumeration of what happens under the just-mentioned conditions – without distinctly stating the conditions themselves. And then, having described the facts which arise in our society under these conditions, they represent to us these facts as rigid, inevitable economic laws.|[[Peter Kropotkin]], ''Revolutionary Pamphlets'', p. 179|source=}}

It has also been pointed out that historically the anarchist-communist economic theories published by [[Peter Kropotkin]] and others have been ignored or intentionally sidelined by historians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hetsa.fec.anu.edu.au/review/ejournal/pdf/31-A-3.pdf Microsoft Word - HER31Knowles.doc&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050615022420/http://hetsa.fec.anu.edu.au/review/ejournal/pdf/31-A-3.pdf|date=June 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the realm of anarchist labor issues is the issue of the monetary system. While all anarchists are against the current monetary system, there is disagreement as to whether or not there should be a monetary system. [[Alexander Berkman]] was an anarchist against the monetary system. In his book ''[[Now and After|What is Anarchism?]]'', Berkman argues that in an anarchist society money would become unnecessary. Within anarchy, all occupations are viewed as equally beneficial to society. Since the concept of value is different for everyone and cannot be determined, it is argued that it should not be set and one's contribution to society through their occupation entitled them to be a part of it. Within this system, there is a free distribution of goods without the need for money. Money in its current form is a hierarchical system, the exception being when all people are paid equal salaries. However, the argument goes further to question the purpose of money if people are paid equally. Certainly those who agree with this would also note that a monetary system would open a vulnerability for some to acquire more of it and create a class system.

Not all anarchists oppose the idea of money. Individualist and mutualist anarchists see currency as a tangible form of workers receiving the "full product of their labor". They support mutual banking (some individualists support no banking at all to keep exchange rates constant) and local currency as opposed to national currency.&lt;ref&gt;Citizens' money, a lecture on the "National banking system." Delivered in Chicago and published in "Liberty," of Boston, in 1888. San Fran: Equity publishing co, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/westrup/citizensmoney.pdf Citizens' money, a critical analysis in the light of free trade in banking a lecture by Alfred B. Westrup ... delivered in Chicago, Sunday, June 3, 1888, and in Toledo, O., under the auspices of the Society for Economic Inquiry, Feb. 19, 1891.

'''Andre Crawford''' (born March 20, 1962) is a [[serial killer]], who killed 11 women between 1993 and 1999. Many of the women were [[prostitutes]] or [[drug addicts]]. He also had [[Necrophilia|sex with their corpses]].&lt;ref name="trib" /&gt;

Crawford had been placed in foster care as an infant after authorities found him living alone in squalor and after his mother admitted leaving him unattended for long periods of time. As a child he had lived with a foster family.&lt;ref name="trib1216" /&gt; As an adult, he became a [[Homelessness|transient]], living in vacant buildings in Chicago.&lt;ref name="trib1103" /&gt;

He was accused of the murder of Evandry Harris, Patricia Dunn, Rhonda King, Angel Shatteen, Shaquanta Langley, Sonja Brandon, Nicole Townsend, Cheryl Cross, Tommie Dennis, Sheryl Johnson and Constance Bailey. He was linked by DNA to seven of the victims, and confessed to all 11 murders. He was convicted in December 2009.&lt;ref name="trib1103" /&gt; A 12th woman was attacked and left for dead on Thanksgiving 1997, but survived.&lt;ref name="wmaq1218" /&gt;

[[Hubert Geralds]], Jr., 34, was convicted in 1997 of murdering six women in Chicago's [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]] neighborhood. The first victim was Rhonda King. Under interrogation by police, he confessed to all six murders. In 1998 he was sentenced to death. In 2000 prosecutors moved to vacate the conviction for the King murder, because DNA linked her death to Andre Crawford. Geralds remained on death row for the other five murders, however.&lt;ref name="nwu" /&gt;

'''Angelica Fraser''' (25 January, 1823 – 27 November, 1910) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] social reformer. She was active in arranging bible based education for tailors and "Tailor's Hall" was opened in London. In Edinburgh she founded a [[temperance society]] for tailors and another for working women.

==Life==
Fraser was born in [[Aberdeen]] in 1823. Her mother, Agnes, died when she was eleven and she took a strong interest in religion.  Her father, Alexander, was the [[Lord Provost]] of Aberdeen. Fraser became interested in the education and well-being of tailors.&lt;ref name=ody/&gt; In 1856 she first entered a tailor's workshop to educate them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19080513.2.23.8|title=Papers Past {{!}} &amp;quot;THE TAILORS' FRIEND.&amp;quot; THE IMPRESSIONIST DRESSER. (Dominion, 1908-05-13)|last=Zealand|first=National Library of New|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She arranged for volunteers to read from the Bible as the tailors worked. The idea caught on and similar groups of lady readers were established in Belfast, London and Liverpool to read to tailors as they worked. Fraser thought that the tailors would improve their own working conditions if they were better informed and educated and in 1875 they formed the "Edinburgh Tailors' Abstinence Union".&lt;ref name=ody&gt;Kelly, S. (2004-09-23). Fraser, Angelica Patience (1823–1910), social reformer. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 23 Dec. 2017, see [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-59507 link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 she formed the "Scottish Ladies' Temperance Society". The society intended to open public houses where alcohol would not be served. They identified laundresses, cooks and similar jobs which made women prone to the temptation of drink. The society planned to make them total abstainers.&lt;ref name="MurrayStark2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Janet Horowitz Murray|author2=Myra Stark|title=The Englishwoman's Review of Social and Industrial Questions: 1875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcwBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT211|date=27 January 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-315-41091-3|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser moved to London in 1879 and the following year organised a conference on matters important to tailors. By 1885 monies had been raised to open an institute with a lecture hall and reading room. It was known as "Tailors' Hall". She became known as the tailors' "Florence Nightingale"&lt;ref name="ody" /&gt; or the "Tailor's Friend". In 1906, on the 50th anniversary of her first work with tailors she established an endowment fund to raise £5000 to ensure the continued work at Tailors' Hall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fraser remained a regular visitor to Tailor's Hall until she died at her home in [[London]] in November 1910.&lt;ref name=ody/&gt;

[[File:FlorentineCodex BK12 F54 smallpox.jpg|thumb|250px|Drawing accompanying text in Book XII of the 16th-century ''[[Florentine Codex]]'' (compiled 1540–1585), showing [[Nahua people|Nahua]] of conquest-era central Mexico suffering from smallpox.]]  '''The Aztec medicine''' concerns the body of knowledge, belief and a ritual surrounding human health and sickness, as observed among the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking peoples in the [[Aztec]] realm of central [[Mexico]].

The Aztecs knew of and used an extensive inventory consisting of hundreds of different [[medicinal herb]]s and plants.

A variety of indigenous [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] and [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Novohispanic]] written works survive from the conquest and later colonial periods that describe aspects of the Aztec system and practice of [[medicine]] and its remedies, incantations, practical administration, and cultural underpinnings. Elements of traditional medicinal practices and beliefs are still found among modern-day Nahua communities, often intermixed with European or other later influences.

== Medical beliefs==
As with many other [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures, the Aztec system recognized three main causes of illness and injury; supernatural causes (eg; displeasure of the gods, imbalance with the supernatural and natural worlds), magical causes, involving malevolent curses and [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] (''tlacatecolotl'' in Nahuatl), and natural or practical causes.

Medical practices and treatment consisted of a combination of medical botany and an understanding in the supernatural.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerra|first=Francisco|date=Aug 2012|title=AZTEC MEDICINE|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/medical-history/article/aztec-medicine/F4FF5AE8E8919AB2E7589248AFB74B1C|journal=Medical History|volume=10|issue=4|pages=315–338|doi=10.1017/S0025727300011455|issn=2048-8343|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing a treatment for any given ailment depended first upon determining the nature of its cause, which could be the result of the supernatural or the natural. The presence of a disease could often indicate the existence of a communion with the supernatural world. The Aztecs also understood there was a balance between hot and cold in medical practice, bearing resemblance to [[Humorism]].

The Aztecs believed that the body contained a balance of three separate entities or souls; the [[tonalli]], the [[Teyolía|teyolia]], and the ihiyotl, a balance that affected the health and life of a person.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gimmel|first=Millie|date=2008|title=Reading Medicine in the Codex de la Cruz Badiano|jstor=30134035|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=69|issue=2|pages=169–192|doi=10.2307/30134035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tonalli, which was commonly attributed with the disease of "soul loss", was located in the upper part of the head.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Montellano|first=Bernard Ortiz|date=1987|title=Caida de Mollera: Aztec Sources for a Mesoamerican Disease of Alleged Spanish Origin|jstor=482818|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=34|issue=4|pages=381–399|doi=10.2307/482818}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that this life force was connected to a higher power, and the Aztec people had to make sure their tonalli was not lost or did not stray from the head. The teyolia was located in the heart. This entity has been described to be specific to the individual and stood for a person’s intelligence and memory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ihiyotl, which resided in the liver, was strongly attached to witchcraft and the supernatural. It could also leave the body but was always connected through the wind or an individual's breath, “...thus, each individual could affect other people and things by breathing on them.” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Aztecs believed in a life after death, and a life heavily influenced by the gods. They believed in [[Tonatiuh]] (heaven) on the sun reserved for the strong and the heroes after death, and another heaven on earth. The mother of gods (Teteoinam or [[Toci]]) was worshiped and followed by those in the medical field.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As the goddess of medicine and herbs, her image was always kept in view of medical practitioners. The [[Aztec calendar|Tonalamatl (religious calendar)]] had an impactful role on their belief system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They believed that the Tonalamatl determined everything about the individual except their profession.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A person’s longevity, luck, sickness, and even their name was determined by the month and day they were born. The Tonalamatl was split into 13 months, each month representing a different god.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Codex Vaticanus]] depicts the relationship between human organs and calendar signs, illustrating the magical significance certain organs or body parts held.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53984557|title=Medicine across cultures : history and practice of medicine in non-Western cultures|date=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|others=Selin, Helaine, 1946-, Shapiro, Hugh.|isbn=9780306480942|location=Dordrecht|oclc=53984557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the calendar had so much authority over a person's life, the day on which someone was born or got sick had great importance and usually gave reference to which god the individual had to pay respect to. It was believed that when you were sick you were being punished by the gods for your sins in some cases. Specific sicknesses were linked to individual gods and their punishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Tlaloc]], the water god, was responsible for sickness related to wet and cold, such as rheumatic ailments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tlaloc also was responsible for tremor, delirium and other symptoms of alcoholism for those who abused consuming [[pulque]]. To relieve these symptoms, people would travel to mountains and rivers of significance to present the god with offerings.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The flayed god, [[Xipe Totec]] was responsible for skin eruptions and rashes. Common ailments included [[scabies]], boils, and eye diseases. The way to treat this disease was to march in front of others wearing the skins from human sacrifices during the second month.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After they did this, Xipe Totec would cure them of their ailments. When people broke vows such as fasting or celibacy, [[Tezcatlipoca]] would induce incurable disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Xochipilli|Macuilxochitl]] (Xochipilli), would send hemorrhoids, boils, and other similar diseases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were many other gods as well, each connected to their own set of sicknesses.

== Illness from the gods ==
The Aztec believed that different gods were associated with different diseases or ailments as the Aztec in their medicine the Aztec would treat aliments and not what we think of as diseases. The god of the waters, [[Tlaloc]], was connected with damp and cold as well as being responsible for the ailments that we know of today to be signs of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Xipe Totec]], the flayed one, punished people with more physical aliments such as boils or other skin ailments. Understanding the reason for the ailments was a primary way of knowing which god sent the punishment. The ailments themselves were often not enough as multiple gods such as the god of pleasure and the god of love used similar punishments would both send venereal diseases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Aztec are known for herbal medicine but there was a religious aspect as well. The religious side of treatment was varied based on which god issued the punishment and as well as what the ailments were. When seeking reprieve from the aliments imposed by the god of waters one would make offerings at rivers and mountains.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During the second month of the [[Aztec calendar]] there is a festival call tlacaxipehualiztl which was a festival honoring "the flayed one". This festival was an important event for those wishing to be cured from the aliments sent by the god. Those wishing to be cured would cover themselves in the skin of human sacrifices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Aztecs had several misconceptions on the contributing factors of illness and health. For example, fever was thought to be caused by internal heat and was cured by using a purgative, digestive or diuretic to remove the heat from the body. In spite of their misconceptions of contributing factors, the medicine they used was highly effective for Aztec standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because they often obtained the desired results, like their purgatives successfully evacuating the body. They even succeeded, though less often, at correctly treating the ailment.This shows a strong empirical basis for their knowledge of medicine. The adjacent table shows only the well agreed upon herbs in the list of hundreds that were used.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Badianus Manuscript: An Aztec Herbal, 1552.” ''Herbs: Friends of Physicians, Praise of Cooks'', exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/herbs/badianus/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montezuma I had beautiful, extensive gardens near the palace that astonished the conquistadors. The gardens showed the Aztec's integration with, and dependence on nature. Many skilled craftsman and gardeners were employed to maintain and improve the gardens. Houses, paths, trees, flowers, ponds and engineered water flow were all organized by skilled masonry. Within all of this natural engineering, many medicinal herbs were maintained for actual use. Nature was a part of Aztec life, and they saw herbs as beautiful as flowers. The Spaniards admitted that their own knowledge of herbs was very limited while the Aztecs seemed to know about every herb and its use.&lt;ref&gt;Castillo, Bernal Diaz del., et al.

'''British migration to Spain''' has resulted in [[Spain]] being home to one of the largest [[British people|British]]-born populations outside the [[United Kingdom]] in the world, and the largest in Europe. Migration from the UK to Spain has increased rapidly since the late 1990s and the registered population of British nationals in Spain in 2014 was 236,669 (2014).&lt;ref name="med_dream"/&gt;&lt;ref name=INE2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/jaxi/Datos.htm?path=/t20/e245/p04/a2014/l0/&amp;file=00000010.px&amp;type=pcaxis|title=Revision of the Municipal Register 2014.

Research has shown that most of the British population in Spain is poorly [[social integration|socially integrated]] into Spanish society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Most Brits in Spain say no gracias to integration|newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|date=29 March 2011|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/europe-news|accessdate=2011-12-10|location=London|first=Duncan|last=Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= British pupils have most problems in adapting to schools on the Costa del Sol|publisher= [[Diario Sur]]|date=|url= http://www.surinenglish.com/20080516/news/costasol-malaga/british-pupils-have-most-200805160941.html|accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= It’s the British children who have the most difficulty integrating in class|newspaper= [[Diario Sur]]|date=|url= http://www.surinenglish.com/20090423/news/costasol-malaga/british-children-have-most-200904231739.html|accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of 340 British migrants in the [[Province of Málaga]], for example, found that one third rarely or never met Spanish people, apart from in shops and restaurants, and that 60 per cent did not speak Spanish well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/The%20Edge%2019_tcm8-8226.pdf|title=British migrants feel the strain in Spain|work=The Edge|volume=19|publisher=[[Economic and Social Research Council]]|date=June 2005|page=4|accessdate=20 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220175245/http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/The%20Edge%2019_tcm8-8226.pdf|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of initiatives have been launched to improve integration of British migrants into Spanish life, including language course provision.

'''Caterina Jarboro''' (July 24, 1898 &amp;ndash; August 13, 1986) was an [[African-American]] [[opera]] singer. She was the first female black opera singer ever to sing on an opera stage in America, twenty-two years before [[Marian Anderson]]'s début at the [[Metropolitan Opera]].

==Biography==
According to the June 1900 census,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/cen_1900/?name=Katie+l_Yarabough&amp;birth=1898&amp;birth_x=0-0-0&amp;name_x=1_1|title=Ancestry.com|last=1900 census for Katie l Yarabough (misspelled)|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarboro was born in 1898 as '''Katherine (Katie) Lee Yarborough''' at 214 Church Street, [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;Her obituary says she was 90 years old. The [[Social Security Death Index]] has her birthday as July 24, 1908 which would make her 78 years old at death. The [[Biography &amp; Genealogy Master Index]] has her birth year as  1898, 1903 and 1908 in three different entries. Her age on [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:24LN-87K a ship manifest (Saturnina, sailing from Genoa, Italy to New York City) for October 11, 1939], lists her birth as "July 24th 1898" and her age as 41, which would have made her 88 when she died.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father John W. was [[African-American]] and her mother Annie E. was [[Native-American]]. She had at least four siblings. Her siblings alive at her time of death  were Joseph Jarboro of Philadelphia, and Anna Gayle of [[Palmetto, Florida]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Jarboro studied in North Carolina and then in New York. She sang in the theater musical ''[[Shuffle Along]]'' and in [[James P. Johnson]]'s ''Running Wild''. In 1930 she debuted in opera with [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' at the [[Puccini Theatre]] in [[Milan, Italy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1933, twenty-two years before [[Marian Anderson]]'s début at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], impresario [[Alfredo Salmaggi]] hired Jarboro to sing with his opera company at the [[New York Hippodrome]]. She was presented in the title role of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]''. Later she appeared with the company as Sélika in [[Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[L'Africaine]]''. She was the first female black opera singer ever to sing on an opera stage in America (baritone Jules Bledsoe had sung Amonasro at Chicago Opera in 1930). This milestone earned Salmaggi special recognition from First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. Many other opera appearances throughout Europe followed. She returned to the United States in 1941. Among her performances were a recitals at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|the Town Hall]] in 1942 and [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1944. She retired in 1955.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Jarboro died in August 13, 1986 in Manhattan. She is believed to have been 88 years old.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Caterina Jarboro obituary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/16/obituaries/caterina-jarboro.html|quote=Caterina Jarboro, a soprano who made her United States debut in Verdi's ''Aida'' in 1933, a black woman taking the lead role in an all-white company, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan after a brief illness.

Poverty is a major factor that drives  child labour in Nigeria. In poor families, child labour is a major source of income for the family.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The US Department of Labour in its 2010 report claims Nigeria is witnessing the worst forms of child labor, particularly in agriculture and domestic service. In rural areas, most children work in agriculture of products such as cassava, cocoa and tobacco.{{Cn|date=January 2017}} These children typically work long hours and for little pay, with their families. The report claims some children are exposed to pesticides and chemical fertilizers in cocoa and tobacco fields because of archaic farming practices or because they are deployed as forced labour without protective gear. Additionally, street children work as porters and scavengers, and a growing number of them engage in begging. The report claims commercial sexual exploitation of children, especially girls, is also occurring in some Nigerian cities, including Port Harcourt and Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Report - Nigeria|year=2011|publisher=United States Department of Labor|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4e8c398827.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trafficking==
There is [[trafficking of children]] in [[Nigeria]]. Child labour is more common among children of [[illiterates]].&lt;ref name="aercafrica.org"/&gt; On average, in the Southwestern zone of Nigeria, there is a higher work burden for working children.&lt;ref name="aercafrica.org"/&gt; Boys tend to earn more.&lt;ref name="aercafrica.org"/&gt; Girls' non-participation in schooling is more likely affected by parents' lack of interest than boys'.&lt;ref name="aercafrica.org"/&gt; Non-participation in school is related to [[poverty]]. About one third of working children obtain no benefit from their employer.&lt;ref name="aercafrica.org"/&gt; Child labour among pupils frequently impairs schooling.&lt;ref name="aercafrica.org"/&gt;

The '''Chitty''' are a distinctive group of [[Tamil people]] found mainly in [[Melaka]] and [[Singapore]], who are also known as the [[India]]n [[Peranakan]]s and have adopted Chinese and Malay cultural practices whilst also retaining their Hindu heritage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/meet-chetti-melaka-peranakan-indians-striving-save-culture-hindu-10849258&lt;/ref&gt; As of today{{when|date=April 2012}}, their population stands at 2,000. The Chitty/Chetti community is largely from the Coramandel Coast of South India and are devout Hindus.

==Language==

Like the [[Peranakan]]s, the Chitty speak a [[Malay language|Malay]] patois, which is mixed with many Tamil loan words. Many of the Chitty are unable to communicate in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] fluently.

==History==
[[File:Chitty Museum.JPG|thumb|[[Chitty Museum]] in Melaka.]]

Historical records stated that the Tamil traders from Panai in [[Tamil Nadu]] settled down in [[Melaka]] during the sovereignty of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]]. Like the [[Peranakan]]s, they later settled down and freely intermingled with the local Malays and Chinese settlers. However, with the fall of the [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca Sultanate]] after 1511, the Chitty eventually lost touch with their native land.

Under the administration of the Portuguese, Dutch and British colonizers, the Chitty eventually began simplifying their culture and customs by adopting local customs. This can be evidenced in the architecture of the [[Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple]], which was built by [[Thaivanayagam Pillay]], the leader of the Chitty people, in 1781 after the Dutch colonial government gave him a plot of land.

The traditional Chitty settlement is located at Kampung Tujuh along  Jalan Gajah Berang, which is also inhabited by a small number of Chinese and Malays as well. Many of the Chitty have since found jobs in [[Singapore]] and other parts of [[Malaysia]].

The ethnic identity of the Chitty is nearly lost. As many of them are assimilating into the mainstream [[India]]n, [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] ethnic communities culturally, this small but distinct group of people that has survived for centuries is now on the brink of extinction.

Exhibition of Peranakan Chitty history, antiques and culture can be seen at the [[Chitty Museum]] in Chitty Village, [[Melaka]], [[Malaysia]]. Recently in 2013, there were controversies of development at the expense of demolishing part of Kampung Chitty, a historical and cultural village.&lt;ref name="Peranakan Chitty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/now-development-threatens-historical-site-in-malacca |title=Now, development threatens historical site in Malacca |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |accessdate=14 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221113723/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/now-development-threatens-historical-site-in-malacca |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal to construct a condominium, a hotel and a road cutting through the village are seen as a threat affecting the residents and a temple built in 1827.&lt;ref name="Kampung Chitty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.news.yahoo.com/39-road-kg-chitty-could-destroy-homes-39-043200736.html |title=Road through Kg Chitty could destroy homes |publisher=Yahoo! News |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The Chitty are a mixed people. Although they ethnically consider themselves to be Tamil, of Southern Indian origin and mostly of dark complexion, the Chitty appear to have varying degrees of [[Southeast Asia]]n and Indian appearance.

This resulted from the fact that the first Tamil settlers took in local wives, since they did not bring along any of their own women with them. Over time, the Chitty gathered physical features that were less Indian and more Malay-looking.

Some Nairs from Kerala region of South-western India are classified as a sub category of Chitty's even though they are fairer skinned with features that are distinctive to the Tamils and Telugus.

==Religion==
[[Image:Sri Poyatha.jpg|thumb|[[Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple]] in [[Melaka]].]]
The Chitty are a tightly knit community of Saivite [[Hindus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shiv Shanker Tiwary &amp; P.S. Choudhary|title=Encyclopaedia Of Southeast Asia And Its Tribes (Set Of 3 Vols.)|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YdEjAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Encyclopaedia+Of+Southeast+Asia+And+Its+Tribes+(Set+Of+3+Vols.)&amp;dq=Encyclopaedia+Of+Southeast+Asia+And+Its+Tribes+(Set+Of+3+Vols.)|year=2009|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=81-261-3837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; worshipping in their three temples. Gods such as [[Ganesha]] and [[Shiva]] are worshipped in full gaiety. Hints of [[Taoist]] and [[Islamic]] influences are also evident in their religious rituals. As staunch believers of the Hindu faith, the 
Melakan Chitty community still upholds their religious ceremonies. They observe [[Deepavali]], [[Ponggal]], the Hindu New Year, [[Navratri]] and other traditional Hindu festivals that are celebrated by Hindu groups in Malaysia. However, the Chitty do not participate in [[Thaipusam]] in at a grand level like most Hindu groups. During the month of May they have a similar festival to Thaipusam in their local temple called Mengamay. One celebration that is unique to the Chitty community is the Parchu festival. It is celebrated twice a year with Parchu Ponggal (Bhogi) observed the day before Ponggal in January and Parchu Buah-buahan during the fruit season between June and July.

==Culture==
[[File:Chitti Village.JPG|thumb|Chitty Village in Melaka.]]

Culturally, the Chitty have largely assimilated into the Malay culture with some Chinese, Dutch and Portuguese influences, although certain elements of Indian culture do remain. This is especially true in the case of marriages, where offerings of fruits and burning of incense are used. In the case of food, Malay spices, ingredients and the way of cooking have largely supplanted the Indian style.

Chinese cultural influence is also evident, especially in the case of ancestral worship. Religious objects used for conducting rituals were also used by the Chinese. The Chitty are also influenced by the Chinese to some extent in their ceramics works of art.

Simplification of Tamil architecture among the Chitty is also present. Distinct from the Tamil, who have a complex Dravidian Temple Architecture in the [[Pallava]] style, that displays beautifully carved out sculptures of the Hindu gods in many rows, the Chitty temple tend to only have one row of these, or a picture of one single god in each of the three rows, as evidenced in the [[Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple]], built by Thaivanayagam Chitty in 1781.

==Dress and lifestyle==
Most of the Chitty have adopted the Malay costume. In the case of men, a comfortable [[sarong]] and Malay shirt may be worn, although a [[songkok]] may also be worn. Women, on the other hand, wear a similar costume that are similar to the [[Peranakan]] Nonya.

Alongside their [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and Malay neighbours, the Chitty live in [[kampung|Kampong]] houses. Pictures of [[Hindu]] gods and [[Indian name]]s can be seen just outside their houses, as their descendants tend to adopt [[Languages of India|Indian]], rather than Malay surnames.

A typical  Chitty home is distinctly marked by mango leaves arranged in a row, dangling from above the front door. Chitty temples are also adorned this way.

This is the old tradition still followed in Tamil Nadu from ancient period during functions.

'''Crime in Transnistria''' covers criminality-related incidents in the breakaway Republic of [[Transnistria]], still nominally part of [[Moldova]]. The [[Law enforcement in Transnistria|police organisations of Transnistria]] are tasked with fighting crime in the republic.

==EUBAM border controls and smuggling issues==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PMR-MVDBadge.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Ministry of Interior badge insignia.]] --&gt;
Transnistria has a reputation of being a haven for smuggling. In 2002, the [[European Parliament]]'s delegation to Moldova named Transnistria "a black hole in which illegal trade in arms, the trafficking in human beings and the laundering of criminal finance was carried on".&lt;ref name="rfi"&gt;European Parliament, [http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/afet/20021007/473437EN.pdf "Chairman's Report—Ad Hoc Delegation to Moldova"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 5–6 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[The Wall Street Journal]] called Transnistria "a major haven for smuggling weapons and women".&lt;ref&gt;[[The Wall Street Journal]], "Moldova's Ruling Communists Are Leading a Swing to the West, Marc Champion in London and Alan Cullison in Moscow. 4 March 2005. pg. A.13&lt;/ref&gt; However, in more recent statements, OSCE and European Union diplomats cited by [[Radio Free Europe]] called the smuggling claims "likely exaggerated".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Article/1062030.html Moldova: Western Diplomats Say Reports Of Smuggling From Transdniester Likely Exaggerated] - [[Radio Free Europe]] / [[Radio Liberty]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 30 November 2005 the European Union has had a Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) on Transnistria's borders with the United Nations Development Programme as implementing partner. In its official statements, the EU mission repeatedly confirmed an absence of any signs of weapons smuggling from Transnistria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiraspoltimes.com/node/291 EU confirms absence of weapons smuggling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014538/http://www.tiraspoltimes.com/node/291 |date=30 September 2007 }} Tiraspol Times. 22 Oct., 2006. Retrieved 2007, 2-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of weapons trade ==
Foreign experts working on behalf of the United Nations confirm that the current situation in the region "has prevented effective small arms control and undermined reform of the security sector".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.md/main/seesac_eng.shtml UNDP: 2006 Small arms and light weapons survey of Moldova] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706015118/http://www.undp.md/main/seesac_eng.shtml |date=6 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a ''[[Washington Times]]'' article claimed that a cache of [[surface-to-air missile]] launchers, and other weapons, may have disappeared from a former Soviet stockpile, and that officials were at the time unable to account for their whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington Times]]'', [http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20040118-103519-5374r.htm George Jahn: "Hotbed of Weapons Deals"], 19 January 2004 Retrieved 2006, 12-24&lt;/ref&gt; The OSCE and European Union officials state that there is no evidence that Transnistria has ever, at any time in the past, trafficked arms or nuclear material.&lt;ref name="rfi" /&gt;

Foreign experts working on behalf of the United Nations say that the historically low levels of transparency and continued denial of full investigation to international monitors has reinforced negative perceptions of the Transnistrian regime, although recent good levels of cooperation on the part of Transnistrian authorities in some areas may reflect a shift in the attitude of PMR.&lt;ref name=seesac&gt;[http://www.seesac.org/reports/ENGLISH.pdf UNDP: 2006 Small arms and light weapons survey of Moldova] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810121103/http://www.seesac.org/reports/ENGLISH.pdf |date=10 August 2007 }}, SEESAC 1 July 2007, {{ISBN|86-7728-014-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also it says that the evidence for the illicit production and trafficking of weapons into and from Transnistria has in the past been exaggerated, that although the trafficking of light weapons is likely to have occurred before 2001. The last year when export data showed US$900,000 worth of ‘weapons, munitions, their parts and accessories’ exported from Transnistria.

In 2006 special monitoring mission of Russia and Ukraine headed by deputy secretary of the Security Council of Russia Yuri Zubakov and deputy secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Serhiy Pirozhkov visited Transnistria and inspected enterprises, suspected in arms production. Based on the results of the inspection Zubakov and Pirozhkov stated that there have been no signs that any of the enterprises ever produced armaments or their components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/648475 Moscow and Kiev improved Transnistria's Image] Kommersant. 10 Feb., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Ukrainian Foreign Minister and Acting Chairman of the OSCE [[Leonid Kozhara]] gave an interview to ''[[El País]]'' newspaper, commenting on situation in Transnistria and results of work of the EUBAM mission. According to Kozhara, there have been no cases of arms traffic found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2013/06/04/actualidad/1370334170_344660.html Queremos zonas de libre comercio tanto al Este como hacia el Oeste] El Pais. 4 Jun., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antisemitic incidents==
Over the past few years, there have been several minor antisemitic incidents in Transnistria.
*14–15 April 2001 the Synagogue of Tiraspol suffered a pipe bomb attack. The building was damaged, but the guard was not hurt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Anti-Semitism+and+the+Holocaust/Antisemitism+Monitoring+Forum/Anti-Semitic+Incidents+-+April+2001.htm Anti-Semitic Incidents - April 2001] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 1 Apr., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*13–30 March 2004 over 70 tombstones in the Jewish cemetery of Tiraspol were vandalized. Local community leaders said the authorities refused to help clean up the anti-Semitic graffiti painted over the tombstones&lt;ref name="JJ"&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=12248 Briefs: Synagogue in FSU Hit with Arson] Jewish Journal. 14 May 2004. Retrieved 2006, 12-24&lt;/ref&gt;
* in May 2004, there was an attempt by a Russian [[neo-nazi]] organization to set on fire a [[synagogue]] in Tiraspol, using a [[Molotov Cocktail]] and a flammable liquid near a gas pipe.&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt; The attack failed when passers-by extinguished the fire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm Report on Global Anti-Semitism] U.S. Department of State. 5 Jan., 2005.

==Deadly explosions==
* in July 2006, a bomb killed eight in a Tiraspol [[minibus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5153322.stm Trans-Dniester blast kills eight] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain countries, including the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://Chişinău.usembassy.gov/wm_081406.html U.S. State Department travel warning for Moldova] {{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/moldova/safety-and-security&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/Moldova Australian Government - Travel advisories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230162646/http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/Moldova |date=30 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2014}} and Spain{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} cautions its citizens from traveling to both Moldova and Transnistria.

==Espionage==
In April 2010 the journalist [[Ernest Vardanean]] was arrested on accusations of espionage in favour of Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jurnal.md/en/news/journalist-arrested-in-tiraspol-for-being-moldovan-spy-184293/ report about Vardanean case in Jurnal de Chişinău] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511042122/http://www.jurnal.md/en/news/journalist-arrested-in-tiraspol-for-being-moldovan-spy-184293/ |date=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 Igor Smirnov signed a decree saying that Ernest can be released from the jail&lt;ref&gt;[http://unimedia.md/?mod=news&amp;id=33444 Vardanyan has been released from the jail]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deep Creek Hot Springs''', '''DCHS''', are natural [[hot spring]]s located in the northern [[Mojave Desert]] section of the [[San Bernardino National Forest]], near [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], Southern [[California]].&lt;ref name="usnfs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTJw8jAwjQL8h2VAQAzHJMsQ!!/?ss=110512&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;cid=FSE_003714&amp;navid=110160000000000&amp;pnavid=110000000000000&amp;position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;recid=34152&amp;actid=50&amp;ttype=recarea&amp;pname=San%20Bernardino%20National%20Forest%20-%20Deep%20Creek%20Hot%20Springs |title=San Bernardino National Forest, Deep Creek Hot Springs |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s are in the [[rain shadow]]ed desert foothills of the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] on the Deep Creek fork of the [[Mojave River]]. They are in a large bouldered [[riparian zone]], surrounded by a rich [[habitat]] [[ecotone]] of the [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrublands]]—[[desert chaparral]],  [[California montane chaparral and woodlands|montane chaparral and woodlands]], and [[Temperate coniferous forest|conifer forest]] [[Plant community|plant communities]].&lt;ref name="usnfs"/&gt;

The [[Arroyo toad|Southwestern Arroyo Toad—''Bufo californicus'']], an [[endangered species]], lives along Deep Creek.&lt;ref name="usnfs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/fieldguide/herps/bufo-cal.html|title=SDNHM - Arroyo Toad|publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum|accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2985">The '''Degoodi''' or '''Degodia''' ({{lang-so|Degoodi or Degoodiya}}, {{lang-ar|دغودي}}) is a [[Somali clan]]. Members of the clan primarily inhabit [[Kenya]], but also large part of southern [[Ethiopia]] and places in southern [[Somalia]]. Like many Somalis, Degoodi members trace their paternal ancestry to [[Samaale]], through their [[Gardhere]] ancestor. They are genealogically related to the other [[Samaale]], but in particular to the Gaalje'el, Masare, Isa (Saransor) and 'Owrmale, with which they share the same ancestor [[Gardhere]] [[Samaale]].&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0m9yAAAAMAAJ|title=Mending rips in the sky: options for Somali communities in the 21st century |last=Adam|first=Hussein Mohamed|last2=Ford|first2=Richard|date=1997-01-01 |publisher= Red Sea Press |isbn=9781569020739|page=127|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpdAzRYruCwC|title=The Invention of Somalia|last=Ahmed|first=Ali Jimale|date=1995-01-01 |publisher=The Red Sea Press |isbn=9780932415998|page=121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
When [[Arthur Donaldson Smith]] traveled through what is now [[Bare (woreda)|Bare woreda]] in 1895, he found that the Degodia were neighbors of the Afgab clan (whom they were at endless war with), their territory stretching east to the [[Weyib River|Weyib]] and [[Dawa River]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson-Smith, ''Through Unknown African Countries: the first expedition from Somaliland to Lake Rudolph'' (London, 1897), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The Degodia are said to have originated around the rivers [[Dawa River|Dawa]], Parma and Ganale Daria in southeastern [[Ethiopia]] and from Eel Ali in [[Somalia]], where clansmen are still present today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=nl&amp;id=T14wAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=degodia|title=Kenya's ethnic communities: foundation of the nation|last=Ng'ang'a|first=Wangũhũ|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Gatũndũ Publishers |year= |isbn=9789966975706 |location= |pages=522 |language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Demographics of Kyrgyzstan''' is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]], including population growth, [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population. The name [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], both for the people and the country, means [[List of country name etymologies|"forty girls" or "forty tribes"]], a reference to the epic hero [[Epic of Manas|Manas]] who unified forty tribes against the [[Oirats]], as symbolized by the 40-ray sun on the [[flag of Kyrgyzstan]].

==Demographic trends==

[[File:Население Киргизии за 2015.png|thumb|right|500px|Population density of Kyrgyzstan, 2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.kg/media/publicationarchive/30c1af54-2244-4fe1-a470-4d1a88bcea8b.pdf|title=Ethnic composition of the population in Kyrgyzstan 2015 |publisher=National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic | accessdate=1 January 2015|language=ru|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Kyrgyzstan's population increased from 2.1 million to 4.8 million between the censuses of 1959 and 1999.&lt;ref name=census/&gt; Official estimates set the population at 5.2 million in 2007.&lt;ref name=ethnic/&gt; Of those, 34.4% are under the age of 15 and 6.2% are over the age of 65. The country is [[rural]]: only about one-third of Kyrgyzstan's population live in urban areas. The average [[population density]] is 69 people per square mile (29 people per km²).

The nation's largest [[ethnic group]] are the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people, which comprise 70.9% of the population (2009 census). Other ethnic groups include [[Russians]] (9.0%) concentrated in the north and [[Uzbeks]] (14.5%) living in the south. Small but noticeable minorities include [[Dungans]] (1.9%), [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] (1.1%), [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] (1.1%), [[Kazakhs]] (0.7%) and [[Ukrainians]] (0.5%), and other smaller ethnic minorities (1.7%). Of the formerly sizable [[Volga German]] community, exiled here by [[Joseph Stalin]] from their earlier homes in the [[Volga German Republic]], most have returned to [[Germany]], and only a few small groups remain. A small percentage of the population are also [[Koryo-saram|Koreans]], who are the descendants of the Koreans [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union|deported]] in 1937 from the [[Russian Far East|Soviet Far East]] to Central Asia.

Kyrgyzstan has undergone a pronounced change in its ethnic composition since independence.&lt;ref name="spo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoorenberg |first1=Thomas |year=2013 |title=Fertility changes in Central Asia since 1980|journal=Asian Population Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=50–77 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441730.2012.752238#.VW9dTc_BzRY |doi=10.1080/17441730.2012.752238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spoo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoorenberg |first1=Thomas |year=2015 |title=Explaining recent fertility increase in Central Asia |journal=Asian Population Studies |publisher=Routledge |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441730.2015.1027275 |doi=10.1080/17441730.2015.1027275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of ethnic Kyrgyz increased from around 50% in 1979 to nearly 70% in 2007, while the percentage of European ethnic groups (Russians, Ukrainians and Germans) dropped from 35% to about 10%.&lt;ref name=ethnic/&gt;&lt;ref name=census/&gt;

The Kyrgyz have historically been semi-[[nomad]]ic herders, living in round tents called [[yurt]]s and tending [[sheep]], [[horse]]s and [[yak]]s. This nomadic tradition continues to function seasonally (see [[transhumance]]) as herding families return to the high mountain pasture (or ''jailoo'') in the summer. The retention of this nomadic heritage and the freedoms that it implies continue to affect the political atmosphere in the country.

2.65 children born/woman (2009 est.)

The differences in the number of children by nationality are significant:&lt;ref name="spo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spoo" /&gt; [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]]s (3.0 children), [[Tajik people|Tajik]]s (3.0 children), [[Turkish people|Turks]] (2.9), [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] (2.9), [[Dungans]] (2.8) [[Russians]] (1.7), [[Koreans]] (1.7), [[Germans]] (1.8), [[Ukrainians]] (2.1), [[Tatars]] (2.1), [[Kazakhs]] (2.3) and [[Uyghur people|Ugyhur]]s (2.5).&lt;ref name=census/&gt; The TFR for Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, and Koreans in Kyrgyzstan are considerably higher than in their home countries, possibly due to the much lower cost of living.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Ethnic groups==

According to the 1999 census,&lt;ref name=census&gt;&lt;!--[http://www.stat.kg/Eng/Home/census.pdf--&gt;[http://www.stat.kg/stat.files/census.pdf Population census for Kyrgyzstan, 1999] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ethnic composition of the population was as follows: [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] 72.6%, [[Uzbeks]] 14.4%, [[Russians]] 6.4%, [[Dungan people|Dungans]] 1.1%, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] 0,9%, other 3.6%, including [[Koreans]] 0.4% and [[Germans]] 0.4% (among them [[Mennonite Low German|Low German]]-speaking [[Mennonites]]). Most Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Germans, and Koreans lived in northeast, especially around the city of [[Karakol]]. Most of the [[Dungan people|Dungans]] and [[Uyghur people|Ugyhurs]] are found along the Chinese border. Most of the [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] and [[Uzbeks]] live in the south. The emigration of non-Turkic people to [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Germany]] is now negligible, in part because most of them left prior to 1999.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} For example, the number of Germans has fallen by over 90% between the 1989 and 2009 censuses.

The table shows the ethnic composition of Kyrgyzstan's population according to all population censuses between 1926 and 2009. There has been a sharp decline in the European ethnic groups (Russians, Ukrainians, Germans) and also Tatars since independence (as captured in the 1989, 1999 and 2009 censuses).

'''Diseases of Abnormal Polymerization''', termed DAPs for short, are a class of disorders characterized by a novel alteration in base unit [[protein]]s that results in a structure with pathogenic potential.  This functional alteration in a protein in relation to its thermodynamic and kinetic properties enacts an extended chain response among neighboring proteins until an extensive and potentially harmful [[polymer|polymerized]] structure is formed.  Due to this endogenous foreign formation, these diseases are often untreatable and very severe in clinical manifestation. Although DAPs are rare infections, the poor outcome in patients and the need for further understanding makes this class of diseases a pillar for future research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8016/|title=Medical Microbiology|last=Gibbs|first=Clarence J.|last2=Asher|first2=David M.|date=1996-01-01|publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston|isbn=0963117211|editor-last=Baron|editor-first=Samuel|edition=4th|location=Galveston (TX)|pmid=21413288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Telling|first=Glenn C.|date=2017-03-17|title=The Importance of Prions|journal=PLoS Pathogens|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003090|issn=1553-7366|pmc=3561141|pmid=23382670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replication by recruitment ==

Diseases of abnormal polymerization are said the undergo “replication”, or rather that the number of proteins that are polymerized is shown to generally increase much like in a natural course of infection.  Since the functional “pathogens” of DAPs are protein units the diseases are almost entirely independent from the use of nucleic acids.  Multiple models illustrating this recruitment function exist, including the PrP protein in prion disease.  The PrP protein is the major agent in spongiform encephalopathies and undergoes a clear process of polymerization based upon the natural balancing of thermodynamic states and kinetic summation.  Like most proteins PrP can exist in two forms, one major and one minor, an alpha helix structure and a beta-pleated sheet structure respectively, that are balanced during nearly all conditions, but with dominance granted to the stable helix form.  In certain instances, it may be possible for two beta forms to contact each other at the same time, and in this case the pair can form bonds that successfully stabilize the beta forms thermodynamically and allowing these structures to remain.  This is termed the “seed” of polymerization as from this point the continued interaction, or recruitment, amongst the beta forms is increased perpetually, since there is a constant presence of stable beta forms, as well as the fact that beta forms, or beta-pleated sheets, have a greater number of reactive nucleation sites. This progression forms extended fibrils slowly over time that will then cause localized cytopathology, resulting in the characteristic sites of cell degradation or “sponginess”.  This general template of recruitment is also characteristic in the condition sickle cell anemia in which the red blood cells are misshapen because of the formation of extended polymer fibrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/scd_background.html|title=How Does Sickle Cell Cause Disease?|last=MD|first=Kenneth R.

== Scenarios for pathogenesis ==

=== Spontaneous development ===
ADPs can be generated in a spontaneous nature by the existence of multiple thermodynamic states and the kinetic equilibrium between the [[alpha helix]] and [[beta-pleated sheet]]s polymerizing into extended [[Amyloid|fibrils]].

=== Genetic predisposition ===
In certain ADPs, such as Gerstmann-Straussler or fatal familial insomnia, individuals naturally encode a form of the PrP protein that shifts the equilibrium slightly to make the beta form more favorable, thus increasing the likelihood of additional nucleation and extended polymerization.

=== Infectious etiology ===
Many ADPs, including [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] and [[Kuru (disease)|Kuru]], have an infectious nature and can be transmitted to other hosts through various means. In the case of Kuru, familial and cultural rituals in indigenous peoples of [[Papua New Guinea]] promoted the consumption of a relative’s body upon death, and if contaminated, resulting in the transmission of the original “seed” of polymerization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weissmann|first=C.|last2=Enari|first2=M.|last3=Klöhn|first3=P‐C.|last4=Rossi|first4=D.|last5=Flechsig|first5=E.|date=2002-12-01|title=Transmission of Prions|url=https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/186/Supplement_2/S157/2191193/Transmission-of-Prions|journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=186|issue=s2|pages=S157–S165|doi=10.1086/344575|issn=0022-1899|pmc=139897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6036">In the [[feudal system]] of the European Middle Ages, an '''ecclesiastical fief''', held from the [[Catholic Church]], followed all the laws laid down for temporal fiefs. The [[suzerain]], e.g. bishop, abbot, or other possessor, granted an estate in perpetuity to a person, who thereby became his [[vassal]]. 

As such, the grantee at his [[enfeoffment]] did homage to his overlord, took an [[oath of fealty]], and made offering of the prescribed money or other object, by reason of which he held his fief. These requirements had to be repeated as often as there was a change in the person of the suzerain or vassal. These fiefs were granted by churchmen to princes, barons, knights, and others, who thereupon assumed the obligation of protecting the church and domains of the overlord. 

==Features of the system==

This system of feudal tenure was not always restricted to lands, as church revenues and tithes were often farmed out to secular persons as a species of ecclesiastical fief. Strictly speaking, however, a fief was usually defined as [[immovable property]] whose [[usufruct]] perpetually conceded to another under the obligation of fealty and [[personal homage]]. A fief was not ecclesiastical simply because its overlord was a churchman; it was requisite also that the domain granted should be church property. Lands, which belonged to the patrimony of an ecclesiastic, became a secular fief if he bestowed them on a vassal.

All fiefs were personal and hereditary, and many of the latter could be inherited by female descent. 

==Passive fiefs==

Fiefs bestowed by the Church on vassals were called ''active fiefs''; when churchmen themselves undertook obligations to a suzerain, the fiefs were called ''passive''. In the latter case, temporal princes gave certain lands to the Church by enfeoffing a bishop or abbot, and the latter had then to do homage as [[pro-vassal]] and undertake all the implied obligations. When these included military service, the ecclesiastic was empowered to fulfil this duty by a substitute. 

It was as passive fiefs that many bishoprics, abbacies, and prelacies, as to their temporalities, were held of kings in the medieval period, and the power thereby acquired by secular princes over elections to ecclesiastical dignities led to the strife over [[investiture]]s. These passive fiefs were conferred by the suzerain investing the newly elected churchman with [[crozier]] and ring at the time of his making homage, but the employment of these symbols of spiritual power gradually paved the way to claims on the part of the secular overlords (see [[Investiture Conflict]]). 

==Papal fiefs==

Papal fiefs included not only individual landed estates, however vast, but also duchies, principalities, and even kingdoms. When the pope enfeoffed a prince, the latter did homage to him as to his liege lord, and acknowledged his vassalage by an annual tribute. [[Pope Pius V]] (29 March 1567) decreed that, in future, fiefs belonging strictly to the [[Patrimony of St. Peter]] should be incorporated with the [[Pontifical States]] whenever the vassalage lapsed, and that no new enfeoffment take place.

King [[John of England]] declared that he held his realm as a fief from the pope in 1213, and King [[James II of Aragon]] accepted the same relation for [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]] in 1295. 

The most famous papal fief, the [[Kingdom of Naples and Sicily]], sprang from investitures of 1059 and 1269. Compare [[Terra Mariana]], the lands in Livonia considered directly subject to the Holy See from 1215.&lt;ref&gt;

It was also referred to as Maria's land after 1202 when the Pope took it under his auspices (''Terra Mariana'', ''Terra Matris'', ''Terra beate Virginis''), initially referring to the triangle of the lower sections of the Daugava and the Gauja, which roughly corresponds to today's Vidzeme. [...] Considering the land as his own ''allodium'' (fief) in 1207 Bishop Albert offered the land to the German King [[Philip of Swabia | Philip]] who immediately returned it to the bishop as a ''feudum oblatum'' (fiefdom). [...] Establishing a Church state was always the underlying agenda of the crusades (Taube 1938, 21).

__NOTOC__
The '''Fang people''', also known as '''Fãn''' or '''Pahouin''', are a [[Central Africa]]n ethnic group found in [[Equatorial Guinea]], northern [[Gabon]], and southern [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=britfangp&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fang-people Fang people], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates415"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|pages=415–419, 460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representing about 85% of the total population of Equatorial Guinea, concentrated in the Rio Muni region, the Fang people are its largest ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Stokes225"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jamie Stokes|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC |year=2009|publisher=Infobase|isbn=978-1-4381-2676-0|pages=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, in the regions they live, they are one of the most significant and influential ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ek.html Equatorial Guinea] People and Society; [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cm.html Cameroon] People and Society; [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gb.html Gabon] People and Society; CIA Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Fang people speak the [[Fang language]], also known as Pahouin or Pamue or Pangwe. The language is a Southern Bantu language belonging to the Niger-Congo family of languages.&lt;ref name=ethnofang/&gt; The Fang language is similar and intelligible with languages spoken by [[Beti-Pahuin peoples]], namely the [[Beti people]] to their north and the [[Bulu people]] in central. Their largest presence is in the southern regions, up to the [[Ogooué River]] estuary where anthropologists refer them also as "Fang proper".&lt;ref name=britfangp/&gt;

They have preserved their history largely through a musical [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Alexandre | first=Pierre | title=Introduction to a Fang oral art genre: Gabon and Cameroon mvet | journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=37 | issue=01 | year=1974 | page=1 | doi=10.1017/s0041977x00094799 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Fang people are fluent in Spanish, French, German and English, a tradition of second language they developed during the Spanish colonial rule in Equatorial Guinea, the French colonial rule in Gabon and the German-later-British colonial rule in Cameroon.&lt;ref name="Stokes225"/&gt;

==History==
The Fang people are relatively recent migrants into the Equatorial Guinea, and many of them moved from central Cameroon in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Stokes225"/&gt;

Early ethnologists conjectured them to be [[Nilotic peoples]] from the upper Nile area, but a combination of evidence now places them to be of Bantu origins who began moving back into Africa around the seventh or eighth century possibly because of invasions from the north and the wars of West Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Gates415"/&gt; Their migration may be related to an attempt to escape the violence of slave raiding by the [[Hausa people]],&lt;ref name="Gates415"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gebauer | first=Paul | title=Art of Cameroon | journal=African Arts | publisher=UCLA Press | volume=4 | issue=2 | year=1971 | pages=24–35 | doi=10.2307/3334518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this theory has been contested.&lt;ref name="Gates415"/&gt;

The Fang people were victims of the large transatlantic and trans-Saharan slave trade between the 16th and 19th century. They were stereotyped as cannibals by slave traders and missionaries, in part because human skulls and bones were found in open or in wooden boxes near their villages, a claim used to justify violence against them and their enslavement.&lt;ref name="Gates415"/&gt; When their villages were raided, thousands of their wooden idols and villages were burnt by the slave raiders.&lt;ref name="Stokes225"/&gt; Later ethnologists who actually spent time with the Fang people later discovered that the Fang people were not cannibalistic, the human bones in open and wooden boxes were of their ancestors, and were Fang people's method of routine remembrance and religious reverence for their dead loved ones.&lt;ref name="Gates415"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stokes225"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p60"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Shoup|title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPBfnT_E1mgC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-362-0|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
[[File:Tocado fang MNA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A head dress of the Fang people with embedded artwork.]]
They have a patrilineal kinship social structure. The villages have been traditionally linked through lineage. They are exogamous, particularly on the father's side.&lt;ref name=britfangp/&gt; Polygamy was accepted in the culture of the Fang people.&lt;ref name="Gates415"/&gt; The independence of villages from each other is notable, and they are famed for their knowledge of animals, plants and herbs in the Equatorial forests they live in.&lt;ref name="Gates415"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Guyer | first=Jane I. | last2=Belinga | first2=Samuel M.

Under French colonial rule, they converted to Christianity. However, after independence their interest in their own traditional religion, called ''Biere'', also spelled ''Byeri'', has returned, and many practice syncretic ideas and rites.&lt;ref name=britfangp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stokes225"/&gt; One of the syncretic traditions among Fang people is called ''Bwiti'', a monotheistic religion that celebrates Christian Easter but over four days with group dancing, singing and psychedelic drinks.&lt;ref&gt;J. Vansina (1984), Review: Fang Religious Experience, The Journal of African History, Cambridge University Press, Vol. 25, No. 2 (1984), pages 228-230&lt;/ref&gt;

The art works of Fang people, particularly from wood, iron and [[steatite]], are regionally famous.&lt;ref name=britfangp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stokes225"/&gt; Their wooden masks and idol carvings are on display at numerous museums of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chinua Achebe (1977), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25088813 An Image of Africa], The Massachusetts Review, Vol. 18, No. 4 (Winter, 1977), pages 782-794&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Guyer | first=Jane I. | title=Wealth in People and Self-Realization in Equatorial Africa | journal=Man | publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland | volume=28 | issue=2 | year=1993 | page=243 | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2803412 | doi=10.2307/2803412 | accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy and employment==
Bahrain is the eighth largest destination for Filipino [[domestic worker]]s hired or rehired from 2006–2011, and has  21,254 documented overseas Filipino domestic workers as of July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/48074/dole-plans-to-end-deployment-of-maids-overseas-in-5-years|title=DOLE plans to end deployment of maids overseas in 5 years|date=25 August 2012|publisher=Global Nation Inquirer|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Filipinos in Bahrain commonly work as accountants, construction contractors, engineers, sales associates, as well as business and government support staff.&lt;ref name="FS1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/03/17/11/bahrain-loves-filipino-workers|title='Bahrain loves Filipino workers'|last=Cariño|first=Jorge|date=17 March 2011|publisher=ABS-CBN News|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, the Philippine government implemented a "deployment ban" on hiring Filipinos in Bahrain due to the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahraini uprising]] as a part of the [[Arab Spring]], allowing existing Filipino employees to continue working in Bahrain while preventing new workers from entering the nation, but this ban was lifted several months later that year.&lt;ref name="FS1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20110320-326609/Bahrain-PM-assures-PH-of-Filipinos-safety|title=Bahrain PM assures PH of Filipinos’ safety|date=20 March 2011|publisher=Global Nation Inquirer|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/321974/deployment-ban-bahrain-lifted#.UOn3PG-1XDQ|title=Deployment ban in Bahrain lifted|last=Medenilla|first=Samuel|date=9 June 2011|publisher=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filipinos working in Bahrain remitted US$151.82 million from January to November 2012, about 7 per cent more than in the same period in 2011.

In October 1994, the Philippine School Bahrain was established to serve the overseas Filipino community.&lt;ref name="psb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo-pso.org.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=100|title=Philippine School Bahrain|year=2012|publisher=IACPSO|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school currently has nearly 900 students in three separate schools: a pre-school, an elementary school, and a secondary school all housed in three separate buildings in the Kanoo Gardens district in [[Manama]].&lt;ref name="FS1"/&gt; The school is accredited by the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Philippine Department of Education]] and is seeking accreditation by the [[Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities]].&lt;ref name="psb"/&gt;

In 1998, Akmad Sakkam, the previous Filipino Ambassador to Bahrain, said that "Bahrain is the only country in the Middle East where there are no Filipinos in jail",&lt;ref name="FS1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Filipinos in Bahrain most law-abiding|date=2 March 1998|publisher=Bahrain Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributing this to good diplomatic relations and a sense of understanding between the Philippine and Bahraini governments.&lt;ref name="FS1"/&gt; However, by 2006, this number later rose 18 Filipinos in prison, the majority of them being women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bahrainrights.org/en/node/608|title=GDN:Embassy call for Filipinos to obey law|last=del Rosario|first=Eunice|date=13 October 2006|publisher=Bahrain Center for Human Rights|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a Filipino man in Bahrain was convicted of "encouraging moral depravation" and jailed after [[cross-dressing]] and was later deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/bahrain/filipino-cross-dresser-solicits-online-jailed-1.752538|title=Filipino cross dresser solicits online, jailed|date=26 January 2011|publisher=Gulf News|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Filipinos in Palau can speak [[Palauan language|Palauan]] and English language along with their native languages. Filipinos in Palau are mostly speakers of Tagalog, which is, along with almost all Filipino languages are distantly related to Palauan linguistically.

]]

The study of the '''impact of globalization on women in China''' examines the role and status of [[Chinese women]] relative to the political and cultural changes that have taken place in the 20th century as a consequence of [[globalization]]. Globalization refers to the interaction and integration of people, products, cultures and governments between various nations around the globe; this is fostered by [[trade]], [[investment]], and [[information technology]].&lt;ref name=Jiang&gt;Jiang, Shiwei. "Global Trade and Its Effects on China's Female Labor Market." In International Studies Association (ISA) Annual Convention, San Francisco, CA. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=car&gt;Carnegie Endowment for the International Peace. (2009). ''What is Globalization?''. Retrieved November 26, 2009. Retrieved from www.globalization101.org/What_is_Globalization.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization affected women's rights and the gender hierarchy in China, in aspects of domestic life such as marriage and [[primogeniture]], as well as in the workplace. These changes altered the quality of life and the availability of opportunities to women at different junctures throughout the modern globalization process.

The dynamics of gender inequity are related with the ideological principles held by the ruling political regime. The [[History of China#Imperial China|imperial era]] was dominated by the social paradigm of [[Confucianism]], which was a pervasive philosophy throughout the [[Orient]]. Confucian ideals emphasized [[morality]], character, social relationship, and the [[status quo]].&lt;ref name=main&gt;Main Concepts of Confucianism. (n.d.). Retrieved November 28, 2009. Retrieved from http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/main.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius preached ''jen'' (humanity) and the equality and educability of all people;&lt;ref name=ng&gt;Ng, R.M. (2009). College and character: What did Confucius Teach Us About the Importance of Integrating Ethics, Character, Learning, and Education? Journal of College &amp; Character, vol 10(4), pp 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Confucianists and Imperial leaders used his beliefs in social hierarchy, particularly in the family setting, for the physical and social oppression of women. As the Chinese government began to re-assimilate themselves into the global community in the late 19th to early 20th century, it shifted away from conventional Confucian ideals and women's role in society changed as well. After [[Mao Zedong]] established the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, a change in traditional gender roles came about. Mao's death marked the beginning of the current [[communism|communist]] administration, and an influx of international communications in the areas of commerce, politics and social ideals.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;Sung, Y. W. (1991). The China- Hong Kong Connection: The Key to China's Open Door Policy. pp. 1-183. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-38245-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, under the new communist party, the women's rights movement has gained momentum and has become a national issue as well as a sign of [[modernization]].

In rural areas, women traditionally work alongside their family to produce crops like tea and rice. In urban areas, women work in factories, living away from home. Most of these factory workers are young girls who send their income to their families. To help maintain the rights of women in factories, labor unions and organizations were built. In their homes, women take care of their children and cook.

== Western bias ==
Western scholarship has historically used ideas of [[Hierarchy|subordinance]] and [[Victimology|victimization]] to characterize traditional Chinese womanhood.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; These beliefs were largely constructed on the basis of [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[political agenda]]s, and were widely accepted despite their [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref name =ten&gt;Teng, J. E. (1996). The construction of the "traditional Chinese woman" in western academy: A critical review. ''Signs'', Vol 22 (1), pp. 115-151.&lt;/ref&gt; Early European writings pertaining to Chinese women were produced by [[Missionary|missionaries]] and [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] at the conclusion of the 19th century.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; The goal of the missionaries was to "civilize China," and highlighting weakness and victimization provided for the continuance of their work.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; This belief prompted scholars to use female subordination as a means to validate Western ideas about Chinese culture and Confucian principles.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt;

In the 1970s, as the [[feminist movement]]s were forming, they began to affect the literature surrounding women in China.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; Studies on Chinese women from this period were concerned with women's liberation, and were sympathetic to the feminist movement.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; This sentiment largely influenced the topics and methodology of the research.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; With this shift in perspective, the focus of discourse remained on subordination, [[Patriarch|patriarchal oppression]], and victimization.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; These studies examined such issues as foot binding and the [[chastity]] of widows.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; Literature formulated by feminist writers did nothing to dispel the myth of the weak, subservient woman.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; These works provided a new bias that had not before been articulated.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; Feminists believed that Chinese women were a part of a "universally subordinated womanhood".&lt;ref name =ten /&gt; This line of thinking illustrates the cultural superiority inherently felt by Western women.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; Writings on Chinese woman rarely account for differences in time, [[ethnicity]], [[Social class|class]], region or age, preferring to describe the status of women as a static, unitary fixture of Chinese culture, despite the political and geographic boundaries that defined different regions and the economic and social changes that occurred throughout history.&lt;ref name =ten /&gt;

== History of female oppression in marriage ==

=== Traditional roles and Confucianism ===
From the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC-220 CE) until the modern period (1840–1919), scholars and rulers developed a male-dominated [[patriarchal society]] in China.&lt;ref name="Tamney"&gt;Tamney, J. B., &amp; Chiang, L.H. (2002). ''Modernization, Globalization, and Confucianism in Chinese Societies.'' Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Patriarchy is a social and philosophical system where men are considered as superior to women, and thus men should have more power in decision-making than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rawat|first=P. S.|date=2014|title=Patriarchal beliefs, womens empowerment, and general well-being|url=|journal=Vikalpa|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1177/0256090920140206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism was at the root of the development of the patriarchal society in China, and emphasized the distinctions between the sexes and the roles they have within the family.&lt;ref name="Tamney" /&gt; These ideologies continued through the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), and girls were taught from a very young age to be submissive to their fathers, then to their husbands, and later to their sons.&lt;ref name="Tamney2"&gt;Tamney, J. B., &amp; Chiang, L.H. (2002). ''Modernization, Globalization, and Confucianism in Chinese Societies.'' Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.&lt;ref name="Tamney3"&gt;Tamney, J. B., &amp; Chiang, L.H. (2002). ''Modernization, Globalization, and Confucianism in Chinese Societies.'' Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

B., &amp; Chiang, L. H. (2002). ''Modernization, Globalization, and Confucianism in Chinese Societies.'' p. 133. Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; The prime mission of a married woman, regardless of her social status, was to bear at least one son in order to carry on the family name.&lt;ref name="Yao4"&gt;Yao, E. L. (1983). ''Chinese Women: Past &amp; Present'' (p. 22). Mesquite, TX: Ide House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women were only valued for their reproduction functions.&lt;ref name="Yao2" /&gt; Three types of marriage dominated in Ancient China.&lt;ref name="Yao"&gt;Yao, E. L. (1983). ''Chinese Women: Past &amp; Present'' (p. 17). Mesquite, TX: Ide House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The first traditional Chinese marriage type, which originated in the primitive society,&lt;ref&gt;Qixin Chen and Hong Dong. “中国抢婚习俗研究.” In ''中南民族学院学报(哲学社会科学版)''. 1993: 6, pp. 44&lt;/ref&gt; was called a "capture marriage," in which the groom would go to his prospective bride's house at dusk to "kidnap" her.&lt;ref name="Yao" /&gt; The second type was called a "purchase marriage," in which women were paid for by their husbands.&lt;ref name="Yao2"&gt;Yao, E. L. (1983). ''Chinese Women: Past &amp; Present'' (p. 18). Mesquite, TX: Ide House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Once women were purchased, they became their husband's possession and could be traded or sold.&lt;ref name="Yao2" /&gt; The third type was the "[[arranged marriage]]," which could be traced back to the Warring States, emphasized the necessity of parental control and matchmaking institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=孟子|last=孟|first=轲|publisher=艺术中国网|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=42|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matchmakers acted as go-betweens for both families.&lt;ref name="Yao3"&gt;Yao, E. L. (1983). ''Chinese Women: Past &amp; Present'' (p. 19). Mesquite, TX: Ide House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; If there was not a matchmaker, the marriage could be deemed unacceptable and could be dissolved.&lt;ref name="Yao3" /&gt; Once two people were married, the wife would leave her family, live with the husband's family, and be obedient to her in-laws as if they were her own parents.&lt;ref name="Yao4" /&gt;

During the Chou Dynasty, the upper class considered daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Women: Past &amp; Present|last=Yao|first=Esther S.

L. (1983). ''Chinese Women: Past &amp; Present'' (p. 127). Mesquite, TX: Ide House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Many believed that the solution to China's problems would be to adopt Western notions of equality and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="Asia" /&gt; Since the movement stressed group efforts and [[propaganda]], women were involved in numerous collective tasks such as publication, drama production, and fund raising, which helped them gain more social contact with men and win respect.&lt;ref name="Yao5" /&gt;

=== Marriage reforms in the Twentieth Century ===

[[Foot binding]] is the process in which the arch of a woman's feet is broken and the toes are wrapped up against the foot to create a smaller looking foot with an acute arch.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Women: Past and Present|last=Yao|first=Esther S.

Later, as the Communist regime changed the structure of Chinese society through economic reform, the structure of the Chinese family was altered.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"&gt;Guthrie, Doug. (2008).

The traditional social structure was further degraded by the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; The [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] turned members of a family against one another as they sought out "class enemies" to be sent for "re-education," ultimately resulting in a loss of family ties.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; Women were elevated to equal status as men through a series of laws which prohibited practices such as arranged marriages, [[concubinage]]s, [[dowry|dowries]], and [[child marriage|child betrothals]].&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; Under these marriage laws, women enjoyed joint property in marriage and could file for a divorce.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt;

=== Population control ===
During the reform period, the Communist regime in China regulated [[birth control]].&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; The government shaped policies with the intention to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women In China's Long Twentieth Century|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-520-09856-5|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London|pages=27|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the [[Family planning policy|Planned Birth Policy]] was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth Control in China 1949–2000 : Population Policy and Demographic Development|last=Scharping|first=Thomas|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7007-1154-3|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women In China's Long Twentieth Century|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-520-09856-5|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London|pages=27–28|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the fundamental unit of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women In China's Long Twentieth Century|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-520-09856-5|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London|pages=28|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, city couples who both came from one-child families were allowed to have a second child, while couples in rural areas could have a second if just one of them came from a one-child family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/14956C3C5EFFAF28?p=AWNB|title=Shanghai Municipal Government: Young Couples Sticking with One Child|last=|first=|date=November 16, 2011|work=China Business News (China)|access-date=November 20, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the further revision of the Planned Birth Policy allowed couples in which either parent had no siblings to have two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/14B0B267AD5D1D08?p=AWNB|title=Child policy eased, camp abolished|last=|first=|date=December 29, 2013|work=Shanghai Daily (China)|access-date=November 20, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, China allowed all couples to have two children, abolishing its decades-long one-child policy for urban families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/158CAF6871392A70?p=AWNB|title=One-Child Policy Lifted, All Couples Allowed Two Children|last=Xin, Lin and Gang, Wu|first=|date=October 30, 2015|work=Global Times (Beijing, China)|access-date=November 20, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of population control is the prevalence of [[female infanticide]].&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women In China's Long Twentieth Century|last=Hershatter|first=Gail|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=9780520098565|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London|pages=28–29|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per year because of the preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as [[ultrasound]], which help to find out the sex of the fetus.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge [[china gender gap|gender gap]] in China.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt;

The '''history of the [[Jewish]] community in [[Kosovo]]''' largely mirrors that of [[Serbia]], except during the [[Second World War]], when Kosovo, as part of Kingdom of Albania, was [[Albania under Italy|under Italian control]] and later [[Albania under Germany|under German control]]. The other exception is following the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999, when the province began its political separation from Serbia.

== Ottoman rule ==
{{see also|History of the Jews in Turkey}}
Prior to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] conquest of the region, documentation on the Jews of the [[Balkans]] was sketchy. The Jewish communities of the Balkans were boosted in the 15th and 16th centuries by the arrival of Jewish refugees fleeing the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition|Portuguese]] Inquisitions. [[Sultan]] [[Bayezid II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] welcomed the Jewish refugees into his empire. Jews became involved in trade between the various provinces in the Ottoman Empire, becoming especially important in the salt trade.&lt;ref name="jvlibrary"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/serbia.html Virtual Jewish History Tour - Serbia and Montenegro&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1455 [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[cadastral tax census]]{{Ref|a|a}} of the [[House of Branković|Branković]] lands (covering 80% of present-day Kosovo) recorded 1 Jewish dwelling in [[Vučitrn]].

* [[Albanians]]: (48%)
* [[Serbs]]: (44%)
* Remaining 8%: [[Tsintsars]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Circassians]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and Jews
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Yugoslavian rule ==
In the aftermath of [[World War I]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] merged with [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and then united with the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] to form the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], which was soon renamed [[History of The Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The largely Albanian-populated Kosovo was included within Serbia. At the time, some 500 Jews resided in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The 1921 population [[census]] for the territories comprising modern-day Kosovo listed 439,010 inhabitants:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* [[Muslims]]: 329,502 (75%)

* [[Greek Catholics]]: 26
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== World War II and The Holocaust ==

In 1941, Kosovo was incorporated into the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–1943)|Italian-ruled Greater Albania]], and the local Jewish population was protected from the [[Nazi]]-led 
[[Holocaust]]. In July 1943, when [[Italian surrender|Italy left the war]], the Germans took control of Kosovo and recruited the [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian)|Skanderbeg Division]] of Albanian collaborators to defeat [[Yugoslav partisans]] and exterminate the Jews. In 1944, [[Yugoslav Partisans|communist partisans]] recaptured Kosovo from Albania and made it part of the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]].

=== Deportations and death / survival figures ===
'''Critical evaluation of all reference materials listed below should be skillfully employed to filter internal bias within the source.'''

Current literature indicates four sets of numerically recorded deportations from Kosovo:

1) August 1941, Mitrovica, under German occupation, 88 Jews are reported to have been sent to [[Sajmište concentration camp|Sajmiste Concentration Camp]] near [[Axis occupation of Serbia|axis occupied]] Belgrade where they were killed. Prior to deportation all Jewish men in Mitrovica / Mitrovice are alleged to have been arrested, while women were sent to daily forced labor. In February 1942, the women are said to have been detained with their children, Jewish property taken by local collaborators, and Synagogue destroyed. A 1960 report to the Administration of the State Security of NR Serbia [http://kosovoholocaust.com/page4/page17/page17.html details names] of victims from 12 families shot at the camp in winter 1941.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kosovoholocaust.com/|title=Kosovo Holocaust|website=kosovoholocaust.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[While source &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; shows significant signs of bias in tone, second generational verbal accounts of deportations from Mitrovica can still be sourced today. Supplementary survivor testimony in the [https://sfi.usc.edu/vha Shoah Foundation Archive] also makes reference to experience of the holocaust in relation to movements through [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Kosvoska Mitrovica]]]

2) 1942, Prishtina. 250 Yugoslav Jews, including an unknown number of native Kosovo Jews, transferred to the Albanian interior. As of 1943 historian Daniel Perez relates they made up part of 500 Jews held under house arrest or in concentration camps in the Albanian towns of Berat, Kruja and Kavaja. He also indicates movements of both native and non-native Jews from Kosovo to Albania were ongoing throughout the war period.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hW8pDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Daniel+Perez+kosovo+holocaust&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PfT1bWe8ls&amp;sig=IBo2H_jl677rPnGqD0sVksz---A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk_K6HvbXZAhWqKMAKHUZ9BLwQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Daniel%20Perez%20kosovo%20holocaust&amp;f=false|title=In, Bringing the Dark Past to Light: The Reception of the Holocaust in Postcommunist Europe|last=Perez|first=Daniel|last2=Edited by John-Paul Himka|first2=and Joanna Beata Michlic|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|year=2008|isbn=9780803225442|location=USA|pages=27, 28, 29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3) March 1942, Prishtina. Italian military police detained 51 Jewish refugees and passed them to the Nazis. According to historian Noel Malcom they were sent to [[Sajmište concentration camp|Sajmiste]]. Daniel Perez details that the deportation list was compiled by Italian authorities and local Albanian police and that they were first sent to a "concentration camp" [probable terminiological error] in Prishtina before being transferred to Mitrovica.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;'''Malcolm, Noel'''. ''Kosovo: A Short History''. New York: New York University Press, 1998, Pages 213, 231,310  {{ISBN|978-0330412247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4) May 14, 1944, Prishtina. [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg|Skanderburg Unit]] arrested 281Jews who were sent to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] via occupied Belgrade where, according to Noel Malcom, 'more than' 200 died, or according to Martin Cüppers, 'at least' 177 died.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cüppers, “Mission in 'Greater Albania': The 21st Weapon Mountain Division of the ss 'Skanderbeg'” (paper presented at conference in Tirana, 19–20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Albania at War, 1939-1945|last=Jürgen Fischer|first=Bernd|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|year=1999|isbn=|location=Albania|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the majority of historians seem to draw consensus around the 281 figure Albanian historian Haxhi Bajraktari is said to have written that only 43 Jewish names were included in a total of 249 deportees, whom he describes as mainly Communists and Partisans.&lt;ref&gt;''Marrëdhënjet Shqiptaro-Hebraike'', Instituti Shqiptar i Studimeve Politike, Tiranë, printed in Prishtinë in Albanian in 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of apparently [http://kosovoholocaust.com/page1/page1.html original Nazi transport lists] (as yet unverified by this author) suggest Bajraktari's apparent figures for Jews to be understated. Serbian historian Pavle Dzeletovic Ivanov also puts the number of arrests on May 14 at 400 (which conversely suggests overstatement).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jevreji Kosova i Metohije|last=Dzeletovic Ivanov|first=Pavle|publisher=PANPUBLIK BEOGRAD|year=1988|isbn=|location=Belgrade|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of those who both survived and perished at Bergen-Belsen are recorded at source   &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Noel Malcolm|Noel Malcom]] summarises that out of 551 native Kosovo Jews present before war, 210 had died by the end.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[Non-correspondence with the preliminary evidence above as incidents 1 and 4; (210 + 88) = approx 298. This could be because Malcom may not have come across, considered or rejected the Mitrovica deportations].

Video interviews with Kosovo Jews who survived the Holocaust can be found at the [[Shoah foundation|Shoah Foundation]].

=== Extracts from witness statements ===
An extract from the statement of Hedviga Schönfein, prisoner of the Judenlager Zemlin (Sajmište) prison camp has been published by the Centre for Democracy and Reconciliation in South East Europe:

"Immediately upon our arrival at the camp, the Germans told us that the camp would gradually be evacuated, because they intended to imprison communists at the Fair, but they did not want to tell us where they were going to take us.… For the first transfers they invited volunteers and the first to be invited was the group I was from – Jews from Kosmet. (…) Those who were designated for transport were ordered, or, more precisely, kindly advised to take their most valuable possessions with them, and to pack all the rest carefully and put their exact address on the package. (…) Thus, these transfers departed almost every day. On Sundays and holidays there were usually no transfers or removals, but there were days when the car would make two rounds. The driver of the grey car often entered the camp alone, gathered children around him, caressed them, took them in his arms and gave them candies. The children liked him and whenever he came, they would rush toward him to get candies. No one in the camp suspected that people were taken to their deaths. It was strongly believed they were being transferred into a work camp." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pollitecon.com/html/ebooks/Workbook-4-The-Second-World-War.pdf|title=Alternative Educational Materials. The Second World War, second edition. Centre for Democracy and Reconciliation in South East Europe.|last=Edited by Erdelja|first=Kresimir|date=|website=|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [http://kosovoholocaust.com/page56/page56.html statement] from Albert Ruben suggests a deportation from Prishtina in winter 1943, not recorded by the academic historians above:

"At the end of 1943, it was already winter, maybe November or December, the SS men came to all Jewish homes to round us up. They got us out of our beds and took us straight to the barracks near the football field. There were a lot of us, more than four hundred people. We stayed there for two days. Everyone brought some food with them. We didn't have a toilet, so we dug a hole and put some wooden boards over it. They were threatening us, telling us to hand over our gold and other valuables, and we were throwing them into the toilet. What we had not given to the poor earlier we were now throwing into the toilet. Before long they put us into cattle wagons and drove us to the Belgrade camp for Jews at the Sajmiste."

=== Further sources of information on WWII and Holocaust period  ===
Extensive information on the [[World War II in Albania|German occupation of Albania]] proper, with original Nazi source materials referring to Kosovo, can be found in the work of [[Robert Elsie|Robert Elise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/1945_German-Wehrmacht/index.html|title=1945 {{!}} Final Report of the German Wehrmacht in Albania|last=Elsie|first=Dr. Robert|website=www.albanianhistory.net|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/1956_Neubacher/index.html|title=1956 {{!}} Hermann Neubacher: A Nazi Diplomat on Mission in Albania|last=Elsie|first=Dr. Robert|website=www.albanianhistory.net|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thorough critique of the teaching of the subject of WWII and the holocaust in Kosovo schools has been produced by [http://oralhistorykosovo.org/research/the-second-wold-war/ Oral History Kosovo.]

== Post-war community ==
The [[Federation of Jewish Communities in Yugoslavia]] was formed in the aftermath of [[World War II]] to coordinate the Jewish communities of post-war [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and to lobby for the right of Jews to [[aliyah|immigrate to Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Yugoslavia2.html Jews of the Former Yugoslavia After the Holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation was headquartered in [[Belgrade]], the capital of the post-war Yugoslavia.

More than half of the surviving Yugoslav Jews chose to immigrate to [[Israel]] after World War II.  The Jewish community of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]], and indeed of all constituent republics in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], was maintained by the unifying power of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Yugoslavia. However, this power ended with the [[dissolution of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s.

== Yugoslav wars ==
The Jews of Serbia lived relatively peacefully in Yugoslavia between World War II and the 1990s. According to the 1991 census, there were 112 Jews in Kosovo, though it is possible that there have been more. However, the end of the [[Cold War]] saw the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], and wars in [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatia]] and [[Bosnian War|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The war for Kosovo began in the 1990s, when Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] began consolidating power in Kosovo and the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] waged a separatist insurgency. In 1999, international forces expelled Serb forces from Kosovo. During the conflict, the 50 remaining Jews in the capital city of [[Pristina]] fled to Serbia, with which they had close cultural and linguistic ties.

== Post-war Kosovo ==
Currently there are very few Jews in Kosovo, according to Čeda Prlinčević, the leader of Pristina's small Jewish community.

The lone Jewish community in [[Prizren]] speaks Albanian and Turkish, and has remained for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Gabon]] is primarily a transit country for children from [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], [[Togo]], [[Mali]], [[Guinea]], and other [[West Africa]]n countries who are subjected to [[human trafficking]], specifically forced labor and forced prostitution. Some victims transit through Gabon en route to exploitation in Equatorial Guinea. According to [[UNICEF]], the majority of victims are boys who are forced to work as street hawkers or mechanics. Girls generally are subjected to conditions of involuntary domestic servitude, or forced labor in markets or roadside restaurants. Stepped-up coastal surveillance over the past year – especially following the October 2009 arrival in Gabonese waters of a sea vessel that was carrying 34 child trafficking victims, some of whom were destined for Equatorial Guinea{{Citation needed|date = July 2013}}{{Clarify|date=July 2013}} – caused traffickers to change their routes, which included utilizing estuaries and rivers to transport children. The majority of victims were young girls{{Contradict-inline|date=July 2013}}, a departure from previous patterns of trafficking in the region. Trafficking offenders appear to operate in loose ethnic-based crime networks. Most child traffickers are women, who serve as intermediaries in their countries of origin. In some cases, child victims report that their parents had turned them over to intermediaries promising employment opportunities in Gabon. The government has no reports of international organized crime syndicates, employment agencies, marriage brokers, or travel services facilitating trafficking in Gabon. In 2009, the government began tracking a new trend of young adults between ages 18 and 25 being forced into domestic servitude or prostitution in Gabon.&lt;ref name="dos"&gt;"Gabon". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Gabon]] does not fully comply with what the U.S. government considers to be minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts – most notably the arrests of seven suspected traffickers and the expansion of protection services for child victims of trafficking – the government did not show evidence of increasing efforts to address trafficking. Specifically, the government, for another consecutive year, did not provide information on prosecutions or convictions of traffickers, despite the arrest of over 30 suspected offenders between 2003 and 2008.&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt; Because of this, Gabon has been placed on the Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year.

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2 Watchlist"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Gabon has demonstrated limited progress in anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts. Gabon has several laws regarding forms of human trafficking. Law 09/04{{Vague|date=July 2013}}, enacted in September 2004, is used to protect children against sex or labor trafficking in Gabon. The law prescribes penalties of 5 to 15 years of imprisonment, along with fines of $20,000 to $40,000. The procurement of a child for the purpose of prostitution is prohibited under Penal Code Article 261, which prescribes 2 to 5 years of imprisonment and a fine. Forced prostitution of adults is prohibited by law 21/63-94{{Vague|date=July 2013}}, which prescribes 2 to 10 years of imprisonment. During 2010, the government reported seven arrests for trafficking, but did not provide details of the cases. The government also did not report any trafficking prosecutions or convictions during the year. In February 2010, three suspected traffickers were arrested on the border trying to bring 18 young adults from Cameroon, Mali, [[Burkina Faso]], and Guinea into Gabon. The suspects remain jailed as the investigation continues. As the Criminal Court maintained its calendar providing for only one meeting per year, and for one week, suspected trafficking offenders typically waited in jail for trials, and received credit for time served.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Government of Gabon showed progress in its efforts to ensure that victims of trafficking received access to necessary protective services. Government personnel employed procedures to identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable groups, such as migrant children, and referred them systematically to government or [[NGO]] shelters. In responding a vessel in Gabon waters, authorities identified the 34 children aboard the vessel (among 285 others) as trafficking victims and took steps to provide them with assistance. The government coordinated the repatriation of the vessel’s victims to their countries of origin with the concerned governments.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

In direct support of victim protection measures, the government spent approximately $270,000 to support three centers offering foster care to child victims of trafficking in [[Libreville]] and [[Port-Gentil]]. One of the centers is completely government-funded, while the other two are financed partly by the government through material donations and social worker access, and partly through others{{Who|date=July 2013}}. These centers provided shelter, medical care, education, and rehabilitation services, as well as [[psychosocial]] services to educate victims on asserting their rights. The government provided temporary de facto resident status for trafficking victims, and refrained from deporting them. The government also began rehabilitation of two more centers, and opened more child protection centers in [[Franceville]], [[Moanda]] and [[Tchibanga]]. The government also opened six centers for street children and the Ministry of Interior operated two transit centers for illegal immigrants – an alternative to jail.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Gabonese government made some efforts to prevent human trafficking during 2010. In 2009, as the first step in its effort to improve targeting of its prevention messages, it surveyed 2,500 residents to examine the public’s understanding of violence against children, including trafficking. In accordance with the survey findings, an outreach campaign aimed at identifying child victims of violence will begin. In his effort to increase awareness, the country’s President raised the topic of trafficking in Council of Ministers meetings. Also in 2009, the government monitored migration patterns for evidence of trafficking to Gabon. The government stepped up its efforts to enhance maritime security through aerial surveillance. An inter-Ministerial Committee to Combat Child Trafficking was created by Law 09/04{{Vague|date=July 2013}}. The inter-ministerial committee published and distributed leaflets and posters entitled “STOP child exploitation” to highlight forms and consequences of trafficking and its hotline number. Heavy government press coverage of anti-trafficking training sponsored by a foreign government helped raise awareness of victim identification and law enforcement responses. The government did not take action during 2010 to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. However, the commercial sex trade is not a widespread problem in Gabon. Gabon is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The '''Igede people''' are the third largest ethnic group in present-day [[Benue State]] of [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://igede.org|title=Igede.org|website=Igede.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are native to the Oju and Obi local government areas of Nigeria, where 2006 population figures stand at an estimated 267,198 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://igede.org/igedenation/brief-history/|title=Brief History|date=2010-11-10|website=Igede.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a large number of Igede people are dispersed across the state and the Nation. For instance, the [[Igede language]] is also spoken in Nigeria's [[Cross River State]], and a large number of Igede communities exist in [[Osun State]] and [[Ogun State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olatokun|first=Wole|last2=Ayanbode|first2=O.F.|date=April 2009|title=Use of indigenous knowledge by women in a Nigerian rural community|url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/3968|journal=Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge|volume=8|issue=2|pages=287–295|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Igede language is a member of the [[Benue–Congo languages|Benue-Congo]] subgroup of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] language family. [http://igede.org Igede.org] is the unofficial online community of Igede people.

==Geographical Location==
The [[Oju Local Government Area]] was created in 1976 and shares boundaries with present-day Obi, Ado, Konshisha and Gwer East Local Government Areas of Benue State, Ebonyi and Izzi Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State, and Yala Local Government Area of Cross River State. It is headquartered in Oju Town.

The [[Obi local government area]] was created in 1996 and has its headquarters at Obarike-Ito. The local government area derives its name from the Obi stream that flows in the area and shares boundary with Ado, [[Otukpo]] and Oju local government areas of [[Benue State]].

Ekiti State: Igede.

==History==

===Origin: Oral Tradition ===
The Igede trace their origin to Sabon Gida Ora in present-day [[Edo state]]. They are said to be the descendants of Agba, a high chief in Sabon Gida Ora. A skirmish between the Igede and the natives of Ora led to their migration from that region to present-day Benue state through Nsukka in [[Enugu state]]. This historical event in Igede history is commonly recounted in song and drama, for instance the record and drama piece "Ego ny'Igede".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=David Agogo|title=Ego nyi Igede|date=2011-09-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q1jepUY8Ps|accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin: Archival Records ===
Archival records portray them as migrants from Ogoja province who have increasingly adopted the culture and practices of the [[Idoma people|Idoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ugbem|first=Confort E.|date=2013|title=The Social Relations of Identity Construction and Reconstruction among Ethnic Groups in Benue State, Nigeria|url=http://www.ifra-nigeria.org/publications/ifra-e-papers/ifra-e-papers-108/article/ugbem-confort-e-2013-the-social|journal=IFRA e-papers|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration and Politics==
Politically, the Igede fall under the Zone C senatorial district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://benue.com.ng/benue-guber-the-dynamics-of-zone-c-politics/|title=Benue Guber &amp; The Dynamics Of Zone C Politics|website=benue.com.ng|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Igede Culture ==
The Igede are predominantly farmers cultivating maize, cassava, groundnut and yams. Igede is home of the popular Igede-Agba festival, a colourful annual celebration that marks the yam harvest season in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/feature/intriguing-traditional-wedding-rites-of-the-igede-people/99749.html|title=Intriguing traditional wedding rites of the Igede people|last=Ebhota|first=Eseohe|date=2014-03-02|website=[[Daily Trust]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much importance is attached to yam in Igede nation and Nigeria and many other parts of the world, not only because it is the first crop to be harvested, but also the most important and palatable crop. The crop can be eaten in different forms – roasted, boiled, pounded, floured, fried, etc. The crop has been cultivated since 50,000 B.C in Africa and Asia. It is one of the most consumed foods in the world and it constitutes staple food in South America, Africa, West Indies and Pacific Islands, implying that it can be produced for export. Nigeria is already recognized as the largest producer of yam, providing approximately 70% of the world’s total yams.
The New Yam Festival is therefore a celebration depicting the prominence of yam in the social-cultural life of the Igede people and all Agba Descendants such as the Obudu and Bekwara people. The emphasis being placed on yam by the Agba sons is not out of place as research has shown that yam has a lot of health and economic benefits. 
Yam, according to scholars, provides 200 calories of energy per capita daily. The demand for yam in Nigeria is higher than the supply of the crop because it occupies a very prestigious social and religious status in the country and so can be regarded as the "KING OF ALL CROPS" – it is not only celebrated in Nigeria but also in other parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.
More so, each 10 grams of yam contains 118 calories – complex carbohydrates and soluble fiber. It is an excellent source of vitamin B complex (B6, B1 riboflavin, folic acid and niacin). It also contains antioxidants and vitamin C, providing about 20% of the required vitamin C in the body per 100 grams. Other benefits of yam include supporting women’s endocrine system, aiding digestion, improving Bowel Habit, improving cognitive ability and it is cancer deterrent. Besides, the Igede Agba Festival serves as the most important day to a typical Igede man and Agba Descendants as it is the only celebration that creates a sense of nationalism in the descendants of Agba. It is the best platform through which families show love, sense of belonging, unity, communalism and harmonious living. No traditional ceremony among the Agba sons and daughters occupies a more prominent position than the Igede Agba – it is not intended at appeasing any deity (such as “Apang”), but meant to celebrate hard work, dignity of labour and magnanimity as well as elicit resilient spirit which spur farmers to putting in more effort in the next planting season. Igede traditional clothes are blue, black, and white stripes.

[[Image:Nevadacave1.jpeg|right|200px|thumb|Jack Lee Harelson looting Elephant Mountain Cave in the Black Rock Desert]]
'''Jack Lee Harelson''' (1940 - December 14, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[insurance agent]], best known for [[desecration|desecrating]] and looting a [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indian burial site in the [[Black Rock Desert]] of [[Nevada]].

==Biography==

Jack Lee Harelson was an insurance agent in [[Grants Pass, Oregon]]. In 1995, one of his former business partners in an [[opal]] mine tipped off police that Harelson had been looting Amerindian sites. In exchange for immunity from prosecution, Harelson's ex-wife Pamela Ralph led police investigators to an Elephant Mountain&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite gnis
|type=summit
|id=847170
|name=Elephant Mountain
|accessdate=17 April 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cave in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. She stated that she and Harelson had dug and collected American Indian treasures in the early 1980s. She had photographs of the cave that had significantly grown after three years of digging. Harelson had built a wall to hide a dirt pile. Digging had totally destroyed the site, which had included various artifacts, including those from the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] tribe.

[[Oregon State Police]] recovered over 2,000 artifacts from Harelson's home in Grants Pass, including 10,000-year-old sandals. In Harelson's garden, police found two [[decapitation|headless bodies]] of Paiute children wrapped in plastic garbage bags. These bodies were historical, maybe 2,000 years old. The heads were not found. Ralph said that bodies were intact when they were found in two large baskets.

The state prosecutor charged Harelson for looting and desecrating the site. He was charged with [[theft|aggravated theft]], [[abuse of corpse]]s, tampering with [[evidence]] and possessing illegal [[gambling]] devices. The main witness in the case was Pamela Ralph, but his old business partners also testified.

Harelson admitted only to digging a "test hole" and removing some artifacts and said that he had intended to attract interest of archaeologists and to hand the artifacts over later. He stated that he had reported significant [[paleontology|paleontological]] finds to the [[Nevada State Museum, Carson City|Nevada State Museum]]. The museum acknowledged that.

Harelson's defense claimed he was a collector who had bought the Amerindian artifacts and was not involved with dealing them. The defense tried to have charges dismissed on the grounds that the [[statute of limitations]] had expired. The prosecutor successfully argued that continued possession of the items constituted continuation of the crime. Harelson was found guilty of abuse of a corpse and possession of state property. He received a fine of $20,000 and spent 30 days in jail.

Harelson lost his insurance agent's licence and began an online business, called Jack's Outback, selling opals and things like [[petroglyph]] reproductions and artifact display cases. According to a later police report, he also continued to deal in [[illegal antiquities]] and solicited excavation of sites in Oregon and Nevada.

On December 6, 2002, a federal administrative law judge in Oregon fined Harelson $2.5 million for destruction of archaeological resources.&lt;ref&gt;

Further investigation unearthed two skulls that may have belonged to the two Paiute corpses. Harelson claimed that he had no money and accused the government of turning him into a scapegoat. Behind the scenes, police investigation about his antique dealings continued.

In January 2003, authorities discovered that Harelson intended to kill police sergeant Walt Markee, who had searched Harelson's home, County Judge Loyd O'Neal, who had presided over the 1996 trial, Harelson's ex-wife and two former business partners. An undercover policeman approached Harelson in the role of a [[hitman]] willing to carry out the murders for a price. Harelson paid the policeman $10,000 in the form of opals after the policeman showed Harelson a fabricated photograph of the corpse of one of the intended murder victims. The transaction was videotaped, and police later arrested Harelson in his home with the help of a [[SWAT]] team.

In 2004, the [[Government of Oregon|State of Oregon]] charged Harelson with multiple counts of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit aggravated [[murder]] and [[gun control|illegal possession of a firearm]]. He was sent to jail without [[bail]] to await sentencing.  Later in 2004, Harelson's bid to overturn the $2.5 million fine failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Kasepuhan''' or '''Kasepuhan Banten Kidul''' are a traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] community of approximately 5,300 people, who live in the southern part of [[Gunung Halimun National Park]], in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[West Java]]. Gunung Halimun National Park is located within the borders of the [[Sukabumi Regency]], [[Bogor]] and southern [[Banten]] province. The Kasepuhan is called "Kasepuhan Banten Kidul" (Kasepuhan of Southern Banten), their main village is Ciptagelar in the Cisolok subdistrict (''kecamatan'') in the western part of the [[Sukabumi Regency]]. The current head of the community, Abah Ugih, inherited the position of leader when his father, Abah Anom, died at the age of 54.&lt;ref&gt;J. Adiguna, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/11/living-harmony-with-nature.html-3 Living in harmony with the nature'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514223326/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/11/living-harmony-with-nature.html-3 |date=2014-05-14 }}, ''The Jakarta Post'', 11 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''kasepuhan'' is formed on ''sepuh'', which means "old" in the [[Sundanese language]]. It refers to a way of living based on ancestral traditions and eventually, to the local community who lives according to these traditions.

==History and tradition==
According to oral information, the Kasepuhan have lived in this area (''Banten Kidul'', or ''south Banten'') since 1368.   The ancestors of the Kasepuhan are said to have lived in the area of Bogor, east of Gunung Halimun. At that time, their ancestors were part of a kingdom that encompassed the province of West Java and Banten.

The people of the Kasepuhan claim they are linked with the [[Baduy people|Baduy]], another traditional group in West Java. The main belief system of Kasepuhan people is [[Sunda Wiwitan]]. Nowadays, the Kasepuhan are influenced by [[Islam]].  However they do not strictly follow all rules of Islam but, rather, combine their beliefs with [[animism]] and [[Sundanese (people)|Sundanese]] traditions. Just as their ancestors, they have combined several traditions and religions with their own Kasepuhan tradition; that is, they are influenced by Islam, Sundanese traditions, Pajajaran traditions and thus Hinduism and also animism.

The main ritual of Kasepuhan community is ''[[Seren Taun]]'', or rice harvest thanksgiving as well as marking the new agriculture year in [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] tradition. Seren Taun festival also celebrated by other Sundanese traditional communities in other areas such as Sundanese community in Cigugur [[Kuningan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.kompas.com/read/2011/01/23/09340353/Hari.Ini.Puncak.Seren.Taun.di.Bogor Seren Taun Bogor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kasepuhan history existed since 1368 (note: the years allowed to write down) their believe before that time also they still have story, but enough to lets other peoples known only from that time.
the areas of the kingdom called " Banten Kidul" its a territories  before the government age, and now this Banten Kidul area on three sub district areas ( Lebak, Bogor and Sukabumi)
The peoples in Kasepuhan still living in the tradition and ancient cultures role of custom, following what the ancestor said for their life and living on rice plantation. the rice they have to plan is only rice seed from the ancestor ( data 2014: there are 167 original varieties) planting till today, and more than 300 new varieties from natural mixing on the rice field.

By far the most important way of subsistence for the Kasepuhan is agriculture, which can split into two categories: ' Huma'' (Dry rice cultivation), ''Sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). the Dry system rice plantation is the original way plantation from the ancestor, and since the Dutch time then they have wets system rice plantation called "Sawah".

About 85% of Kasepuhan agricultural land is ''sawah'', 10% consists of ''ladang'', and 5% ''kebun''.  There is a strong emphasis on eco-friendly techniques of farming within the community.and the other land is Forestry, living in the forest also message from the ancestor to keep the tradition safely, make distance with the city from outside influence, they have three categories forestry for : Leuweung  Tutupan (forbidden forest), Leuweung Titipan (forbidden forest) and Leuweung Garapan ( the plots forest), and the peoples living in the plots lands &lt;ref&gt;Sri Wahyuni, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/10/25/painting-campaign-calls-justice-climate-change.html Painting campaign calls for justice on climate change'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 25 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that is at a risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]]. [[UNESCO]] defines [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|four levels of language endangerment]] between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

Nine government ministers have been charged by the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]],&lt;ref name="DNA26sep2014"&gt;[[National Anticorruption Directorate]], [http://www.pna.ro/comunicat.xhtml?id=5309 Comunicat Nr. 1342/VIII/3], 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to the [[First Năstase cabinet|Năstase]], [[Tăriceanu I Cabinet|Tăriceanu]] and [[Boc Cabinets]].

In [[law]], a '''minor''' is a person under a certain age, usually the [[age of majority]], which legally demarcates [[childhood]] from [[adulthood]]. The age of majority depends upon jurisdiction and application, but it is generally 18. ''Minor'' may also be used in contexts that are unconnected to the overall age of majority. For example, the [[legal drinking age|drinking age]] in the [[United States]] is usually 21, and younger people are sometimes called ''minors'' in the context of alcohol law, even if they are at least 18.&lt;ref name="CTLaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_545.htm|publisher=State of Connecticut|title=Liquor Control Act|quote='Minor' means any person under twenty-one years of age.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNLaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-39/chapter-15/part-4/39-15-404|publisher=State of Tennessee|title=Offenses Against the Family|quote=As used in this section, minor means a person under twenty-one (21) years of age.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''underage''' often refers to those under the age of majority, but it may also refer to persons under a certain age limit, such as the [[drinking age]], [[smoking age]], [[age of consent]], [[marriageable age]], [[driving age]], [[voting age]], etc. Such age limits are often different from the age of majority.

The concept of ''minor'' is not sharply defined in most jurisdictions. The [[age of criminal responsibility|ages of criminal responsibility]] and consent, the age at which school attendance is no longer compulsory, the age at which legally binding contracts can be entered into, and so on may be different from one another.

In many countries, including [[Australia]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], [[Croatia]], and [[Colombia]], a minor is defined as a person under the age of 18. In the United States, where the age of majority is set by the individual states, minor usually refers to someone under the age of 18 but can, in some states, be used in certain areas (such as casino [[gambling]], handgun ownership and the consuming of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]) to define someone under the age of 21. In the [[criminal justice]] system in some places, "minor" is not entirely consistent, as a minor may be [[trial (law)|tried]] and punished for a crime either as a "juvenile" or, usually only for "extremely serious crimes" such as murder, as an "adult".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quora.com/Prisons-and-Prison-Life/Juvenile-crime-is-on-the-rise-Is-it-right-or-fair-to-treat-and-charge-juveniles-as-adults "Prisons and Prison Life: Juvenile crime is on the rise. Is it right or fair to treat and charge juveniles as adults?"]. Retrieved June 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Thailand]], a minor is a person under 20 years of age. In [[New Zealand]] law, the age of majority is 20 years of age as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1970/0137/latest/DLM396495.html|title=Age of Majority Act 1970|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the rights of adulthood are assumed at lower ages: for example, entering contracts and having a will are allowed at 15.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rudman.

==International==

===Canada===
{{Main|Youth Criminal Justice Act}}
For all provincial laws (such as alcohol and tobacco regulation), the provincial and territorial governments have the power to set the age of majority in their respective province or territory, and the age varies across [[Canada]].

[[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Prince Edward Island]] have the age of majority set at 18, while in [[British Columbia]], [[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]] the age of majority is 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.tdcanadatrust.com/apply/aom2.html|title=Age of Majority Table|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Saskatchewan]], the legal gaming age and the legal drinking age are both 19.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/canada/saskatchewan/drinking-age-will-remain-19-in-saskatchewan-1.1350523 "Drinking age will remain 19 in Saskatchewan"]. ''CBC News''. (March 8, 2013). Retrieved June 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], law nr. 39 of March 8, 1975, states that a minor is a person under the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italie|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/fr/text.jsp?file_id=230008|publisher=[[WIPO]]|website =[[WIPO Lex]]|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens under the age of 18 may not vote (to vote for senators, 25), be elected, obtain a driving license for automobiles or issue or sign [[legal instrument]]s. Crimes committed in Italy by minors are tried in a juvenile court.

===Mexico===
In all 31 states, a minor is referred to as someone under the age of 18.

Minors aged 16 or 17 who are charged with crimes could sometimes be treated as an adult.

===India===
In all 29 [[States of India|states]] and 7 [[Union Territory|union territories]], a minor is referred to as someone under the age of 18. In rare cases minors aged 16 or 17 who are.. charged with extremely heinous crimes could sometimes be treated as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/class-11-student-to-be-tried-as-an-adult-for-ryan-boys-murder/articleshow/62185814.cms|title=Class XI student to be tried as adult for Ryan boy's Murder|last=Coleman|first=Bennet &amp;|date=2017-12-21|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
The Civil and Commercial Code of the Kingdom of Thailand does not define the term "minor"; however, sections 19 and 20 read as follows:
* '''Section 19''' – A person, on completion of 20 years of age ceases to be a minor and become ''[[sui juris]]''
* '''Section 20''' – A minor becomes ''sui juris'' upon marriage, provided that the marriage is made in accordance with the provisions of Section 1448

Hence, a minor in Thailand refers to any person under the age of 20, unless they are married. A minor is restricted from doing juristic acts—for example, sign contracts. When a minor wishes to do a juristic act, he has to obtain the consent from his legal representative, usually (but not always) the parents and otherwise the act is voidable. The exceptions are acts by which a minor merely acquires a right or is freed from a duty, acts that are strictly personal, and acts that are suitable to the person's condition in life and are required for their reasonable needs. A minor can make a [[Will (law)|will]] at the age of fifteen.

{{Further|Law of England and Wales|Law of Northern Ireland|Law of Scotland}}
In [[England and Wales]] and in [[Northern Ireland]] a minor is a person under the age of 18;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1969/46/section/1|title=Family Law Reform Act 1969|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is also true for [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/50/section/1|title=Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The age of criminal responsibility]] in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland is 10; and 12 in Scotland, formerly 8, which was the lowest age in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/age-of-criminal-responsibility|title=Age of criminal responsibility|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthjusticeagencyni.gov.uk/youth_justice_system/age_of_criminal_responsibility/|title=Youth justice - Department of Justice|date=2 September 2015|publisher=youthjusticeagencyni.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/S4/SB_11-53rev.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204131530/http://scottish.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/S4/SB_11-53rev.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales, cases of [[Young offender|minors breaking the law]] are often dealt with by the [[Youth Offending Team]]. If they are [[incarcerated]], they are sent to a [[Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution|Young Offender Institution]].

Things that persons under 18 are prohibited from doing include sitting on a jury, voting, standing as a candidate, buying or renting films with an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]] or [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]] or seeing them in a cinema, being depicted in pornographic materials, suing without a litigant friend, being civilly liable, accessing adoption records and purchasing alcohol, tobacco products, knives and fireworks. The rules on minimum age for sale of these products are frequently broken so in practice drinking and smoking takes place before the age of majority; however many UK shops are tightening restrictions on them by asking for identifying documentation from potentially underage customers.

Driving certain large vehicles, acting as personal license holder for licensed premises, and adopting a child are only permitted after the age of 21. The minimum age to drive a HGV1 vehicle was reduced to 18. However, certain vehicles, e.g., [[steamroller]]s, require that someone be 21 years of age to obtain an operating license.

===United States===
In the United States as of 1995, ''minor'' is generally legally defined as a person under the age of 18.  Although in the context of [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] or [[gambling]] laws, people under the age of 21 may also sometimes be referred to as "minors".&lt;ref name="CTLaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNLaw"/&gt;  However, not all minors are considered "juveniles" in terms of criminal responsibility. As is frequently the case in the United States, the laws vary widely by state.

Under this distinction, those considered juveniles are usually (but not always) tried in [[juvenile court]], and they may be afforded other special protections. For example, in some states a parent or guardian must be present during police questioning, or their names may be kept confidential when they are accused of a crime. For many crimes (especially more violent crimes), the age at which a minor may be tried as an adult is variable below the age of 18 or (less often) below 16.&lt;ref&gt;Gaines, Larry K and Roger Leroy Miller. "Criminal Justice in Action"  4th ed., Thompson Wadsworth Publishing, 2007. Pg 495&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Kentucky]], the lowest age at which a juvenile may be tried as an adult, no matter how heinous the crime, is 14.

The death penalty for those who have committed a crime while under the age of 18 was discontinued by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Roper v.

{{Main|Minors detained in the global war on terror}}
The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] took the position that they would not consider "[[enemy combatant]]s" held in [[extrajudicial]] detention in the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]]s minors unless they were less than sixteen years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/guantanamo-s-child-soldiers-files-reveal-many-inmates-were-minors-a-759444.html|title=Files Reveal Many Inmates Were Minors|last=Schmitz|first=Gregor Peter|date=April 2011|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, they only separated three of more than a dozen detainees under 16 from the adult prison population. Several dozen detainees between sixteen and eighteen were detained with the adult prison population. Now those under 18 are kept separate, in line with the age of majority and world expectations.

Some states, including [[Florida]], have passed laws that allow a person accused of an extremely heinous crime, such as murder, to be tried as an adult, regardless of age. These laws have been challenged by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. An estimated 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as adults every year across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campaignforyouthjustice.org/documents/KeyYouthCrimeFacts.pdf Campaign for Youth Justice, Key Facts: Youth in the Justice System.

==Emancipation of minors==
{{Main|Emancipation of minors}}
Emancipation of minors is a legal mechanism by which a minor is no longer under the control of their parents or guardians, and is given the legal rights associated with adults. Depending on country, emancipation may happen in different manners: through [[marriage]], attaining economic self-sufficiency, obtaining an educational [[academic degree|degree]] or [[diploma]], or participating in a form of [[military service]]. In the United States, all states have some form of emancipation of minors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/emancipation_of_minors&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that living in areas of high [[pollution]] has serious long term health effects. Living in these areas during [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]] can lead to diminished [[Intelligence|mental capacity]] and an increased risk of [[brain damage]]. People of all ages who live in high pollution areas for extended periods place themselves at increased risk of various [[neurological disorder]]s. Both [[air pollution]] and [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] pollution have been implicated as having negative effects on [[central nervous system]] (CNS) functionality. The ability of [[pollutant]]s to affect the [[neurophysiology]] of individuals after the structure of the CNS has become mostly stabilized is an example of negative [[neuroplasticity]].

==Air pollution==
Air pollution is known to affect small and large [[blood vessel]]s throughout the body.

High levels of air pollution are associated with increased risk of [[stroke]]s and [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Hong et al., 2002 Y. C. Hong, J. T. Lee, H. Kim and H. J. Kwon, "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c066/1a72abe8ffc01cad4fb6d3ab596b6bbd7c7d.pdf Air pollution: a new risk factor in ischemic stroke mortality]", ''Stroke'' 33 (9) (2002), pp. 2165–2169&lt;/ref&gt; By permanently affecting [[vascular]] structures in the [[brain]], air pollution can have serious effects on [[nervous system|neural]] functioning and neural matter. In dogs air pollution shows to cause damage to the CNS by altering the [[blood–brain barrier]], causing [[neurons]] in the [[cerebral cortex]] to degenerate, destroying [[glial cells]] found in [[white matter]], and by causing [[neurofibrillary tangles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calderon-Garciduenas | first1 = L. | last2 = Azzarelli | first2 = B. | last3 = Acuna | first3 = H. | last4 = Garcia | first4 = R. | last5 = Gambling | first5 = T.

===Effects in adolescents and canines===
A study from 2008 compared children and dogs raised in [[Mexico City]] (a location known for high pollution levels) with children and dogs raised in [[Polotitlán de la Ilustración|Polotitlán]], Mexico (a city whose pollution levels meet the current US [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calderon-Garciduenas | first1 = L. | last2 = Mora-Tiscareno | first2 = A. | last3 = Ontiveros | first3 = E. | last4 = Gomez-Garza | first4 = G. | last5 = Barragan-Mejia | first5 = G. | last6 = Broadway | first6 = J. | last7 = Chapman | first7 = S. | last8 = Valencia-Salazar | first8 = G. | last9 = Jewells | first9 = V.

In contrast, children from the low pollution area scored as expected on IQ tests, and did not show any significant sign of the risk of brain lesions. This correlation was found to be statistically significant, and shows that pollution levels may be related to, and contribute to, brain lesion formation and IQ scores, which, in turn, manifests as impaired intellectual capacity and/or performance. Living in high pollution areas thus places adolescents at risk of premature brain [[Degeneration (medical)|degeneration]] and improper neural development—these findings could have significant implications for future generations.

===Effects in adults===
There are indications that the effects of physical activity and air pollution on neuroplasticity counteract. Physical activity is known for its health-enhancing benefits, particularly on the [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] system, and has also demonstrated benefits for brain plasticity processes, [[Circulatory system|cognition]] and mental health. The neurotrophine, [[BDNF|brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) is thought to play a key role in exercise-induced cognitive improvements. Brief bouts of physical activity have been shown to increase [[Serum (blood)|serum]] levels of BDNF, but this increase may be offset by increased exposure to [[Serum (blood)|traffic]]-related air pollution.&lt;ref name="Bos et al. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal

===Epilepsy===
Researchers in [[Chile]] found statistically-significant correlations between multiple air pollutants and the risk of [[epilepsy]] using a 95% [[confidence interval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cakmak | first1 = S. | last2 = Dales | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Vidal | first3 = C. B. | year = 2010 | title = Air pollution and hospitalization for epilepsy in Chile". [Article] | url = | journal = Environment International | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 501–505 | doi=10.1016/j.envint.2010.03.008| pmid = 20452673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The air pollutants that the researchers attempted to correlate with increased incidence of epilepsy included [[carbon monoxide]], [[ozone]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], large [[Particulates|particulate]] matter, and fine particulate matter. The researchers tested these pollutants across seven cities and, in all but one case, a correlation was found between pollutant levels and the occurrence of epilepsy. All of the correlations found were shown to be statistically significant. The researchers hypothesized that air pollutants increase epilepsy risk by increasing [[inflammation|inflammatory]] mediators, and by providing a source of [[oxidative stress]]. They believe that these changes eventually alter the functioning of the blood–brain barrier, causing brain [[inflammation]]. Brain inflammation is known to be a risk factor for epilepsy; thus, the sequence of events provides a plausible mechanism by which pollution may increase epilepsy risk in individuals who are [[Genetics|genetically]] vulnerable to the disease.

==Dioxin poisoning==
[[Organohalogen]] compounds, such as [[dioxins]], are commonly found in [[pesticide]]s or created as by-products of pesticide manufacture or [[Biodegradation|degradation]]. These compounds can have a significant impact on the [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]] of exposed organisms. Some observed effects of exposure to dioxins are altered [[Astrocyte|astroglial]] intracellular [[Astrocyte|calcium]] ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), decreased [[glutathione]] levels, modified [[Astrocyte|neurotransmitter]] function in the CNS, and loss of [[pH]] maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mates | first1 = J. | last2 = Segura | first2 = J. | last3 = Alonso | first3 = F. | last4 = Marquez | first4 = J. | year = 2010 | title = Roles of dioxins and heavy metals in cancer and neurological diseases using ros-mediated mechanisms | url = | journal = Free Radical Biology and Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 9| pages = 1328–1341 | doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.07.028| pmid = 20696237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 350 [[chemical plant]] employees exposed to a dioxin precursor for [[herbicide]] synthesis between 1965 and 1968 showed that 80 of the employees displayed signs of dioxin poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Urban | first1 = P. | last2 = Pelclova | first2 = D. | last3 = Lukas | first3 = E. | last4 = Kupka | first4 = K. | last5 = Preiss | first5 = J. | last6 = Fenclová | first6 = Z. | last7 = Šmerhovský | first7 = Z. | year = 2007| title = Neurological and neurophysiological examinations on workers with chronic poisoning by 2,3,7,8-tcdd: follow-up 35 years after exposure | url = | journal = European Journal of Neurology | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 213–218 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2006.01618.x| pmid = 17250732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 350 employees, 15 were contacted again in 2004 to submit to neurological tests to assess whether the dioxin poisoning had any long-term effects on neurological capabilities. The amount of time that had passed made it difficult to assemble a larger [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]], but the results of the tests indicated that eight of the 15 subjects exhibited some central nervous system impairment, nine showed signs of [[polyneuropathy]], and [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) showed various degrees of structural abnormalities. This study suggested that the effects of dioxins were not limited to initial [[toxicity]]. Dioxins, through neuroplastic effects, can cause long-term damage that may not manifest itself for years or even decades.

==Metal exposure==
Heavy metal exposure can result in an increased risk of various neurological diseases. Research indicates that the two most [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]] heavy metals are [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[lead]]. The impact that these two metals will have is highly dependent upon the individual due to [[genetic variation]]s. Mercury and lead are particularly neurotoxic for many reasons: they easily cross [[cell membrane]]s, have oxidative effects on cells, react with [[sulfur]] in the body (leading to disturbances in the many functions that rely upon [[sulfhydryl]] groups), and reduce [[glutathione]] levels inside cells. [[Methylmercury]], in particular, has an extremely high affinity for [[Thiol|sulfhydryl]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gundacker | first1 = C. | last2 = Gencik | first2 = M. | last3 = Hengstschlager | first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = The relevance of the individual genetic background for the toxicokinetics of two significant neurodevelopmental toxicants: mercury and lead | url = | journal = Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research | volume = 705 | issue = 2| pages = 130–140 | doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2010.06.003| pmid = 20601101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Organomercury]] is a particularly damaging form of mercury because of its high absorbability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ng | first1 = D.

Elevated mercury levels increase glutathione levels by affecting [[gene expression]], and this in turn affects two proteins (MT1 and MT2) that are contained in [[astrocytes]] and neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = J. | last2 = Lei | first2 = D. | last3 = Waalkes | first3 = M.

===Autism===
{{main|Causes of autism}}
Heavy metal exposure, when combined with certain [[genetic predisposition]]s, can place individuals at increased risk for developing [[autism]]. Many examples of CNS [[pathophysiology]], such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and [[mitochondrial]] dysfunction, could be by-products of environmental [[stressor]]s such as pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herbert | first1 = M. R. | authorlink = Martha Herbert | year = 2010 | title = Contributions of the environment and environmentally vulnerable physiology to autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurology | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 103–110 | doi=10.1097/wco.0b013e328336a01f | pmid=20087183}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been reports of autism outbreaks occurring in specific locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = S. | last2 = Saunders | first2 = K. | last3 = Chakrabarti | first3 = S. | year = 1999 | title = Does autism cluster geographically? A research note | url = | journal = Autism | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 39–43 | doi=10.1177/1362361399003001004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these cases of autism are related to geographic location, the implication is that something in the environment is complementing an at-risk [[genotype]] to cause autism in these vulnerable individuals. Mercury and lead both contribute to inflammation, leading scientists to speculate that these heavy metals could play a role in autism. These findings are controversial, however, with many researchers believing that increasing rates of autism are a consequence of more accurate screening and diagnostic methods, and are not due to any sort of [[environmental factor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wing | first1 = L. | last2 = Potter | first2 = D. | year = 2002 | title = The epidemiology of autistic spectrum disorders: is the prevalence rising? | url = | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 151–161 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.10029 | pmid = 12216059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accelerated neural aging==
[[Neuroinflammation]] is associated with increased rates of [[neurodegeneration]].&lt;ref name="CAMPBELL, A. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = A. | year = 2004 | title = Inflammation, Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Environmental Exposures | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1035 | issue = 1| pages = 117–132 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1332.008 | pmid = 15681804 | bibcode = 2004NYASA1035..117C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflammation tends to increase naturally with age. By facilitating inflammation, pollutants such as air particulates and heavy metals cause the CNS to age more quickly. Many late-onset diseases are caused by neurodegeneration. [[Multiple sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), and [[Alzheimer's disease]] are all believed to be exacerbated by inflammatory processes, resulting in individuals displaying signs of these diseases at an earlier age than is typically expected.&lt;ref name="CAMPBELL, A. 2004"/&gt;

Multiple sclerosis occurs when chronic inflammation leads to the compromise of [[oligodendrocyte]]s, which in turn leads to the destruction of the [[Myelin|myelin sheath]]. Then [[axon]]s begin exhibiting signs of damage, which in turn leads to neuron death. Multiple sclerosis has been correlated to living in areas with high particulate matter levels in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oikonen | first1 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Ambient air quality and occurrence of multiple sclerosis relapse | url = | journal = Neuroepidemiology | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 95–99 | doi=10.1159/000067108| pmid = 12566960 | author2 = and others | displayauthors = 1 | last3 = Laippala | first3 = P. | last4 = Oksaranta | first4 = O. | last5 = Lilius | first5 = E.-M. | last6 = Lindgren | first6 = S. | last7 = Rantio-LehtimÄki | first7 = A. | last8 = Anttinen | first8 = A. | last9 = Koski | first9 = K. | last10 = ErÄlinna | first10 = J.-P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Parkinson's disease, inflammation leading to depletion of [[antioxidant]] stores will ultimately lead to [[dopamine]]rgic neuron degeneration, causing a shortage of dopamine and contributing to the formation of Parkinson's disease. Chronic glial activation as a result of inflammation causes [[motor neuron]] death and compromises astrocytes, these factors leading to the symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, aka [[Lou Gehrig|Lou Gehrig's]] disease).

In the case of Alzheimer's disease, inflammatory processes lead to neuron death by inhibiting growth at axons and activating astrocytes that produce [[proteoglycans]].  This product can only be deposited in the [[hippocampus]] and [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], indicating that this may be the reason these two areas show the highest levels of degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoke | first1 = A. | year = 1994 | title = Regional differences in reactive gliosis induced by substrate-bound β-amyloid | url = | journal = Exp.

These facts, coupled with air pollution's link to neurofibrillary tangles and the observed subcortical vascular changes observed in dogs, imply that the negative neuroplastic effects of pollution could result in increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, and could also implicate pollution as a cause of early-onset Alzheimer's disease through multiple mechanisms. The general effect of pollution is increased levels of inflammation. As a result, pollution can significantly contribute to various neurological disorders that are caused by inflammatory processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7473">'''Nude psychotherapy''' is the use of non-sexual social [[nudity]] as an intentional means to improve the participant's psychological health.

The field began in the 1930s with psychological studies of the effects of social nudity on the lives of [[naturist]]s. It developed in the 1960s along with the [[encounter group]] movement as a way to challenge preconceptions and promote intimacy and trust, but suffered a decline in the 1980s. It is still used by some organizations that offer participatory workshops on intimacy, sex and love.

== Origins ==

In 1932 a Princeton psychologist [[Howard Warren]], who was president of the [[American Psychological Association]], spent a week at a German [[nudist]] camp. A year later, he published a paper entitled ''Social Nudism and the Body Taboo'', which was a largely sympathetic consideration of the social and psychological significance of nudism.{{sfn|Tartakovsky|2011}}{{sfn|Warren|1933}} Warren described nudism in therapeutic terms, pointing out its 'easy camaraderie' and lack of 'self-consciousness' . He noted an 'improvement in general health' among participants.  Other psychologists published further papers on the effect of nudity in the 1940s and 1950s.{{sfn|Tartakovsky|2011}}

===1960s===
In 1967, a group psychotherapist in California, [[Paul Bindrim]], noticed that towards the end of a long period of [[group psychotherapy]] called a "marathon", the participants would be sufficiently open and trusting of each other to feel comfortable enough to be spontaneously naked in each other's company. Bindrim theorized that intentionally introducing nudity in the early stages of a group might accelerate the process of mutual trust and emotional openness. Bindrim corresponded with [[Abraham Maslow]] on the subject of nude psychotherapy groups, which Maslow, who was then-president of the [[American Psychological Association]], supported. Maslow supported the idea stating he saw the social taboo on nudity to be a matter of custom rather than of any ethical or moral importance. Maslow warned that he thought discretion, sensitivity and caution would have to be present in any execution of the idea.{{sfn|Nicholson|2007}} Maslow later cautioned that the sensation of nudity and sensual pleasure should not be mistaken by participants for the genuine achievement of a psychological "high" and feared it might impede the development of real empathy between individuals.{{sfn|Grogan|2008|pp=192–194}}

In 1967, Bindrim conducted his first nude workshop in [[Deer Park, California]]. There were typically 15 to 25 participants.{{sfn|Tartakovsky|2011}} Bindrim developed his nude encounter marathons into a weekend workshop using nudity and swimming pools, which was recorded in the 1971 documentary film entitled ''Out of Touch'' by the [[Canadian Film Board]] and produced by Bindrim.{{sfn|Fountain|2010}}{{sfn|Kaphan}} The American Psychological Association's Ethics Committee launched an investigation of Bindrim, reportedly prompted by conservative politicians. However,  due to the cultural climate of the late 1960s and the fact that the nudity was [[consensual]], the  investigation was later dropped.{{sfn|Tartakovsky|2011}} Bindrim became increasingly sensitive to the [[public relations]] obstacle posed by the phrase "nude psychotherapy" causing him recast his approach and by the late 1970s his promotional materials made only a passing reference to nudity. With the change in psychotherapeutic fashion as the 1970s progressed, the decision was eventually made to remove the emphasis on nudity altogether. Other contemporary researchers found that social nudity is not the sexually-charged practise that convention imagines it to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199707/why-nudist-dont-get-erections|title=Nudity as a Quest for Life Way it was Before Apple|last=Blank|first=Leonard|date=June 1969|website=Psychology Today|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

The Human Awareness Institute, an organization that offers participatory workshops on intimacy, sex and love continues to conduct group sessions in which the participants have the option to be naked.{{sfn|Shewey|1994}}

'''Panamanian people''' or '''Panamanians''' are people identified with [[Panama]], a country in [[Central America]], whose connection may be residential, legal, historical, or cultural. For most Panamanians, several or all of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their Panamanian identity. Panama is a multilingual and multicultural society, home to people of many different ethnicities and religions. Therefore, many Panamanians do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance to Panama. The overwhelming majority of Panamanians are the product of varying degrees of admixture between [[European ethnic groups]] (predominantly [[Spaniards]]) with native [[Amerindians]] who are indigenous to Panama’s modern territory. 

The culture held in common by most Panamanians is referred to as [[mainstream]] [[Culture of Panama|Panamanian culture]], a culture largely derived from the traditions of the [[Indigenous peoples of Panama|Indigenous people]] and the early [[Spanish people|Spanish]] settlers, along with other Europeans arriving later such as [[Italians]], with west [[Afro-Panamanian|African]] culture as another important component.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Panama}}
The culture of Panama derived from the cultures of [[Indigenous peoples of Panama]], [[European art|art]] and [[tradition]]s, as well as [[Culture of Africa|African Culture]] that were brought over by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] to [[Panama]]. [[Hegemonic]] forces have created [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] forms of this by blending [[Culture of Africa|African]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture with [[Culture of Europe|European culture]]. For example, the ''tamborito'' is a Spanish dance with that was blended with Native American rhythms and dance moves. Dance is a symbol of the diverse cultures that have coupled in [[Panama]].
The culture, customs, and language of the Panamanians are predominantly Caribbean and Spanish.

[[Afro-Panamanians]] played a significant role in the creation of the republic.  The descendants of the Africans who arrived during the colonial era are intermixed in the general population or live in small Afro-Panamanian communities along the Atlantic Coast and in villages within the Darién jungle. Most of the people in Darien are fishermen or small-scale farmers growing crops such as bananas, rice and coffee as well as raising livestock. Other Afro-Panamanians descend from later migrants from the Caribbean who came to work on railroad-construction projects, commercial agricultural enterprises, and (especially) the canal. Important Afro-Caribbean community areas include towns and cities such as [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], Cristobal and Balboa, in the former Canal Zone, as well as the Río Abajo area of Panama City. Another region with a large Afro-Caribbean population is the province of Bocas del Toro on the Caribbean coast just south of Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="minorityrights.org"&gt;

Most of the Panamanian population of West Indian descent owe their presence in the country to the monumental efforts to build the Panama Canal in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Three-quarters of the 50,000 workers who built the canal were Afro Caribbean migrants from the British West Indies. Thousands of Afro-Caribbean workers were recruited from Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad.&lt;ref name="minorityrights.org"/&gt;

Panama, partly owing to its historical reliance on commerce, is an ethnically diverse society. It has considerable populations of Afro-Antillean and [[overseas Chinese|Chinese origin]]. The first [[Ethnic Chinese in Panama|Chinese immigrated to Panama]] from southern China to help build the Panama Railroad in the 19th century. There followed several waves of immigrants whose descendants number around 50,000. Starting in the 1970s, a further 80,000 have immigrated from other parts of China as well.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Panama's Chinese community celebrates a birthday, meets new challenges|last=Jackson|first=Eric|volume=10|issue=9|date=May 2004|accessdate=November 7, 2007|url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_09/community_01.html|journal=The Panama News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916050839/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_09/community_01.html|archivedate=September 16, 2007|df=}}

==Languages==
Spanish is the official and dominant language. About 93% of the population speak Spanish as their first language, though many citizens speak both English and Spanish or native languages, such as [[Ngäbere]].
Many languages, including seven indigenous languages, are spoken in Panama, although Spanish is the official and dominant language. English is sometimes spoken by many professionals and those working in the business or governmental sectors of society.

The '''Reguibat''' ({{lang-ar|الرقيبات}}; variously transliterated ''Reguibate'', ''Rguibat'', ''R'gaybat'', ''R'gibat'', ''Erguibat'', ''Ergaybat'') is a nomad [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] [[tribe]] of [[Sanhaja]]-[[Berbers|Berber]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHowMbfP6RAC|title=Le conflit du Sahara occidental: Réédition d'un livre paru en 1982|last=Barbier|first=Maurice|date=2003-06-01|publisher=Editions L'Harmattan|year=|isbn=9782296278776|location=|pages=16–18|language=fr|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2CiHoQ1IsgC|title=Les populations du Sahara occidental: histoire, vie et culture|last=Gaudio|first=Attilio|date=|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|year=1993|isbn=9782865374113|location=|pages=36|language=fr|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C|title=The Peoples of Africa: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary|last=Olson|first=James Stuart|date=|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1996|isbn=9780313279188|location=|pages=494|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GK5IAAAAMAAJ|title=Sahara occidental: les enjeux d'un conflit régional|last=Mohsen-Finan|first=Khadija|date=|publisher=CNRS éditions|year=1997|isbn=9782271055149|location=|pages=17|language=fr|quote=......ainsi les Reguibat, qui sont berbères Sanhadja, sont principalement guerriers et accessoirement pasteurs......}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Reguibat speak [[Hassaniya]] [[Arabic Language|Arabic]], and are [[Arabized]] in culture.

{{Weasel|date=August 2011}}
{{Refimprove|date=August 2011}}
Initially an important Arabic [[zawiya (institution)|zawiya]] or religious tribe with a semi-sedentary lifestyle, the Reguibat gradually turned during the 18th century towards [[camel]]-rearing, raiding and [[nomadism]], in response attacks from neighbouring tribes which provoked them into taking up arms and leaving the subordinate position they had previously held. This started a process of rapid expansion, and set the Reguibat on the course towards total transformation into a traditional warrior tribe&lt;ref name=harv /&gt; In the late 19th century, they had become well-established as the largest Sahrawi tribe, and were recognized as the most powerful warrior tribe of the area.&lt;ref name=harv /&gt;

The grazing lands of the Reguibat fractions extended from [[Western Sahara]] into the northern half of [[Mauritania]], the edges of southern [[Morocco]] and northern [[Mali]], and large swaths of western [[Algeria]] (where they captured the town of [[Tindouf]] from the [[Tajakant]] tribe in 1895, and turned into an important Reguibat encampment).&lt;ref name=harv /&gt; The Reguibat were known for their skill as warriors, as well as for an uncompromising tribal independence, and dominated large areas of the [[Sahara desert]] through both [[trade]] and use of arms.&lt;ref name=harv /&gt;

Reguibat Sahrawis were very prominent in the resistance to [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization in the 19th and 20th century, and could not be subdued in the [[Spanish Sahara]] until 1934, almost 50 years after the area was first colonized by Spain.&lt;ref name=harv&gt;{{cite book|last=Trout|first=Frank E.|title=Morocco's Saharan Frontiers|date=1969|publisher=Librairie Droz|location=Geneva|isbn=978-2-600-04495-0|pages=225–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, many Reguibat have been active in the [[Polisario Front]]'s resistance to Moroccan rule over the still non-sovereign Western Sahara territory. Polisario leader [[Mohamed Abdelaziz (Sahrawi politician)|Mohamed Abdelaziz]] was Reguibi, as is the Moroccan [[CORCAS]] leader [[Khalihenna Ould Errachid]].

'''[[Russians]]''' are a small diaspora in [[France]] but one of the most important groups in the [[Russian diaspora]].

== History ==
The [[French Riviera]] was a favorite spot, where the European aristocracy had launched the fashion of the rainy season. Some also came there to treat tuberculosis which was then rampant. The Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Feodorovna]], wife of the late [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicolas I]] liked to stay there to rest since her widowhood. She raised money in 1856 to build a church for the parish. The {{Interlanguage link multi|Église Saint-Nicolas-et-Sainte-Alexandra|fr}} was consecrated on December 31, 1859 in the city of [[Nice]] who at that time had more than 45 000 inhabitants and was part with its [[County of Nice|County]] of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], belonging to the House of Savoy, before being annexed to the French Empire by plebiscite a few months later in April 1860. In December 1912, half a century later, the [[Russian Orthodox Cathedral, Nice|Russian Orthodox Cathedral]] would be consecrated in memory of [[Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsarevich of Russia]], who died in Nice. The building itself and the parcel of land on which it stands has been the property of the Russian state to this day.

===Russian Civil War===
On an approximate figure of 1.5 million exiles during the [[Russian Civil War]], about 400,000 have taken up residence in France. Political refugees, [[White émigré]] gather around charities like the [[Zemgor]] Committee and the company of the Russian Red Cross, the [[St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute]] (founded in 1924) and the [[:fr:Action chrétienne des étudiants russes|Action chrétienne des étudiants russes]] (ACER ) (1926), which provided to their community an associative link, political and religious, as well as material aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poutine réhabilite les Russes blancs|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2008/04/12/01006-20080412ARTFIG00023-poutine-rehabili-te-les-russes-blancs.php|accessdate=8 June 2016|agency=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a symbol of this massive immigration, 10,000 Russians are buried at [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]]

===Exodus of White Russians in Corsica===
{{main article|:fr:Exode des Russes blancs en Corse}}

The ship "Rion", carrying some 3422 refugees (Russians, Ukrainians and Cossacks) from Constantinople to Brazil has stopped in Ajaccio, on May 15, 1921 at 2 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bagni|first1=Bruno|title=Les Russes en Corse|journal=Études Corses|issue=49|publisher=ACSH, Archives départementales de la Haute-Corse|location=Bastia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajaccio, an island city of 20,000 inhabitants, sees in one day its population increase by 20%. On May 25, 10 days after the arrival of the ship, some 600 refugees were finally allowed to land and settle at the Livrelli barracks, located in the center of Ajaccio.

A '''stateless society''' is a [[society]] that is not [[government|governed]] by a [[state (polity)|state]], or, especially in common [[American English]], has no government.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; In stateless societies, there is little [[centralization|concentration]] of [[authority]]; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in [[political power|power]] and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Stephen |title= The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of an African Civil War |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2219-0 |page= 198 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fLAWMGqKMb4C&amp;pg=PA198 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Béteille |first= André |authorlink= André Béteille |chapter= Inequality and Equality |editor-last= Ingold |editor-first= Tim |title= Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-415-28604-6 |pages= 1042–1043 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hKzSc02tbaMC&amp;pg=PA1042 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a [[sovereign state]]. In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield [[failed state|little or no actual power]]. Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been [[cultural assimilation|integrated into the state-based societies around them]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Faulks |first= Keith |title= Political Sociology: A Critical Introduction |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2709-6 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_fjCczhvWj0C&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political philosophies, particularly [[anarchism]], consider the state an unwelcome institution and stateless societies the ideal.

==Prehistoric peoples==
In [[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]] and [[history]], a stateless society denotes a less complex human [[community]] without a state, such as a [[tribe]], a [[clan]], a [[band society]] or a [[chiefdom]]. The main criterion of "complexity" used is the extent to which a [[division of labor]] has occurred such that many people are permanently ''specialized'' in particular forms of production or other activity, and depend on others for goods and services through trade or sophisticated reciprocal obligations governed by [[Convention (norm)|custom]] and [[laws]]. An additional criterion is [[population size]]. The bigger the population, the more relationships have to be reckoned with.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Evidence of the earliest known city-states has been found in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] around 3700 BC, suggesting that the history of the state is less than 6,000 years old; thus, for most of human [[prehistory]] the state did not exist.

{{Quotation|For 99.8 percent of human history people lived exclusively in autonomous bands and villages. At the beginning of the Paleolithic [i.e. the stone age], the number of these autonomous political units must have been small, but by 1000 BC it had increased to some 600,000. Then supra-village aggregation began in earnest, and in barely three millennia the autonomous political units of the world dropped from 600,000 to 157.|Robert L.

Generally speaking, the archaeological evidence suggests that the state emerged from stateless communities only when a fairly large population (at least tens of thousands of people) was more or less settled together in a particular territory, and practiced [[agriculture]]. Indeed, one of the typical functions of the state is the defense of territory. Nevertheless, there are exceptions: [[Lawrence Krader]] for example describes the case of the Tatar state, a political authority arising among confederations of clans of nomadic or semi-nomadic herdsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Krader |title= Formation of the State |location= Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher= Prentice-Hallm |year= 1968 |at= ch. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristically the state functionaries (royal dynasties, soldiers, scribes, servants, administrators, lawyers, tax collectors, religious authorities etc.) are mainly not self-supporting, but rather materially supported and financed by taxes and tributes contributed by the rest of the working population. This assumes a sufficient level of labor-productivity [[per capita]] which at least makes possible a ''permanent'' [[surplus product]] (principally foodstuffs) appropriated by the state authority to sustain the activities of state functionaries. Such permanent surpluses were generally not produced on a significant scale in smaller tribal or clan societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Henri J.M. |editor1-last= Claessen |editor2-first= Peter |editor2-last= Skalnik |lastauthoramp= yes |url= https://books.google.com/?id=sMoLhNQ9KRoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Henri+J.M.+Claessen#v=onepage&amp;q=Henri%20J.M.%20Claessen&amp;f=false |title= The Early State |location= The Hague |publisher= Mouton |year= 1978 |via= Google Books|isbn= 9789027979049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist [[Gregory Possehl]] has argued that there is no evidence that the relatively sophisticated, urbanized [[Harappan civilization]], which flourished from about 2,500 to 1,900 BC in the [[Indus]] region, featured anything like a centralized state apparatus. No evidence has yet been excavated locally of palaces, temples, a ruling sovereign or royal graves, a centralized administrative bureaucracy keeping records, or a state religion—all of which are elsewhere usually associated with the existence of a state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Gregory L. |last= Possehl |chapter= Sociocultural Complexity Without the State: The Indus civilization |editor1-first= Gary M. |editor1-last= Feinman |editor2-first= Joyce |editor2-last= Marcus |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Archaic States |location= Santa Fe |publisher= School of American Research Press |year= 1998 |pages= 261–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the earliest large-scale human settlements of the [[stone age]] which have been discovered, such as [[Çatal Höyük]] and [[Jericho]], no evidence was found of the existence of a state authority. The Çatal Höyük settlement of a farming community (7,300 BC to circa 6,200 BC) spanned circa 13 hectares (32 acres) and probably had about 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Chris |editor-last= Scarre |title= The Human Past |edition= 2nd |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson |year= 2009 |page= 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern state-based societies regularly pushed out stateless indigenous populations as their settlements expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Richards |first=  John F. |title= The Unending Frontier: An Environmental History of the Early Modern World |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-520-24678-2 |pages= 4–5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=i85noYD9C0EC&amp;pg=PA4 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uncontacted peoples]] may be considered remnants of prehistoric stateless societies. To varying extents they may be unaware of and unaffected by the states that have nominal authority over their territory.

==As a political ideal==
Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved.

A central tenet of [[anarchism]] is the advocacy of society without states.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year= 2005 |page= 14 |quote= Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sheehan |first= Sean |title= Anarchism |location= London |publisher= Reaktion Books |year= 2004 |page= 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of society sought for varies significantly between [[anarchist schools of thought]], ranging from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin&gt;{{cite book |last= Slevin |first= Carl |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics |editor1-first= Iain |editor1-last= McLean |editor2-first= Alistair |editor2-last= McMillan |lastauthoramp= yes |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marxism]], [[Marx's theory of the state]] considers that in a [[post-capitalist]] society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and [[Withering away of the state|wither away]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm |first= Frederick |last= Engels |title= Socialism: Utopian and Scientific |year= 1880 |chapter= Part III: Historical Materialism |quote= State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The State is not "abolished". It dies out...Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master—free. |via= Marx/Engels Internet Archive (marxists.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is that of [[stateless communism]], a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society.

==Social and economic organization==
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] have found that [[social stratification]] is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy writes, "Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal, that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gowdy |first= John |year= 2006 |chapter= Hunter-Gatherers and the Mythology of the Market |editor1-link= Richard Borshay Lee |editor1-first= Richard B. |editor1-last= Lee |editor2-first= Richard H. |editor2-last= Daly |lastauthoramp= yes |title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers |page= 391 |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-60919-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economies of stateless agricultural societies tend to focus and organize [[subsistence agriculture]] at the community level, and tend to diversify their production rather than specializing in a particular crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Chase |first1= Diane Z. |last2= Chase |first2= Arlen F. |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Mesoamerican Elites: An Archaeological Assessment |publisher= University of Oklahoma Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-8061-3542-7 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kwxl5jjQ-dUC&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many stateless societies, conflicts between families or individuals are resolved by appealing to the community. Each of the sides of the dispute will voice their concerns, and the community, often voicing its will through village elders, will reach a judgment on the situation. Even when there is no legal or coercive authority to enforce these community decisions, people tend to adhere to them, due to a desire to be held in esteem by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fleming, Thomas|title=The Politics of Human Nature|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1993|isbn=978-1-56000-693-0|pages=165–166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saK1sFtSXuEC&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia''' ({{lang-sr|Републички завод за статистику Србије}}) is a specialized, professional organization within the public administration of the [[Serbia|Republic of Serbia]].

==History==
[[Official statistics]] in the Republic of Serbia was established in 1862, when Prince [[Mihailo Obrenovic]] passed an act granting powers to the economic department of the Ministry of Finance concerning all statistical work. This was the beginning of state statistics in Serbia, but historic data suggest there was even earlier collecting of statistical data on tax payers, census of the cattle (in 1824) and regular population censuses (from 1834), as well as, since 1843, regular monitoring of statistical data on external trade, domestic trade, prices and wages. 
Statistical work was performed even before the foundation of the National Statistical Office through participation of Serbian representatives at international congresses of statisticians held in the Hague in 1859, in Berlin in 1863 and in Florence in 1867. 
The Law on the Organization of Statistics was enacted in 1881 and in 1882 the Ministry of National Economy assumed responsibility regarding national statistics.
State Statistics of Serbia has been a member of the [[International Statistical Institute]] since its foundation in 1885. 
The State Statistics Directorate was founded in 1919 in the scope of the Ministry of Social Policy of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], but a separate Statistical Office of Serbia was opened only in 1945.
Regarding the publishing activity, the first State Statistics of Serbia was published in 1863 and the first results of Population Census in 1863. The first Statistical Yearbook of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] was published in 1893 and in 1894 the State Statistics was published for the last time. The last Statistical Yearbook of the Kingdom of Serbia was published in 1910. In 1954 a special edition of the Statistical Yearbook of Serbia was re-published, as a complex statistical publication that encompassed the results of versatile statistical surveys. 
The Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia was founded in 1945.
In the period 1945-2006 the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia was inferior to the Federal Statistical Office regarding the process of conducting unique programs of statistical surveys and methodologies. Simultaneously, the Office has been completely independent regarding financial and human resources and other issues.

The Tomal have been one of the low status castes or outcasts among the [[Somalis]], along with [[Midgan]] and others. They have historically faced discrimination, restrictions, harassment and prejudice from other social strata of the Somali people.&lt;ref name="Levine2014p62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TaroneBigelow2013p74"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elaine Tarone|author2=Martha Bigelow|author3=Kit Hansen|title=Oxford Applied Linguistics: Literacy and Second Language Oracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvSdBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT74|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-442313-7|pages=55, 73–74 with footnote 5}}, Quote: "In addition to the Bantus, there are Somali clans considered to be of low caste and treated as outcasts.

==Discussion==
According to the folklore tradition of the Somali people, Tomal and other low castes arose from unholy origins.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed A. Eno and Abdi M. Kusow (2014), ''Racial and Caste Prejudice in Somalia'', Journal of Somali Studies, Iowa State University Press, Volume 1, Issue 2, pages 91, 96, 108-112&lt;/ref&gt; They were historically smiths who worked various metals,&lt;ref name="Levine2014p195"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald N. Levine|title=Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZHeBQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22967-6|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some also were leather workers (producing and processing animal skin).&lt;ref name="Bridges2000p95"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Bridges|title=Safirka: An American Envoy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vaDkDZmrZmYC&amp;pg=PA95|year=2000|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=978-0-87338-658-6|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be, states Peter Bridges, pre-Somali Bushmen-like natives who lived in these lands.&lt;ref name="Bridges2000p95"/&gt; They are one of a castes within the ''Sab'' lineage among the Somali, but they are not the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]-related slave strata of the Somali people.&lt;ref name="Thompson2015p32"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Bakpetu Thompson|title=Conflict in the Horn of Africa: The Kenya-Somalia Border Problem 1941–2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxWMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|year=2015|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-6526-1|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Francis Burton]], the colonial era Somali ethnographer describing his observations in the northern Somali country, the Tomal were also known as ''Handad'' probably a corruption of ''Haddad'' which in Arabic means "ironworkers". They were considered vile because they had intermarried with the servile group within the Somali society, and their work with metal and fire was presumed to make them following the path of [[David]] {{clarification needed|date=October 2018}} and close to witchcraft. These people, states Burton, were also found and reviled in [[Yemen|Al-Yaman]].&lt;ref name="Burton2014p24"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard F. Burton|title=First Footsteps in East Africa; Or, an Exploration of Harar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHnCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |year=2014| authorlink = Richard Francis Burton| publisher=Courier|isbn=978-0-486-78954-5|page=24 with footnote 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholarship, such as by Heather Marie Akou – a professor of History specializing in Near East Cultures, states that per mythical narrative Tomals had intermarried with [[Midgan]]s, and have been the talented descendants of nomads in the Horn of Africa.&lt;ref name="Akou2011p22"/&gt; The Tomal caste has been notable for their everyday dress, where they traditionally carry a hand crafted long spear called ''waran'' as walking stick, and a hidden dagger called ''bilawi'' in a leather belt.&lt;ref name="Akou2011p22"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather Marie Akou|title=The Politics of Dress in Somali Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Eg-b6EQt-cC&amp;pg=PA22 |year=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn= 978-0-253-22313-5|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Teshale Tibebu – a professor of History specializing on Ethiopia and Horn of Africa, the Tomal along with [[Midgan|Mijan]] and [[Yibir]] castes have traditionally been considered as ritually impure using Islamic rationalization, and other caste members of the Somali society would never marry a member of the Tomal, Mijan and Yibir castes.&lt;ref name="Tibebu1995p198"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teshale Tibebu|title=The Making of Modern Ethiopia: 1896-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeD4gruvuNEC&amp;pg=PA198 |year=1995|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-1-56902-001-2|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidental reports of prejudicial comments against the Tomal by other Somali people, in contemporary society include they being called ''"nasab-dhiman"'', or "ignoble outcast".&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed A. Eno and Abdi M. Kusow (2014), ''Racial and Caste Prejudice in Somalia'', Journal of Somali Studies, Iowa State University Press, Volume 1, Issue 2, page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognate castes in Horn of Africa==
The Tomal caste is not an exception limited to the Somali ethnic group, and equivalent cognate caste is found in numerous ethnic groups in [[Horn of Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. According to [[Donald N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4702">The '''Valle Trita''' was a remote area lying beneath the highest peak in the [[Apennine Mountains|Central Apennines]]. It was mainly [[forest]] and [[pasture]]land, classified as a ''gualdus'' during the [[Lombards|Lombard period]].{{sfn|Wickham|2005|pp=583–85}} It is famous for the long dispute between its inhabitants and the monastery of [[San Vincenzo al Volturno]] in the early [[Middle Ages]].

The Valle Trita belonged to the [[royal fisc]] until about 758, when King [[Desiderius]] granted it to San Vincenzo about 100 kilometres away. The monastery began collecting as rents the dues (or taxes) formerly owed to the crown.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|pp=583–85}} The monks built up an estate in the valley and claimed that the peasants were [[slaves]] who did not own the land but owed service to the monastery for their right to it.{{sfn|Wickham|1981|pp=110–11}} The peasants claimed that they were free, and could produce precepts (''precepta'') of the [[Dukes of Spoleto]], the highest local Lombard official, to that effect.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|pp=583–85}}

In 779, after the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingians]] had replaced the Lombards, the monastery brought the peasants to court to enforce their obedience. It won, but the peasants did not accept the verdict.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|pp=583–85}} In 787, Abbot Paul brought a petition to King [[Charlemagne]], who confirmed Desiderius' grant of Trita to the monastery.{{sfn|Balzaretti|1999|p=392|ps=. For the diploma, cf. E. Mühlbacher, ed., ''Diplomata Karolinorum'' I, [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica|MGH]] (Berlin, 1906), [http://www.mgh.de/dmgh/resolving/MGH_DD_Kar._1_S._216 doc. 159], which calls the place ''villam Trite sitam'', a village at the place of Trita.}} The peasants were taken to court again that year and in 822, 823, 824, 854, 872 and 873: a total of eight court cases for which records survive in the [[cartulary]] of the monastery.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|p=583 n. 125. The cartulary is preserved in the house chronicle, the ''[[Chronicon Vulturnense]]''}} The records also indicate a ninth court challenge, for which the proceedings have not survived, took place. San Vincenzo won every trial, but was unable to consistently enforce the rulings in the remote area.{{sfn|Wickham|1981|pp=110–11}} After the 854 ruling it had some success in forcing ''[[corvée]]'' from the peasants, who worked twelve weeks a year for the monastery.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|p=296 and n. 79}} In January 873, when the peasants refused to attend court, the army of the [[Emperor Louis II]], which was in the area, rounded them up and brought them to trial. The cold weather had prevented the peasants from taking to higher ground.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|pp=583–85}}

In 881 San Vincenzo was sacked by [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Muslim raiders]] and lost control over most of its estates for decades. The Valle Trita is not recorded again in the monastic cartulary until 998. [[Chris Wickham]] concludes that in all of Europe only at Trita did peasants successfully resist intrusive lordship for a long period before 900.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|pp=583–85}} Nevertheless, the peasant resistance of Trita may be only the best chronicled of many cases of remote pastoral communities with a history of independence resisting [[feudalisation]] in central Italy.{{sfn|Wickham|2005|p=588}} More rare, but better recorded were the wide-ranging and violent revolts of the lower classes, such as the contemporary Saxon ''[[Stellinga]]'' in 841–42.

[[Whittaker Chambers]] identified him to the [[FBI]]. Sveshchnikov reported to Soviet [[Agent handler]] Boris Bykov. When interviewed by the FBI, De Sveshnikov said he was first approached by Soviet intelligence in the mid-1920s, and from 1931 to 1938/39, he allegedly furnished Soviet intelligence with industrial and military patents as well as military journals and received regular payments in return.

In the ''Gorsky Memo'', V.V. Sveshchnikov is identified by the code name "Rupert".

[[File:Vasnetsov Tatary Idut.jpg|thumb|Warriors of the [[Golden Horde]] raid upon Moscow.]]

The '''Volga Tatars''' are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ethnic group native to the [[Volga-Ural region]] of [[Russia]].  They are in turn subdivided into various subgroups.  Volga Tatars are Russia's second-largest ethnicity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpretermag.com/kazan-tatars-see-no-future-for-themselves-in-putins-russia/ |title=Kazan Tatars See No Future for Themselves in Putin’s Russia |publisher=The Interpreter |date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; composing 53% of the population of [[Tatarstan]] and 25% of the population of [[Bashkortostan]].

==Volga Tatar history==
{{further|Tartary|Tatarstan}}
Tatars inhabiting the Republic of Tatarstan, a federal subject of Russia, constitute one third of all Tatars, while the other two thirds reside outside Tatarstan. The formation of some of the communities residing outside Tatarstan took place before the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 due to Tatars being specialized in trading.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~turkish/aatt/tatar.htm |title=TATAR. THE LANGUAGE OF THE LARGEST MINORITY IN RUSSIA |publisher=Princeton University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213002624/http://www.princeton.edu/~turkish/aatt/tatar.htm |archivedate=2006-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of ethnonym "Tatar" is disputed, with two theses trying to explain its origins. Mongol thesis, according to which etymology can be traced back to the Chinese "Ta-Tan" or "Da-Dan", is more widely accepted than Turkic one.&lt;ref name="rorlich"/&gt; Ethnonym "Tatar" first emerged in the fifth century CE/AD.&lt;ref name="brittanica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Tatar |title=Tatar |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14th century saw the spread of [[Sunni Islam]] among the Tatars.&lt;ref name="brittanica"/&gt; Tatars became subjects of Russia after the [[Siege of Kazan]] in 1552.&lt;ref name="gorenburg"/&gt; Since Russians linked Tatars with the Mongol [[Golden Horde]] (that ruled Russia in the 13th century), they began to negatively stereotype the Tatar people. Due to these negative stereotypes, some of which persist in modern Russian society, recently some Tatar intellectuals have been trying to link Tatar heritage with the historic [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] population of today's Tatarstan. Russians were using the Tatar ethnonym during the 18th and 19th centuries to denote all Turkic inhabitants of the Russian Empire,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Tatars |volume=26 |pages=448–449 |first=Peter |last=Kropotkin |authorlink=Peter Kropotkin |first2=Charles |last2=Eliot |author2link=Charles Eliot (diplomat)}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the Turkic peoples of the Russian Empire before the emergence of the Soviet Union did not usually self-identify as Tatars.&lt;ref name="gorenburg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no7_ses/chapter04.pdf |title=TATARS AS MESO-NATION |author=DMITRY GORENBURG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the end of the 19th century, Volga Tatars mainly identified themselves as Muslims until the rehabilitation of the ethnonym Tatar occurred.&lt;ref name="rorlich"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groznijat.tripod.com/fadlan/rorlich1.html |title=1. The Origins of the Volga Tatars |author=Azade-Ayshe Rorlich |publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian officials used literary Tatar language to interact with the [[Turkic peoples]] of the [[Russian Empire]] before the end of the 19th century. Volga Tatar role in the Muslim national and cultural movements of the Russian Empire before the 1917 Revolution is significant and this situation continued even after 1917.&lt;ref name="princeton"/&gt; Tatar authorities attempted in the 1990s to reverse the [[Russification]] of Tatarstan that took place during the Soviet period.&lt;ref name="gorenburg"/&gt;

===Bulgarism===
"Bulgarism" is a term for the position that the Volga Tatars are significantly descended from the [[Volga Bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~Groznijat/fadlan/rorlich1.html|title=A. Rorlich - Origin of the Volga Tatars|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], article on ''Tatarstan''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Aleksandrovich Shnirelʹman, Who gets the past?: competition for ancestors among non-Russian intellectuals in Russia, Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8018-5221-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5221-3}}. Limited preview at Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwHp8amsdEC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] (Chapter ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwHp8amsdEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Rivalry%20for%20the%20Bulgar%20Legacy&amp;f=false The Rivalry for the Bulgar Legacy]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volga Tatar subgroups==
===Kazan Tatars===
The majority of Volga Tatars are Kazan Tatars. They form the bulk of the Tatar population of Tatarstan. Traditionally, they inhabit the left bank of [[Volga river]].&lt;ref&gt;Татары (Серия «Народы и культуры» РАН). М.: Наука, 2001. — P.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Khazar]] invasions forced Bulgars, Turkic people, to migrate from the [[Azov]] steppes to the Middle Volga and lower [[Kama River|Kama]] region during the first half of the eighth century.&lt;ref name="rorlich"/&gt; In the period of 10th–13th centuries, Turkic peoples, including Kipchaks, migrated from southern [[Siberia]] to Europe. They played a significant role in the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']] in the 13th century. Tatar ethnogenesis took place after Turkic peoples, who were mixed with the Bulgars and other local inhabitants of the Volga River area, kept Kipchak dialect and became Muslims. Several new Tatar states had emerged by the 1500s after the Golden Horde fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CquTz6ps5YgC |title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires |editor=James S. Olson |year=1994 |pages=624–625}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states were [[Khanate of Kazan]], [[Astrakhan Khanate]], [[Khanate of Sibir]] and [[Crimean Khanate]].&lt;ref name="brittanica"/&gt;

Controversy surrounds the origin of the Tatar people, whether they are descended either from Bulgars or Golden Horde.&lt;ref name="princeton"/&gt; According to one theory, [[Kazan]] Tatar heritage can be traced back to Kipchaks of the Golden Horde, yet according to another theory, the Tatars emerged from the Bulgar culture which had survived the Mongol conquest of 1236–1237.&lt;ref name="rorlich"/&gt;

===Mishars===
[[Mishars]] (or Mişär-Tatars)  are an ethnographic group of Volga Tatars speaking [[Mishar Tatar dialect|Mishar]] dialect of the [[Tatar language]]. They comprise approximately one third of the Volga Tatar population. They are descendants of Cuman-Kipchak tribes who mixed with the [[Burtas]] in the Middle [[Oka River]] area and Meschiora. Nowadays, they live in [[Chelyabinsk Oblast|Chelyabinsk]], [[Ulyanovsk Oblast|Ulyanovsk]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhegorodskaya]] oblasts of Russia and in Tatarstan, [[Bashkortostan]] and [[Mordovia]].

===Qasím Tatars===
The Qasím Tatars have their capital in the town of Qasím ([[Kasimov]] in Russian transcription) in [[Ryazan Oblast]]. See "[[Qasim Khanate]]" for their history. Today, there are 1,100 Qasím Tatars living in Kasimov. There is no reliable information about their number elsewhere.

===Noqrat Tatars===
Noqrat Tatars live in Russia's Republic of [[Udmurtia]] and [[Kirov Oblast]]. In 1920s their number was around 15,000 people.

===Perm (Ostyak) Tatars===
Ethnographic subgroup of Kazan Tatars that lives in Russia's [[Perm Krai]]. Some Tatar scholars (as Zakiev) name them ''[[Ostyak]] Tatars''. Their number is (2002) c.130,000 people.

===Keräşens===
{{main|Kryashens}}
[[File:Korovin kazan.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan the Terrible]] subjugated the [[Tatar]]s and forcibly converted many of them to [[Christianity]].]]

A policy of Christianization of the Muslim Tatars was enacted by the Russian authorities, beginning in 1552, resulting in the emergence of Keräşens (Christianized Tatars).{{sfn|Brower|2001|p=271}}

Many Volga Tatars were forcibly Christianized by [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] during the 16th century, and later, during the 18th century.

Some scientists suppose that the [[Sabir people|Suars]] were ancestors of the Keräşen Tatars, and had been converted to Christianity by [[Armenians]] in the 6th century while they lived in the [[Caucasus]]. Suars, like other tribes which later converted to Islam, became Volga Bulgars, and later the modern [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] (who are Orthodox Christians) and Kazan Tatars (who are [[Muslims]]).

Keräşen Tatars live in much of the Volga-Ural area.  Today, they tend to be assimilated among the Chuvash and Tatars.  Eighty years of [[Atheism|Atheistic]] Soviet rule made Tatars of both faiths not as religious as they once were. Russian names are largely the only remaining difference between Tatars and Keräşen Tatars.

Some Cuman tribes in the Golden Horde were converted to Christianity in the 13th and 14th centuries ([[Nestorianism]]).  Some prayers, written during that time in the ''[[Codex Cumanicus]]'', sound like modern Keräşen prayers, but the connection between Christian Cumans and modern Keräşens is unknown.

==1921–22 famine in Tatarstan==
{{main|1921–22 famine in Tatarstan}}
The 1921–1922 famine in Tatarstan was a period of mass starvation and drought that took place in the [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tatar ASSR]] as a result of [[war communism]] policy,{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression|date=October 1999|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H1jsgYCoRioC|last1=Werth|last2=Panné|last3=Paczkowski|last4=Bartosek|last5=Margolin|first1=Nicolas|first2=Jean-Louis|first3=Andrzej|first4=Karel|first5=Jean-Louis|author1-link=Nicolas Werth|author3-link=Andrzej Paczkowski|pages=92–97; 116–21|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|editor-last=Courtois|editor-first=Stéphane|editor-link=Stéphane Courtois|isbn=978-0-674-07608-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which 500,000{{sfn|Dronin|Bellinger|2005|p=98}} to 2,000,000{{sfn|Mizelle|2002|p=281}} peasants died.

==Population figures==
In the 1910s, they numbered about half a million in the area of [[Kazan]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Nearly 2 million Volga Tatars died in the [[1921–22 famine in Tatarstan]]. Some 15,000 belonging to the same stem had either migrated to [[Ryazan]] in the center of Russia (what is now European Russia) or had been settled as prisoners during the 16th and 17th centuries in [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; ([[Vilnius]], [[Hrodna|Grodno]], and [[Podolia]]). Some 2,000 resided in [[St. Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]].
Volga-Ural Tatars number nearly 7 million, mostly in Russia and the republics of the former [[Soviet Union]]. While the bulk of the population is found in Tatarstan (around 2 million) and neighbouring regions, significant number of Volga-Ural Tatars live in [[Siberia]], Central Asia, and the Caucasus.  Outside of Tatarstan, urban Tatars usually speak [[Russian language|Russian]] as their first language (in cities such as [[Moscow]], [[Saint-Petersburg]], [[Nizhniy Novgorod]], [[Ufa]], and cities of the [[Ural (region)|Ural]] and Siberia).
