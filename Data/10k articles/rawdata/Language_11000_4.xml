      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7930">An '''accreditation mill''' is an organization that purports to award [[educational accreditation]] to higher education institutions without having government authority or recognition from mainstream [[academia]] to operate as an accreditor. Implicit in the terminology is the assumption that the "mill" has low standards (or no standards) for such accreditation. Accreditation mills are much like [[diploma mill]]s, and in many cases are closely associated with diploma mills. The "accreditation" they supply has no legal or academic value, but is used in diploma mill marketing to help attract students.&lt;ref name=Lantero&gt;Luca Lantero, [http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf Degree Mills: non-accredited and irregular higher education institutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513185433/http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf |date=2015-05-13 }}, [[Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence|Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence (CIMEA)]], Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some institutions obtain accreditation from an independent group with low standards. In other cases, the institution sets up its own seemingly independent accreditation board and then accredits itself.&lt;ref name="CapTimes"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050312020754/http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/index.php?ntid=28423&amp;ntpid=3  Diploma mills provide phony credentials], By Helena Andrews, ''[[The Capital Times]]''/[[Medill News Service]], February 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This gives the appearance that an outside group has approved the education that is offered at the school.

In many countries, accreditation is a government function. In the United States, governments normally do not accredit academic institutions, but federal education authorities recognize about 18 private accrediting organizations for institutional accreditation of [[higher education]] institutions&lt;ref name="CapTimes" /&gt; and more than 60 other private organizations for accreditation of specific educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/CHEA_USDE_AllAccred.pdf Recognized Accrediting Organizations (as of August 2010)], CHEA website, accessed November 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  While standards vary from organization to organization, without recognition from the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) (a [[non-governmental organization]]) or the [[United States Department of Education]], the claims made by independent groups hold no value in the academic community.

==Characteristics==
CHEA has published a list of attributes of accreditation mills to help consumers identify them. According to CHEA, an accreditation operation might be a "mill" if it:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/degreemills/ Important Questions About Accreditation, Degree Mills and Accreditation Mills (April 2005)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823213902/http://www.chea.org/degreemills/ |date=2010-08-23 }}, CHEA website, accessed November 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Allows accreditation to be purchased
*Allows institutions to attain accredited status in a very short period of time
*Does not conduct site visits or interviews of key personnel as part of its accreditation process, instead reviewing institutions solely on the basis of submitted documents
*Grants “permanent” accreditation, with no requirement for later periodic review
*Claims recognition from an authority such as CHEA without appearing on lists of accreditors recognized by that authority
*Has a name that is very similar to the name of a [[List of recognized higher education accreditation organizations|recognized accrediting organization]]
*Publishes a list of institutions or programs that it has accredited without the knowledge of the listed institutions and programs
*Publishes few or no standards for quality
*Publishes claims for which there is no evidence.
Verifile's [[Accredibase]] notes that some accreditation mills do not reveal their locations, which makes it difficult to determine whether they are legitimate. Some other mills have been found to use the same [[address (geography)|address]]es as the education providers that claim accreditation from them.&lt;ref&gt;Eyal Ben Cohen and Rachel Winch (Verifile Ltd.), [http://www.international.ac.uk/resources/Diploma%20and%20Accreditation%20Mills.pdf Diploma and accreditation mills: Exposing academic credential abuse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315042332/http://www.international.ac.uk/resources/Diploma%20and%20Accreditation%20Mills.pdf |date=March 15, 2012 }}, 20 January 2010. Retrieved from UK Higher Education International Unit website, November 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer information resources==
To help consumers avoid diploma mills and accreditation mills, several national and international bodies publish lists of recognized accreditors and accredited educational institutions, as well as accreditors that are known to lack the necessary legal authority or recognition, and higher education providers known to lack accreditation.&lt;ref name=Lantero/&gt;  The United States organization CHEA maintains an international directory of education ministries and other recognized higher education [[quality assurance]] bodies worldwide. The 2007 version of that directory lists 467 recognized bodies in 175 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/intdb/international_directory.asp CHEA International Directory introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420041706/http://chea.org/intdb/international_directory.asp |date=2011-04-20 }}, accessed November 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed U.S. legal definition==
A proposal for legislation that was announced in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in January 2010 would have inserted a definition of "accreditation mill" into U.S. law. The proposal, sponsored by Congressmen [[Timothy Bishop]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Michael Castle]] of [[Delaware]], would have defined the term to mean "an education or corporate organization that offers a form of educational recognition or accreditation, for a fee or free of charge, that extend[s] a permanent recognition or accreditation status to an institution with few or no requirements for subsequent periodic reviews; (B) publish[es] a list of institutions and programs recognized or accredited by such organization that includes institutions and programs that did not apply for or otherwise request such recognition or accreditation by the organization; or (C) lack[s] national recognition by the Secretary of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/01/29/mills&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chea.org/pdf/Diploma%20Mill%20Final%20Draft.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714004641/http://www.chea.org/pdf/Diploma%20Mill%20Final%20Draft.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antillean Creole''' is a [[French-based creole languages|French-based creole]], which is primarily spoken in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Its grammar and vocabulary include elements of [[Carib language|Carib]] and [[African languages]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Antillean Creole is related to [[Haitian Creole]] but has a number of distinctive features; however, they are mutually intelligible. The language was formerly more widely spoken in the [[Lesser Antilles]], but its number of speakers is declining in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Grenada]]. While the islands of [[Dominica]] and [[Saint Lucia]] are officially English-speaking, there are efforts to preserve the use of Antillean Creole, as well as in Trinidad and Tobago and its neighbour, [[Venezuela]]. In recent decades, Creole has gone from being seen as a sign of lower socio-economic status, banned in school playgrounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zouk: world music in the West Indies |last=Guilbault |first=Jocelyne |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31041-1 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0lrjteCl2IC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22Henri+Guedon%22&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Henri%20Guedon%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a mark of national pride.

Since the 1970s, there has been a literary revival of Creole in the French-speaking islands of the Lesser Antilles, with writers such as [[Raphaël Confiant]] and [[Monchoachi]] employing the language. [[Edouard Glissant]] has written theoretically and poetically about its significance and its history.

Antillean Creole is spoken natively, to varying degrees, in [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Îles des Saintes]], [[Martinique]], [[Saint-Barthélemy]] (St. Barts), [[Saint Lucia]], [[French Guiana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Venezuela]] (mainly in [[Macuro]], [[Güiria]] and [[El Callao Municipality]]). Dominican, Grenadian, St. Lucian, Trinidadian, Brazilian ([[Lanc-Patuá]]) and Venezuelan speakers of Antillean Creole call the language ''[[patois]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=DM Languages of Dominica]. ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World'', SIL International, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also spoken in various Creole-speaking immigrant communities in the [[United States Virgin Islands]], [[British Virgin Islands]], and the island of [[Saint Martin]].

Antillean Creole has approximately 1 million speakers and is a means of communication for migrant populations traveling between neighbouring English- and French-speaking territories.

==History==
[[Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc]] was a French trader and adventurer in the [[Caribbean]] who established the first permanent French colony, [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|Saint-Pierre]], on the island of [[Martinique]] in 1635. Belain sailed to the Caribbean in 1625, hoping to establish a French settlement on the island of [[Basseterre|St. Christopher]] (St. Kitts). In 1626, he returned to [[France]], where he won the support of [[Cardinal Richelieu]] to establish French colonies in the region. Richelieu became a shareholder in the [[Compagnie de Saint-Christophe]], created to accomplish that with d'Esnambuc at its head. The company was not particularly successful, and Richelieu had it reorganised as the Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique. In 1635, d'Esnambuc sailed to Martinique with 100 French settlers to clear land for [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s.

After six months on Martinique, d'Esnambuc returned to [[St. Kitts|St. Christopher]], where he soon died prematurely in 1636, leaving the company and Martinique in the hands of his nephew, Du Parquet. His nephew, [[Jacques Dyel du Parquet]], inherited d'Esnambuc's authority over the French settlements in the Caribbean. Dyel du Parquet became governor of the island. He remained in Martinique and did not concern himself with the other islands.

The French permanently settled on Martinique and Guadeloupe after being driven off [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] (''Saint-Christophe'' in [[French (language)|French]]) by the British. [[Fort Royal]] (now Fort-de-France) on Martinique was a major port for French battle ships in the region from which the French were able to explore the region. In 1638, Dyel du Parquet decided to have [[Fort Saint Louis (Martinique)|Fort Saint Louis]] built to protect the city against enemy attacks. From Fort Royal, Martinique, Du Parquet proceeded south in search for new territories, established the first settlement in [[Saint Lucia]] in 1643 and headed an expedition that established a French settlement in [[Grenada]] in 1649.

Despite the long history of British rule, Grenada's French heritage is still evident by the number of French [[loanwords]] in [[Grenadian Creole]] and the French-style buildings, cuisine and placenames ([[Petit Martinique]], [[Martinique Channel]], etc.)

In 1642, the [[Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique]] received a 20-year extension of its charter. The king would name the governor general of the company, and the company would name the governors of the various islands. However, by the late 1640s, [[Cardinal Mazarin]] had little interest in colonial affairs, and the company languished. In 1651, it dissolved itself, selling its exploitation rights to various parties. The Du Paquet family bought Martinique, Grenada and Saint Lucia for 60,000 livres. The sieur d'[[Charles Houël du Petit Pré|Houël]] bought [[Guadeloupe]], [[Marie-Galante]], [[La Desirade]] and the [[Îles des Saintes|Saintes]]. The [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] bought [[Saint Barthélemy]] and [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]], which were made [[dependencies of Guadeloupe]].

In 1665, the Knights sold the islands that they had acquired to the [[French West India Company|Compagnie des Indes occidentales]], formed one year earlier.

[[Dominica]] is a former French and British colony in the [[Eastern Caribbean]], about halfway between the French islands of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique (to the south). [[Christopher Columbus]] named the island after the day of the week on which he spotted it, a Sunday (''dies Dominica'' in Latin), on 3 November 1493. In the 100 years after Columbus's landing, Dominica remained isolated. At the time, it was inhabited by the [[Island Caribs]], or Kalinago people. Over time, more settled there after they had been driven from surrounding islands, as European powers entered the region.

In 1690, French woodcutters from Martinique and Guadeloupe begin to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood and gradually become permanent settlers. France had a colony for several years and imported slaves from [[West Africa]], Martinique and Guadeloupe to work on its plantations. The Antillean Creole language developed.

France formally ceded possession of Dominica to Great Britain in 1763. The latter established a small colony on the island in 1805. As a result, Dominica uses [[English language|English]] as an official language, but Antillean Creole is still spoken as a secondary language because of Dominica's location between the French-speaking departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique.

In [[Trinidad]], the Spanish possessed the island but contributed little towards advancements, with [[El Dorado]] being their focus. Trinidad was perfect for its geographical location. Because Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada, was able to obtain a Cédula de Población from [[King Charles III of Spain]] on 4 November 1783.

Trinidad's population jumped to over 15,000 by the end of 1789, from just under 1,400 in 1777. In 1797, Trinidad became a British crown colony, despite its French-speaking population.

===Origin of creole===
In the slavery era, Africans were assigned to the slavery plantations in the [[French Antilles]]. The French of their slave masters and their native tongues were somewhat useless as a method of communication since they spoke different languages. As a result, they were forced to develop a new form of communication by relying on what they heard from their colonial masters and other slaves.

Sporadically, they would use words they thought they heard their colonial masters speak and combine them with their African expressions and sentence structure. Thus, new words were fashioned and given
meaning.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Gradually, the new method of communication among the slaves spread across the regions of the Caribbean. The creole languages (French for "indigenous") progressively grew into a distinct language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

#Man is used in Dominica and Martinique.
# m, ng, and n are contracted forms of mwen which occur before certain verb particles. Mwen pa is contracted to m'a, mwen ka to either ng'a or n'a, and mwen kay to either ng'ay or n'ay.
# w and y occur after a vowel. Nonm-lan wè i→ Nonm-lan wè'y. Koumonon ou?→ Koumonon'w?
# li occurs after consonants. Ou konnèt i?→ Ou konnèt li?  Personal pronouns in Antillean Creole are invariable so they do not inflect for case as in European languages such as French or English. This means that mwen, for example, can mean I, me or my; yo can mean they, them, their etc.

#

==Vocabulary==
The vocabulary of Antillean Creole is based mostly on French, with many contributions from West African languages, Spanish, English and Amerindian languages.

==Varieties==

===Dominican Creole French===
The [[Dominican Creole French]] is a [[French-based creole languages|creole French]], which is the generally-spoken language in [[Dominica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avirtualdominica.com/creole.cfm |title=The Creole Language of Dominica |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a subvariety of Antillean Creole, which is spoken in other islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and is very closely related to the varieties spoken in [[Martinique]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Grenada]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The intelligibility rate with speakers of other varieties of Antillean Creole is almost 100%. Its syntactic, grammatical and lexical features are virtually identical to that of Martinican Creole, but like its Saint Lucian counterpart, it has more English loanwords than the Martinican variety. People who speak [[Haitian Creole]] can also understand Dominican Creole French. Even though there are a number of distinctive features, they are mutually intelligible.

Like the other [[Caribbean]] Creoles, Dominican French Creole combines a syntax of African and Carib origin with a vocabulary primarily derived from French.

===Saint Lucian Creole French===
The [[Saint Lucian Creole French]] is a [[French-based creole languages|French-based creole]] that is the generally-spoken language in [[Saint Lucia]].

It is a subvariety of Antillean Creole, which is spoken in other islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and is very closely related to the varieties spoken in [[Martinique]], [[Dominica]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Grenada]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Its syntactic, grammatical and lexical features are virtually identical to that of Martinican Creole.

Like the other [[Caribbean]] creoles, Saint Lucian French Creole combines a syntax of African and Carib origin with a vocabulary primarily derived from French.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In addition, many expressions reflect a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] influence in the language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The language can be considered to be mutually intelligible with French creoles of the Lesser Antilles and is related to [[Haitian Creole]], which has nonetheless a number of distinctive features.

It is still widely spoken in Saint Lucia. In the mid-19th century, migrants took the language with them to Panama, where it is now moribund.

===Grenadian Creole French===
Historically, French, or French Creole, was the language of the large majority of the inhabitants, slaves and estate owners. Though the new British administrators spoke English, French was still predominant.

The [[Grenadian Creole|Grenadian Creole French]] is a variety of Antillean Creole French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=acf Ethnologue report for language code:acf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In Grenada and among Grenadians, it is referred to as ''Patois'' or ''[[French language|French]] [[Patois]]''. It was once the [[lingua franca]] in Grenada and was commonly heard as recently as 1930 when children in some rural areas could speak it. In the 21st century, it can be heard only among elderly speakers in a few small pockets of the country. They are becoming fewer and fewer because unlike [[St. Lucia]] and [[Dominica]], which lie close to the French islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], Grenada does not have French-speaking neighbours to keep the language alive.

===Trinidadian French Creole===
[[Trinidadian creole|Trinidadian French Creole]] is a French Creole ([[Patois]]) of Trinidad spoken by descendants of the French Creole migrants from the [[French Antilles]].

The [[Cedula of Population]] of 1783 laid the foundation and growth of the population of [[Trinidad]]. French planters with their slaves, free coloureds and mulattos, from the French Antilles of Martinique, Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica, migrated to Trinidad during the [[French Revolution]]. The immigrants establishing local communities of [[Blanchisseuse]], Champs Fleurs, [[Paramin]], Cascade, [[Carenage]], [[Laventille]], etc. Trinidad's population, which numbered less than 1,400 in 1777, soared to over 15,000 by the end of 1789.

In 1797, Trinidad became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking and Patois-speaking population. Today, Trinidadian French Creole can be found in regional pockets among the elders, particularly in the villages of [[Paramin]] and [[Lopinot]].

He strove in building modern hospitals, medical schools and colleges, and successfully built the Dojin hospital and its affiliated medical school. He was also a supporter of the free press, including journals which satirized him. His idea was that the freedom of the press is a must to supervise the government.

He was appointed as the Governor of Hwanghae Province in 1921, and the Governor of [[North Chungcheong Province]] in 1923 to 1925. After the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], he appealed to the Japanese government to release the arrested Koreans, and asserted that the Koreans were not involved in the criminal cases which occurred during the earthquake. In November 1924, he was accused in a sex abuse scandal, but the accuser woman suddenly died; three years later, the charge against him was dismissed. In 1928, he was re-appointed as the Governor of [[Hwanghae Province]].

He governed the civilians through a regulated bureaucracy system, often with warning and several days of confinement instead of punishment, and suppressed the power of the Japanese police and soldiers to harass civilians, even putting them in confinement as well.  Sometimes, the bureaucrats were imprisoned, but the Japanese police never arrested him, because he was especially trusted by the Japanese [[Governor-General of Korea]], which pleased many [[Joseon]] people.

=== [[World War II]] era ===

A '''beta reader''' is usually an unpaid test reader of an unreleased work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karen Hellekson|first=Kristina Busse|title=Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet: New Essays|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786454962|pages=15, 43, 172–179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgZsi_DOKoQC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=%22Beta+reader%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=seZYUtvkIqHA4AOL34HgAg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Beta%20reader%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; of literature or other writing (similar to [[Beta tester|beta testing]] in software), who gives feedback from the point of view of an average reader to the author.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-beta-reader.htm|title=What Is a Beta Reader? (with picture)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A beta reader is not a professional and can therefore provide advice and comments in the opinions of an average reader&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cocowordcraft.com/menu.html/], Beta Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. This feedback is used by the writer to fix remaining issues with plot, pacing, and consistency. The beta reader also serves as a [[sounding board]] to see if the book has had the intended emotional impact.

== Origin ==
"Beta reader" is an English term originally borrowed from the information technology/software industry where [[Beta tester|beta testers]] try to identify problems in [[Software|a piece of computer software]] before its release.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it differs from other roles ==
A "proofreader" usually only looks at grammar and spelling and is a paid professional. A "critique partner" is a trained writer who "test reads" from the perspective of an author, unlike a beta reader who has little or no experience with writing. A beta reader can also serve as an "alpha reader" when reading a book draft that is still without an ending or is completely unrevised. Typically, a beta reader reviews a draft that has gone through at least one revision.

'''Bhisham Sahni''' (8 August 1915 – 11 July 2003) was a [[Hindi]] writer, playwright, and actor, most famous for his novel and television screenplay ''[[Tamas (film)|Tamas]]'' ("Darkness, Ignorance"), a powerful and passionate account of the [[Partition of India]]. He was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]] for literature in 1998,&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]] in 2002.

He was the younger brother of the noted Hindi film actor, [[Balraj Sahni]].
He was the son of shree Babu Haribansal Sahni.

==Biography==
Bhisham Sahni was born on 8 August 1915 in [[Rawalpindi]]. He earned a master's degree in English Literature from Government College in [[Lahore]], and a Ph.D from Punjab University, Chandigarh in 1958.

He joined the struggle for Indian independence. At the time of Partition he was an active member of the Indian National Congress, and organized relief work for the refugees when riots broke out in Rawalpindi in March 1947. 
In 1948 Bhisham Sahni started working with the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA), an organization with which his brother was already closely associated. He worked both as an actor and a director. As a result of his association with IPTA, he left the Congress and joined the Communist Party. Thereafter, he left Bombay for Punjab where he worked briefly as a lecturer, first in a college at Ambala and then at Khalsa College, Amritsar. At this time he was involved in organizing the Punjab College Teachers’ Union and also continued with IPTA work. In 1952 he moved to Delhi and was appointed Lecturer in English at Delhi College (now Zakir Husain College), University of Delhi.

From 1956 to 1963 he worked as a translator at the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow, and translated some important works into Hindi, including Lev Tolstoy’s short stories and his novel Resurrection. On his return to India Bhisham Sahni resumed teaching at Delhi College, and also edited the reputed literary magazine Nai Kahaniyan from 1965 to 1967. He retired from service in 1980.  Sahni was fluent in Punjabi, English, Urdu, Sanskrit and Hindi.
 
Bhisham Sahni was associated with several literary and cultural organizations. He was General Secretary of the All India Progressive Writers Association (1975–85) and Acting General Secretary of the Afro-Asian Writer’ Association and was also associated with the editing of their journal Lotus.  He was the founder and chairman of 'SAHMAT', an organisation promoting cross-cultural understanding, founded in memory of the murdered theatre artist and activist [[Safdar Hashmi]].

==Literary works==
Bhisham Sahni's epic work ''Tamas'' (Darkness, Ignorance 1974) is a novel based on the riots of  1947 [[Partition of India]] which he witnessed at [[Rawalpindi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedamsbooks.com/no21939.htm Tamas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022150021/https://www.vedamsbooks.com/no21939.htm |date=22 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tamas'' portrays the horrors of senseless communal politics of violence and hatred; and the tragic aftermath – death, destruction, forced migration and the partition of a country.  It has been translated to English, French, German, Japanese and many Indian languages including Tamil,Gujarati, Malayalam, Kashmiri, and Manipuri. ''Tamas'' won the 1975 [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for literature and was later made into a [[Tamas (film)|television film]] in 1987 by [[Govind Nihalani]]. Two of his masterpiece stories, 'Pali' and 'Amritsar Aa Gaya Hai', are also based on the Partition.

Sahni's prolific career as a writer also included six other Hindi novels: Jharokhe (1967), Kadian (1971), Basanti (1979), Mayyadas Ki Madi (1987), Kunto (1993) and Neeloo, Nilima, Nilofar (2000)., over hundred short stories spread over ten collections of short stories, (including ''[[Bhagya Rekha]]'' (1953), ''Pahla patha'' (1956),Bhatakti Raakh (1966), Patrian (1973), Wang Chu (1978), Shobha Yatra (1981), Nishachar (1983), [[Pali]](1989), and Daayan (1996) ; five plays including 'Hanush', 'Kabira Khada Bajar main', Madhavi', 'Muavze', 'Alamgeer', a collection of children's short stories ''Gulal ka keel'''. But his novel named 'Mayyadas Ki Mari' (Mayyadas's Castle) was one of his finest literary creation, the backdrop of this narrative is historical and depicts the age when the Khalsa Raj was vanquished in Punjab and the British were taking over. This novel is a saga of changing social order and decadent set of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mystudyroom.org/hobbies |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802214217/http://mystudyroom.org/hobbies |archivedate=2 August 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He wrote the screenplay for Kumar Shahani's film, ''Kasba'' (1991), which is based on Anton Chekhov's story, "In the Gully".

Bhisham Sahni wrote his autobiography ''Aaj ke Ateet'' (''[https://www.amazon.com/Todays-Pasts-Memoir-Bhisham-Sahni-ebook/dp/B018M71YZM Today's Pasts]'', Penguin 2016) and the biography of his brother [[Balraj Sahni]], ''Balraj My Brother'' (English).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/salrp/bhishamsahni.html Bhishma Sahni at U.S. Library of Congress].

=== Literary style ===
Bhisham Sahni was one of the most prolific writers of Hindi literature. 
Krishan Baldev Vaid, "His voice, both as a writer and a man, was serene and pure and resonant with humane reassurances. His immense popularity was not a result of any pandering to vulgar tastes but a reward for his literary merits—his sharp wit, his gentle irony, his all-pervasive humour, his penetrating insight into character, his mastery as raconteur, and his profound grasp of the yearnings of the human heart.&lt;ref name="outlookindia1"&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article/trailings-of-a-lonely-voice/220872 Trailings Of A Lonely Voice]. Outlookindia.com (28 July 2003). Retrieved on 2018-11-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted Writer, Nirmal Verma, stated, "If we see a long gallery of unmatched characters in his stories and novels, where each person is present with his class and family; pleasures and pains of his town and district; the whole world of perversions and contradictions; it is because the reservoir of his (Bhisham Sahni's) experience was vast and abundant. At the request of his father – would anyone believe? – he dabbled in business, in which he was a miserable failure. With his high-spirits and passion for life of the common people, he travelled through villages and towns of Punjab with the IPTA theatre group; then began to teach to earn a living; and then lived in the USSR for seven years as a Hindi translator. This sprawling reservoir of experience collected in the hustle-bustle of various occupations ultimately filtered down into his stories and novels, without which, as we realise today, the world of Hindi prose would have been deprived and desolate. The 'simplicity' of his work comes from hard layers of experience, which distinguish and separate it from other works of 'simplified realism. ...
"Bhisham Sahni is able to express the terrifying tragedy of Partition with an extraordinary compassion in his stories. Amritsar Aa Gaya Hai ('We have reached Amritsar') is one such exceptional work where Bhisham gets away from the external reality and points to the bloody fissures etched on people's psyche. This is possible only for a writer who, in the darkness of historic events has seen the sudden 'accidents' that happen inside human hearts from up close." ... 
"After reading his last collection of stories Daayan (Witch), I was amazed that even after so many years there seemed no repetition or staleness in his writing. Each of his stories seemed to bring something sudden from newer directions, which was as new for him as it was unexpected for us. That Bhisham never paused, never halted in such a long creative journey is a big achievement; but what is bigger perhaps is that his life nurtured his work and his work nurtured his life, both nurtured each other continuously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article/the-faces-memory-memorys-face/220780 The Face's Memory, Memory's Face].

Kamleshwar,"Bhisham Sahni's name is etched so deeply into the twentieth century of Hindi literature that it cannot be erased. With Independence and till the 11th. July 2003, this name has been synonymous with Hindi story and play writing. Bhisham Sahni had gained such an unmatched popularity that all kinds of readers awaited his new creations and each and every word of his was read. There was no need to ask a general reader if he had read this or that writing by Bhisham. It was possible to begin a sudden discussion on his stories or novels. Such a rare readerly privilege was either available to Premchand or, after Harishankar Parsai, to Bhisham Sahni. This too is rare that the fame he received from Hindi should, during his lifetime,  become the fame for Hindi itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article/the-light-shall-shine-on/220781 The Light Shall Shine On]. Outlookindia.com. Translated from Outlook Saptahik, 28 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishan Baldev Vaid. "Bhisham Sahni's last published book, an autobiography with the quiet title Aaj Ke Ateet (The Pasts of the Present), is a beautiful culmination of a lifetime of excellent writing. Apart from giving us an intimate account of some of the salient phases of his life, it epitomises his literary qualities. It is full of fun and insights; it is variegated; it is fair; it is unsmug; it is absorbing; it is also his farewell to his family, his milieu, his readers, and his friends.

He begins at the beginning and ends very near the end. The book glows with the sense of ending without, however, any trace of morbidity or self-pity. The early part, where Bhisham tenderly evokes his earliest memories and records his childhood in an affectionate middle-class family in Rawalpindi, is for me the most moving part of this self-portrait. With characteristic elegance and an unfailing eye for the significant detail, the elderly author looks back with nostalgic longing at the world of his childhood and achieves a small but brilliant portrait of the artist as a little child.&lt;ref name="outlookindia1"/&gt;

'''Bi-directional text''' is text containing text in both [[text direction]]alities, both [[right-to-left]] (RTL or dextrosinistral) and [[left-to-right]] (LTR or sinistrodextral). It generally involves text containing different types of [[alphabet]]s, but may also refer to [[boustrophedon]], which is changing text directionality in each row.

Some [[writing system]]s of the world, including the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] scripts or derived systems such as the [[Persian alphabet|Persian]], [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]], and [[Yiddish orthography|Yiddish]] scripts, are written in a form known as right-to-left (RTL), in which writing begins at the right-hand side of a page and concludes at the left-hand side. This is different from the left-to-right (LTR) direction used by the dominant Latin script. When LTR text is mixed with RTL in the same paragraph, each type of text is written in its own direction, which is known as ''bi-directional text''. This can get rather complex when multiple levels of quotation are used.

Many computer programs fail to display bi-directional text correctly.
For example, the Hebrew name Sarah &lt;span lang="he"&gt;(שרה)&lt;/span&gt; is spelled: sin &lt;span lang="he"&gt;(ש)&lt;/span&gt; (which appears rightmost), then resh &lt;span lang="he"&gt;(ר)&lt;/span&gt;, and finally heh &lt;span lang="he"&gt;(ה)&lt;/span&gt; (which should appear leftmost).

''Note: Some [[web browser]]s may display the Hebrew text in this article in the opposite direction.''

== Bidirectional script support ==
Bidirectional script support is the capability of a [[computer]] system to correctly display bi-directional text. The term is often shortened to "BiDi" or "bidi".

Early computer installations were designed only to support a single [[writing system]], typically for left-to-right scripts based on the [[Latin alphabet]] only.  Adding new [[character set]]s and [[character encoding]]s enabled a number of other left-to-right scripts to be supported, but did not easily support right-to-left scripts such as [[Arabic script|Arabic]] or [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and mixing the two was not practical. Right-to-left scripts were introduced through encodings like [[ISO/IEC 8859-6]] and [[ISO/IEC 8859-8]], storing the letters (usually) in writing and reading order. It is possible to simply flip the left-to-right display order to a right-to-left display order, but doing this sacrifices the ability to correctly display left-to-right scripts. With bidirectional script support, it is possible to mix scripts from different scripts on the same page, regardless of writing direction.

In particular, the [[Unicode]] standard provides foundations for complete BiDi support, with detailed rules as to how mixtures of left-to-right and right-to-left scripts are to be encoded and displayed.

== Unicode bidi support ==
The Unicode standard calls for characters to be ordered 'logically', i.e. in the sequence they are intended to be interpreted, as opposed to 'visually', the sequence they appear. This distinction is relevant for bidi support because at any bidi transition, the visual presentation ceases to be the 'logical' one. Thus, in order to offer bidi support, Unicode prescribes an algorithm for how to convert the logical sequence of characters into the correct visual presentation. For this purpose, the Unicode encoding standard divides all its characters into one of four types: 'strong', 'weak', 'neutral', and 'explicit formatting'.&lt;ref name="Bidi_UAX9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Resolving_Weak_Types |title=UAX #9: Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm |publisher=Unicode.org |date=2018-05-09 |accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Strong characters ===
Strong characters are those with definite directionality. Examples of this type of character include most alphabetic characters, syllabic characters, Han ideographs, non-European or non-Arabic digits, and punctuation characters ''that are specific to only those scripts''.

=== Weak characters ===
Weak characters are those with vague directionality. Examples of this type of character include European digits,&lt;!--Debian doesn't work this way: "حج6341" does not show the year as "1436"--&gt; Eastern Arabic-Indic digits, arithmetic symbols, and currency symbols.

==== Numbers ====
Unless a directional override is present numbers are always encoded (and entered) big-endian, and the numerals rendered LTR. The weak directionality only applies to the placement of the number in its entirety.

=== Neutral characters ===
Neutral characters have directionality indeterminable without context. Examples include paragraph separators, tabs, and most other whitespace characters. Punctuation symbols that are common to many scripts, such as the colon, comma, full-stop, and the no-break-space also fall within this category.

=== Explicit formatting ===
Explicit formatting characters, also referred to as "directional formatting characters", are special Unicode sequences that direct the unicode algorithm to modify its default behavior. These characters are subdivided into "marks", "embeddings", "isolates", and "overrides". Their effects continue until the occurrence of either a paragraph separator, or a "pop" character.

==== Marks ====
If a "weak" character is followed by another "weak" character, the algorithm will look at the first neighbouring "strong" character. Sometimes this leads to unintentional display errors. These errors are corrected or prevented with "pseudo-strong" characters. Such [[Unicode control characters]] are called ''marks''. The mark ({{unichar|200E|Left-to-right mark|note=LRM}} or {{unichar|200F|Right-to-left mark|note=RLM}}) is to be inserted into a location to make an enclosed weak character inherit its writing direction.

For example, to correctly display the {{unichar|2122|trade mark sign}} for an English name brand (LTR) in an Arabic (RTL) passage, an LRM mark is inserted after the trademark symbol if the symbol is not followed by LTR text (e.g. "{{rtl-lang|ar|قرأ Wikipedia™&amp;#8206; طوال اليوم.}}"). If the LRM mark is not added, the weak character ™ will be neighbored by a strong LTR character and a strong RTL character. Hence, in an RTL context, it will be considered to be RTL, and displayed in an incorrect order (e.g. "{{rtl-lang|ar|قرأ Wikipedia™ طوال اليوم.}}").

==== Embeddings ====
The "embedding" directional formatting characters are the classical Unicode method of explicit formatting, and as of Unicode 6.3, are being discouraged in favor of "isolates". An "embedding" signals that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally distinct. The text within the scope of the embedding formatting characters is not independent of the surrounding text. Also, characters within an embedding can affect the ordering of characters outside. Unicode 6.3 recognized that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use.

==== Isolates ====
The "isolate" directional formatting characters signal that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally isolated from its surroundings. As of Unicode 6.3, these are the formatting characters that are being encouraged in new documents – once target platforms are known to support them. These formatting characters were introduced after it became apparent that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use. Unlike the legacy 'embedding' directional formatting characters, 'isolate' characters have no effect on the ordering of the text outside their scope. Isolates can be nested, and may be placed within embeddings and overrides.

==== Overrides ====
The "override" directional formatting characters allow for special cases, such as for part numbers (e.g. to force a part number made of mixed English, digits and Hebrew letters to be written from right to left), and are recommended to be avoided wherever possible. As is true of the other directional formatting characters, "overrides" can be nested one inside another, and in embeddings and isolates.

==== Pops ====
The "pop" directional formatting characters terminate the scope of the most recent "embedding", "override", or "isolate".

=== Runs ===
In the algorithm, each sequence of concatenated strong characters is called a "run". A "weak" character that is located between two "strong" characters with the same orientation will inherit their orientation. A "weak" character that is located between two "strong" characters with a different writing direction, will inherit the main context's writing direction (in an LTR document the character will become LTR, in an RTL document, it will become RTL).

=== Table of possible BiDi-types ===

== Scripts using bi-directional text ==

=== Egyptian hieroglyphs ===
[[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphs]] can be written bi-directionally, where the signs had a distinct "head" that faced the beginning of a line and "tail" that faced the end.

=== Chinese characters and other CJK scripts ===
[[Chinese characters]] can be written in either direction as well as vertically (top to bottom then right to left), especially in signs (such as plaques), but the orientation of the individual characters is never changed. This can often be seen on tour buses in China, where the company name customarily runs from the front of the vehicle to its rear — that is, from right to left on the right side of the bus, and from left to right on the left side of the bus. English texts on the right side of the vehicle are also quite commonly written in reverse order. (See pictures of tour bus and post vehicle below.)

Likewise, other [[CJK]] scripts made up of the same square characters, such as the [[Japanese writing system]] and [[Korean writing system]], can also be written in any direction, although left-to-right, top-to-bottom and top-to-bottom, right-to-left are most common.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Boustrophedon ===
[[Boustrophedon]] is a writing style found in ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] inscriptions and in [[Hungarian runes]]. This method of writing alternates direction, and usually reverses the individual characters, on each successive line.

[[Arthur C. Graesser]] and [[Danielle McNamara]], Coh-Metrix calculates the [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] of texts on many different measures.

==Coh-Metrix Measurements==
Coh-Metrix can be used in many different ways to investigate the cohesion of the explicit text and the coherence of the [[mental representation]] of the text. "Our definition of [[Cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] consists of characteristics of the explicit text that play some role in helping the reader mentally connect ideas in the text" (Graesser, McNamara, &amp; Louwerse, 2003). The definition of coherence is the subject of much debate. Theoretically, the coherence of a text is defined by the interaction between linguistic representations and knowledge representations. While coherence can be defined as characteristics of the text (i.e., aspects of cohesion) that are likely to contribute to the coherence of the mental representation, Coh-Metrix measurements provide indices of these cohesion characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Graesser,A.C., McNamara,D.S.,&amp; Louwerse,M.M (2003).

According to an empirical study, the Coh-Metrix L2 Reading Index performs significantly better than traditional [[readability]] formulas.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''critical period hypothesis''' is the subject of a long-standing debate in [[linguistics]] and [[language acquisition]] over the extent to which the ability to acquire [[language]] is biologically linked to age. The hypothesis claims that there is an ideal time window to acquire language in a linguistically rich environment, after which further language acquisition becomes much more difficult and effortful.

The critical period hypothesis states that the first few years of life is the crucial time in which an individual can acquire a [[first language]] if presented with adequate stimuli. If language input does not occur until after this time, the individual will never achieve a full command of language—especially [[grammar|grammatical systems]].

The evidence for such a period is limited, and support stems largely from theoretical arguments and analogies to other [[critical period]]s in biology such as [[visual system|visual development]], but nonetheless is widely accepted. The nature of such a critical period, however, has been one of the most fiercely debated issues in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive science]] in general for decades. Some writers have suggested a "sensitive" or "optimal" period rather than a critical one; others dispute the causes (physical maturation, cognitive factors). The duration of the period also varies greatly in different accounts.

In [[second-language acquisition]], the strongest empirical evidence for the critical period hypothesis is in the study of [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], where most older learners do not reach a native-like level. However, under certain conditions, native-like accent has been observed, suggesting that accent is affected by [[individual variation in second-language acquisition|multiple factors]], such as [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[second-language acquisition#Motivation|motivation]], rather than a critical period biological constraint.

==History==
The critical period hypothesis was first proposed by Montreal neurologist [[Wilder Penfield]] and co-author Lamar Roberts in their 1959 book ''Speech and Brain Mechanisms'',{{sfn|Penfield|Roberts|1959}} and was popularized by [[Eric Lenneberg]] in 1967 with ''Biological Foundations of Language.''{{sfn|Lenneberg|1967}}

Lenneberg's critical period hypothesis states that there are maturational constraints on the time a first language can be acquired. First-language acquisition relies on [[neuroplasticity]]. If [[language acquisition]] does not occur by puberty, some aspects of language can be learned but full mastery cannot be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lenneberg|1967|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the critical period theory stems largely from theoretical arguments and analogies to other critical periods in biology such as visual development. Strictly speaking, the experimentally verified [[Critical period#Vision|critical period]] relates to a time span during which ''damage'' to the development of the visual system can occur, for example if animals are deprived of the necessary binocular input for developing [[stereopsis]]. It has however been considered "likely",{{sfn|Fawcett|Wang|Birch|2005}} and has in many cases been flatly presented as fact, that experimental evidence would point to a comparable critical period also for ''recovery'' of such development and ''treatment''; however this is a hypothesis. Recently, doubts have arisen concerning the validity of this critical period hypothesis with regard to visual development, in particular since the time it became known that neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]] and others have [[Stereopsis recovery|achieved stereopsis]] as adults, long after the supposed critical period for acquiring this skill.{{sfnm|1a1=Sacks|1y=2006|2a1=Barry|2y=2010}}

Recently, it has been suggested that if a critical period does exist, it may be due at least partially to the delayed development of the [[prefrontal cortex]] in human children.&lt;ref name="Thompson-Schill"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson-Schill|Ramscar|Chrysikou|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramscar|Gitcho|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have suggested that delayed development of the [[prefrontal cortex]] and an associated delay in the development of [[cognitive control]] may facilitate convention learning, allowing young children to learn language far more easily than cognitively mature adults and older children.  This pattern of prefrontal development is unique to humans among similar mammalian (and primate) species, and may explain why humans—and not chimpanzees—are so adept at learning language.{{sfn|Dye|2010}}

==Second-language acquisition==
The theory has often been extended to a critical period for [[second-language acquisition]] (SLA), although this is much less widely accepted. Certainly, older learners of a [[second language]] rarely achieve the native-like fluency that younger learners display, despite often progressing faster than children in the initial stages. [[David Singleton]] states that in learning a second language, "younger = better in the long run", but points out that there are many exceptions, noting that five percent of adult bilinguals master a second language even though they begin learning it when they are well into adulthood—long after any critical period has presumably come to a close.{{sfn|Singleton|Lengyel|1995}}

While the window for learning a second language never completely closes, certain linguistic aspects appear to be more affected by the age of the learner than others. For example, adult second-language learners nearly always retain an immediately identifiable foreign accent, including some who display perfect grammar.{{sfn|Oyama| 1976}} A possible explanation for why this foreign accent remains is that [[pronunciation]], or phonology, is susceptible to the critical period.{{sfn|Singleton|Lengyel|1995}} The pronunciation of speech sounds relies on neuromuscular function. Adults learning a new language are unlikely to attain a convincing native accent since they are past the prime age of learning new neuromuscular functions, and therefore pronunciations. Writers have suggested a younger critical age for learning phonology than for morphemes and syntax. {{harvtxt|Singleton|Lengyel|1995}} reports that there is no critical period for learning vocabulary in a second language because vocabulary is learned consciously using declarative memory.{{sfn|Paradis|1999|pp=59–60}} The attrition of [[procedural memory]] with age results in the increased use of declarative memory to learn new languages, which is an entirely different process from L1 (first language) learning. The plasticity of procedural memory is argued to decline after the age of 5. The attrition of procedural memory plasticity inhibits the ability of an L2 user to speak their second language automatically. It can still take conscious effort even if they are exposed to the second language as early as age 3. This effort is observed by measuring brain activity. L2-users that are exposed to their second language at an early age and are everyday users show lower levels of brain activity when using their L1 than when using their L2. This suggests that additional resources are recruited when speaking their L2 and it is therefore a more strenuous process.

The critical period hypothesis in SLA follows a "use it '''then''' lose it" approach, which dictates that as a person ages, excess neural circuitry used during L1 learning is essentially broken down.{{sfn|Birdsong|1999|p=5}} If these neural structures remained intact they would cost unnecessary metabolic energy to maintain. The structures necessary for L1 use are kept. On the other hand, a second "use it '''or''' lose it" approach dictates that if an L2 user begins to learn at an early age and continues on through his life, then his language-learning circuitry should remain active. This approach is also called the "exercise hypothesis".{{sfn|Birdsong|1999|p=6}}

There is much debate over the timing of the critical period with respect to SLA, with estimates ranging between 2 and 13 years of age.{{sfnm|1a1=Paradis|1y=1999|1pp=59–60|2a1=Loewen|2a2= Reinders|2y=2011}} These estimates tend to vary depending on what component of the language learning process a researcher considers. For instance, if an SLA researcher is studying L2 ''phonological'' development, they will likely conclude that the critical period ends at around age 3. If another SLA researcher is studying L2 ''syntactical'' development, they may conclude that the critical period ends at a much later age. These differences in research focus are what create the critical period timing debate.

Some writers have argued that the critical period hypothesis does not apply to SLA, and that second-language proficiency is determined by the time and effort put into the learning process, and not the learner's age.{{sfnm|1a1=Loewen|1a2= Reinders|1y=2011|2a1=Birdsong|2y=1999|2p=9}} {{Harvtxt|Robertson|2002}}  observed that factors  other than age may be even more significant in successful second-language learning, such as personal motivation, anxiety, input and output skills, and the learning environment. A combination of these factors often leads to [[individual variation in second-language acquisition]] experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=P.|date=2002|title=The Critical Age Hypothesis: A Critique of Research Methodology|url=|journal=Asian EFL Journal|volume=4 |issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On reviewing the published material, Bialystok and Hakuta (1994) conclude that second-language learning is not necessarily subject to biological critical periods, but "on average, there is a continuous decline in ability [to learn] with age."

==Experimental and observational studies==
How children acquire native language (L1) and the relevance of this to foreign language (L2) learning has long been debated. Although evidence for L2 learning ability declining with age is controversial, a common notion is that children learn L2s easily, whilst older learners rarely achieve fluency. This assumption stems from ‘[[critical period]]’ (CP) ideas. A CP was popularised by [[Eric Lenneberg]] in 1967 for L1 acquisition, but considerable interest now surrounds age effects on second-language acquisition (SLA). SLA theories explain learning processes and suggest causal factors for a possible CP for second language acquisition. These SLA-CP theories mainly attempt to explain apparent differences in language aptitudes of children and adults by distinct learning routes, and clarify these differences by discussing psychological mechanisms. Research explores these ideas and hypotheses, but results are varied: some demonstrate pre-pubescent children acquire language easily, and some that older learners have the advantage, whilst others focus on existence of a CP for SLA. Recent studies (e.g. Mayberry and Lock, 2003) have recognised certain aspects of SLA may be affected by age, whilst others remain intact. The objective of this study is to investigate whether capacity for vocabulary acquisition decreases with age.

Other work has challenged the biological approach; Krashen (1975) re-analysed clinical data used as evidence and concluded cerebral specialisation occurs much earlier than Lenneberg calculated. Therefore, if a CP exists, it does not coincide with lateralisation. Despite concerns with Lenneberg’s original evidence and the dissociation of lateralisation from the language CP idea, however, the concept of a CP remains a viable hypothesis, which later work has better explained and substantiated.

===Effects of aging===
A review of SLA theories and their explanations for age-related differences is necessary before considering empirical studies. The most reductionist theories are those of Penfield and Roberts (1959) and Lenneberg (1967), which stem from L1 and brain damage studies. Children who suffer impairment before puberty typically recover and (re-)develop normal language, whereas adults rarely recover fully, and often do not regain verbal abilities beyond the point reached five months after impairment. Both theories agree that children have a neurological advantage in learning languages, and that puberty correlates with a turning point in ability. They assert that language acquisition occurs primarily, possibly exclusively, during childhood as the brain loses plasticity after a certain age. It then becomes rigid and fixed, and loses the ability for adaptation and reorganisation, rendering language (re-)learning difficult. Penfield and Roberts (1959) claim children under nine can learn up to three languages: early exposure to different languages activates a reflex in the brain allowing them to switch between languages without confusion or translation into L1 (Penfield, 1964). Lenneberg (1967) asserts that if no language is learned by puberty, it cannot be learned in a normal, functional sense. He also supports Penfield and Roberts’ (1959) proposal of neurological mechanisms responsible for maturational change in language learning abilities. This, Lenneberg maintains, coincides with brain lateralisation and left-hemispherical specialisation for language around age thirteen: infants’ motor and linguistic skills develop simultaneously, but by age thirteen the cerebral hemispheres’ functions separate and become set, making language acquisition extremely difficult (Lenneberg, 1967).

===Deaf and feral children===
Cases of deaf and [[feral child]]ren provide evidence for a biologically determined CP for L1. Feral children are those not exposed to language in infancy/childhood due to being brought up in the wild, in isolation and/or confinement. A classic example is [[Genie (feral child)|'Genie']], a victim of [[child abuse]] who was deprived of social interaction from birth until discovered aged thirteen. Her father had judged her retarded at birth and had chosen to isolate her. She was kept strapped to a potty chair and forced to wear diapers. She was completely without language. Her case presented an ideal opportunity to test the theory that a nurturing environment could somehow make up for the total lack of language past the age of 12. After seven years of rehabilitation Genie still lacked linguistic competence, although the degree to which she acquired language is disputed.{{sfn|Jones}} Another case is 'Isabelle', who was incarcerated with her deaf-mute mother until the age of six and a half (pre-pubescent). She also had no language skills, but, unlike Genie, quickly acquired normal language abilities through systematic specialist training.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vvk2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=child+language+acquisition+and+development+matthew+saxton#v=onepage&amp;q=isabelle&amp;f=false|title=Child Language: Acquisition and Development|last=Saxton|first=Matthew|date=2017-10-02|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781526421906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors of the critical period hypothesis point out that in these examples and others like them (see [[feral child]]ren), the child is hardly growing up in a nurturing environment, and that the lack of language acquisition in later life may be due to the results of a generally abusive environment rather than being specifically due to a lack of exposure to language. Such studies are problematic; isolation can result in general retardation and emotional disturbances, which may confound conclusions drawn about language abilities.

Studies of deaf children learning American Sign Language (ASL) have fewer methodological weaknesses. Newport and Supalla &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newport|first=E.L.|last2=Supalla|first2=T.|date=n.d.a.|title=Critical Period Effects in the Acquisition of a Primary Language: The Influence of Maturational State on the Acquisition of Complex Morphology in American Sign Language|url=|journal=|volume=21|issue=1|pages=60–99|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied ASL acquisition in deaf children differing in age of exposure; few were exposed to ASL from birth, most of them first learned it at school. Results showed a linear decline in performance with increasing age of exposure; those exposed to ASL from birth performed best, and 'late learners' worst, on all production and comprehension tests. Their study thus provides direct evidence for language learning ability decreasing with age, but it does not add to Lenneberg's CP hypothesis as even the oldest children, the 'late learners', were exposed to ASL by age four, and had therefore not reached puberty, the proposed end of the CP. In addition, the declines were shown to be linear, with no sudden 'drop off' of ability at a certain age, as would be predicted by a strong CP hypothesis. That the children performed significantly worse may suggest that the CP ends earlier than originally postulated. However, this decline in performance may also be attributed in part to limitations of second language acquisition for hearing parents learning ASL.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Behavioural approaches===
Contrary to biological views, behavioural approaches assert that languages are learned as any other behaviour, through [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]. [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] (1957) details how [[operant conditioning]] forms connections with the environment through interaction and, alongside [[O. Hobart Mowrer]] (1960), applies the ideas to language acquisition. Mowrer hypothesises that languages are acquired through rewarded imitation of ‘language models’; the model must have an emotional link to the learner (e.g. parent, spouse), as imitation then brings pleasant feelings which function as [[positive reinforcement]]. Because new connections between behaviour and the environment are formed and reformed throughout life, it is possible to gain new skills, including language(s), at any age.

To explain observed language learning differences between children and adults, children are postulated to create countless new connections daily, and may handle the language learning process more effectively than do adults. This assumption, however, remains untested and is not a reliable explanation for children’s aptitude for L2 learning. Problematic of the behaviourist approach is its assumption that all learning, verbal and non-verbal, occurs through the same processes. A more general problem is that, as [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] (1995) notes, almost every sentence anybody voices is an original combination of words, never previously uttered, therefore a language cannot consist only of word combinations learned through repetition and conditioning; the brain must contain innate means of creating endless amounts of grammatical sentences from a limited vocabulary. This is precisely what Chomsky (1965) (reprinted as {{harvtxt|Chomsky|1969}}) argues with his proposition of a [[universal grammar]] (UG).

===Universal grammar===
{{harvtxt|Chomsky|1969}} asserts that environmental factors must be relatively unimportant for language emergence, as so many different factors surround children acquiring L1. Instead, Chomsky claims language learners possess innate principles building a '[[language acquisition device]]' (LAD) in the brain. These principles denote restricted possibilities for variation within the language, and enable learners to construct a grammar out of 'raw input' collected from the environment. Input alone cannot explain language acquisition because it is degenerated by characteristic features such as stutters, and lacks corrections from which learners discover incorrect variations.

Singleton and Newport (2004) demonstrate the function of UG in their study of 'Simon'. Simon learned ASL as his L1 from parents who had learned it as an L2 after puberty and provided him with imperfect models. Results showed Simon learned normal and logical rules and was able to construct an organised linguistic system, despite being exposed to inconsistent input. Chomsky developed UG to explain L1 acquisition data, but maintains it also applies to L2 learners who achieve near-native fluency not attributable solely to input and interaction {{harv|Chomsky|1969}}.

Although it does not describe an optimal age for SLA, the theory implies that younger children can learn languages more easily than older learners, as adults must reactivate principles developed during L1 learning and forge an SLA path: children can learn several languages simultaneously as long as the principles are still active and they are exposed to sufficient language samples (Pinker, 1995). The parents of Singleton and Newport's (2004) patient also had linguistic abilities in line with these age-related predictions; they learned ASL after puberty and never reached complete fluency.

====Problems within UG theory for L2 acquisition====
There are, however, problems with the extrapolation of the UG theory to SLA: L2 learners go through several phases of types of utterance that are not similar to their L1 or the L2 they hear. Other factors include the cognitive maturity of most L2 learners, that they have different motivation for learning the language, and already speak one language fluently. Other studies also highlight these problems: [[Stanislas Dehaene]] has investigated how cerebral circuits used to handling one language adapt for the efficient storage of two or more.{{sfn|Dehaene| Spelke| Pinel| Stanescu |1999}} He reports observations of cerebral activation when reading and translating two languages. They found the most activated brain areas during the tasks were not those generally associated with language, but rather those related to mapping [[orthography]] to [[phonology]]. They conclude that the left temporal lobe is the physical base of L1, but the L2 is 'stored' elsewhere, thus explaining cases of bilingual aphasia where one language remains intact. They maintain that only languages learned simultaneously from birth are represented, and cause activity, in the left hemisphere: any L2 learned later is stored separately (possibly in the right hemisphere), and rarely activates the left temporal lobe.

This suggests that L2 may be qualitatively different from L1 due to its dissociation from the 'normal' language brain regions, thus the extrapolation of L1 studies and theories to SLA is placed in question. A further disadvantage of UG is that supporting empirical data are taken from a limited sample of syntactic phenomena: a general theory of language acquisition should cover a larger range of phenomena. Despite these problems, several other theorists have based their own models of language learning on it. These ideas are supported by empirical evidence, which consequently supports Chomsky's ideas. Due to this support and its descriptive and explanatory strength, many theorists regard UG as the best explanation of language, and particularly grammar, acquisition.

====UG and the critical period hypothesis====
A key question about the relationship of UG and SLA is: is the [[language acquisition device]] posited by Chomsky and his followers still accessible to learners of a second language? The critical period hypothesis suggests that it becomes inaccessible at a certain age, and learners increasingly depended on explicit teaching. In other words, although all of language may be governed by UG, older learners might have great difficulty in gaining access to the target language's underlying rules from positive input alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singleton|first=David|date=2005-11-18|title=The Critical Period Hypothesis: A coat of many colours|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/iral.2005.43.issue-4/iral.2005.43.4.269/iral.2005.43.4.269.xml|journal=IRAL - International Review of Applied Linguistics in Language Teaching|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=269–285|doi=10.1515/iral.2005.43.4.269|issn=1613-4141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piaget===
[[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] (1926) is one psychologist reluctant to ascribe specific innate linguistic abilities to children: he considers the brain a homogeneous computational system, with language acquisition being one part of general learning. He agrees this development may be innate, but claims there is no specific language acquisition module in the brain. Instead, he suggests external influences and social interaction trigger language acquisition: information collected from these sources constructs symbolic and functional schemata (thought or behaviour patterns). According to Piaget, cognitive development and language acquisition are lifelong active processes that constantly update and re-organise schemata. He proposes children develop L1 as they build a sense of identity in reference to the environment, and describes phases of general cognitive development, with processes and patterns changing systematically with age. Piaget assumes language acquisition is part of this complex cognitive development, and that these developmental phases are the basis for an optimal period for language acquisition in childhood. Interactionist approaches derived from Piaget’s ideas supports his theory. Some studies (e.g. Newport and Supalla)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; show that, rather than abrupt changes in SLA ability after puberty, language ability declines with age, coinciding with declines in other cognitive abilities, thus supporting Piaget.

===Krashen===
Although [[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]] (1975) also criticises this theory, he does not deny the importance of age for second-language acquisition. Krashen (1975) proposed theories for the close of the CP for L2 at puberty, based on Piaget’s cognitive stage of formal operations beginning at puberty, as the ‘ability of the formal operational thinker to construct abstract hypotheses to explain phenomena’ inhibits the individual’s natural ability for language learning.

The term "[[language acquisition]]" became commonly used after [[Stephen Krashen]] contrasted it with formal and non-constructive "learning." Today, most scholars use "language learning" and "language acquisition" interchangeably, unless they are directly addressing Krashen's work. However, "second-language acquisition" or "SLA" has become established as the preferred term for this academic discipline.

Though SLA is often viewed as part of [[applied linguistics]], it is typically concerned with the language system and learning processes themselves, whereas applied linguistics may focus more on the experiences of the learner, particularly in the classroom. Additionally, SLA has mostly examined ''naturalistic'' acquisition, where learners acquire a language with little formal training or teaching.
&lt;!-- This is extra material from excess critical period hypothesis left over at [[second language acquisition]]. See talk page for more details --&gt;

===Other directions of research===

====Effect of illiteracy====
Virtually all research findings on SLA to date build on data from literate learners. {{harvtxt|Tarone| Bigelow |Hansen |2009}} find significantly different results when replicating standard SLA studies with low literate L2 learners. Specifically, learners with lower alphabetic literacy levels are significantly less likely to notice corrective feedback on form or to perform elicited imitation tasks accurately. These findings are consistent with research in cognitive psychology showing significant differences in phonological awareness between literate and illiterate adults .{{sfnm|1a1=Reis |1a2=Castro-Caldas|1y= 1997|2a1=Castro-Caldas|2a2=Petersson|2a3= Reis|2a4= Stone-Elander| 2a5=Ingvar|2y=1998}} An important direction for SLA research must therefore involve the exploration of the impact of alphabetic literacy on cognitive processing in second-language acquisition.

Empirical research has attempted to account for variables detailed by SLA theories and provide an insight into L2 learning processes, which can be applied in educational environments. Recent SLA investigations have followed two main directions: one focuses on pairings of L1 and L2 that render L2 acquisition particularly difficult, and the other investigates certain aspects of language that may be maturationally constrained. {{harvtxt|Flege| Mackay |Piske |2002}}  looked at bilingual dominance to evaluate two explanations of L2 performance differences between bilinguals and monolingual-L2 speakers, i.e. a maturationally defined CP or interlingual interference.

====Bilingual dominance====
{{Harvtxt|Flege|Mackay|Piske|2002}} investigated whether the age at which participants learned English affected dominance in [[Italian language|Italian]]-English bilinguals, and found the early bilinguals were English (L2) dominant and the late bilinguals Italian (L1) dominant. Further analysis showed that dominant Italian bilinguals had detectable foreign accents when speaking English, but early bilinguals (English dominant) had no accents in either language. This suggests that, though interlingual interference effects are not inevitable, their emergence, and bilingual dominance, may be related to a CP.

{{harvtxt|Sebastián-Gallés|Echeverría|Bosch|2005}} also studied bilinguals and highlight the importance of early language exposure. They looked at vocabulary processing and representation in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-[[Catalan language|Catalan]] bilinguals exposed to both languages simultaneously from birth in comparison to those who had learned L2 later and were either Spanish- or Catalan-dominant. Findings showed 'from birth bilinguals' had significantly more difficulty distinguishing Catalan words from non-words differing in specific vowels than Catalan-dominants did (measured by reaction time).

These difficulties are attributed to a phase around age eight months where bilingual infants are insensitive to vowel contrasts, despite the language they hear most. This affects how words are later represented in their [[lexicon]]s, highlighting this as a decisive period in language acquisition and showing that initial language exposure shapes linguistic processing for life. {{harvtxt|Sebastián-Gallés|Echeverría|Bosch|2005}} also indicate the significance of phonology for L2 learning; they believe learning an L2 once the L1 phonology is already internalised can reduce individuals’ abilities to distinguish new sounds that appear in the L2.

====Age effects on grammar learning====
Most studies into age effects on specific aspects of SLA have focused on grammar, with the common conclusion that it is highly constrained by age, more so than semantic functioning. {{Harvtxt|Harley|1986}} compared attainment of French learners in early and late immersion programs. She reports that after 1000 exposure hours, late learners had better control of [[French language|French]] verb systems and syntax. However, comparing early immersion students (average age 6.917 years) with age-matched native speakers identified common problem areas, including third person plurals and polite ‘[[T-V distinction|vous]]’ forms. This suggests grammar (in L1 or L2) is generally acquired later, possibly because it requires abstract cognition and reasoning.{{sfn|Harley|1986}}

B. Harley also measured eventual attainment and found the two age groups made similar mistakes in syntax and lexical selection, often confusing French with the L1. The general conclusion from these investigations is that different aged learners acquire the various aspects of language with varying difficulty. Some variation in grammatical performance is attributed to maturation,{{sfn|Harley|1986}} however, all participants began immersion programs before puberty and so were too young for a strong critical period hypothesis to be directly tested.

This corresponds to [[Noam Chomsky]]’s UG theory, which states that while language acquisition principles are still active, it is easy to learn a language, and the principles developed through L1 acquisition are vital for learning an L2.

{{harvtxt|Scherag|Demuth|Rösler|Neville |2004}} also suggest learning some syntactic processing functions and lexical access may be limited by maturation, whereas semantic functions are relatively unaffected by age. They studied the effect of late SLA on speech comprehension by [[Germans|German]] immigrants to the U.S.A. and American immigrants to Germany. They found that native-English speakers who learned German as adults were disadvantaged on certain grammatical tasks but performed at near-native levels on lexical tasks.

====Semantic functions acquisition====
One study that specifically mentions semantic functions acquisition is that of {{Harvtxt|Weber-Fox|Neville|1996}}. Their results showed that [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-English bilinguals who had been exposed to English after puberty, learned vocabulary to a higher competence level than syntactic aspects of language. They do, however, report that the judgment accuracies in detecting semantic anomalies were altered in subjects who were exposed to English after sixteen years of age, but were affected to a lesser degree than were grammatical aspects of language. It has been speculated by {{harvtxt|Neville |Bavelier| 2001}} and {{harvtxt|Scherag|Demuth|Rösler|Neville |2004}} that semantic aspects of language are founded on associative learning mechanisms, which allow lifelong learning, whereas syntactical aspects are based on computational mechanisms, which can only be constructed during certain age periods. Consequently, it is reasoned, semantic functions are easier to access during comprehension of an L2 and therefore dominate the process: if these are ambiguous, understanding of syntactic information is not facilitated. These suppositions would help explain the results of Scherag et al.'s (2004) study.

====Advantages of bilingual education for children====
It is commonly believed that children are better suited to learning a second language than are adults. However, general second-language research has failed to support the critical period hypothesis in its strong form (i.e., the claim that full language acquisition is impossible beyond a certain age).
According to Linda M. Espinosa, especially in the United States the number of children growing up with a home language that is not English but Spanish is constantly increasing.&lt;ref name="espinosa"&gt;{{Harvnb|Espinosa|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these children have to learn the English language before kindergarten as a second language. It is better for young children to maintain both their home language and their second language. Cultivating their home language, children create their own cultural identity and become aware of their roots. This fact leads to the question whether having the ability to speak two languages helps or harms young children. Research shows that the acquisition of a second language in early childhood confers several advantages, especially a greater awareness of linguistic structures. Furthermore, it is advantageous for young children to grow up bilingually because they do not need to be taught systematically but learn languages intuitively. How fast a child can learn a language depends on several personal factors, such as interest and motivation, and their learning environment. Communication should be facilitated rather than forcing a child to learn a language with strict rules. Education in early childhood can lead to an effective educational achievement for children from various cultural environments.

Another aspect worth considering is that bilingual children are often doing code switching, which does not mean that the child is not able to separate the languages. The reason for code switching is the child's lack of vocabulary in a certain situation. The acquisition of a second language in early childhood broadens children's minds and enriches them more than it harms them. Thus they are not only able to speak two languages in spite of being very young but they also acquire knowledge about the different cultures and environments. It is possible for one language to dominate. This depends on how much time is spent on learning each language.&lt;ref name="espinosa" /&gt;

==Evolutionary explanations==

===Hurford’s model===

In order to provide evidence for the evolutionary functionality of the critical period in language acquisition, {{harvtxt|Hurford|1991}} generated a computer simulation of plausible conditions of evolving generations, based on three central assumptions:

# Language is an evolutionary adaptation that is naturally selected for.
# Any given individual’s language can be quantified or measured.
# Various aspects of maturation and development are under genetic control, which determines the timing for critical periods for certain capacities (i.e. [[polygenic inheritance]]).

According to Hurford's evolutionary model, language acquisition is an adaptation that has survival value for humans, and that knowing a language correlates positively with an individual’s reproductive advantage. This finding is in line with views of other researchers such as Chomsky{{sfn|Chomsky|Huybregts|Riemsdijk|1982}} and {{harvtxt|Pinker | Bloom |1990}}. For example, [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] argue that because a language is a complex design that serves a specific function that cannot be replaced by any other existing capacity, the trait of language acquisition can be attributed to natural selection.

However, while arguing that language itself is adaptive and "did not 'just happen'" (p.&amp;nbsp;172), Hurford suggests that the critical period is not an adaptation, but rather a constraint on language that emerged due to a lack of selection pressures that reinforce acquiring more than one language. In other words, Hurford explains the existence of a critical period with [[genetic drift]], the idea that when there are no selection pressures on multiple alleles acting on the same trait, one of the alleles will gradually diminish through evolution. Because the simulation reveals no evolutionary advantage of acquiring more than one language, Hurford suggests that the critical period evolved simply as a result of a lack of selection pressure.

===Komarova and Nowak's dynamical system===

{{harvtxt|Komarova |Nowak |2001}} supported Hurford's model, yet pointed out that it was limited in the sense that it did not take into account the costs of learning a language. Therefore, they created their own algorithmic model, with the following assumptions:

# Language ability correlates with an individual’s reproductive fitness
# The ability to learn language is inherited
# There are costs to learning a language

Their model consists of a population with constant size, where language ability is a predictor of reproductive fitness. The learning mechanism in their model is based on linguistic theories of {{harvard citations |txt |last=Chomsky|author1-link=Noam Chomsky |year=1980 |year2=1993  }}– the [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) and the notion of [[universal grammar]]. The results of their model show that the critical period for language acquisition is an "[[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS)" (Komarova &amp; Nowak, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1190). They suggest that this ESS is due to two competing selection pressures. First, if the period for learning is short, language does not develop as well, and thus decreases the evolutionary fitness of the individual. Alternatively, if the period for learning language is long, it becomes too costly to the extent that it reduces reproductive opportunity for the individual, and therefore limits reproductive fitness. Therefore, the critical period is an adaptive mechanism that keeps these pressures at equilibrium, and aims at optimal reproductive success for the individual.

The '''EpiDoc''' Collaborative, building recommendations for structured [[markup language|markup]] of [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] documents in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] [[XML]], was originally formed in 2000 by scholars at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]: Tom Elliott, the former director of the Ancient World Mapping Center, with Hugh Cayless and Amy Hawkins. The guidelines have matured considerably through extensive discussion on the [http://lsv.uky.edu/archives/markup.html Markup list] and other discussion fora, at several conferences, and through the experience of various pilot projects. The first major&amp;mdash;but not by any means the only&amp;mdash;epigraphic project to adopt and pilot the EpiDoc recommendations were the Inscriptions of [[Aphrodisias]] and [[Vindolanda Tablets]] Online in 2002-4, and the guidelines reached a degree of stability for the first time in that period. EpiDoc has since been adopted as the native format for the Greek [[Papyrology]] site, Papyri.info.

The EpiDoc [[XML schema|schema]] and guidelines may also be applied, perhaps with some local modification to related palaeographical fields including [[Sigillography]], and [[Numismatics]].

==Guidelines and Schema==
The EpiDoc Guidelines are available in two forms:
# the stable guidelines, released periodically &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/ EpiDoc Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;
# the source code, available in its most up-to-date form in the EpiDoc Sourceforge repository. The Guidelines source files are a series of XML documents, plus XSLT to transform them to the web version. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/guidelines/ SourceForge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EpiDoc Schema is also available in two forms:
# the latest stable version of the schema, which may be linked to directly by XML documents. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/schema/latest/tei-epidoc.rng Latest EpiDoc Schema]&lt;/ref&gt;
# the source code, available in its most up-to-date form in the EpiDoc SourceForge repository. &lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/schema/ EpiDoc ODD at Sourceforge]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
Other tools developed by and for the EpiDoc community include:
* The EpiDoc Reference Stylesheets (XSLT), available from the SourceForge file repository. These stylesheets are also used to deliver the online Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Stylesheets/ EpiDoc Reference Stylesheets]&lt;/ref&gt;
* CHET-C (the Chapel Hill Electronic Text-Converter), an application originally written in VBA, then as a free-standing [[Java (programming language)|Java]] app, and now available as a self-contained [[Javascript]] platform written by Hugh Cayless. &lt;ref&gt;[http://cds.library.brown.edu/projects/chet-c/chetc.html Online CHET-C version]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transcoder: a Java tool for converting between Beta Code, Unicode NF C, Unicode NF D, and GreekKeys encoding for Greek script on the fly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/epidoc/files/Transcoder/ Transcode]&lt;/ref&gt;
* EFES (EpiDoc Front-End Services): an "out of the box" software package for the publication of EpiDoc collections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/EpiDoc/EFES EFES codebase in Github]; [https://github.com/EpiDoc/EFES/wiki/ Documentation and User Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5766">[[File:Eran Tzur.jpg|alt=A man with a guitar and a woman with a microphone|thumb|356x356px|Zur (left) in concert with the guest Efrat Ben-Tsur, 2007]]
'''Eran Zur''' ({{lang-he|ערן צור}}; born 11 July 1965 in [[Kiryat Bialik]]) is an Israeli rock singer and songwriter and prose writer, who started his career in late 1980s. He wrote dozens of songs for himself as well as for other Israeli artists. He mostly plays [[bass guitar]]. One of the characteristics of his songs is strong and explicit accent on love and [[sexuality]].

== Musical career ==

=== First years and Tatu ===
In high school Zur started playing rock songs with Eyal Schechter and Amir Ben-David, who later formed the band [[Avtipus]] in a band with the English name "Mother Brain Crazy", but it didn't record anything.

In 1986, after he graduated from the [[Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music]], Zur formed the band Tatu (טאטו) with his school mates [[Yuval Messner]], Uri Balak and [[Alona Daniel]].  The band released one album, ''Khatokh Tokhen'' (Cut Content). Daniel, who went on to become a successful solo singer, sang most of the songs on it. Zur was the singer on one of the songs ''Bekhatserot bakhoshekh'' (In the Yards in Darkness), which describes the thoughts of a [[rapist]] in [[First-person narrative|first person]]. This song was censored and forbidden for broadcasting on Israeli radio. The band protested against it - in the video for the theme song the band members were shown cutting magnetic tape, and briefly showing the title of the censored song. The band broke up in 1989, though later it reunited several times for concerts.

=== Carmela Gross Wagner ===
After the break-up of Tatu, Zur started another band named Carmela Gross Wagner. The band included Uri Balak, who earlier played in Tatu, as well as Uri Frost and Avshalom Kaspi. Another Tatu band mate Yuval Messner acted as a cello player in several songs and co-wrote some of them - a partnership that continued throughout Zur's career. The band's first album was released in 1991, with most songs written by Zur, one song by [[Meir Ariel]], and several songs by the poet and the [[Gender studies|gender]] researcher Amalia Ziv. The album did not sell well initially, although the song ''Tmuna impressionistit'' (מונה אימפרסיוניסטית, Impressionist Picture), performed with Corinne Allal, became a major radio hit.

in 1992 the guitar player Uri Frost left Carmela Gross Wagner to join [[Rir]]. He was replaced by Dror Orgad and later by Ram Orion, of [[the Top-Hat Carriers]]. Another new band member as Yarona Caspi of Gvanim Kehim, who later went on to be a solo singer.

In 1994 Zur sang in two songs on the album ''Radio Bla Bla'' by [[Natasha's Friends]]. The same band's singer produced Carmela Gross Wagner's second album, ''Iver be-lev yam'' (''Blindfold in the Middle of the Sea''). The album became more popular than its predecessor, producing the hits ''Erev bet kislev'' (partially based on a medieval poem by [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]]) and ''Kayits'' (''Summer''). Both songs were composed by Messner. In 1995 Carmela Gross Wagner broke up although, like Tatu, it played several reunion shows in different line-ups in the years that followed.

=== Solo albums ===
After the success of ''Iver belev yam'' Zur started a series of intimate concerts, with himself on bass guitar and Messner on cello. Despite the unusual line-up, the show garnered very positive reviews and Zur continued staging up for many years to come, gradually adding newer songs.

In 1997 he staged ''Ata khavera sheli'' (''You Are My Girlfriend'', with the [[Grammatical gender|masculine]] form of "you"), a concert based on poems by [[Yona Wallach]]. [[Rona Kenan]], [[Dana International]] and Corinne Allal all performed as guests singers on the concert. An album based on the concert was also released - essentially Zur's first album as a solo artist. The ballad ''Tutim'' (''Strawberries'') becoming a hit despite its highly explicit sexual lyrics.

In 2000 Zur released his first studio solo album ''Takhlit batakhtit''. The album had a mellower pop sound, and generated two radio hits - ''Leilot shel yareakh male'' (Full Moon Nights) and Hu ve-hi (''He and She'').

In 2004 Zur published his first book as a prose writer - ''The Ashman House'' through the [[Keter Publishing House]].

In 2006 he released the album ''Khotekh bekhatakh hazahav'' (''Cutting the Golden Section''). Zur wrote most of the songs, except three - by [[Inbal Perlmuter]], [[Joshua Sobol]] and [[Naim Araidi]].

In 2010 he released ''Kol ma she-enoshi'', (''Anything Human''), with lyrics by himself as well as by [[Yair Hurvitz]], [[Avraham Shlonsky]] and [[Etgar Keret]].

In 2013 he received the Meir Ariel award for Creativity in the Hebrew language.

In addition to playing concerts, Zur is a teacher in the Rimon school, where he studied himself.

'''The flag of the Swedish-speaking Finns''' is an unofficial red [[flag]] with a yellow [[Nordic Cross Flag|cross]] used in the [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking parts of [[Finland]] to represent the [[Finland-Swedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2006 | title = Hur ser Svenskfinland ut om 100 år? | journal = Medborgarbladet | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 20 | publisher = Svenska folkpartiet RP | location = Helsinki | url = http://www.sfp.fi/files/Medborgarblad/MED%204_06.pdf |format=PDF| language = Swedish | accessdate = 2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fotw.net"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fotw.net/flags/xn_fi-se.html|title= Swedish speaking population in Finland|accessdate= 6 June 2008 |author= Engene, Jan Oskar |date= 10 March 1996|publisher= Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be flown in addition to the [[Flag of Finland|Finnish blue and white flag]]. This flag is unfamiliar to many in Finland but there have been attempts to introduce it again to a broader audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fotw.net/flags/xn_fi-se.html|title= Swedish speaking population in Finland|accessdate= 6 June 2008 |author= Engene, Jan Oskar |date= 20 August 2002|publisher= Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; as what is known as "[[Household pennants of Finland|household pennants]]" (Finnish ''isännänviirit'', Swedish ''husbondsvimplar'') demonstrating one's identity as Swedish-speaking, are more common&lt;ref name="Kuriren"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuriren.net/flagga.htm |title=I min iver... |accessdate=6 June 2008 |author=Weegar, Rune |publisher=Kuriren |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921013149/http://www.kuriren.net/flagga.htm |archivedate=21 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen on many flagpoles in areas where there live many Swedish-speaking Finns, especially in countryside.

The flag may have been used in the 16th century,&lt;ref name="Kuriren"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fotw.net/flags/xn_fi-se.html|title= Swedish speaking population in Finland|accessdate= 6 June 2008 |author= "SJ"|date= 9 November 2004|publisher= Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the flag is based on a proposal to [[civil ensign]] put forward by the Senate flag committee in 1917. This proposal included nine white roses in the upper left corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uta.fi/suomi80/art4.htm |title= Suomen lipun historia |accessdate= 6 June 2008 |author= Savolainen, Paula |publisher= Suomi 80 |language= Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains the same colours as one of the candidates for the Finnish flag on independence in 1917 and may even have been a proposal for the state flag itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fotw.net/flags/xn_fi-se.html|title= Swedish speaking population in Finland|accessdate= 6 June 2008 |author= "SJ"|date= 11 November 2004|publisher= Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current blue and white state flag became official on 28 May 1918.

The colours are traditional and based on the red and yellow of the [[Coat of arms of Finland|Finnish coat of arms]] (and can, for example, also be seen in the coat of arms of [[Southwest Finland]]).&lt;ref name="fotw.net"/&gt; The cross design symbolises the unity with the other [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref name="Kuriren"/&gt; There are probably no official decision on the cross width but a width of not less than that of the Swedish flag, (i.e. 5:2:9 horizontally and vertically 4:2:4) and not more than that of Finland (i.e. 5:3:11 horizontally and 4:3:4 vertically) should apply. It has rectangular boxes rather than squares in the internal corners of the hoist. The flag is similar to [[Flag of Skåneland|that of Scania]], but it is more oblong and has a broader and less centred cross.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2961">The '''free floating screed''' is a device pioneered in the 1930s that revolutionized the [[asphalt]] [[Pavement (material)|paving]] process.
The device is designed to flatten the material (e.g. [[concrete]] or [[asphalt]]) below it, which is also known as [[screed]].

== Description ==
[[File:Asphalt_Paver_With_Free_Floating_Screed.png|thumb|right|Key components of an asphalt paving machine with a free-floating screed identified. Not shown is the screed end gate.]]
The free floating [[screed]] has a number of [[forces]] acting on it that, when in [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]], allow the depth behind the screed to be constant.

* Tow arm pull: the force exerted on the screed by the paver dragging it
* [[Mass]]: the weight of the screed
* Resistance of the head of material: the opposing force exerted on the screed by the pile of material in front of the screed. This force depends in turn on the material's [[viscosity]] and mass.

The [[angle]] at which the tow arm pull is exerted on the screed also contributes to the [[Motion (physics)|motion]]; its resultant force is either added or subtracted from the mass of the screed.

If each of these forces is constant, altering the angle of the screed to the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] (angle of attack) will control the amount of material [[extrusion|extruded]] behind the screed. Increasing the angle of attack will cause the screed to climb higher through the pile of material, and therefore raise its trailing edge, increasing the amount of material extruded behind the screed. Similarly, reducing the angle of attack will reduce the amount of material extruded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=frkn9GKaKuUC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=free+floating+screed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k0WK7K0DK5&amp;sig=D44nX7HDLvlKWuX8fk31mjeUNrI&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXhfD9u7jOAhWCOyYKHTS_AvAQ6AEIZTAL#v=onepage&amp;q=free%20floating%20screed&amp;f=false|title=Roadwork: Theory and Practice|author=Door Peter Kendrick et al.|page=199|publisher=Routledge|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free floating screed has become standard because of the smoothing or averaging effect it can have on the existing [[base course]]. Since the only connection between the asphalt paver and the screed is the tow arm, the screed can "float" vertically relative to the paver. This allows the paver to traverse uneven ground while the screed floats over the material placed in front of it.

== Patent ==

The company [[Barber Greene]] dominated the market for free floating screed equipment until the patent expired in 1955, and now all major asphalt paver manufacturers use this design principle in their equipment.

In [[telephony]], a '''functional protocol''' is a type of [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] that is used to carry signaling messages between end points. Such a protocol is used to control the operation of devices at each end of the link. The adjective functional is used to describe protocols that are aware of the system state of the endpoints. [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) is a currently popular protocol for [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP) and other applications. 

Functional protocols, with their awareness of system state, are becoming more popular since they fit the current technology ethos by taking the intelligence of the network to the periphery. They rely on the capability of intelligent end points. This expectation   is compatible with the current technological and economic reality of silicon integration. Functional protocols are the hallmark of the [[dumb network]] architecture that marks the Internet.

Functional protocols allow the customization of applications to end user preferences. This should be contrasted with [[stimulus protocol]] such as [[MiNET]] which carry only event data and are not aware of system state. As a result, stimulus protocols were commonly used in traditional telephony architectures that relied on centralized [[call control]]. With centralization, stimulus protocols allow for more complex and reliable operation than functional because they offer standardized feature sets whose development costs can be amortized over a large number of users.

'''Hogging''' and '''sagging''' describe the shape of a beam or similar long object when loading is applied. Hogging describes a [[beam (structure)|beam]] which curves upwards in the middle, and sagging describes a beam which curves downwards.

==Ships==
Hogging is the stress a ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] or [[keel]] experiences that causes the center or the keel to bend upward. Sagging is the stress a ship's hull or keel is placed under when a wave is the same length as the ship and the ship is in the trough of two waves. This causes the middle of the ship to bend down slightly, and depending of the level of bend, may cause the hull to snap or crack. 

Sagging or dynamic hogging may have been what sank the ''[[Prestige oil spill|Prestige]]'' off Spain on 19 November 2002.

The 2013 loss of container ship ''[[MOL Comfort]]'' off the coast of [[Yemen]] was attributed to hogging. Subsequent lawsuits blamed the shipbuilder for design flaws.

Hogging, or "hog", also refers to the semi-permanent bend in the keel, especially in wooden-hulled ships, caused over time by the ship's center's being more buoyant than the bow or stern.  At the beginning of her 1992 refit, {{USS|Constitution}} had over 13&amp;nbsp;inches (33&amp;nbsp;cm) of hog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Otton|first=Patrick|date=1997-08-11|url=http://www.maritime.org/conf/conf-otton-const.htm|title=USS Constitution Rehabilitation And Restoration|accessdate=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keel blocks in the [[drydock]] were set up especially to support this curve.  During her three years in drydock, the center keel blocks were gradually shortened, allowing the hog to settle out.  Additionally, the diagonal risers specified in her original design to resist hogging, which had been removed in an earlier refit, were restored.  The similar-sized {{USS|Constellation|1854|6}} had 36&amp;nbsp;inches (91&amp;nbsp;cm) of hog before refitting, when she was condemned as unsafe in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c13/constellation-ii.htm |title=Constellation|work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|accessdate=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During loading and discharging cargo, ships bend (hog or sag) due to the distribution of the weights in the various holds and tanks on board.

== Effects on cargo loading ==

Since the maximum amount of cargo that a vessel can load often depends on whether her [[Plimsoll line|Plimsoll mark]] is submerged or not, sagging can reduce her effective cargo capacity—especially if her [[Load-Line|loadline]] has already been reached prematurely due to the sag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Carefully to Carry - Measurement of bulk cargoes|year=May 2008|publisher=UK P &amp; I Club|page=8|url=http://www.ukpandi.com/fileadmin/uploads/uk-pi/LP%20Documents/Carefully_to_Carry/Measurement%20of%20bulk%20cargoes%20-%20draught%20surveys.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is taken into account when calculating [[cargo]], by applying what is called a "3/4 mean draft". This is also called the "two-thirds mean correction", directly derived from [[Simpson's rules (ship stability)|Simpson's first rule]].

A '''horse opera''', '''hoss opera''', or '''oat opera''' is a [[western movie]] or [[TV western|television series]] that is extremely clichéd or formulaic (in the manner of a [[soap opera]]). The term, which was originally coined by silent film-era Western star [[William S. Hart]], is used variously to convey either disparagement or affection. The name "horse opera" was also derived in part from the musical sequences frequently featured in these films and TV series which depicted a cowboy singing to his horse on-screen. The term "horse opera" is quite loosely defined; it does not specify a distinct subgenre of the [[western fiction|western]] (as "[[space opera]]" does with regard to the [[science fiction]] genre).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44013">The '''Integrational theory of language'''&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Heinrich Lieb (ed.), [http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000008405/XIX._Syntactic_methodology_x_an_Integrational_account_I.pdf "Syntactic methodology: an Integrational account I"], 2017, p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; is the general theory of language that has been developed within the general linguistic approach of [[integrational linguistics]].

Differently from most other approaches in [[linguistics]], integrational linguistics emphasizes a distinction between ''theories of language'' and ''theories of language descriptions''. Integrational linguistics has therefore developed both a general theory of language and a theory of linguistic descriptions, the [[integrational theory of grammars]].&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1983. ''Integrational Linguistics. Vol. I: General Outline''. Amsterdam; Philadelphia: Benjamins. (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 17).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb History"&gt;[http://integrational-linguistics.science/+en/hist-en.html Lieb, Hans-Heinrich: "History of Integrational Linguistics: a short outline"]. ''The Homepage of Integrational Linguistics''. (Retrieved April 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The integrational theory of language contains two major subtheories: (i) the '''integrational theory of linguistic variability''', which is 'conflated' with (ii) the '''integrational theory of language systems'''.

One of the most distinctive features of the integrational theory of language is its adherence to [[ontology|ontological]] explicitness and constructiveness: the ontological status of every linguistic [[entity]] postulated by the theory is clearly determined (explicitness), and every entity is a [[logic]]al or [[set theory|set-theoretical]] construct ultimately related to a small number of sets of basic entities that include, in particular, [[physical body|objects]] and events in space-time (constructiveness).&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006"&gt;Sackmann, Robin. 2006. "Integrational Linguistics (IL)". In: Keith Brown (ed.-in-chief). ''Encyclopedia of language and linguistics''. 2nd edition. Oxford: Elsevier. Vol.5. 704–713.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inception, IL has regarded linguistic variability, i.e. the changeability of [[language]]s along dimensions such as time, geographical space, social stratification etc., as an essential property of natural languages that has to be treated in any realistic theory of language; certain idealizations, such as [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] 'completely homogeneous speech-community,' are rejected.

The Integrational Theory of Linguistic Variability thus aims at providing a theoretical framework for variation research (including studies in [[sociolinguistics]], [[dialectology]], and [[historical linguistics]]) and a basis for a realistic theory of language systems. The theory centers around the notion of '[[idiolect]],' in a specific sense of the term that avoids traditional problems: an idiolect is a homogeneous part of an individual speaker's share of a language (a speaker's total share of a language, called a 'personal variety,' is not an idiolect in this sense but is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of idiolects). Such an idiolect, understood as an individual (linguistic) means of [[communication]] of a person during a certain period of time, simultaneously belongs to a certain [[periodization|period]] of the language, to a certain [[dialect]], [[sociolect]], [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]], medial variety, etc. A natural language (understood as a historical language during the entire span of its existence, or a period – a major temporal part – of a historical language) is construed as a set of idiolects, and each variety of the language is a subset of the language. Sets of idiolects (such as languages and their varieties) are called 'communication complexes.' The varieties of a language are given through its 'variety structure': a classification system whose source is the language itself.&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993g"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1993. ''Linguistic variables: Towards a unified theory of linguistic variation''. Amsterdam; Philadelphia: Benjamins. (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 108).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idiolects and idiolect systems===
Ontologically, an idiolect is construed as a (possibly infinite) set of abstract [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]: form-meaning pairs consisting, in the case of a spoken rather than a written or signed idiolect, of a structured phonetic sound [[sequence]] and a meaning of this sequence. For each idiolect in a language, there is a system (idiolect system) that specifies which form-meaning pairs are elements of the idiolect. Every idiolect system consists of (technically: is an ''n''-[[tuple]] whose components are) a phonetic, phonological, morphological, syntactic, lexico-semantic, and sentence-semantic part; and each part determines a different type of properties that the form-meaning pairs must have in order to belong to the idiolect. In written idiolect systems, the [[phonetics|phonetic]] and [[phonology|phonological]] parts are replaced by a [[graphetics|graphetic]] and a [[graphemics|graphematic]] part, in signed idiolect systems by a cheremic and a cherematic part. (There may be other components in addition to the ones listed above; the precise structure of idiolect systems is a matter of ongoing research.) The parts of an idiolect system are grouped into the sound system (script system, chereme system), the morpho-syntactic (or grammatical) subsystem, and the semantic subsystem of the idiolect system. (There is no [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] part or subsystem – 'pragmatic' properties of form-meaning pairs, as far as they are determined by the idiolect system itself, are covered by the semantic subsystem, or else indirectly by the idiolect's place in the variety structure.) Finally, a system for a language (or language variety) is a construct of properties shared by every system of every idiolect in the language (or language variety). Idiolects, varieties, languages, and their systems are all construed as extramental and [[abstract and concrete|abstract]].

Systems of idiolects (idiolect systems) and systems for languages differ from each other both ontologically and in their relation to speakers' minds. Idiolect systems are ''n''-tuples (as specified above) whereas language systems are sets of properties of such ''n''-tuples. Moreover, for every idiolect that is a means of communication for a given speaker, there must be a (psychological and physiological) internal basis in the speaker that corresponds to a system of this idiolect, but there is no such internal basis for entire language systems. From an IL point of view, distinguishing between language systems, idiolect systems, idiolects (themselves no systems), and speaker-internal bases for idiolects is a cornerstone for a realistic theory of natural languages and language use.&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993g" /&gt;

A full representation of the Integrational Theory of Linguistic Variability and discussion of rival theories can be found in Lieb (1993);&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993g" /&gt; for the conceptions of languages and idiolects, see also Lieb (1983),&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b"/&gt; Part A.

==The integrational theory of language systems==

===General features===
The Integrational Theory of Linguistic Variability is conflated with the Integrational Theory of Language Systems. The latter is concerned mainly with (i) making general assumptions on the properties of idiolect systems in arbitrary languages and (ii) developing a conceptual framework, and corresponding terminology, for their description.

The well-known problems in defining a truly universal terminology (applicable in the description of arbitrary languages) in the face of linguistic diversity are tackled in Integrational Linguistics by making a number of essential meta-theoretic distinctions, implicit in linguistic tradition but typically blurred in modern approaches.

Most importantly, a distinction is made between the ''[[definition]]'' of a term and the ''identification'' of corresponding linguistic entities in given idiolect systems. For example, terms such as 'phoneme,' 'suffix,' 'verb,' 'singular,' 'accusative,' etc. are construed not as categorial terms (denoting sets of linguistic entities) but as names of two-place [[binary relation|relations]] ('is-a-phoneme-of,' 'is-a-suffix-of,' etc.) between linguistic entities and idiolect systems ''S'' (e.g., SLEEP is-a-verb-of S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, SCHLAFEN is-a-verb-of S&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, where S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; are, respectively, an English and a German idiolect system: one and the same relation [is-a-]verb[-of] holds between SLEEP and S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, SCHLAFEN and S&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.). Names for categories of a given idiolect system are then derived from such relational terms: the expression 'verb of S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;' denotes the set of all verbs of S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; (a category), i.e., denotes the set of all linguistic entities that are related to idiolect system S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; by the relation [is a ]verb[ of]. While the relational term 'verb' is ''defined'' in the Integrational Theory of Language Systems so as to allow for ''arbitrary'' idiolect systems, the corresponding categories (verb in S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, verb in S&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.) must be ''identified'' in a grammar for individual idiolect systems, and the identifying properties may vary greatly among the systems of idiolects in different languages or even within a single language. It is a task not of a general theory of language but of theories of individual languages or language varieties – e.g., of individual grammars – to formulate identifying properties for the entities (categories, etc.) postulated for the idiolect systems of a given language (or variety). (Consider, for instance, a language in whose idiolect systems ''S'' all infinitive forms of verbs – and only such forms – have a certain prefix, giving rise to an identifying property for the category infinitive-in-''S'' in the idiolect systems of this language. Clearly, this criterion should not be used to define the term 'infinitive' in a general theory of language.) Given this distinction, a term like 'verb' may be ''defined'' by means of word- or sentence-semantic criteria; the syntactic nature of the corresponding categories in individual idiolect systems is still guaranteed by the fact that the categories can be ''identified'' by resort to the syntactic means of the idiolect systems (morphological marking, word order, intonation) and, possibly, properties of lexical meanings. Defining a term in a general theory of language does not, however, imply that there are corresponding entities in all idiolect systems (for instance, we can formulate a general definition of 'adjective' although there may be languages without adjectives).&lt;ref name="Budde 2000"&gt;Budde, Monika. 2000. ''Wortarten: Definition und Identifikation''. Doct. diss. Freie Universität Berlin. [Published on microfiche.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993a"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1993. "Integrational Linguistics". In: Joachim Jacobs, Arnim von Stechow, Wolfgang Sternefeld, and Theo Vennemann (eds). ''Syntax: Ein internationales Handbuch zeitgenössischer Forschung / An International Handbook of Contemporary Research''. Vol.1. Berlin etc.: de Gruyter. (= Handbücher zur Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft 9.1). 430–468.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements of a category in a given idiolect system may, and usually will, have additional relevant properties not needed for identifying the category. (In the above example, the infinitive forms may show certain tense distinctions.) Such properties must still be included in a ''complete characterization'' of the category. Finally, each entity proposed by a general theory of language or by a theory of an individual language, variety, or idiolect should also be ''justified'' by metatheoretic considerations. Consider, for example, the set of all adjective forms of a given English idiolect system whose sound sequences start with /bl/. Such a set should hardly be postulated as a syntactic category of this idiolect system, even though the set would easily be identified, and a corresponding term would easily be defined.&lt;ref name="Budde 2000" /&gt;

From an IL point of view, distinguishing between the definition of a term, the identification and characterization of a corresponding entity in an individual idiolect system, and the justification for postulating such an entity in a theory of a specific language, is a prerequisite both for formulating a general theory of language (one of the main goals of linguistics) and for successfully integrating theories of individual languages or language varieties with such a theory. Integrational Linguistics appears to be the only modern approach to explicitly adopt the fourfold distinction between definition, identification, characterization and justification, implicit in Western linguistic tradition with its insistence on the ''semantic'' definition of many general terms used in identifying ''syntactic'' entities as described in individual grammars. — For a detailed discussion of the underlying metatheoretic principles, see, in particular, Budde (2000):&lt;ref name="Budde 2000" /&gt; chapter 1; for an application in a general theory of parts of speech, using German for orientation, see Budde (2000): chapters 2–10.

Reflecting the basic structure of spoken idiolect systems (see above), the Integrational Theory of Language Systems comprises Integrational Phonology, Integrational Morpho-Syntax (with Integrational Morphology and Integrational Syntax), and Integrational Semantics (Integrational Lexical Semantics, including morpho-semantics and word semantics, and Integrational Sentence Semantics). For medial types of idiolect systems other than the spoken one, suitable subtheories – corresponding to Integrational Phonology – are provided for but have not yet been worked out in detail (Integrational Graphematics for written, Integrational Cherematics for signed idiolect systems).

The most detailed representation to date of the Integrational Theory of Language Systems as a whole (excluding Integrational Phonology) is found in Lieb (1983):&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt; parts B to F); for Integrational Syntax see also Lieb (1993),&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993a" /&gt; for Integrational Semantics Lieb (1979,&lt;ref name="Lieb 1979c"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1979.

===Integrational phonology===
Integrational Phonology is a 'declarative' two-level [[phonology]] that postulates two distinct levels (or 'parts') in the sound system of any idiolect system, a less abstract phonetic and a more abstract phonological one. Phonetic and phonological sounds are both conceived as sets of [[auditory phonetics|auditory]] properties of speech-sound events, hence, as [[abstract and concrete|abstract]] real-world entities. (Speech-sound events are [[abstract and concrete|concrete]] entities, located in space-time.) [[phoneme|Phonological sounds]] differ from [[phone (phonetics)|phonetic]] ones by a higher degree of abstraction: While sounds on the phonetic level (i.e., part) of an idiolect system contain all properties that characterize normal utterances of entities of the idiolect system, phonological sounds contain only those properties that are functional in the idiolect system, i.e., are relevant with respect to distinctions in the morphological, syntactic, or semantic parts of the system.&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1998b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 2008" /&gt;

Phonological words and morphs (on the phonological level) as well as phonetic words (on the phonetic level) are construed as 'structured sound sequences,' that is, ordered pairs consisting of (1) a phonetic or phonological sound sequence (called the 'basis' of the morph or word) and (2) a phonetic or phonological structure of the sound sequence – itself a pair of (2a) a [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] structure and (2b) an intonation structure of the sound sequence. ('Sequence' is understood in the Integrational Theory of Language in a specific, set-theoretical sense that allows for the limiting cases of empty and one-member or 'unit sequences.') The constituent structure relates parts of the sound sequence to one of the sound categories Vocalic-in-''S'', Consonantal-in-''S'', and VocalicGroup-in-''S'', thereby determining a syllable sequence (possibly empty) for the sound sequence. The sound categories (simultaneously belonging to the phonetic and the phonological level) are uniformly construed as sets not of individual sounds but of sound ''sequences'' of the idiolect system, allowing a treatment of [[affricate consonant|affricates]] and long [[consonant]]s (elements of Consonantal-in-''S''), [[diphthong]]s and long [[vowel]]s (elements of Vocalic-in-''S'') and the like alongside simple vowels and consonants. The intonation structure assigns sets of 'auditory values' ([[pitch accent (intonation)|pitches]], degrees of loudness, [[phonation]] modes etc.) to the [[syllable]]s of a (syllabic) sound sequence identified by the constituent structure. [[prosody (linguistics)|Prosodic]] phenomena in both [[accent (phonetics)|accent]] languages and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] languages are then treated in a unified way: differences of tone or stress are represented through sets of auditory values directly within a specific component of a phonological word, namely, the phonological intonation structure, which is properly linked to the (syntactic) intonation structures of syntactic units in which the phonological word occurs; and tone languages differ from accent languages mainly in the way phonological intonation structures are 'processed' in syntactic intonation structures. The constituents of a structured sound sequence are connected through phonological relations (p-nucleus, p-complement, p-modifier).&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1998b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 2008" /&gt;

The phonetic-phonological properties of an idiolect system are to a large degree determined by the way sound sequences combine to form more complex ones, and the way phonetic sound sequences are related to phonological ones. There is a 'connection function' on the phonological level that takes pairs of structured sound sequences and assigns to each pair another such sequence, and a 'connection function' on the phonetic level that takes such pairs and assigns to each pair a ''set'' of structured sound sequences. Both levels are connected through a 'variant relation' relating structured phonetic sound sequences to structured phonological sound sequences. While the two connection functions jointly represent the '[[phonotactics]]' of the idiolect system, the variant relation is only partly analogous to the '[[allophone]]' relation in [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] phonology and avoids its problems (treatment of diphthongs, affricates etc.) by connecting structured phonetic with structured phonological sound ''sequences'' instead of connecting individual sounds. Phonetic variants of a complex structured phonological sound sequence may be determined not only phonetically but also phonologically, by underlying sequences on the phonological level. The variant relation is postulated as a third component of the sound system of an idiolect system, in addition to its phonetic and phonological parts.&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1998b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 2008" /&gt;

===Integrational syntax and morphology===
Integrational Syntax is akin in spirit to [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], notwithstanding basic differences, and includes essential ideas of [[valency (linguistics)|Valency Grammar]]. Among modern approaches to syntax, Integrational Syntax may well be closest to the grammatical tradition as it has developed in the West since antiquity. In particular, Integrational Syntax is Word-and-Paradigm, an orientation that has recently been gaining followers also elsewhere in linguistics. Integrational Syntax is a surface syntax: no '[[deep structure]]s' and no empty syntactic units or categories are allowed; true, an 'empty phonological word,' properly defined, is assumed for the treatment of phenomena such as [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]], and the empty sequence is used to deal with so-called optional complements. Integrational Syntax is also a 'syntax as a basis for semantics' in the sense that every meaning of a complex syntactic unit is obtained from the lexical meanings of its primitive meaningful parts on the basis of one of its structures. (The nature of lexical meanings is specified in Integrational Lexical Semantics, while ontological questions regarding syntactic meanings and the details of syntactic-semantic meaning composition are treated in Integrational Sentence Semantics.)&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993a" /&gt;

Among the syntactic entities postulated in Integrational Syntax for the syntactic part of arbitrary idiolect systems, there are: syntactic base forms, syntactic units, syntactic [[Inflection#Inflectional_paradigm|paradigms]], lexical words, syntactic categories (either syntactic unit categories or word categories), syntactic structures, and syntactic functions.

A syntactic unit of an idiolect system is a sequence of syntactic base forms. (Again, unit sequences, but not the empty sequence, are allowed as a limiting case of syntactic units, that is, a syntactic unit may contain a single syntactic base form.) In a system of a spoken idiolect, the syntactic base forms are precisely the phonological words occurring in the phonological part of the system (analogously, for systems of written and signed idiolects).

It is an essential feature of Integrational Syntax that a clear distinction is made between lexical words and forms of lexical words (called 'syntactic word forms' or simply 'syntactic words'): every lexical word is an ordered pair consisting of a syntactic paradigm or 'word paradigm' (the form component of the word) and a concept that is a meaning of the paradigm (the meaning component of the word); a syntactic paradigm is a (non-empty) set of pairs, each consisting of a syntactic word form and a 'categorization' of the word form, that is, a set of syntactic categories such that the word form is an element of each category in the set; and any syntactic word form is also a syntactic unit, hence, a sequence (possibly, a unit sequence) of syntactic base forms (phonological words in the case of spoken idiolects). A given syntactic word form may combine with several categorizations within a single paradigm ([[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]]); and a single paradigm may have a number of different meanings ([[polysemy]]), which leads to the same number of different lexical words (identical in their form components). Both the notion of paradigm and the notion of concept are generalized so as to allow for lexical words also where traditionally one would not speak either of a paradigm or of a lexical meaning.&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993a" /&gt;

Given the distinction between syntactic units (including syntactic word forms) and lexical words, two main types of syntactic categories are postulated for the syntactic part of any idiolect system. Type 1 syntactic categories (also called 'syntactic unit categories') are sets of syntactic units of the idiolect system, and include the syntactic constituent categories as well as word form categories like [[grammatical case|cases]], [[grammatical number|numbers]], [[grammatical tense|tenses]], and [[definiteness]] categories. The type 1 syntactic categories of an idiolect system are given through a classification system (a system of cross- and sub-classifications) on the set of all syntactic units of the idiolect system, called the 'Syntactic Unit Ordering.' Type 2 syntactic categories (also called 'word categories') are sets of lexical words. They include the '[[part of speech|parts of speech]]' of the idiolect system and their subcategories. The type 2 categories are given by the 'Lexical Word Ordering', a classification system on the set of all lexical words of the idiolect system. Both the Syntactic Unit Ordering and the Lexical Word Ordering are components of the syntactic part of an idiolect system.&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993a" /&gt;

Any syntactic unit can be assigned at least one syntactic structure. The syntactic structures of a unit are to jointly represent all formal information (including [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]) that is relevant with respect to the syntactic meanings of the unit. This is achieved by construing the syntactic structures of a syntactic unit as triples consisting of (i) a constituent structure, (ii) a marking structure, and (iii) an intonation structure of the unit. The ''constituent structure'' identifies [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] of the unit by associating certain parts of the unit with syntactic constituent categories like Noun form, Verb form, Verb Group etc., and captures the positions of syntactic base forms within the unit. The formal conception of constituent structures developed in IL allows for easy surface treatment of discontinuous constituents (whose proper treatment was a key motivation, in early [[Generative Grammar]], for deep structures) and avoids any restriction to [[branching (linguistics)|binary branching]] with its well-known empirical problems. The ''marking structure'' contains additional categorial information beyond what is provided by the constituent structure. Each primitive constituent of the syntactic unit, that is, each occurrence of a form of a lexical word in the unit, is assigned a 'marking': a set of pairs each consisting of two sets of categories. The first set contains syntactic unit categories of which the word form itself is an element; more specifically, the set is identical with a categorization the word form has in the paradigm of a lexical word to which the word form belongs; if the word form has several categorizations in the paradigm, then all these categorizations appear as first components of pairs in the marking of the primitive constituent, thus, the marking has several elements. The second set contains word categories (in particular, government categories) characterizing the lexical word itself. Finally, the ''intonation structure'' is a sequence of modified intonation structures of the syntactic base forms occurring in the syntactic unit. The syntactic intonation structure is crucial for syntactic accents and for the distinction of sentence types (as far as this is based on intonation patterns).&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993a" /&gt;

Traditional [[grammatical relation]]s such as [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]], [[grammatical modifier|attribute]], etc. are reconstructed in Integrational Syntax as functions ('grammatical functions') taking 'syntactic quadruples' as their arguments. Each quadruple consists of (i) a syntactic unit (or concatenation of units) of an idiolect system, (ii) a syntactic structure the unit or concatenation has in the system, (iii) an assignment of lexical meanings to the primitive constituents contained in the unit given the structure and the system (called a 'lexical interpretation'), and (iv) the system itself. The values of such grammatical functions are two-(or more)-place relations among constituents of the syntactic unit. (Grammatical functions are only one type of 'constituent functions,' which also include 'scope functions' like negation and qualification, and 'phoric functions' like antecedent; and there are other types of syntactic functions besides the constituent functions.) Syntactic functions play a central role, via their semantic content, in the [[principle of compositionality|composition process]] by which syntactic meanings of a syntactic unit are constructed from the lexical meanings of its primitive constituents. Incorporating features of Valency Grammar, Integrational Syntax construes subject and object functions as derived from more basic complement functions that simultaneously cover all complements of a single verbal nucleus; it generalizes the notion of valency to arbitrary lexical words, excluding purely auxiliary words.&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993a" /&gt;

This reconstruction of traditional conceptions, which distinguishes between (universal) syntactic functions on the one hand and their values for individual syntactic quadruples on the other, again allows to formulate general ''definitions'' for the names of syntactic functions in the Integrational Theory of Language and to ''identify'' their occurrences in the syntactic units of specific idiolect systems by statements in a grammar. Such identification, relative to the syntactic structure and lexical interpretation contained in a given syntactic quadruple, typically depends on the marking structure more than on other components of the syntactic structure, or the lexical interpretation. In particular, government categories, given through classifications in the Lexical Word Ordering and contained in the marking structure, are crucial to identifying the values of the complement functions relative to the syntactic quadruple. Type 1 categories, contained in the marking structure, may also play a role in the identification of syntactic function values. For example, the identification of subject constituents as opposed to object constituents may depend on case categories (cf. German ''Der Kellner'' [NOM] ''mochte sie''. 'The waiter liked her.' vs. ''Den Kellner'' [ACC] ''mochte sie''. 'The waiter she liked.').&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993a" /&gt;

Integrational Morphology, concerned with the analysis of phonological words (and other medial types of syntactic base forms) into meaningful parts, is largely analogous to Integrational Syntax. The morphological entities postulated for any idiolect system are morphological base forms, units, paradigms, categories, structures, and functions as well as lexemes. Morphological base forms (morphs) are entities of the same ontological type as syntactic base forms, structured phonological sound sequences in the case of a spoken idiolect; morphological units are sequences of morphological base forms; and 'lexemes' are conceived as ordered pairs consisting of a morphological paradigm and a concept that is a meaning of the paradigm, similarly to the lexical words in syntax. For any syntactic base form there is a 'morphological analysis': a pair consisting of a morphological unit and a morphological structure of the unit. A morphological unit that is the first component in an analysis of a syntactic base form is a 'morphological word.' A morphological structure of
a morphological unit is a triple consisting of a morphological constituent structure, marking structure, and intonation structure. Two main types of morphological categories are assumed. Type 1 morphological categories (also called 'morphological unit categories'), given through the 'Morphological Unit Ordering' of an idiolect system, are sets of morphological units; they include morphological constituent categories, maximally, [[word stem|Stem]] form, [[Affix]] form, and Stem Group, as well as possible subcategories of Stem form and Affix form. Cross-linguistically, there must be stem forms in the idiolect systems of any language whereas the categories Affix form and Stem Group need not occur. Type 2 morphological categories ('lexeme categories') are sets of lexemes and are given through the 'Lexeme Ordering' of the idiolect system. They include the top-level lexeme categories Stem and Affix (comparable to the parts of speech in syntax) and their subcategories. Morphological functions (e.g., morphological complement, modifier, and nucleus) are comparable to grammatical functions in syntax in taking 'morphological quadruples' as their arguments and assigning relations among morphological constituents as values. They figure, via their semantic content, in morphosemantic meaning composition.&lt;ref name="Lieb 1983b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;

The ''[[lexicon]]'' of an idiolect system is construed as a pair consisting of the ''lexeme lexicon'' and the ''word lexicon''. The former is the set of all lexemes (hence, the source of the Lexeme Ordering), and the latter is the set of all lexical words (hence, the source of the Lexical Word Ordering), of the idiolect system.&lt;ref name="Lieb 1993a" /&gt;

===Integrational semantics===
Integrational Semantics treats lexical meanings (i.e., meanings of morphological or syntactic paradigms and their forms) as entities entirely different from syntactic meanings (meanings of simple or complex syntactic constituents obtained through syntactic meaning composition). Consequently, meaning composition, too, is construed differently for lexical and for syntactic meanings. Integrational Lexical Semantics (with Integrational Morphosemantics and Integrational Word Semantics as its parts) combines the psychological and the realist traditions in semantics. Lexical meanings are construed as [[concept]]s in a psychological sense: an ''n''-place concept (with ''n'' &gt; 0) is the property of being a (human) perception or conception in whose content a certain non-empty set of ''n''-place attributes of real-world entities occurs as a subset. The set of attributes is called the (''n''-place) intension of the concept, and the set of real-world entities that have all attributes is called its (''n''-place) extension. The extension but not the intension may be empty. In the case of a 1-place concept, the attributes in the intension are properties, and the extension is a set of individual real-world objects. If ''n'' &gt; 1, the attributes are ''n''-place intensional relations between real-world entities, and the extension is the set of ''n''-tuples of real-world entities among which the ''n''-place relations in the intension hold. Such 'relational concepts' typically occur as lexical meanings of verbs and adpositions (prepositions, etc.) but also of other kinds of relational words. The only concept for which the notions of intension and extension are not defined is the (0-place) 'empty concept,' occurring as the meaning component of lexical words such as auxiliaries and modal particles, and of all affixes, that is, of linguistic entities whose contribution to meaning composition is not based on lexical meanings. Given the notion of empty concept, the IL conception of concepts is both flexible and powerful enough to assign meanings to lexical words of any kind.&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1979c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1980k" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1992c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1992b"&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1992. "Integrational Linguistics: Outline of a theory of language". In: Hans-Heinrich Lieb (ed.). ''Prospects for a New Structuralism''. Amsterdam; Philadelphia: Benjamins. (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 96). 127–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

A conception is a mental state, and a perception a mental event, located in the brain of an individual. By identifying concepts not with such mental entities but with (extra-mental) properties of mental entities, Integrational Lexical Semantics can account for the potential intersubjectivity of concepts, a problem that any psychological meaning conception must face: while perceptions and conceptions are tied to an individual, a concept may well be a property shared by perceptions or conceptions located in different individuals.

Lexical meaning composition is based on morphosemantic composition functions whose arguments
are (''n''-tuples of) concepts and whose values are again concepts. Such semantic functions occur in
the semantic content of morphological functions such as morphological complement, modifier, and nucleus, and operate on the basis of (morphological or semantic) application conditions.

In Integrational Sentence Semantics, sentence meanings are construed as intensional relations between potential utterances and potential speakers. For any syntactic unit that has a sentence meaning, the meanings of the unit jointly represent a necessary condition for successful utterances of the unit. Each (simple) sentence meaning consists of at least (i) a referential part: a set containing exactly one 'referential meaning' for each [[referential expression]] of the syntactic unit; (ii) a propositional part: a pair consisting of a directive part (determining a speech act type) and a proposition; and (iii) a propositional background, consisting of what the speaker co-expresses with the proposition. The referential part and the propositional background of a sentence meaning may be empty.

Syntactic meaning composition is based on semantic composition functions associated with (i) the syntactic functions in an idiolect system, by the 'syntactic function interpretation,' (ii) with syntactic categories like tense or definiteness categories, by the 'syntactic category interpretation' (both are components of the sentence-semantic part of the idiolect system). Syntactic meaning composition starts from the lexical meanings of the primitive constituents in a syntactic quadruple: 'basic syntactic meanings' are pairs of a concept, assigned to a primitive constituent by the lexical interpretation, and a 'contextual embedding' of the concept that involves potential speakers and utterances. Next, basic syntactic meanings are transformed into 'intermediate syntactic meanings' for non-primitive constituents by means of syntactic-semantic composition functions that are associated in the idiolect system with syntactic functions such as complement and modifier. Finally, the intermediate (and, possibly, basic) meanings are further processed by semantic functions that are associated with the syntactic nucleus function, so as to yield 'complete syntactic meanings,' which are either referential meanings or sentence meanings.&lt;ref name="Sackmann 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1979c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1980k" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1992c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb 1992b" /&gt;

It appears that Integrational Sentence Semantics combines the meaning-as-use tradition in seman-
tics (relating sentence meanings to speakers and utterances) with features of the psychological tradition (lexical meanings as concepts in a psychological sense, speaker attitudes as essential to sentence meanings) and with features of the realist tradition (e.g., extra-mental status of lexical and of syntactic meanings, the compositionality principle for complex meanings).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6524">In linguistics, '''inverse copular constructions''', named after Moro (1997), are a type of [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] in English where canonical SCP word order (&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ubject-[[Copula (linguistics)|&lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;opula]]-[[Predicative expression|&lt;u&gt;p&lt;/u&gt;redicative expression]], e.g. ''Fred is the plumber'') is reversed in a sense, so that one appears to have the order PCS instead (&lt;u&gt;p&lt;/u&gt;redicative expression-&lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;opula-&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ubject, e.g. ''The plumber is Fred''). The verb in these constructions is always the copula ''be'' (''am'', ''are'', ''is'', ''was'', ''were''). Inverse copular constructions are intriguing because they render the distinction between subject and predicative expression difficult to maintain. The confusion has led to focused study of these constructions,&lt;ref&gt;Inverse copular constructions have been explored in great depth. See Moro (1997) for the original proposal, Heycock and Kroch (1998), Pereltsvaig (2001), Mikkelsen (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and their impact on the theory of grammar may be great since they appear to challenge the initial binary division of the sentence (S) into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] [[verb phrase]] (VP) (S → NP VP), this division being at the core of all [[phrase structure grammar]]s (as opposed to [[dependency grammar]]s, which do not acknowledge the binary division).

== Examples ==
Inverse copular constructions involve nouns and noun phrases, but they do not allow the post-copula nominal to be a personal pronoun:

::a. '''The cause of the riot is''' a picture on the wall.
::b. A picture on the wall '''is the cause of the riot'''. {{small|- Inverse copular construction}}
::c. *A picture on the wall '''is it'''. {{small|- Post-verb subject cannot be a personal pronoun.}}

::a. '''Fred is''' the plumber.
::b. The plumber '''is Fred'''. {{small|- Inverse copular construction}}
::c. *The plumber '''is he'''. {{small|- Post-verb subject cannot be a personal pronoun.}}

The defining trait of the inverse copular constructions is that two counts of inversion appear to have occurred: the normal subject has inverted to a post-verb position, and the predicative nominal has inverted to the pre-verb position. The verb is a finite form of the copula 'be' (''am'', ''are'', ''is'', ''was'', ''were''). This type of inversion is generally NOT possible with other verbs.

== Subject-verb agreement ==
Inverse copular constructions where the inverted predicative expression is a noun phrase are noteworthy in part because subject-verb agreement can (at least in English) be established with the pre-verb predicative NP as opposed to with the post-verb subject NP, e.g.

::a. '''The pictures are''' a problem. {{small|- Canonical word order, standard subject-verb agreement}}
::b. A problem '''is/&lt;sup&gt;??&lt;/sup&gt;are the pictures'''. {{small|- Inverse copular construction, subject-verb agreement reversed in a sense}}

::a. '''Those kids are''' an annoyance. {{small|- Canonical word order, standard subject-verb agreement}}
::b. An annoyance '''is/&lt;sup&gt;??&lt;/sup&gt;are those kids'''. {{small|- Inverse copular construction, subject-verb agreement reversed in a sense}}

In the inverse copular constructions, the copula agrees with the singular predicative expression to its left as opposed to with the plural subject to its right. This phenomenon seems to be limited to English (and possibly French); it does not occur in related languages such as German, e.g.

::a. '''Die Bilder sind''' ein Problem. {{small|- Canonical subject-verb agreement}}
:::'The pictures are a problem.'

::b. Ein Problem '''sind/*ist die Bilder'''. {{small|- Plural agreement with inverted subject maintained}}
:::'A problem are/is the pictures.'

Nor does it occur in some Romance languages, e.g. Italian:

::a. '''Queste foto sono''' la causa della rivolta. {{small|- Canonical subject-verb agreement}}
:::'These photos are the cause of the revolt.'

::b. La causa della rivolta '''sono/*è queste foto'''. {{small|- Plural agreement with inverted subject maintained}}
:::'The cause of the revolt are/is the photos.'

The fact that English (unlike German and Italian) demands subject-verb agreement to occur with the pre-verb NP generates confusion about what should qualify as the subject NP. From a morphological point of view, the pre-verb NP in inverse copular constructions should count as the subject, but from the perspective of information structure (e.g. definiteness, old information, specificity), the post-verb NP should be the subject.

== Importance for the theory of grammar ==
Inverse copular constructions challenge one of the major dogmas of the theory of [[clause]] or [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] structure, i.e. that the two basic constituents of a sentence - the noun phrase (NP) and the verb phrase (VP) - are associated with the logical/grammatical functions of [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and predicate (cf. [[phrase structure rules]] and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]). In fact, copular sentences that maintain the canonical groupings are not adequate on empirical grounds, since a very unorthodox left-branching structure is necessary, or if one rejects the canonical groupings and positions the subject inside a VP-like constituent, then one has to assume that the subject NP and copula verb can form a type of VP to the exclusion of the predicative expression.

&lt;!--[[Image:Kemeny Janos.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Kemény János]]--&gt;

[[Baron]] '''János Kemény''' ([[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], 5 September 5 1903 – [[Târgu Mureş]], 13 October 1971) was a Hungarian writer, theater director, dramatist, and founder of the [[Brâncoveneşti, Mureş|Marosvécs/Brâncoveneşti]] Helikon community.

==Lifetime==
János Kemény's mother, the actress Ida Berenice Mitchell (1871-1956), lost her husband, István Kemény, shortly after János was born and could not afford to support her four children. She therefore moved from the United States to her grandfather's house in [[Transylvania]] in 1904. János attended the Reformed College (denominational high school) in [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsvár/Cluj]], and then enrolled in the fall of 1921 at the College of Land Cultivation in [[Vienna]]. He was married in 1923 to a woman of Scottish-Greek origin, Augusta Paton, daughter of [[William Roger Paton]], and they had six children.

In 1926, János Kemény and Aladár Kuncz organized a literary conference of [[Hungarians in Transylvania|Transylvanian Hungarians]] at Kemény's estate in Brâncoveneşti, Mureş (Marosvécs) County. This led to the formation of the Helikon community, which from 1928 published the influential Hungarian literary periodical ''[[Erdélyi Helikon]]''. In 1930, Kemény was awarded the Corvin Wreath by the Hungarian Government.&lt;ref&gt;List of persons who were decorated with the [http://www.akm.externet.hu/rendjel/adatok/tudos/nevsor.htm Corvin decoration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915060623/http://www.akm.externet.hu/rendjel/adatok/tudos/nevsor.htm |date=2007-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ten years from 1931, he headed the Hungarian Thália Theater in Kolozsvár/Cluj and also published literary work. Then from 1945 to 1952 he was among the founding organizers of the [[Székely]] theatre in [[Târgu Mureş]] (Marosvásárhely). However, he was obliged to do manual work in the communist period, before later finding a job in the library of [[Târgu Mureş]] (Marosvásárhely) art college and working on the Hungarian-language magazine ''Új Élet'' in the same city. A succession of his works appeared between 1957 and his death in 1971, but he managed to complete only one volume of a planned autobiography.

==Selected works==
*His first writing "Emlékezetem" ([[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], 1921) (My memories)
*Kutyakomédia (Poor Comedy, [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], 1934)

The '''lexical diversity''', or type-token ratio (TTR), of a given text is defined as the ratio of different unique word stems (types) to the total number of words ([[Type-token distinction|tokens]]). The term is used in [[applied linguistics]] and related fields as an equivalent to lexical richness.

A problem with the lexical diversity measure is that text samples containing large number of tokens give lower values for TTR since it is often necessary for the writer or speaker to re-use several [[function words]]. One consequence of this is that lexical diversity is better used for comparing texts of equal length.&lt;ref&gt;Lexical diversity and lexical density in speech and writing: A developmental perspective - V Johansson - Working Papers in Linguistics, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
==Definitions==
In a 2013 article [[Scott Jarvis]] proposed that lexical diversity, similar to diversity in ecology, is a perceptual phenomenon. Lexical redundancy is a positive counterpart of lexical diversity in the same way as lexical variability is the mirror image of repetition. According to Jarvis's model, lexical diversity includes variability, volume, evenness, rarity, dispersion and disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2012.00739.x/abstract|title=Capturing the Diversity in Lexical Diversity|date=2013|publisher=[[Language Learning (journal)|Language Learning]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jarvis, the six properties of lexical diversity should be measured by the following indices.

'''Low Bergish''', or '''Western Bergish''', is a group of [[local language]]s of the [[Bergisches Land|Bergisches Land Region]] east of the [[Rhine]] in West Germany. It is part of the [[Limburgish language]] group, which extends far beyond the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Meuse (river)|Maas]] into the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. They are also part of the East Limburgish group, that is, the varieties of Limbugish spoken in Germany. They combine [[Low Franconian]] properties with some [[Ripuarian (language)|Ripuarian]] properties and are seen as the transitory dialects between them in the [[dialect continuum]] of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language|German]].

Low Bergish neighbors in the east to [[East Bergish]], a variety of [[South Guelderish]] between the [[Limburgish language]] and [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]]. In the south of Low Bergish is the [[Benrath line]], border to the [[Ripuarian languages|Ripuarian]] variety [[Upper Bergish]] or [[East Ripuarian]].

Low Bergish is also seen as parts of [[Meuse-Rhenish]], which names a somewhat larger number of dialects. than the three groups having names with Bergish.

As opposed to linguists, laymen usually call their local Low Bergisch variety simply ''[[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]'' or ''"Platt"'' ([[:de:Platt]]); they do not distinguish between the dialect groups, when talking about local languages. People from outside the [[Rhineland]] often make even less distinctions and use the term ''[[Rhinelandic]]'' for the vernacular of an even larger region than Meuse-Rhenish.

==History==
The Low Bergish dialects were called only "Bergish" by early dialect geographers of Germany of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;See also: Georg Wenker: Das rheinische Platt, 1877, which had been written down few decades earlier.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

The [[phoneme]] inventory of the '''[[Marathi language]]''' is similar to that of many other [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. An [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] chart of all contrastive sounds in Marathi is provided below.

== Vowels ==
Vowels in native words are:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Vowels
! || Front || Central || Back
|-
! High
| {{IPA|i iː}} || || {{IPA|u uː}}
|-
! Mid
| {{IPA|e}} || {{IPA|ə}} || {{IPA|o}}
|-
! Low
| || {{IPA|a}} ||
|}

There are no nasal vowels.

Like other [[Abugida|alphasyllabaries]], Devanagari writes out syllables by adding vowel [[diacritic]]s to consonant bases. The table below includes all the vowel symbols used in Marathi, along with a transliteration of each sound into [[Latin script]] and [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Devanagari
| अ || आ || इ || ई || उ || ऊ || ऋ || ए || ऐ || ओ || औ || अं || अः
|-
! Transliterated
| a || ā || i || ī || u || ū || ṛ || e || ai || o || au || aṃ || aḥ
|-
! IPA

|-

| {{Multi-listen item small|filename=MRv13-ru.ogg|title=ru|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}
| {{Multi-listen item small|filename=MRv07-e.ogg|title=a|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

| {{Multi-listen item small|filename=MRv12-aha.ogg|title=aha|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}
|}

Marathi furthermore contrasts {{ipa|/əi, əu/}} with {{ipa|/ai, au/}}.

There are two more vowels in Marathi to denote the pronunciations of English words such as of {{IPA|/æ/}} in ''act'' and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in ''all''. These are written as {{angbr|अ‍ॅ}} and {{angbr|ऑ}}.

Marathi retains several features of Sanskrit that have been lost in north-Indian Sanskrit-based languages such as Hindi and Bengali, especially in terms of pronunciation of vowels and consonants. For instance, Marathi retains the original Sanskrit pronunciation of {{angbr|अं}} {{IPA|[əⁿ]}}, {{angbr|ऐ}} {{IPA|[əi]}}, and {{angbr|औ}} {{IPA|[əu]}}. However, as was done in Gujarati, Marathi speakers tend to pronounce ऋ {{IAST|ṛ}} somewhat similar to {{IPA|[ru]}}, unlike most other Indic languages which changed it to {{IPA|[ri]}} (e.g. the original Sanskrit pronunciation of the language's name was ''{{IAST|saṃskṛtam}}'', while in day-to-day Marathi and Gujarati it is ''{{IAST|saṃskrut}}''. In other Indic languages, it is closer to ''{{IAST|sanskrit}}''). Spoken Marathi allows for conservative stress patterns in words like राम (''rama'') with an emphasis on the ending vowel sound, a feature that has been lost in Hindi.

The table below includes all the consonant bases onto which vowel diacritics are placed. The lack of a vowel diacritic can either indicate the lack of a vowel, or the existence of the default, or "inherent", vowel, which in the case of Marathi is the [[schwa]].

Unlike most Indian languages, the Marathi language has multiple pronunciations for certain consonants (च, ज, झ and फ). This generally applies to pronunciations that were imported from Persian or English, but were tied to the existing Devanagari alphabet. The letter {{angbr|ज}} may represent {{IPA|/dʑə/}} (जग, ''jag'' 'world'), as well as {{IPA|/dzə/}} (जागा, ''zāgā'' 'place'). It is not possible to determine which pronunciation is to be used without knowing the word or the context, unlike Hindi, where {{angbr|ज़}} was added to represent {{IPA|/zə/}}. This pronunciation inconsistency is one of the most prominent difficulties for Marathi learners.

A defining feature of the Marathi language is the frequent substitution of the consonant ल (la) in Sanskrit words with the [[retroflex lateral flap]] ळ ({{IAST|ḷa}}). For instance, कुळ (''{{IAST|kuḷa}}'') for the Sanskrit कुलम् (''kulam'' 'clan') and कमळ (''{{IAST|kamaḷ}}'') for Sanskrit कमलम् (''kamalam'' 'lotus'). ळ is possibly an import in Marathi from Dravidian languages, although it may also have originated from [[Vedic Sanskrit]].

== Consonant clusters ==
In Marathi, the consonants by default come with a [[schwa]]. Therefore, तयाचे will be &lt;nowiki&gt;'təyāce'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, not &lt;nowiki&gt;'tyāce'&lt;/nowiki&gt;. To form &lt;nowiki&gt;'tyāce'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, one should add त् to याचे, which would yield त्याचे.

In [[digital typography]], the '''Medieval Unicode Font Initiative''' ('''MUFI''') is a project which aims to coordinate the encoding and display of special characters in medieval texts written in the [[Latin alphabet]], which are not encoded as part of [[Unicode]].

== Organization ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
MUFI was founded in July 2001 by a workgroup consisting of Odd Einar Haugen ([[University of Bergen|Bergen]]), Alec McAllister ([[University of Leeds|Leeds]]), and Tarrin Wills ([[University of Sydney|Sydney]]). From 2006 to 2015, MUFI had a board of four members, consisting of the three founding members and Andreas Stötzner ([[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]]). {{As of|2016|post=,}} Tarrin Wills is the single board member.

== Character variants ==
In medieval texts, many special [[ligature (typography)|ligature]]s, [[scribal abbreviation]]s, and letter forms existed, which are no longer a part of the Latin alphabet. As few of these characters are encoded in Unicode, ligatures have to be broken up into separate letters when digitized. Since few fonts support medieval ligatures or alternative letter forms, it is difficult to transmit them reliably in digital formats.

To prevent the possibility of corruption of the source texts, the eventual goal of the MUFI is to create a consensus on which characters to encode, and then present a completed proposal to the Unicode. In the meantime, a part of the [[Private Use Area]] has been assigned for encoding, so these characters can be placed in [[typeface]]s for testing and to speed up the later transition to the final encodings (if the project is accepted). This was originally based upon work done by the [[TITUS (project)|TITUS]] project, which also deals with [[Greek script|Greek]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], [[Georgian script|Georgian]], [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Devanagari]] characters, As of Unicode 5.1, this proposal has been made, covering 152 characters, and most of these (89 in all) have been encoded in the [[Latin Extended-D]] block. Others are in the Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement (26 chars.), Latin Extended Additional (10 chars.), Supplemental Punctuation (15 chars.) and Ancient Symbols (12 chars.).

== Fonts ==
{{As of|2017|09}}, [[Junicode]] ([[GPL]]) is the first typeface to cover all of MUFI 4.0, also in its italic face. Prior to MUFI 4.0, there were some 39 code point conflicts with Junicode.

There are three typefaces that are confirmed to cover all of MUFI 3.0. These are [[Cardo (typeface)|Cardo]], [[Andron (typeface)|Andron Scriptor Web]] and [[Palemonas (typeface)|Palemonas MUFI]]. Only the last one comes in four faces (regular, italic, bold and both).

[[LeedsUni]] supports all of MUFI 2.0. [[Caudex (typeface)|Caudex]], which is available at Google Fonts for embedding, claims to support most of MUFI 3.0, but is not listed on the MUFI homepage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/caudex/ Caudex source repository]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mufi-fonts"&gt;[http://folk.uib.no/hnooh/mufi/fonts/ The MUFI font page]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Alphabetum]] has an almost complete coverage of MUFI 2.0 and some coverage of version 3.0, in addition to a complete coverage of MUFI 1.0. 

[[TITUS Cyberbit Basic|TITUS Cyberbit]] covers all of MUFI 1.0 and includes some additional characters at different places, as it predates the MUFI project.

There is a project to make available MUFI characters, including version 4.0 ones, in [[LaTeX]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/mikkelee/mufi-latex MUFI macros for LaTeX]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private Use Area ==
The MUFI set includes standardized characters from many areas in the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] and includes named character references (“entities”) for use in [[SGML]] and [[XML]], especially in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] formats such as [[Menota]]. It also specifies many characters that are not encoded in Unicode, yet, in the Private Use Area which is designated for such use. When MUFI PUA characters have been accepted for encoding they are removed from the PUA in subsequent versions. As of version 4.0 there are the following PUA assignments, organized into several sub-areas.

'''Milana Bakhaeva''' ({{lang-ru|'''Милана Бахаева'''}}) (born 30 December 1979 in Orekhovo, [[Chechnya]]), better known by the [[pen name]] '''Milana Terloeva''', is a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] journalist and author of the 2006 French bestseller ''Danser sur les ruines — Une jeunesse tchétchène''. A refugee during the [[Second Chechen War]], Milana was one of eight Chechen students at the University of Grozny selected to study abroad by the human rights organization Études Sans Frontières in 2003, and she graduated with a master's degree in journalism from the [[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]] in 2006.

==Biography==
Milana was born in the small village of Orekhovo, sixty kilometers west of the Chechen capital [[Grozny]] and near the border of [[Ingushetia]], and she lived with her parents and grandmother, who had survived the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced deportations of most Chechens to Central Asia]] on 23 February 1944.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070216113805/http://reseaudesbahuts.lautre.net/article.php3?id_article=455 Milana Terloeva : Danser sur les ruines]. reseaudesbahuts.lautre.net (11 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; As a child growing up in the [[Soviet Union]], the family was relatively well-off, but suffered due to the spiraling increase in crime after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. One night in January 1993, someone left a large iron case outside the family doorstep. Inside was the body of Milana's father, assassinated.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

After the beginning of the [[First Chechen War]] on 11 December 1994, Milana and her family first took refuge in their cellar, and lived without running water or electricity.  As the situation in her village worsened further, her family took refuge in Grozny, which had already been ruined following the siege of the city. The family returned to Orekhovo at the end of the war in 1996, and they found that their homes had been extensively looted, and Russian soldiers living in her house had soiled everything with their excrement, including her prized ball gown, in an effort to humiliate them.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Simonnet  [http://www.lexpress.fr/info/monde/dossier/tchetchenie/dossier.asp?ida=451355 “Milana Terloeva: En Tchétchénie, survivre c'est déjà resister”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525002414/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/monde/dossier/tchetchenie/dossier.asp?ida=451355 |date=25 May 2007 }}, ''L’Express'' (7 September 2006) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the start of the [[Second Chechen War]], Milana and her family sought refuge in Ingushetia along with hundreds of thousands of other refugees. She returned to Grozny six months later, and enrolled in the heavily damaged [[Chechen State University|University of Grozny]], studying the [[French language]] with dreams of continuing her education in Europe. She aspired to become a journalist so that she would be able to bring justice to victims of the conflict. A group of French students opposed to the new war in Chechnya started the organization Etudes Sans Frontières in March 2003 as a means for rescuing Chechen students from the war zone and providing them with a [[Education in France|French education]]. (In 1997, [[President of Ichkeria|Chechen President]] [[Aslan Maskhadov]] appealed to [[Western world|Western nations]] to allow Chechen students into their universities, as he dreamed of liberally oriented leaders who would be capable of rebuilding a society that had been destroyed by war. The call fell on deaf ears, and at the time only [[madrassas]] from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan opened their doors to [[Chechen people|Chechens]]). By that September, the organization had sponsored eight Chechen students, including Milana, to study in Paris.&lt;ref name=bridge&gt;André and Raphaël Glucksmann, [http://www.signandsight.com/features/1122.html “A bridge to Chechnya”], ''www.signandsight.com'' (5 January 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a journalism student at [[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]], Milana excelled academically, graduating as the [[salutatorian]] in her graduating class in 2006. She also worked at the internationally circulated French newspapers ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[Courrier International]]'' in August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043431/http://www.sciences-po.org/journalisme/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=30&amp;Itemid=60 Miliana BAKHAEVA]. sciences-po.org&lt;/ref&gt; She also befriended the late journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110426111336/http://schlomoh.blog.lemonde.fr/category/tcheychenie/ Archives de la catégorie: 'Tchétchénie']. schlomoh.blog.lemonde.fr.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hachette Livre]], the largest publishing house in France, contacted Milana to write about her experiences during the wars, and she wrote her autobiography, ''Danser sur les ruines — Une jeunesse tchétchène'' (''Dancing on Ruins — A Chechen Youth''), which describes the raids in which many of her family members were captured, her journey from Grozny to Paris, and of her experiences as a student at [[Sciences Po]].

Despite numerous job offers in Paris, Milana decided to return to Grozny, to open up an independent newspaper, but realized that she would be unable to because of current censorship and death threats. As of 2007, she is currently working on creating a [[European culture|European]] cultural center in Chechnya, working on a second book, on Chechen women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madmoizelle.com/revue_danser-sur-les-ruines-milana-terloeva.html Danser sur les ruines (Milana Terloeva)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/68HxnRnQK?url=http://www.madmoizelle.com/danser-sur-les-ruines-milana-terloeva-5301 |date=9 June 2012 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10904">'''Narcissistic defenses''' are those processes whereby the idealized aspects of the self are preserved, and its limitations denied.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw J.A. (1999). ''Sexual Aggression'', American Psychiatric Publishing, pp. 28–9.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be rigid and totalistic.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Alper, ''Self Defence in a Narcissistic World'' (2003) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They are often driven by feelings of [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], conscious or unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

Narcissistic defenses are among the earliest [[defense mechanisms]] to emerge, and  include [[denial]], [[cognitive distortion|distortion]], and [[psychological projection|projection]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry P.D., Farmer S. (2002). ''Mental Health and Mental Illness'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]] is another defense mechanism prevalent among individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]]—seeing people and situations in black and white terms, either as all bad or all good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lubit R | year = 2002 | title = The long-term organizational impact of destructively narcissistic managers | url = | journal = Academy of Management Executive | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 127–38 | doi=10.5465/ame.2002.6640218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A narcissistic defense, with the disorder's typical over-valuation of the self, can appear at any stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Wilber|Wilber K.]], Engler J., Brown D. (1986). ''Transformations of Consciousness: Conventional and Contemplative Perspective of Development'', Boston: New Science Library, New York City, NY, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freudians==
[[File:Freud 420a.jpg|thumb|Sigmund Freud]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] did not focus specifically on narcissistic defenses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissistic-defenses Elsa Schmid-Kitsikis, "Narcissistic Defenses"]&lt;/ref&gt; but did note in ''[[On Narcissism]]'' how "even great criminals and humorists, as they are represented in literature, compel our interest by the narcissistic consistency with which they manage to keep away from their ego anything that would diminish it".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud saw narcissistic [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] as a defensive answer to object loss – denying the loss of an important object by way of a substitutive identification with it.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Metapsychology'', p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud also considered social narcissism as a defence mechanism, apparent when communal identifications produce irrational panics at perceived threats to 'Throne and Altar' or 'Free Markets',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; or in English over-reaction to any questioning of [[Shakespeare authorship question|the status and identity of William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;James Shapiro, ''Contested Will'' (2010) p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fenichel===
[[Otto Fenichel]] considered that "identification, performed by means of [[introjection]], is the most primitive form of relationship to objects" a primitive mechanism only used "if the ego's function of reality testing is severely damaged by a narcissistic regression."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946), pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fenichel also highlighted "eccentrics who have more or less succeeded in regaining the security of [[primary narcissism]] and who feel 'Nothing can happen to me'....[failing] to give up the archaic stages of repudiating displeasure and to turn toward reality".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacan===
[[Jacques Lacan]], following out Freud's view of the ego as the result of identifications,&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Oxford 1997), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; came to consider the ego itself as a narcissistic defence, driven by what he called "the 'narcissistic passion' ...in the coming-into-being (''devenir'') of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleinians==
[[Melanie Klein]], emphasised [[projective identification]] in narcissism, and the manic defence against becoming aware of the damage done to objects in this way.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Grotstein, "Foreword", in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; For Kleinians, at the core of manic defences in narcissism stood what [[Hanna Segal]] called "a triad of feelings—control, triumph and contempt".&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosenfeld===
[[Herbert Rosenfeld]] looked at the role of [[omnipotence]], combined with projective identification, as a narcissistic means of defending against awareness of separation between ego and  object.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''The Taming of Solitude'' (2004), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object relations theory==
In the wake of Klein, [[object relations theory]], including particularly the American schools of [[Otto Kernberg]] and [[Heinz Kohut]] has explored narcissistic defences through analysis of  such mechanisms as denial,  projective identification, and extreme idealization.&lt;ref name="Schmid-Kitsikis"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissistic-defenses Schmid-Kitsikis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kernberg emphasised the role of the splitting apart introjections, and identifications of opposing qualities, as a cause of ego weakness.&lt;ref&gt;Otto F. Kernberg, ''Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism'' (London 1990) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut too stressed the fact in narcissism "vertical splits are between self-structures (among others)—'I am grand' and 'I am wretched'—with very little communication between them".&lt;ref&gt;Kohut, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neville Symington]] however placed greater weight on the way "a person dominated by narcissistic currents...survives through being able to sense the emotional tone of the other...wearing the cloaks of others";&lt;ref&gt;Symington, pp. 52, 88&lt;/ref&gt; while for Spotnitz the key element is that the narcissist turns feelings in upon the self in narcissistic defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernpsychoanalysis.blogspot.com/2006/09/narcissistic-defense.html James G. Fennessy, "The Narcissistic Defense"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive defenses===
Kernberg emphasised the positive side to narcissistic defenses,&lt;ref&gt;Elsa Ronningstam, ''Disorders of Narcissism'' (1997) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; while Kohut also stressed the necessity in early life for narcissistic positions to succeed each other in orderly maturational sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Kohut, ''The Analysis of the Self'' (Madison 1971) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Others like Symington would maintain that "it is a mistake to split narcissism into positive and negative...we do not get positive narcissism without self-hatred".&lt;ref&gt;Symington, pp. 58, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stigmatising attitude to psychiatric illness==
Arikan found that a [[Social stigma|stigmatising]] attitude to [[psychiatric]] patients is associated with narcissistic defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arikan, K. |title=A stigmatizating attitude towards psychiatric illnesses is associated with narcissistic personality traits |journal=Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=248–50 |year=2005 |format=PDF |url=http://www.kemalarikan.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/arikan_stigma_narsisizm.pdf |pmid=16618057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
The twenty-first century has seen a distinction drawn between cerebral and somatic narcissists – the former building up their self-sense through intellectualism, the latter through an obsession with their bodies,&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me'' (London 2007) pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- self-help book?? --&gt;  as with the woman who, in [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]], invests her sense of freedom only in being an object of beauty for others.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Reynolds, ''Understanding Existentialism'' (2006) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary parallels==
* [[Sir Philip Sidney]] is said to have seen poetry in itself as a narcissistic defense.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Goldberg, ''Voice Terminal Echo'' (1986) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s aloof, detached protagonists have been seen as crude narcissists who preserve their sense of self only by petrifying it into solid form.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Kotarba/A. Fontana, ''The Existential Self in Society'' (1987) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pipe drift''' is a measure of the roundness or [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the inside wall of a pipe.  "API drift" refers to primary specifications set forth in [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] Specification 5CT ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 11960), "Specification for Casing and Tubing".  "Alternate drift" refers to alternate drift specifications listed in API 5CT.  "Special drift" refers to industry drift specifications other than those found in API 5CT.

'''Drifting''' means measuring a pipe's inner roundness.  Drifting is typically performed by passing a cylindrical [[mandrel]] through the length of the pipe to detect occlusions.  It occurs both at the pipe mill and in the field.  Drifting is performed to ensure that tools, pumps, smaller pipe, and other items can be passed through the pipe.

'''Polci''' (Pəlci, Posə) is an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language]] of [[Nigeria]]. It is part of the Barawa cluster, which is in turn part of the [[West Chadic language|West Chadic]] language family.

==Dialects==
The Polci language is one of six [[dialect clusters]] of the Zaar subgroup of the Barawa branch of the Chadic languages.  The Polci dialects are Zul, Baram, Dir, Buli, Nyamzak/Langas, and Polci proper.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006. [http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf The Afro-Asiatic Languages: Classification and Reference List] (ms)&lt;/ref&gt;

An extinct dialect called Luri was possibly dialect of Polci as well, but it is not well attested.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

==History of scholarship==
There have been several attempts to clarify the linguistic situation in the southern and southwestern part of [[Bauchi State, Nigeria]], of which the Polci cluster and Polci language are a part.

In 1971, John Ballard, working with the Department of Linguistics and Nigerian Languages, University of Ibadan, did an extensive linguistic survey of the Nigerian Middle Belt published ''Historical inferences from the linguistic geography of the Nigerian Middle Belt''. As a result, it came to light that there was a narrow corridor occupied by the speakers of Chadic languages in the southwest of Bauchi.&lt;ref name=Shimizu /&gt;

In the same year, Neil Campbell and James Hoskison from the Summer Institute of Linguistics carried out a linguistic survey of the Bauchi area. The survey, ''Bauchi Area Survey Report'' and published in 1972, listed the names, location and population of twenty four Chadic languages, which are very closely related to each other and are spoken to the south and west of Bauchi. They also collected word lists. However, no detailed analysis of linguistic data or language classification was included in either of these surveys.&lt;ref name=Shimizu /&gt;

Also in 1971, C. Hoffman published ''Provisional Check List of Chadic Languages'', which contained 17 languages divided into two sub-groups. This list was revised and amplified by Kay Williamson in a document handed out to students at the University of Ibadan, titled ''Chadic languages of Nigeria'' in 1972, to include 21 languages classified into three subgroups.&lt;ref name=Shimizu /&gt;

With this information, K. Shimizu set out in 1974 to list the languages belonging to the Southern Bauchi Group, to examine their geographical distribution, and to use valid linguistic data to come up with sub-classifications. The survey, published in 1978 and titled ''A survey report of The South Bauchi Group of Chadic Languages'' came to the conclusion that not all languages listed under the dialect continuum of the South Bauchi Group belonged there and came up with a much more extensive, new classification. This is also the work from which the Barawa subgroup name came from, which was found to be the term used locally in this area to denote the speakers of this dialect continuum.&lt;ref name=Shimizu /&gt; Much of the research done on Barawa languages, the Polci cluster, and Polci itself use this survey as an important reference.

In 1999, Ronald Cosper published ''Barawa lexicon: A wordlist of eight South Bauchi (West Chadic) languages: Boghom, Buli, Dott, Geji, Jimi, Polci, Sayanci and Zul''. It considered most of the languages to be endangered and found that most individuals who spoke any of these languages were also bilingual in Hausa, which may have had influence on their lexicons and grammars. The book contains a lexicon of 852 words from the different Barawa languages. The words are organized based on semantic and syntactic categories. Semantic noun categories are followed by adjectives, numerals, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions and a number of categories of verbs.&lt;ref name=Lexicon&gt;Cosper, R. 1999: ''Barawa lexicon: A wordlist of eight South Bauchi (West Chadic) languages: Boghom, Buli, Dott, Geji, Jimi, Polci, Sayanci and Zul.'' Muenchen: LINCOM Europa.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Cosper's work was seriously defective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://llacan.vjf.cnrs.fr/PDF/Publications/Caron/Caron_Cosper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the majority of the research on South Bauchi West (B.3) languages has been conducted by Bernard Caron, a faculty member at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, LLACAN. Caron’s research has focused on South Bauchi West and Polci cluster languages in particular. Many of his papers are available online and include topics such as linguistic classification, syntactic structures such as conditionals, and noun classes such as pronominal and number systems.

==Phonology==

==Nouns==

===Plurality===
Polci, being a South Bauchi West language, does not possess grammatical gender or nominal classes and as a rule, few nouns form a plural (morpho-lexical plural). The plural inside the NP (noun phrase) is expressed through the noun modifiers. There is no agreement between the verb and its arguments. However, plurality appears in the verb phrase in two places: (i) the formation of the imperatives (ii) a verbal derivation forming what has come to be called [[Pluractionality|pluractionals]].&lt;ref name=Caron2011&gt;Caron, B. 2011: [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00645133/document ''Number in South-Bauchi-West Languages.''].

==Syntax==

===Conditionals===

{{refimprove|date=August 2011}}
[[File:Stamp France 1882 1c postage due.jpg|thumb|A French 1-centime postage due stamp from 1882]]
'''Postage due''' is the term used for mail sent with insufficient postage. A '''postage due stamp''' is a stamp added to an underpaid piece of mail to indicate the extra postage due.

== Background ==
While the problem of what to do about letters not paying the full correct fee had existed since the creation of regular postal systems, it was greatly heightened by the advent of [[postage stamps]], since customers were now making their own decisions about the right amount to pay, without the assistance of a presumably knowledgeable postal clerk.

While at various times some countries have simply adopted the expedient of  returning the letter to the sender, many others have taken the approach of delivering the letter and collecting the fee from the recipient. Initially the process was handled by a clerk writing something like "Due 3 cents" on the cover, but this was subject to abuse by [[mail carrier]]s, who might write it on themselves and pocket the difference.

[[File:US Postage Due &amp; One Penny.jpg|thumb|US postage due on UK cover]]
The problem of underpaid foreign mail was one of the issues addressed by the 1874 establishment of the [[Universal Postal Union]]. The U.P.U. arrived at the decision that mail with insufficient postage should be marked with a "T" and from  April 1, 1879 the amount missing would also be indicated in black. Later more countries started to use handstamps to indicate the amount due.  Later the combination of handstamps with both the "T" and the amount missing came into use.  From October 1, 1907 the rules were changed. The amount due would be charged instead of the amount missing would be indicated. The amount charged was usually double the amount that was missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~swesspd/rules.htm Centimes Due Markings Rules and Postal History Background.] rootsweb 26 February 2009. Retrieved 18 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== First stamps ==
The problem was solved by France in 1859, with the issuance of official postage due stamps,&lt;ref name="linns"&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Rick |url=http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/stamplessletters_20030512/refreshercourse.aspx |title=Postage due stamps kept postmasters honest |publisher=[[Linn's Stamp News]] |accessdate=2010-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; affixed at the delivery office before being taken out to the recipients. Many other countries followed suit.  (Occasionally, regular postage stamps have been used to fulfill a postage due function.)

Postage due stamps (or "labels", to clarify that they have no value of their own) are not always affixed to individual letters; in the case of business mail, the total due might be summed, and the appropriate stamps added to the top letter in a bundle, or to a bundle's wrapper. The labels have also been used to collect money for other purposes, such as magazine subscriptions.

Since postage due stamps are almost always used only within a single country, they are usually quite simple in design, mostly consisting of a large numeral, and an inscription saying "postage due", "porto", etc.; often there is no country name. As with [[definitive stamp]]s, a variety of values are needed to make up specific amounts.

== Decline in use ==
A number of countries have discontinued postage due stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Klug |first=Janet |url=https://www.linns.com/news/world-stamps-postal-history/2016/november/stamp-collecting-basics-postage-due-stamps-worldwide-collection.html |title=How postage due stamps can spice up a worldwide collection: Stamp Collecting Basics |publisher=[[Linns Stamp News]] |date=17 November 2016 |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain, which first issued theirs in 1914 (and continued the same design until 1970), ended their use in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gbstamp.co.uk/article/the-beginning-and-end-of-gb-postage-due-stamps-could-be-an-opportunity-394.html |title=The Beginning and End of GB Postage Due Stamps Could Be an Opportunity |date=11 June 2013 |publisher=gbstamp.co.uk |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States terminated them in 1986, although [[Postage meter]] labels were used after that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linns.com/news/us-stamps-postal-history/2017/march/postage-due-stamps-postage-due-not-collected.html |title=When postage due stamps mean something else |date=25 March 2017 |publisher=[[Linns Stamp News]] |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting ==
[[File:IFCO 1962cover.jpg|thumb|An Irish envelope with an instructional mark "10d To PAY" (186 code for [[Dublin]]) with a 10 pence postage due label affixed and tied by a datestamp]]
While, technically, there is no reason for postage dues to reach private hands unused, postal administrations have sold them to [[stamp collecting|collectors]], and postage dues of many countries exist in large numbers, often unused and of low value. Conversely, surviving examples of valid postally used postage due stamps tied together by a dated cancellation or other postal markings with a [[postage stamp]] on cover are less common and are sought after by philatelists.

ProEnglish was a major backer of the unsuccessful 2009 [[Nashville Charter Amendment 1]], a local "English First" [[Ballot question|ballot referendum]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which would have generally required government communication and publications to be printed in English only.&lt;ref name="Cousins"&gt;Juanita Cousins, [http://archive.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/01/22/20090122nashville.html Nashville voters reject 'English First' proposal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223645/http://archive.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/01/22/20090122nashville.html |date=2017-03-08 }}, Associated Press (January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; ProEnglish donated $82,500, about 92% of the total amount raised by the referendum's supporters.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; The referendum was rejected by Nashville voters.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cousins"/&gt; In 2012, ProEnglish was the leading force behind a successful effort to make English the official language of [[Frederick County, Maryland]]; the county enacted an ordinance closely based on one drafted by the group.&lt;ref name="Rosenwald"/&gt; However, in 2015, the country repealed the ordinance, marking a defeat for the organization.&lt;ref name="SPLCAug2015"/&gt;

ProEnglish has also worked for the adoption of official English laws at the local level, most notably in [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://judiciary.house.gov/_files/hearings/Hearings%202012/Porter%2008022012.pdf |title={title} |access-date=2017-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727074113/https://judiciary.house.gov/_files/hearings/Hearings%202012/Porter%2008022012.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ProEnglish vocally opposed the [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013|comprehensive immigration reform bill]] sponsored by the "[[Gang of Eight (immigration)|Gang of Eight]]," a bipartisan group of U.S. senators. ProEnglish carried out a radio ad campaign against U.S. Senator [[Lindsey Graham]], who was part of the Gang of Eight.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

In 2014, ProEnglish criticized [[The Coca-Cola Company]] for airing a [[Super Bowl commercials|Super Bowl commercial]] that showed people of different ethnicities singing "[[America, the Beautiful]]" in a variety of languages. ProEnglish condemned Coca-Cola (saying the ad fostered "disunity") and urged its supporters to contact the company to express opposition.&lt;ref name="Segal"/&gt;

In 2017, ProEnglish endorsed the section of the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act that calls for a merit-based legal immigration system in which applicants would get points for speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://proenglish.org/2017/08/11/rep-dana-rohrabacher-co-sponsors-hr-997/ |title={title} |access-date=2017-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204223004/https://proenglish.org/2017/08/11/rep-dana-rohrabacher-co-sponsors-hr-997/ |archive-date=2017-12-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/997 |title={title} |access-date=2017-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803050216/https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/997 |archive-date=2017-08-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2017, ProEnglish endorsed the section of the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act that calls for a merit-based legal immigration system in which applicants would get points for speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://proenglish.org/2017/08/11/rep-dana-rohrabacher-co-sponsors-hr-997/ |title={title} |access-date=2017-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204223004/https://proenglish.org/2017/08/11/rep-dana-rohrabacher-co-sponsors-hr-997/ |archive-date=2017-12-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/997 |title={title} |access-date=2017-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803050216/https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/997 |archive-date=2017-08-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation history===
In 2005, ProEnglish was helping pay the legal fees of at least two employers who had an "English-only rule" requiring employees to speak only English while on the job.&lt;ref name="Jordan"/&gt; ProEnglish paid the legal fees of Terri Bennett, a former nursing student at [[Pima Community College]] (PCC) in [[Tucson, Arizona]], "who claimed she was wrongly suspended for complaining when fellow students spoke Spanish to one another in class."&lt;ref name="Alaimo2015"&gt;Carol Ann Alaimo, [http://tucson.com/news/local/education/ex-student-who-sued-pima-college-must-pay-k/article_5f157fed-024d-59da-9731-6e0476dcffe1.html Ex-student who sued Pima College must pay $111K] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017232059/http://tucson.com/news/local/education/ex-student-who-sued-pima-college-must-pay-k/article_5f157fed-024d-59da-9731-6e0476dcffe1.html |date=2015-10-17 }}, ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' (October 15, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alaimo2013"/&gt; At trial, the evidence showed that Bennett had called [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] classmates "spics, beaners and illegals" and the [[Spanish language]] "gibberish."&lt;ref name="Alaimo2015"/&gt; A jury unanimously rejected the Bennett's claims, and in 2015 ordered her to pay $111,000 in attorney's fees to PCC.&lt;ref name="Alaimo2015"/&gt;

In 2008, ProEnglish, along with the [[Pacific Legal Foundation]], filed a lawsuit in [[United States federal court|federal court]] challenging 2004 [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Service]] regulations that required federally funded healthcare providers to provide translation services for patients who do not speak English. The challengers claimed that the regulations were an "illegal intrusion" on healthcare providers. U.S. District Judge [[Barry Ted Moskowitz]] dismissed the suit in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khn.org/morning-breakout/dr00028586/ Federal Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Filed by ProEnglish Over HHS Guidelines on Translation Services for Patients] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223447/http://khn.org/morning-breakout/dr00028586/ |date=2017-03-08 }}, Kaiser Health News (June 11, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''EEOC v. Kidmans'' (2005), ProEnglish helped fund the litigation costs of a small [[drive-in restaurant]] in [[Page, Arizona]], that was sued by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] after it refused to retract an English-on-the-job rule. The restaurant said that the rule was adopted to stop "trash talking" in the [[Navajo language]] among employees, most of whom are [[Navajo people|Navajo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/05/01/343415/ Fighting Words How a tiny drive-in restaurant in Arizona became the center of a bitter battle over English-only rules in the workplace] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201045327/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/05/01/343415/ |date=2017-12-01 }}, CNN Money (May 1, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The EEOC and the restaurant owners ultimately negotiated a settlement, in which the employees "may require employees to speak English while dealing with the public, but not at other times."&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Barron, [https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/2910 Not just freedom fries at this English-only drive-in?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620181101/https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/2910 |date=2018-06-20 }}, ''The Web of Language'' (November 23, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for Structured English Immersion==
ProEnglish opposes the method of teaching English language learning (ELL) students that teaches them basic courses in their native language while they learn English, known as ‘bilingual education,’ as a failed 40-year experiment. Instead, it favors the method known as ‘structured English immersion,’ in which ELLs are taught in English while being given supplemental learning assistance on the side.

Accordingly, it backed successful citizen initiative that ended bilingual education programs in California (1998), Arizona (2000), and Massachusetts (2002), as well as one unsuccessful such citizen’s initiative in Colorado (2002).  ProEnglish Chair Dr. Rosalie Porter co-chaired the English for the Children initiative in Massachusetts that passed with 68 percent of the vote. Much research comparing students in bilingual programs to students in structured English immersion consistently shows far better results in English immersion classes. {{cite book |last= Imhoff|first= Gary|date= 1990|title= Learning In Two Languages|url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}

==Repealing Executive Order 13166==
[[Executive Order 13166]], also known as “Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency,” states that any entity receiving federal funds must provide translations or interpreters for the services it provides in the language spoken by persons likely to use those services. It states that failure to do so is likely to constitute “discrimination on the basis of national origin” as prohibited by Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights law.
	
An [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] on August 11, 2000, the order directed all federal agencies to draft plans to “improve access to federally conducted or federally assisted programs for persons who, as a result of national origin, are limited in their English proficiency.” The mandate also applies to all state and local government agencies and their subdivisions, and government contractors that receive federal funds.&lt;ref name="Maceri"/&gt;

A '''revival''' is a restaging of a [[stage (theatre)|stage]] production after its original run has closed.  New material may be added. A [[feature film|filmed]] version is said to be an adaptation and requires writing of a [[screenplay]]. Revivals are common in [[Broadway theatre]].

A '''scratch vocal''' is a vocal performance that a singer records to provide a reference track that music [[Producer (music)|producers]] and [[audio engineer]]s can use as they craft other pieces of the recorded song.

Most of the time, the singer ultimately re-records the vocal performance after production is complete, however there are a number of exceptions to this rule such as in the case of [[Escape (The Piña Colada Song)#Production|The Piña Colada Song]] by [[Rupert Holmes]] where the re-recording lacked the desired energy and spontaneity - or in the reverse case of [[Superstar (Delaney and Bonnie song)#The Carpenters version|Superstar]] by [[The Carpenters]] where the scratch was so well performed that a re-record was deemed unnecessary.

Scratch vocals are also often used in the production of feature-length [[animation|animated]] films to bring [[storyboard]]s to life as "animatics," in which storyboard frames are synced to the relevant dialogue, together with a rough soundtrack generated on a [[synthesizer]].  Scratch vocals may be obtained from professional [[Voice acting|voice actors]] (who may or may not be well-established in the voice-over community but are generally unknown to the general public) or from anyone around the studio willing to chip in a line or two (as well as friends or family members).  For lead roles, scratch vocals are nearly always replaced in the final cut by vocal tracks recorded by [[bankable star]]s or experienced [[character actor]]s.  However, in the rush to meet deadlines, if the scratch vocals for a minor role are good enough, the director may skip auditions and simply use the scratch vocalist in the role. This is how many animation studio employees (and their friends and family members) end up with minor credits as cast members on their studio's products.

[[File:St. Christopher 1884 1 penny stamp sheet.jpg|right|thumb|An 1884 sheet of stamps from St. Christopher.]]
[[File:Lithuania 1990 MiNr0457a SB B002a.jpg|thumb|Stamp of Lithuania; 1990; counter sheet with the definitive stamp in the angel-drawing (First Angel Issue), imperforate; without gum; single stamp size 21 x 32 mm]]
A '''sheet of stamps''' or '''press sheet''' is a unit of [[postage stamp|stamps]] as printed, usually on large sheets of paper based on the size of the [[printing]] plate, that are separated into panes that are sold at [[post offices]]. Where more than one pane is on a printed sheet they are arranged in a table-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Glossary Of Philatelic Terms: S | work = | publisher = [[Linn's Stamp News]] | url = http://www.linns.com/reference/terms/terms.asp?firstletter=s | accessdate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spaces between the single stamps are all of the same size and provide space for a [[Postage stamp separation|cut]] or [[Postage stamp separation|perforation]].

==Size and format==
Today, a sheet of stamps is the most common way of arranging stamps on the impressed paper. The number of stamps on a sheet and the [[paper size|format]] of the sheet depend on the size and format of the individual stamps. Small stamps are usually printed on sheets of a hundred stamps, although the [[Penny Black]], as with other pre-decimal [[Pound sterling|sterling currency]] stamps, were printed in sheets of 240; larger stamps are printed on sheets of fifty, twenty-five or twenty, as is done by the [[USPS]].

On November 13, 1994, the [[Deutsche Post]] changed the format of its emissions to sheets of ten stamps each, due to reasons of efficiency. The edges of these sheets are specially designed, making them a novel field of collecting.

==Printing sheet==
In fact, the term printing sheet refers only to a part of the actual ''printing sheet''. This is because stamps are mostly printed in four connected sheets, to make best use of the [[stamp paper]]. At the [[post office]] counter, only the four separated printing sheets are sold. Therefore, the sheet of stamps is also called a counter sheet or pane, though improperly called a sheet of stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Pane vs. Sheet |work =glossary |publisher =Alphabetilately.org |date =2007-02-27 |url =http://alphabetilately.org/glossary.html |accessdate =2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gutters===
[[Image:Zwischensteg.jpg|thumb|300px|Heart (''Herzstück'') and tête-bêche (''Kehrdruck'')]]
The empty fields connecting the single counter sheets are called gutters. Normally they are separated in the middle after [[printing]] in order to obtain four counter sheets. The half empty fields or gutters then form the edge of the sheet. However, from many issues, unseparated gutters with connected stamps of the neighbouring sheets come on the market (stamp - empty field - stamp). These gutters may be either empty or printed, if printed edges were intended.

The [[philatelist]] makes a distinction between ''horizontal and vertical gutters''. A specific characteristic of the gutters is the ''heart'' of the printing sheet, where all four panes are connected. Gutters and hearts are very popular with [[stamp collecting|collectors]] and reach high [[stamp catalog|catalog]] prices, especially for classic issues.

===Tête-bêche===
[[File:Stamp Switzerland 1910 10c tb pair.jpg|thumb|Swiss Tête-bêche]]
Single counter sheets do not always have to be separated by empty fields. Issues which were not intended to have edges were naturally manufactured without empty fields. To be able to distinguish between the single sheets better, the stamps were printed rotated 180° to each other along the separation line. Philatelists describe the two stamps which are upside down in relationship to each other as '''[[tête-bêche]]'''. Some issues have tête-bêches as well as gutters.

Like gutters, tête-bêches are very popular with collectors due to their scarcity and decorativeness.

==Stamp arrangement and location==
[[File:Bogenanordnung.jpg|thumb|Identifying letters in the bottom corners of the [[Penny Black]]]]
The stamps are arranged on the sheet in a table with rows and columns. Due to this arrangement, the location of each stamp can be precisely determined. The philatelist counts the single stamps horizontally from left to right, but the [[Mail|post]] counts them vertically from top to bottom. Accordingly, the third stamp in the sixth row of a sheet of 10 x 10 would be the 53rd stamp of the sheet for the collector, but the 26th stamp for the post.

The first postage stamps of the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain|UK]], the [[Penny Black]], were printed in sheets of 20 rows and 12 columns, but the location on the sheet was indicated by different letters in the bottom corners of each stamp. An "A" in the lower left corner indicated the first row, a "B" the second one, the "C" the third one, etc. The columns were indicated according to the same scheme in the lower right corner. Thus the top left stamp had the letter combination "A" - "A", the bottom right stamp had "T" - "L". As a result, 240 different stamps were made for each plate used. This was intended to prevent forgery.

==Sheet edge==
The term "sheet edge" refers to the empty fields connected to the stamps and arranged around the sheet. These fields are often unprinted. However, in many cases, quite a bit of interesting information can be found on them, e.g. printing dates or the like. The most important inscriptions printed on the edges of the sheet are:
*number of the edition
*sheet inscription (advertisements&lt;!-- could also mean publicity --&gt;, information about the stamp issue, etc.)
*printing dates
*internal numbers
*[[Printing registration|registration marks]]
*plate numbers
*banding &lt;!-- border trim? --&gt;
*counter of the row value

==Specialities==
There are several specialities of the printing of sheets. The most important are:
*[[St. Andrew's cross (philately)|St. Andrew's crosses]]
*[[Se-tenant (philately)|se-tenants]]

==See also==
*[[Miniature sheet]]
*[[Postage stamp booklet]]
*[[Coil stamp]]

The '''theta-criterion''' (also named '''θ-criterion''') is a constraint on [[x-bar theory]] that was first proposed by {{harvs|txt|first=Noam|last=Chomsky|author-link=Noam Chomsky|year=1981}} as a rule within the system of principles of the [[government and binding theory]], called theta-theory (θ-theory).  As theta-theory is concerned with the distribution and assignment of [[theta roles|theta-roles]] (a.k.a. thematic roles), the theta-criterion describes the specific match between [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] and theta-roles (θ-roles) in [[logical form]] (LF):
{|
|-
|
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''θ-criterion:''' ''Each argument bears one and only one θ-role, and each θ-role is assigned to one and only one argument.''
 |source = {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}
 |align  = center
 |fontsize=14
}}
|}

Being a constraint on x-bar theory, the criterion aims to parse out ill-formed sentences. Thus, if the number or categories of arguments in a sentence does not meet the theta-role assigner's requirement in any given sentence, that sentence will be deemed ungrammatical. {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=224}}. In other words, theta-criterion sorts sentences into grammatical and ungrammatical bins based on [[Selection (linguistics)|c-selection and s-selection]].

== Applied ==

=== Theta grid ===
A [[Theta role|theta-role]] is a status of [[thematic relation]] {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}. In other words, a theta-role describes the connection of meaning between a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] or a [[verb]] and a [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] selected by this predicate. The number, types and positions of theta-roles that a lexicon assigns is encoded in its lexical entry {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=38}} and must be satisfied in syntactic structure following [[Projection Principle]].{{efn|Note that this doesn't mean that all theta-roles are obligatorily assigned. If a structural position that can be theta-marked is obligatory, then the theta-role assignment is also obligatory. Otherwise it is not {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=40}}. See Transitivity section}} The [[Selection (linguistics)|selection]] of a constituent by a head based on meaning is called s-selection (semantic-selection) and those based on grammatical categories are called c-selection.{{efn|Such selection (theta-role assignment) is strictly local and only occurs between sister nodes. A lexical head assigns a theta-role to its complement, and the subject of this XP can receive a theta-role from the [[X']] including the head and its complement. The argument in subject position is called external argument, and the one in object position is called internal argument.{{harv|Williams|1981}} Adjuncts don't receive theta-roles so are not restricted by theta-criterion.}} {{harv|Sportiche|Koopman|Stabler|2014|p=141}} Such information can be expressed with a theta grid.

In the example below the verb 'love' has two theta-roles to assign: [[Thematic relation|agent]] (the entity who loves) and [[Thematic relation|theme]] (the entity being loved). In accordance with the theta-criterion, each theta-role must have its argument counterpart.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1a)
|Megan
|loves
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225 (22)}}
|}
In Example 1a, '''Megan''' and '''Kevin''' are the arguments that the verb assigns the agent and theme theta-roles to, respectively. Because there is a one-to-one mapping of argument to theta-role, the theta-criterion is satisfied and the sentence is deemed [[Grammaticality|grammatical]] {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225}}. Below are two examples where the theta-criterion has not been fulfilled and are thus ungrammatical.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1b)
|Megan
|loves
|
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225 (24)}}
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;        |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;    |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1c)
|Megan
|loves
|Jason
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="5" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=226 (26)}}
|}
Example 1b is ungrammatical (marked with '''*''') because there are more theta-roles available than there are arguments. The theta-role '''theme''' does not have an argument matched to it. On the other hand, in example (1c), there are more arguments than theta-roles. Both theta-roles are matched to arguments ('''Megan''' with '''Agent''' and '''Jason''' with '''theme'''), but there is an argument left without a corresponding theta-role (Kevin has no theta-role) {{harv|Carnie|2007}}. Thus for reasons of inequality in number between theta-roles and arguments, with either having more than the other, the result will be ungrammatical.

=== Consequence on movement ===
Since [[Trace (linguistics)|trace]] transmits theta-role, [[Syntactic movement|movements]] resulting in non-local relations between theta-role assigners and receivers in [[Transformational grammar|surface structure]] don't violate theta-criterion. This allows us to generate sentences with [[Raising (linguistics)|DP-raising]], head movement, [[wh-movement]], etc. However, if a phrase occupies a theta-position (complement or selected subject) in [[D-structure]], it can no longer move to another theta-position or it will receive two theta-roles {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=46}}.

== Special cases ==

=== Transitivity ===

[[Verb]]s that can be either [[Transitive verb|transitive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] at the first glance could present a problem for the theta-criterion. For a transitive verb, such as "hit," we assign the [[theta role|theta-role]]s agent and theme to the arguments, as shown in (2b), (2c), and (2d):
[[File:MaryArrived-D.jpg|thumb|(3c). The underlying representation of "Mary arrived." by a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic tree]].]]
[[File:MaryArrived-S.png|thumb|(3d). The surface representation of "Mary arrived." by a syntactic tree. "Mary" is projected to the spec-TP position by the [[Extended Projection Principle|extended projection principle]] triggered by the [+tense] tense morpheme.]]
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|-
|(2a)

|
|
|-

|-
|(2d)
|John

|
|-
| colspan="5" |(adapted from {{harv|Rice|1988|p=207}})
|}
The action of hitting here requires an animate subject, an [[Thematic relation|agent]], carry out the action. The [[Thematic relation|theme]] is then someone or something that undergoes the action.
For an intransitive verb, such as "arrive," we assign the theta-role theme to the sole argument, since "Mary" is the one the undergoes the action:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|
|-
|(3a)

|arrived.
|
|-
|(3b)
|*Mary
|arrived
|an arrival.
|-
| colspan="4" |adapted from {{harv|Pesetsky &amp; Torrego|2002|p=22 (36a)}}
|}

The theta-criterion assigns the theta-role in the [[underlying structure]], as shown by (3c). The past-tense morpheme then requires a subject at the spec-TP position and forces the [[Syntactic movement|movement]] of "Mary," as shown by (3d).
A verb like "eat" can choose to take an object, as shown in (4):
{|
|-
|
 (4) a. ''John ate.''
     b. ''John ate something.''
     c. ''John ate a big lunch.''
         {{harv|Rice|1988|p=203 (1b-d)}}
|}
For this type of verb, the potential object is usually semantically limited and therefore can be inferred from the verb at a default value {{harv|Rice|1988|pp=203–4}}. For instance, for (4a), the listener/reader automatically assumes that John ate "something." What necessitates the object in (4c) is the distinction from the default meaning achieved by specifying what John ate {{harv|Rice|1988|p=208}}. As a result, this type of verbs can be treated the same as transitive verbs. The theta-roles of "agent" and "theme" can be assigned:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!(&lt;THEME&gt;)
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;(|)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(4a)
|John
|ate.
|
|-
|(4b)
|John
|ate
|something.
|-
|(4c)
|John
|ate
|a big lunch.
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Rice|1988|p=203 (1b-d)}}
|}

In summary, by assigning the correct theta-roles, theta-criterion is able to tell the real intransitive verbs, such as "arrive" apart from verbs that can appear intransitive, such as "eat."

=== PRO and pro ===

==== PRO ====
[[PRO (linguistics)|PRO]] (pronounced 'big pro') is a null pronoun phrase that occurs in a position where it does not get case (or gets null case){{efn|There are exceptions. For example, Icelandic PRO is argued to bear normal cases {{harv|Sigurðsson|2008}}}} but takes the theta-role assigned by the [[Nonfinite verb|non-finite verb]] to its subject. PRO's meaning is determined by the precedent DP that [[Control (linguistics)|controls]] it {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}}. As theta criterion states that each argument is assigned a theta-role, and those theta-roles must consist of a syntactic category that the verb selects even when there is no overt subject. This is where PRO comes in to help satisfy theta-criterion by appearing as the null subject attaining the appropriate theta role {{harv|Camacho|2013}}.
Below is an example containing PRO in a sentence:

 (5) a. ''Jean&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is likely  [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean is reluctant [PRO to leave]''.
        {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (1)}}

Example (5a) is a [[Raising (linguistics)|raising]] sentence,and in contrast, (5b) is a [[Control (linguistics)|control]] sentence, meaning it does not involve any DP [[Syntactic movement|movement]]. The PRO, which is a "null DP" is in the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] position of the [[Dependent clause|embedded clause]].

 (6) a. ''Jean wants Brian&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean persuaded Brian [PRO to leave]''.
       {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (4}}

Similarly, example (6a) is a raising-to-object sentence; "Brian" raises to the object position of the verb ''want.''{{efn|This movement won't cause ''Brian'' to get a theta-role from the verb ''want'' because 1) ''want'' only assigns a proposition role to its complement, and that role is already assigned to the clause ''Brain to leave''. 2) ''Brian'' in such cases moved to the specifier position of AgrOP rather than directly into the complement position of ''want''. {{harvtxt|Carnie|2007|page=411}}}} In contrast, (6b) is an object control sentence.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430}} The verb ''persuade'' has three theta-roles to assign: "agent" to ''Jean'', "theme" to ''Brian'', and "proposition" to the clause [''PRO to leave'']. There is no raising, but there is a PRO in the subject position of the embedded clause that takes the verb leave's only theta-role, "agent". Since Brian does not receive theta-role from ''leave'', it only bears one theta-role, nor does PRO receive a second theta-role from ''persuade''. Every argument only receives one theta-role, and every theta-role of the two predicates is assigned to only one argument. The sentence is thus grammatical.

==== pro ====
[[Empty category#pro (little pro)|pro]], also known as little pro, is an [[empty category]] that occurs in a subject or object position of a [[finite clause]] (finite clauses must contain a verb which shows tense) in languages like Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and some Arabic dialects ({{harvnb|Jaeggli|Safir|1989}}; {{harvnb|Rizzi|1986}}). pro differs from PRO in that it contains [[Case (linguistics)|case]]. The meaning of pro is determined not by its [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] but by verb [[Agreement (grammar)|agreement]] in the sentence. The DP is 'dropped' from a sentence if its reference can be recovered from the context.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}} For example:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!&lt;GOAL&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(7a)
|Un bravo psicanalista
(A good psychoanalyst)
|può restituire
(can give back)
|'''pro'''
|a se stessi
(to themselves)
|-
| colspan="5" |'A good psychoanalyst can return people to themselves'.
|-
| colspan="5" |(Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (11b)}})
|}
The verb ''restituire'' 'give back' assigns three theta-roles, but there are only two overt arguments in the sentence. It ultimately satisfies theta-criterion because the role, theme, is taken by a pro, whose existence can be proved by the properly [[Binding (linguistics)|bound]] reflexive pronoun ''se stessi''. Compare (7a) with (7b) below:
 (7b) *''Un bravo psicanalista può dare aiuto a  se stessi''.
       A  good  psychoanalyst can give help  to oneself.
       'A good psychoanalyst can give help to themselves'.
      (Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (13b)}})
When the reflexive pronoun ''se stessi'' 'themselves' doesn't have a proper [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to co-refer to, the sentence can't be grammatical. This indicates that in (7a) ''se stessi'' must have a proper antecedent in the sentence—the pro that takes the theme role.

=== Cognate object ===
[[Cognate object]]s are nominal complements of their cognate verbs that are normally [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. For example,
 (8) ''John died a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=89 (1a)}}
Such a structure posed a problem for theta-criterion because normally the verb assigns only one theta-role, theme, which is already taken by the [[Determiner phrase|DP]], "John." The sentence should be thus predicted ill-formed. To explain the phenomenon, one way is to re-categorize such a verb as "die" so as to change the way it assigns theta-roles. For that purpose, (8) can be interpreted as follows:
 (9) ''John met a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (5a)}}
Or John ''underwent'' a gruesome death. If the verb "die" is essentially similar to the operation-verb "meet," the cognate objects should be assigned a theta-role—one restricted to the nominal form of the verb head {{harv|Jones|1988}}. In other words, "die" is now classified as a potentially transitive verb, assigning two theta-roles, agent to "John" and theme to "a gruesome death." Such a possibility is falsified, however, because cognate object constructions cannot be passivized {{harv|Jones|1988}}.
[[File:JohnDiedAGruesomeDeath.jpg|thumb|(11c) Tree structure of (11a) "John died a gruesome death." The adjunct phrase is highlighted in yellow. Substituting the adjunct DP "a gruesome death" with the [[adverbial phrase]] "gruesomely" will derive (11b).]]
 (10) a. ''A gruesome death was met by John.''
      b. ''*A gruesome death was died by John.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (6a), p=92 (11a)}}
As we can no longer consider verbs that take cognate objects the same as potentially transitive verbs, {{harvtxt|Jones|1988}} argues, based on the framework of {{harvtxt|Zubizarreta|1982}}, that cognate objects are [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]] rather than [[Argument (grammar)|arguments]], having the same meaning and structure as the manner [[adverb]]s in (12b).

|}

Such an analysis restores cognate objects to the group of arguments satisfying the theta-criterion, as adjuncts, by definition, are not counted as arguments and therefore need not be restricted by theta criterion. The tree form (11c) shows the adjunct DP in its relative position.

=== Deverbal nouns ===

[[Deverbal noun]]s are derived from verbs and thus assign theta-roles as their verb stems do. For example,

 (12) (i) ''the barbarians' destruction of Rome''
     (ii) ''Rome's destruction (by the barbarians)''
    (iii) ''the destruction of Rome (by the barbarians)''
     (iv) ''*the barbarian's destruction''
    ({{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=104 (7)}})

According to {{harvtxt|Chomsky|1981|p=104}}, the constructions in (10) are analogous to "the barbarians destroyed Rome" and ''destruction'' needs to assign theta-roles in line with theta-criterion. It assigns "agent" to ''the barbarians'' and "theme" to ''Rome'' so (i) is fine. The verb "destroy" alone doesn't obligatorily assign theta-role to its subject so (ii) and (iii) is well-formed, too. However, "destroy" must assign a "theme", so (iv) is ruled out.

== Alternative approaches ==
Theta-criterion experienced its golden age in the 1980s when people discussed its application to various languages and structures and developed many other theories from it. However, after the [[minimalist program]] challenged some cornerstones of government and binding theory, people started to question the validity of this criterion, especially the number of theta-roles allowed to be taken by an argument. Hornstein and Boeckx, for example, proposed that there is no upper limit on the number of theta-roles an argument can receive during derivation. In their theory, the function of selecting correct number of arguments is shouldered by [[case theory]], and theta-roles are just features on verbs that needs to be checked {{harv|Hornstein|1999}}.

In [[construction]] or [[renovation]], '''underpinning''' is the process of strengthening the [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] of an existing [[building]] or other [[structure]].  Underpinning may be necessary for a variety of reasons:

*The original foundation isn't strong or stable enough.
*The usage of the structure has changed.
*The properties of the [[soil]] supporting the foundation may have changed (possibly through [[subsidence]]) or were mischaracterized during design.
*The construction of nearby structures necessitates the [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] of soil supporting existing foundations.
*To increase the depth or load capacity of existing foundations to support the addition of another storey to the building (above or below grade).
*It is more economical, due to [[land price]] or otherwise, to work on the present structure's foundation than to build a new one.
*[[Earthquake]], flood, drought or other natural causes have caused the structure to move, requiring stabilisation of foundation soils and/or footings.

Underpinning may be accomplished by extending the foundation in depth or breadth so it either rests on a more supportive soil [[stratum]] or distributes its load across a greater area. Use of micropiles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismicropiles.org/|title=International Society for Micropiles|publisher=International Society for Micropiles|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pressure grouting|jet grouting]] are common methods in underpinning. An alternative to underpinning is the strengthening of the soil by the introduction of a [[grout]], including expanding urethane-based engineered structural resins.

Underpinning may be necessary where P class (problem) soils in certain areas of the site are encountered.

Through [[semantic change]] the word underpinning has evolved to encompass all [[abstraction|abstract]] concepts that serve as a foundation.

==Mass Concrete Underpinning==
'Traditional underpinning,' the mass concrete underpinning method is nearly 100 years in age, and the protocol has not changed. This underpinning method strengthens an existing structure's foundation by digging boxes by hand underneath and sequentially pouring concrete in a strategic order.  The result is a foundation built underneath the existing foundation. This underpinning method is generally applied when the existing foundation is at a shallow depth, but works well up to fifty feet (fifteen meters) deep. The method has not changed since its inception with its use of utilitarian tools such as shovels and post hole diggers. Heavy machinery is not employed in this method due to the small size of the boxes being dug.  There are several advantages to using this method of underpinning, including the simplicity of the engineering, the low cost of labor, and the continuity of the structure's use during construction.

==Beam and base underpinning==
The beam and base method of underpinning is a more technically advanced adaptation of traditional mass concrete underpinning. A reinforced concrete beam is constructed below, above or in replacement of the existing footing. The beam then transfers the load of the building to mass concrete bases, which are constructed at designed strategic locations. Base sizes and depths are dependent upon the prevailing ground conditions. Beam design is dependent upon the configuration of the building and the applied loads. Anti-heave precautions are often incorporated in schemes where potential expansion of clay soils may occur.

==Mini-piled underpinning==
Mini-piles have the greatest use where ground conditions are variable, where access is restrictive, where environmental pollution aspects are significant, and where structural movements in service must be minimal. Mini-piled underpinning is generally used when the loads from the foundations need to be transferred to stable soils at considerable depths - usually in excess of {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  Mini-piles may either be augured or driven steel cased, and are normally between {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.  Structural engineers will use rigs which are specifically designed to operate in environments with restricted headroom and limited space, and can gain access through a regular domestic doorway.  They are capable of constructing piles to depths of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  The technique of minipiling was first applied in Italy in 1952, and has gone through many different names, reflecting worldwide acceptance and expiration of the original patents.&lt;ref name="Recent Examples"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wefixfoundation.com/underpinning/|title=We Fix Foundation - Foundation &amp; Structural Repair Company/Contractor.|last=|first=|date=|website=We Fix Foundation|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The relatively small diameter of mini-piles is distinctive of this type of underpinning and generally uses anchoring or tie backs into an existing structure or rock.  Conventional drilling and grouting methods are used for this method of underpinning.  These mini-piles have a high slenderness ratio, feature substantial steel reinforcing elements and can sustain axial loading in both senses.&lt;ref name="Recent Examples" /&gt;  The working loads of mini-piles can sustain up to {{convert|1000|kN|LTf STf|abbr=in}} loads.&lt;br /&gt;
In comparison to Mass Concrete Underpinning, the engineering aspect of mini-piles is somewhat more involved, including rudimentary engineering mechanics such as statics and strength of materials.  These mini-piles must be designed to work in tension and compression, depending on the orientation and application of the design.  In detail, attention with design must be paid analytically to settlement, bursting, buckling, cracking, and interface consideration, whereas, from a practical viewpoint, corrosion resistance, and compatibility with the existing ground and structure must be regarded.

==Mini-piled underpinning schemes==
Mini-piled underpinning schemes include pile and beam, cantilever pile-caps and piled raft systems. Cantilevered pile-caps are usually used to avoid disturbing the inside of a building, and require the construction of tension and compression piles to each cap. These are normally linked by a beam. The pile and beam system usually involves constructing pairs of piles on either side of the wall and linking them with a pile cap to support the wall. The pile caps are usually linked by reinforced concrete beams to support the entire length of the wall. Piled raft underpinning systems are commonly used when an entire building needs to be underpinned. The internal floors are completely removed, a grid of piles is installed, and a reinforced concrete raft is then constructed over the complete floor level, picking up and fully supporting all external and internal walls.

==Underpinning by expanding resin injection==
A mix of structural resins and hardener is injected into foundation ground beneath footings. On entering the ground the resin and hardener mix and expansion occurs due to a chemical reaction. The expanding structural resin mix fills any voids and crevices, compacts any weak soil and then, if the injection is continued, the structure above may be raised and re-levelled. This relatively new method of underpinning has been in existence for approximately 30 years, and because it does not involve any construction or excavation set-up, is known to be a clean, fast and non-disruptive underpinning method.
