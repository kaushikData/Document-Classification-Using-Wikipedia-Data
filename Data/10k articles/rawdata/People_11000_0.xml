'''Adam Bernard Mickiewicz''' ({{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Adam_Mickiewicz.ogg|m|i|c|'|k|J|e|w|i|cz}}; 24 December 1798{{spaced ndash}}26 November 1855) was a [[Poles|Polish]]&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE NATIONALITY PER TALK DISCUSSION --&gt; poet, dramatist, essayist, publicist, translator, professor of [[Slavs|Slavic]] literature, and political activist. He is regarded as [[List of national poets#Europe|national poet]] in [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Belarus]]. A principal figure in [[romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]], he is counted  as one of Poland's "[[Three Bards]]" ("''Trzej Wieszcze''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polish-dictionary.com/poland-poetry |title=Poland's Famous Poets |publisher=Polish-dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely regarded as Poland's greatest poet.&lt;ref name="mickiewicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mickiewicz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornis-PopeNeubauer2010"/&gt; He is also considered one of the greatest [[Slavs|Slavic]]&lt;ref name="PomorskaBaran1992"/&gt; and [[Europeans|European]]&lt;ref name="budowniczowie"/&gt; poets and has been dubbed a "Slavic bard".&lt;ref name="fra"/&gt; A leading Romantic dramatist,&lt;ref name="tm"/&gt; he has been compared in Poland and Europe to [[George Gordon Byron|Byron]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref name=fra/&gt;&lt;ref name=tm/&gt;

He is known chiefly for the poetic drama ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (''Forefathers' Eve'') and the [[Epic poetry|national epic poem]] ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''. His other influential works include ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'' and ''[[Grażyna (poem)|Grażyna]]''. All these served as inspiration for uprisings against the [[Partitions of Poland|three imperial powers that had partitioned the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of existence]].

Mickiewicz was born in the [[Russian partition|Russian-partitioned]] territories of the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which had been part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and was active in the struggle to win independence for his home region.  After, as a consequence, spending five years exiled to central Russia, in 1829 he succeeded in leaving the Russian Empire and, like many of [[Great Emigration|his compatriots]], lived out the rest of his life abroad.  He settled first in Rome, then in Paris, where for a little over three years he lectured on [[Slavs|Slavic]] literature at the [[Collège de France]].  He died, probably of [[cholera]], at [[Constantinople]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], where he had gone to help organize Polish and Jewish forces to fight Russia in the [[Crimean War]].

In 1890, his remains were repatriated from [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise]], in France, to [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Kraków]], Poland.

===Early years===
[[File:Zaosie home of Mickiwiecz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zavosse|Zaosie]] manor, possible birthplace]]
[[File:Navahradak Farny kasciol.JPG|thumb|[[Transfiguration Church, Navahrudak|Church of the Transfiguration of Jesus]], in [[Navahrudak]], where Mickiewicz was baptized]]
[[File:Dom A.Mickiewicza w Nowogródku.jpg|thumb|left|Mickiewicz's house, [[Navahrudak]]]]

Adam Mickiewicz was born on 24 December 1798, either at his paternal uncle's estate in [[Zavosse|Zaosie]] (now Zavosse) near [[Navahrudak]] (in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Nowogródek'') or in Navahrudak itself{{Ref_label|a|a|none}} in what was then part of the [[Russian Empire]] and is now [[Belarus]]. The region was on the periphery of [[Lithuania proper]] and had been part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] until the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1795).&lt;ref name=venc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yad Vashem Studies"/&gt; Its upper class, including Mickiewicz's family, were either [[Polish people|Polish]] or [[polonization|Polonized]].&lt;ref name=venc/&gt; The poet's father, Mikołaj Mickiewicz, a lawyer, was a member of the Polish&lt;ref name="vytautas"/&gt; [[szlachta|nobility]] (''szlachta'')&lt;ref name="cze208"/&gt; and bore the hereditary [[Poraj coat of arms|Poraj coat-of-arms]];&lt;ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/&gt; Adam's mother was Barbara Mickiewicz, ''née'' Majewska. Adam was the second-born son in the family.&lt;ref name="psb694"/&gt;

Mickiewicz spent his childhood in Navahrudak,&lt;ref name="cze208"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb694"/&gt; initially taught by his mother and private tutors. From 1807 to 1815 he attended a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] school following a curriculum that had been designed by the now-defunct Polish [[Commission for National Education]], which had been the world's first [[ministry of education]].&lt;ref name="cze208"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb694"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wulff1992"/&gt; He was a mediocre student, although active in games, theatricals, and the like.&lt;ref name="cze208"/&gt;

In September 1815, Mickiewicz enrolled at the [[Vilnius University|Imperial University of Vilnius]], studying to be a teacher. After graduating, under the terms of his government scholarship, he taught secondary school at [[Kaunas]] from 1819 to 1823.&lt;ref name="psb694"/&gt;

In 1818, in the Polish-language ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Tygodnik Wileński|pl}}'' (Wilno Weekly), he published his first poem, "''Zima miejska''" ("City Winter").&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt; The next few years would see a maturing of his style from [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]]/[[neoclassicism]] to [[romanticism]], first in his poetry anthologies published in [[Vilnius]] in 1822 and 1823; these anthologies included the poem "''[[Grażyna (poem)|Grażyna]]''" and the first-published parts (II and IV) of his major work, ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (''Forefathers' Eve'').&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt; By 1820 he had already finished another major romantic poem, "''[[Oda do młodości]]''" ("Ode to Youth"), but it was considered to be too patriotic and revolutionary for publication and would not appear officially for many years.&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt;

About the summer of 1820, Mickiewicz met the love of his life, {{Interlanguage link multi|Maryla Wereszczakówna|pl}}. They were unable to marry due to his family's poverty and relatively low social status; in addition, she was already engaged to Count {{Interlanguage link multi|Wawrzyniec Puttkamer|pl}}, whom she would marry in 1821.&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze210"/&gt;

In 1817, while still a student, Mickiewicz, [[Tomasz Zan]] and other friends had created a secret organization, the [[Philomaths]].&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt; The group focused on self-education but had ties to a more radical, clearly pro-Polish-independence student group, the [[Filaret Association]].&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt; An investigation of secret student organizations by [[Nikolay Novosiltsev]], begun in early 1823, led to the arrests of a number of students and ex-student activists including Mickiewicz, who was taken into custody and imprisoned at Vilnius' Basilian monastery in late 1823 or early 1824 (sources disagree as to the date).&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt;  After investigation into his political activities, specifically his membership in the [[Philomaths]], in 1824 Mickiewicz was banished to central Russia.&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt;  Within a few hours of  receiving the decree on 22 October 1824, he penned a poem into an album belonging to Salomea Bécu, the mother of [[Juliusz Słowacki]].&lt;ref name="mickiewitch"/&gt;  (In 1975 this poem was set to music in Polish and Russian by Soviet composer [[David Tukhmanov]].)&lt;ref name="popsa"/&gt;  Mickiewicz crossed the border into Russia about 11 November 1824, arriving in [[Saint Petersburg]] later that month.&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt; He would spend most of the next five years in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, except for a notable 1824 to 1825 excursion to [[Odessa]], then on to [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name="cze218"/&gt; That visit, from February to November 1825, inspired a notable collection of [[sonnet]]s (some love sonnets, and a series known as ''[[Crimean Sonnets]]'', published a year later).&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze218"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt;

Mickiewicz was welcomed into the leading literary circles of [[Saint Petersburg]] and Moscow, where he became a great favorite for his agreeable manners and extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation.&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; The year 1828 saw the publication of his poem ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]''.&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; Novosiltsev, who recognized its patriotic and subversive message, which had been missed by the Moscow censors, unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage its publication and to damage Mickiewicz's reputation.&lt;ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt;

In Moscow, Mickiewicz met the Polish journalist and novelist [[Henryk Rzewuski]] and the Polish composer and piano virtuoso [[Maria Szymanowska]], whose daughter, [[Celina Szymanowska]], Mickiewicz would later marry in Paris, France. He also befriended the great Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]]&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; and [[Decembrist]] leaders including [[Kondraty Ryleyev]].&lt;ref name="cze218"/&gt; It was thanks to his friendships with many influential individuals that he was eventually able to obtain a passport and permission to leave Russia for Western Europe.&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt;

After serving five years of exile to Russia, Mickiewicz received permission to go abroad in 1829. On 1 June that year, he arrived in [[Weimar]].&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; By 6 June he was in [[Berlin]], where he attended lectures by the philosopher [[G.W.F. Hegel|Hegel]].&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; In February 1830 he visited [[Prague]], later returning to [[Weimar]], where he received a cordial reception from the writer, scientist and politician [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt;

He then continued on through Germany all the way to Italy, which he entered via the [[Alps]]' [[Splügen Pass]].&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; Accompanied by an old friend, the poet [[Antoni Edward Odyniec]], he visited [[Milan]], Venice, [[Florence]] and Rome.&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt; In August that same year (1830) he went to [[Geneva]], where he met fellow [[Three Bards|Polish Bard]] [[Zygmunt Krasiński]].&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt; During these travels he had a brief romance with {{Interlanguage link multi|Henrietta Ewa Ankwiczówna|pl}}, but class differences again prevented his marrying his new love.&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt;

Finally about October 1830 he took up residence in Rome, which he declared "the most amiable of foreign cities."&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt; Soon after, he learned about the outbreak of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]] in Poland, but he would not leave Rome until the spring of 1831.&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt;

On 19 April 1831 Mickiewicz departed Rome, traveling to Geneva and Paris and later, on a false passport, to Germany, via [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]] arriving about 13 August in [[Poznań]] (German name: Posen), then part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt; It is possible that during these travels he carried communications from the Italian [[Carbonari]] to the French underground, and delivered documents or money for the Polish insurgents from the Polish community in Paris, but reliable information on his activities at the time is scarce.&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze222"/&gt; Ultimately he never crossed into [[Russian Poland]], where the Uprising was mainly happening; he stayed in [[German Poland]] (historically known to Poles as ''Wielkopolska'', or Greater Poland), where he was well received by members of the local Polish nobility.&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt; He had a brief liaison with Konstancja Łubieńska at her family estate.&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt; Starting in March 1832, Mickiewicz stayed several months in [[Dresden]], in [[Saxony]],&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt; where he wrote the third part of his poem ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]''.&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt;

===Paris émigré===
[[File:David d'Angers - Adam Mickiewicz.jpg|thumb|left|Mickiewicz, 1835]]
On 31 July 1832 he arrived in Paris, accompanied by a close friend and fellow ex-[[Philomaths|Philomath]], the future geologist and [[Chile]]an educator [[Ignacy Domeyko]].&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt; In Paris, Mickiewicz became active in [[Great Emigration|many Polish émigré groups]] and published articles in ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Pielgrzym Polski|pl}}'' (The Polish Pilgrim).&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt; The fall of 1832 saw the publication, in Paris, of the third part of his ''Dziady'' (smuggled into partitioned Poland), as well as of ''{{Interlanguage link multi|The Books of the Polish People and of the Polish Pilgrimage|pl|3=Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego}}'', which Mickiewicz self-published.&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt; In 1834 he published another masterpiece, his [[epic poem]] ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt;

''Pan Tadeusz'', his longest poetic work, marked the end of his most productive literary period.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze227"/&gt; Mickiewicz would create further notable works, such as ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Lausanne Lyrics|pl|3=Liryki lozańskie}}'', 1839–40) and ''Zdania i uwagi'' (Thoughts and Remarks, 1834–40), but neither would achieve the fame of his earlier works.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt; His relative literary silence, beginning in the mid-1830s, has been variously interpreted:  he may have lost his talent; he may have chosen to focus on teaching and on political writing and organizing.&lt;ref name="cze229"/&gt;

On 22 July 1834, in Paris, he married [[Celina Szymanowska]], daughter of composer and concert pianist [[Maria Agata Szymanowska]].&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt; They would have six children (two daughters, Maria and Helena; and four sons, Władysław, Aleksander, Jan and Józef).&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt; Celina later became mentally ill, possibly with a [[major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt; In December 1838, marital problems caused Mickiewicz to attempt suicide.&lt;ref name="Twórczość"&gt;{{cite book|title=Twórczość|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SONKAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=6 April 2013|year=1998|publisher=RSW "Prasa-Książa-Ruch"|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celina would die on 5 March 1855.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt;

Mickiewicz and his family lived in relative poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work – not a very profitable endeavor.&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt; They received support from friends and patrons, but not enough to substantially change their situation.&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt; Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government.&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt; By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish émigré political scene.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt;
[[File:Adam Mickiewicz by Jan Mieczkowski.jpg|thumb|150px|Mickiewicz]]
In 1838 Mickiewicz became professor of [[Latin literature]] at the [[University of Lausanne|Lausanne Academy]], in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt; His lectures were well received, and in 1840 he was appointed to the newly established chair of [[Slavic languages]] and literatures at the [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze230"/&gt; Leaving Lausanne, he was made an honorary [[University of Lausanne|Lausanne Academy]] professor.&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt;

Mickiewicz would, however, hold the Collège de France post for little more than three years, his last lecture being delivered on 28 May 1844.&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt; His lectures were popular, drawing many listeners in addition to enrolled students, and receiving reviews in the press.&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt; Some would be remembered much later; his sixteenth lecture, on [[Slavic theater]], "was to become a kind of gospel for Polish theater directors of the twentieth century."&lt;ref name="cze223"/&gt;

But he became increasingly possessed by religious [[mysticism]] as he fell under the influence of the Polish philosopher [[Andrzej Towiański]], whom he met in 1841.&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb701"/&gt; His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government.&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb701"/&gt; The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.&lt;ref name="psb701"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alvis2005"/&gt;

In 1846 Mickiewicz severed his ties with Towiański, following the rise of revolutionary sentiment in Europe, manifested in events such as the [[Kraków Uprising]] of February 1846.&lt;ref name="psb702"/&gt; Mickiewicz criticized Towiański's passivity and returned to the traditional Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="psb702"/&gt; In 1847 Mickiewicz befriended American journalist, critic and women's-rights advocate [[Margaret Fuller]].&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt; In March 1848 he was part of a Polish delegation received in audience by [[Pope Pius IX]], whom he asked to support the enslaved nations and the [[French Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref name="psb702"/&gt; Soon after, in April 1848, he organized a military unit, the [[Mickiewicz Legion]], to support the insurgents, hoping to liberate the Polish and other Slavic lands.&lt;ref name="cze230"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb702"/&gt; The unit never became large enough to be more than symbolic, and in the fall of 1848 Mickiewicz returned to Paris and became more active again on the political scene.&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt;

In December 1848 he was offered a post at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Austrian-ruled [[Kraków]], but the offer was soon withdrawn after pressure from Austrian authorities.&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt; In the winter of 1848–49, Polish composer [[Frédéric Chopin]], in the final months of his own life, visited his ailing compatriot and soothed the poet's nerves with his piano music.&lt;ref name="jachimecki"/&gt; Over a dozen years earlier, Chopin had set two of Mickiewicz's poems to music (see [[Polish songs by Frédéric Chopin]]).&lt;ref name="jachimecki2"/&gt;

===Final years===

[[File:İstanbul 6137.jpg|thumb|Mickiewicz's temporary grave under his [[Istanbul]] apartment, now an [[Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Istanbul|Adam Mickiewicz Museum]]]]
In the winter of 1849 Mickiewicz founded a French-language newspaper, ''[[La Tribune des Peuples]]'' (''The Peoples' Tribune''), supported by a wealthy Polish émigré activist, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ksawery Branicki (d. 1879){{!}}Ksawery Branicki|pl|3=Ksawery Branicki (z Montrésor)}}.&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt; Mickiewicz wrote over 70 articles for the ''Tribune'' during its short existence:  it came out between 15 March and 10 November 1849, when the authorities shut it down.&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze231"/&gt;  His articles supported democracy and socialism and many ideals of the [[French Revolution]] and of the Napoleonic era, though he held few illusions regarding the idealism of the [[House of Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt; He supported the restoration of the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] in 1851.&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt; In April 1852 he lost his post at the Collège de France, which he had been allowed to keep (though without the right to lecture).&lt;ref name="psb700"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt; On 31 October 1852 he was hired as a librarian at the [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze231"/&gt; There he was visited by another Polish poet, [[Cyprian Norwid]], who wrote of the meeting in his poem, "''Czarne kwiaty''" ("Black Blossoms"); and there Mickiewicz's wife Celina died.&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt;

Mickiewicz welcomed the [[Crimean War]] of 1853-1856, which he hoped would lead to a new European order including a restored independent Poland.&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt; His last composition, a [[Latin language|Latin]] [[ode]] ''Ad Napolionem III Caesarem Augustum Ode in Bomersundum captum'', honored [[Napoleon III]] and celebrated the British-French victory over Russia at the [[Battle of Bomarsund]]&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt; in the [[Åland Islands]] in August 1854. [[Hôtel Lambert#The political salon|Polish émigrés associated with the Hôtel Lambert]] persuaded him to become active again in politics.&lt;ref name="psb703"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; Soon after the Crimean War broke out (October 1853), the French government entrusted him with a diplomatic mission.&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; He left Paris on 11 September 1855, arriving in [[Constantinople]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]], on 22 September.&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; There, working with [[Michał Czajkowski]] (Sadyk Pasha), he began organizing Polish forces to fight under Ottoman command against Russia.&lt;ref name="cze231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; With his friend [[Armand Lévy (activist)|Armand Lévy]] he also set about organizing a Jewish legion.&lt;ref name="cze231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; He returned ill from a trip to a military camp to his apartment on Yenişehir Street in the [[Beyoğlu|Pera]] (now Beyoğlu) district of Constantinople and died on 26 November 1855.&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rzeczypospolitej"/&gt; Though [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]] and others have speculated that political enemies might have poisoned Mickiewicz, there is no proof of this, and he probably contracted [[cholera]], which claimed other lives there at the time.&lt;ref name="cze231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760-1850, Volume 2"/&gt;

Mickiewicz's remains were transported to France, boarding ship on 31 December 1855, and were buried at [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise]], on 21 January 1861.&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; In 1890 they were disinterred, moved to [[Austrian Poland]], and on 4 July entombed in the crypts of [[Kraków]]'s [[Wawel Cathedral]], a place of final repose for a number of persons important to Poland's political and cultural history.&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt;

Mickiewicz's childhood environment exerted a major influence on his literary work.&lt;ref name="cze208"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb694"/&gt; His early years were shaped by immersion in [[Belarusian folklore]]&lt;ref name="cze208"/&gt; and by vivid memories, which he later reworked in his poems, of the ruins of [[Navahrudak Castle]] and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and [[Napoleon]]ic troops during [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia]].&lt;ref name="psb694"/&gt; The year 1812 also marked his father's death.&lt;ref name="psb694"/&gt; Later, the poet's personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years of living and studying in [[Vilnius]].&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt;

His first poems, such as the 1818 "''Zima miejska''" ("City Winter") and the 1819 "''Kartofla''" ("Potato"), were classical in style, influenced by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref name="cze210"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze209"/&gt; His poetry anthologies published in 1822 (including the opening poem "''Romantyczność''", "Romanticism") and 1823 mark the start of [[romanticism in Poland]].&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze210"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze212"/&gt; Mickiewicz's influence popularized the use of [[folklore]], folk literary forms, and [[historism]] in Polish romantic literature.&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt; His exile to Moscow exposed him to a cosmopolitan environment, more international than provincial [[Vilnius]] and [[Kaunas]] in Lithuania.&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; This period saw a further evolution in his writing style, with ''Sonety'' (Sonnets, 1826) and ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'' (1828), both published in Russia.&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; The ''Sonety'', mainly comprising his ''[[Crimean Sonnets]]'', highlight the poet's ability and desire to write, and his longing for his homeland.&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt;

One of his major works, ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (Forefathers' Eve), comprises several parts written over an extended period of time.&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze214217"/&gt; It began with publication of parts II and IV in 1823.&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt; [[Czesław Miłosz|Miłosz]] remarks that it was "Mickiewicz's major theatrical achievement", a work which Mickiewicz saw as ongoing and to be continued in further parts.&lt;ref name="cze222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze214217"/&gt; Its title refers to the [[pagan]] ancestor commemoration that had been practiced by [[Slavic nations|Slavic]] and [[Balts|Baltic]] peoples on [[All Souls' Day]].&lt;ref name="cze214217"/&gt; The year 1832 saw the publication of part III:  much superior to the earlier parts, a "laboratory of innovative genres, styles and forms".&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt;  Part III was largely written over a few days; the "Great Improvisation" section, a "masterpiece of Polish poetry", is said to have been created during a single inspired night.&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt;  A long descriptive poem, "''Ustęp''" (Digression), accompanying part III and written sometime before it, sums up Mickiewicz's experiences in, and views on, Russia, portrays it as a huge prison, pities the oppressed Russian people, and wonders about their future.&lt;ref name="cze224225"/&gt;  Miłosz describes it as a "summation of Polish attitudes towards Russia in the nineteenth century" and notes that it inspired responses from Pushkin ("[[The Bronze Horseman (poem)|The Bronze Horseman]]") and [[Joseph Conrad]] (''[[Under Western Eyes (novel)|Under Western Eyes]]'').&lt;ref name="cze224225"/&gt; The drama was first staged by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]] in 1901, becoming, in Miłosz's words, "a kind of national sacred play, occasionally forbidden by censorship because of its emotional impact upon the audience."  The Polish government's 1968 closing down of a production of the play sparked the [[1968 Polish political crisis]].&lt;ref name="cze223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olszewska2007"/&gt;

Mickiewicz's ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'' (1828), a [[narrative poem]] describing battles of the Christian order of [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]] against the [[pagan]]s of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]],&lt;ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/&gt; is a thinly veiled allusion to the long feud between Russia and Poland.&lt;ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; The plot involves the use of subterfuge against a stronger enemy, and the poem analyzes moral dilemmas faced by the Polish insurgents who would soon launch the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]].&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; Controversial to an older generation of readers, ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'' was seen by the young as a call to arms and was praised as such by an Uprising leader, poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Ludwik Nabielak|pl}}.&lt;ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt; Miłosz describes ''Konrad Wallenrod'' (named for its protagonist) as "the most committed politically of all Mickiewczi's poems."&lt;ref name="cze221"/&gt; The point of the poem, though obvious to many, escaped the Russian censors, and the poem was allowed to be published, complete with its telling motto drawn from [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]: ''"Dovete adunque sapere come sono due generazioni di combattere – bisogna essere volpe e leone."'' ("Ye shall know that there are two ways of fighting – you must be a fox and a lion.")&lt;ref name="Koropeckyj2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze220"/&gt; On a purely literary level, the poem was notable for incorporating traditional folk elements alongside stylistic innovations.&lt;ref name="psb696"/&gt;

[[File:Mickiewicz monument in Brest (2006).jpg|100px|thumb|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Mickiewicz in [[Brest, Belarus]]]]
Similarly noteworthy is Mickiewicz's earlier and longer 1823 poem, ''[[Grażyna (poem)|Grażyna]]'', depicting the exploits of a Lithuanian chieftainess against the Teutonic Knights.&lt;ref name="cze213"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze214"/&gt; Miłosz writes that ''Grażyna'' "combines a metallic beat of lines and syntactical rigor with a plot and motifs dear to the Romantics."&lt;ref name="cze213"/&gt; It is said by [[Christien Ostrowski]] to have inspired [[Emilia Plater]], a military heroine of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]].&lt;ref name="The Westminster Review"/&gt; A similar message informs Mickiewicz's "''Oda do młodości''" ("[[Ode to Youth]]").&lt;ref name="psb695"/&gt;

Mickiewicz's ''[[Crimean Sonnets]]'' (1825–26) and poems that he would later write in Rome and Lausanne,  Miłosz notes, have been "justly ranked among the highest achievements in Polish [lyric poetry]."&lt;ref name="cze220"/&gt; His 1830 travels in Italy likely inspired him to consider religious matters, and produced some of his best religiously-themed works, such as "''Arcymistrz''" ("The Master") and "''Do Marceliny Łempickiej''" ("To Marcelina Łempicka").&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt;  He was an authority to the young insurgents of 1830–31, who expected him to participate in the fighting (the poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Maurycy Gosławski|pl}} wrote a dedicated poem urging him to do so).&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt; Yet it is likely that Mickiewicz was no longer as idealistic and supportive of military action as he had been a few years earlier, and his new works such as "''Do matki Polki''" ("To a Polish Mother", 1830), while still patriotic, also began to reflect on the tragedy of resistance.&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt; His meetings with refugees and escaping insurgents around 1831 resulted in works such as "''Reduta Ordona''" ("Ordon's Redoubt"), "''Nocleg''" ("Night Bivouac") and "''Śmierć pułkownika''" ("Death of the Colonel").&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt; Wyka notes the irony that some of the most important literary works about the 1830 Uprising were written by Mickiewicz, who never took part in a battle or even saw a battlefield.&lt;ref name="psb697"/&gt;

His ''Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego'' (Books of the Polish Nation and the Polish Pilgrimage, 1832) opens with a historical-philosophical discussion of the [[history of humankind]] in which Mickiewicz argues that history is the history of now-unrealized freedom that awaits many oppressed nations in the future.&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt; It is followed by a longer "moral [[catechism]]" aimed at Polish émigrés.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt; The book sets out a [[messianism#Russian and Slavic|messianist]] [[metaphor]] of Poland as the "[[Christ of Europe|Christ of nations]]".&lt;ref name="cze226"/&gt; Described by Wyka as a [[propaganda]] piece, it was relatively simple, using biblical metaphors and the like to reach less-discriminating readers.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt;  It became popular not only among Poles but, in translations, among some other peoples, primarily those which lacked their own sovereign states.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze227"/&gt; The ''Books'' were influential in framing Mickiewicz's image among many not as that of a poet and author but as that of ideologue of freedom.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt;
[[File:Manuscript of Pan Tadeusz 8pl.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Manuscript]] of ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'', bearing ''(bottom right)'' his autograph signature]]
''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'' (published 1834), another of his masterpieces, is an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] that draws a picture of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] on the eve of [[Napoleon]]'s 1812 invasion of Russia.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cze227"/&gt;  It is written entirely in thirteen-syllable [[couplet]]s.&lt;ref name="cze227"/&gt; Originally intended as an apolitical [[idyll]], it became, as Miłosz writes, "something unique in world literature, and the problem of how to classify it has remained the crux of a constant quarrel among scholars"; it "has been called 'the last epos' in world literature".&lt;ref name="cze228"/&gt;  ''Pan Tadeusz'' was not highly regarded by contemporaries, nor by Mickiewicz himself, but in time it won acclaim as "the highest achievement in all Polish literature."&lt;ref name="cze229"/&gt;

The occasional poems that Mickiewicz wrote in his final decades have been described as "exquisite, gnomic, extremely short and concise".  His ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Lausanne Lyrics|pl|3=Liryki lozańskie}}'', (1839–40) are, writes Miłosz, "untranslatable masterpieces of metaphysical meditation. In Polish literature they are examples of that pure poetry that verges on silence."&lt;ref name="cze230"/&gt;

In the 1830s (as early as 1830; as late as 1837) he worked on a [[futurist]] or science-fiction work, ''A History of the Future''.&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt; It predicted inventions similar to radio and television, and interplanetary communication using [[balloon]]s.&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt;  Written in French, it was never completed and was partly destroyed by the author.&lt;ref name="psb698"/&gt; Other French-language works by Mickiewicz include the dramas ''Les Confederes de Bar'' (The [[Bar Confederation|Bar Confederates]]) and ''Jacques Jasiński, ous les deux Polognes'' (Jacques Jasiński, or the Two Polands).&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt; These would not achieve much recognition, and would not be published till 1866.&lt;ref name="psb699"/&gt; While Mickiewicz did not write any poems in Lithuanian, and his command of that language has been described as likely limited, on one occasion in the early 1850s he transcribed a short [[folk song]] in that language, ''Ejk Tatuszeli i bytiu darża''.&lt;ref name="Jackiewicz1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="znadwiliiwilno"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Surwiło1993"/&gt;

A prime figure of the [[romanticism in Poland|Polish Romantic period]], Mickiewicz is counted as one of Poland's's [[Three Bards]] (the others being [[Zygmunt Krasiński]] and [[Juliusz Słowacki]]) and the greatest poet in all [[Polish literature]].&lt;ref name="mickiewicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mickiewicz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornis-PopeNeubauer2010"/&gt; Mickiewicz has long been regarded as [[List of national poets#Europe|Poland's national poet]]&lt;ref name="Adam Mickiewicz: the national poet of Poland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krzyzanowski"/&gt; and is a revered figure in [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref name="www"/&gt; He is also considered one of the greatest [[Slavic language|Slavic]]&lt;ref name="PomorskaBaran1992"/&gt; and [[Europea]]n&lt;ref name="budowniczowie"/&gt; poets. He has been described as a "Slavic bard".&lt;ref name="fra"/&gt; He was a leading Romantic dramatist&lt;ref name="tm"/&gt; and has been compared in Poland and in Europe with [[George Gordon Byron|Byron]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref name=fra/&gt;&lt;ref name=tm/&gt;

Mickiewicz's importance extends beyond literature to the broader spheres of culture and politics; Wyka writes that he was a "singer and epic poet of the Polish people, and a pilgrim for the freedom of nations."&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; Scholars have used the expression "cult of Mickiewicz" to describe the reverence in which he is held as a "national prophet."&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wachtel2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterkiewicz1970"/&gt; On hearing of Mickiewicz's death, his fellow bard Krasiński wrote: "For men of my generation, he was milk and honey, gall and life's blood: we all descend from him. He carried us off on the surging billow of his inspiration and cast us into the world."&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MickiewiczAmerica1944"/&gt; [[Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin]] described Mickiewicz's works as [[Prometheus|Promethean]], as "reaching more Polish hearts" than the other Polish Bards, and affirmed Danish critic [[Georg Brandes]]' assessment of Mickiewicz's works as "healthier" than those of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Homer]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref name="corwin"/&gt; Koropeckyi writes that Mickiewicz has "informed the foundations of [many] parties and ideologies" in Poland from the 19th century to this day, "down to the rappers in Poland's post-socialist blocks, who can somehow still declare that 'if Mickiewicz was alive today, he'd be a good rapper.'"&lt;ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/&gt; While Mickiewicz's popularity has endured two centuries in Poland, he is less well known abroad though, particularly in the 19th century, he won substantial international fame among "people that dared resist the brutal might of reactionary empires."&lt;ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/&gt;

Mickiewicz has been written about or had works dedicated to him by many authors in Poland ([[Adam Asnyk|Asnyk]], [[Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński|Gałczyński]], [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz|Iwaszkiewicz]], [[Mieczysław Jastrun|Jastrun]], [[Jan Kasprowicz|Kasprowicz]], [[Jan Lechoń|Lechoń]], [[Maria Konopnicka|Konopnicka]], [[Teofil Lenartowicz]], Norwid, [[Julian Przyboś|Przyboś]], [[Tadeusz Różewicz|Różewicz]], [[Antoni Słonimski|Słonimski]], Słowacki, [[Leopold Staff|Staff]], [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer|Tetmajer]], [[Julian Tuwim|Tuwim]], [[Kornel Ujejski|Ujejski]], [[Kazimierz Wierzyński|Wierzyński]], [[Józef Bohdan Zaleski|Zaleski]] and others) and by authors outside Poland ([[Valery Bryusov|Bryusov]], Goethe, Pushkin, [[Ludwig Uhland|Uhland]], [[Jaroslav Vrchlický|Vrchlický]] and others).&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; He has been a character in works of fiction, including a large body of dramatized biographies, e.g., in 1900, [[Stanisław Wyspiański]]'s ''Legion''.&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; He has also been a subject of many paintings, by [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Józef Oleszkiewicz]], [[Aleksander Orłowski]], [[Wojciech Stattler]] and [[Walenty Wańkowicz]].&lt;ref name="psb705"/&gt; Monuments and other tributes (streets and schools named for him) abound in Poland and Lithuania, and in other former territories of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]: [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]].&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/&gt; He has also been the subject of many statues and busts by [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[David d'Angers]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Antoni Kurzawa|pl}}, [[Władysław Oleszczyński]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Zbigniew Pronaszko|pl}}, [[Teodor Rygier]], [[Wacław Szymanowski]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Jakub Tatarkiewicz|pl}}.&lt;ref name="psb705"/&gt; In 1898, the 100th anniversary of his birth, a towering statue by [[Cyprian Godebski (sculptor)|Cyprian Godebski]] was erected in Warsaw.  Its base carries the inscription, "To the Poet from the People".&lt;ref name="Warsaw and surroundings"/&gt; In 1955, the 100th anniversary of his death, the [[University of Poznań]] adopted him as its official patron.&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt;

A number of museums in Europe are dedicated to Mickiewicz.  [[Warsaw]] has an [[Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature, Warsaw|Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature]].&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt; His house in [[Navahrudak]], [[Belarus]], is now a museum ({{Interlanguage link multi|Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Navahrudak|pl|3=Muzeum Adama Mickiewicza w Nowogródku}});&lt;ref name="Muzeum Adama Mickiewicza w Nowogródku"/&gt; as is the house where he lived and died in Constantinople ([[Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Istanbul]]).&lt;ref name="psb704"/&gt;  There is a ''[[Musée Adam Mickiewicz]]'' in [[Paris, France]].&lt;ref name="Musee Adam Mickiewicz"/&gt;

Much has been written about Mickiewicz, though the vast majority of this scholarly and popular literature is available only in Polish.  Works devoted to him, according to Koropeckyi, author of a 2008 English biography, "could fill a good shelf or two".&lt;ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/&gt; Koropeckyi notes that, apart from some specialist literature, only five book-length biographies of Mickiewicz have been published in English.&lt;ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/&gt; He also writes that, though many of Mickiewicz's works have been reprinted numerous times, no language has a "definitive critical edition of his works."&lt;ref name="Koropeckyi2008-pref"/&gt;

[[File:LT-1998-50litų-Mickevičius-b.png|thumb|[[Litas|Lithuanian coin]] featuring a stylized Mickiewicz]]
Adam Mickiewicz, whose works were written in the [[Polish language]],&lt;ref name="O'Connor2006"/&gt; is generally known as a [[List of Polish poets|Polish poet]].&lt;ref name="O'Connor2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kridl1951"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Classe2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prospects"/&gt; He is described by some authors as "[[Polish-Lithuanian (adjective)|Polish-Lithuanian]]"&lt;ref name="william"/&gt;&lt;ref name="communicating"/&gt; or [[Belarusians|Belarusian]]-Polish.&lt;ref name="United Nations in Belarus - Culture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="katolickiego"/&gt; ''The Cambridge History of Russia'' describes him as Polish but sees his ethnic origins as "Lithuanian-Belarusian (and perhaps Jewish)."&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Russia: Imperial Russia, 1689-1917"/&gt; According to the Belarusian historian Rybczonek, Mickiewicz's mother had [[Tatar]] ([[Polish Tatars]]) roots.&lt;ref name="mickiewicza"/&gt;

Some sources assert that Mickiewicz's mother was descended from a converted, [[Jacob Frank|Frankist]] Jewish family.&lt;ref name="movement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brotherhood"/&gt; Others view this as improbable.&lt;ref name="cze231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="contemporaries"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frankists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="niniwa2"/&gt; Polish historian [[Kazimierz Wyka]], in his biographic entry in ''[[Polski Słownik Biograficzny]]'' (1975) writes that this hypothesis, based on the fact that his mother's maiden name, Majewska, was popular among [[Frankism|Frankist]] Jews, has not been proven.&lt;ref name="psb694"/&gt; Wyka states that poet's mother was the daughter of a noble (''[[szlachta]]'') family of [[Starykoń coat of arms]], living on an estate at [[Czombrów]] in [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1507–1795)|Nowogródek Voivodeship]] (Navahrudak Voivodeship).&lt;ref name="psb694"/&gt;

The Lithuanian scholar of literature {{Interlanguage link multi|Juozapas Girdzijauskas|lt}} writes that Mickiewicz's family was descended from an old [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuanian noble family]] (Rimvydas) with origins predating Lithuania's Christianization.&lt;ref name="antologija"/&gt; The Lithuanian nobility in Mickiewicz's time was heavily [[Polonized]] and spoke Polish.&lt;ref name=venc/&gt; Mickiewicz had been brought up in the culture of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a multicultural state that had encompassed most of what today are the separate countries of [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. To Mickiewicz, a splitting of that multicultural state into separate entities, due to trends such as [[Lithuanian National Revival|Lithuanian separatism]], was undesirable,&lt;ref name=venc/&gt; if not outright unthinkable.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2006"/&gt; According to Romanucci-Ross, while Mickiewicz called himself a '' [[Litvin|Litwin]]'' ("Lithuanian"), in his time the idea of a separate [[Polish-Lithuanian identity|"Lithuanian identity", apart from a "Polish" one]], did not exist.&lt;ref name="prospects"/&gt;  This multicultural aspect is evident in his works; his most famous poetic work, ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'', begins with the Polish-language invocation, "O Lithuania, my country, thou art like good health&amp;nbsp;..." (''"Litwo! Ojczyzno moja! ty jesteś jak zdrowie&amp;nbsp;..."''. It is generally accepted, however, that Mickiewicz, when referring to Lithuania, meant a historical region rather than a linguistic and cultural entity, and he often applied the term "Lithuanian" to the Slavic inhabitants of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (see [[Litvin]]).&lt;ref name="venc"/&gt; Mickiewicz joined the Philomaths while studying at Vilnius University, an organisation which supported the re-emergence of a Polish state free of Russian influence, but which did not support the emergence of separate Lithuanian or Belarusian states.

'''Anne Twysden''' (28 February 1574 – 14 October 1638) was a [[Kingdom of England|British]] writer. She was the mother of several notable children but she is known principally for one book and the original of this work is lost.

==Life==
Twysden was born in [[London]] in 1574 at [[Heneage House]]. Her parents were [[Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet]] and his wife [[Elizabeth_Finch,_1st_Countess_of_Winchilsea|Elizabeth Heneage]] who became the 1st Countess of Winchilsea. Anne learned four languages as a child at the court of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] whilst in the care of her grandmother Elizabeth (born Heneage). Anne married [[Sir William Twysden, 1st Baronet|William Twysden]] who was made a baronet. They had seven children before he died in 1629. She had her own ladies-in-waiting which included Isabella Saunder and Jane Thomlinson and she married these off to her son [[Roger Twysden|Roger]] in 1635 and to another son Thomas in 1639. She had two houses at East Peckham and Redcross Street in London.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Her children had to persuade her to pay Charles I's [[Ship money]] which she objected to.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; She wrote a book of devotions that was edited and published by her son Roger. Her son's notes show that this was published after her death in 1638. The Twysden papers and two of her letters are held by the [[British Library]]. Twysden's original copy of her devotions was known to have existed until 1849 but it is now lost.&lt;ref name=manu&gt;[http://celm2.dighum.kcl.ac.uk/introductions/TwysdenAnneLady.html Lady Anne Twsden], The Catalogue of English Literary Manuscripts 1450–1700, Retrieved 14 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Twysden died in [[Kent]] in 1638.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Marie-Louise Coolahan, ‘Twysden , Anne, Lady Twysden (1574–1638)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/46928, accessed 14 Jan 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33180">'''Arabic names''' were historically based on a long naming system; most [[Arab]]s did not have [[given name|given]]/[[middle name|middle]]/[[family name]]s, but a full chain of names. This system was mainly in use throughout the [[Arab world]].

==Name structure==

===''{{transl|ar|Ism}}''===
The ''{{transl|ar|ism}}'' ({{lang|ar|اسم}}), is the given name, first name, or personal name; e.g. "[[Ahmad]]" or "[[Fatimah]]". Most Arabic names have meaning as ordinary [[adjectives]] and [[nouns]], and are often aspirational of character. For example, ''[[Muhammad (name)|Muhammad]]'' means 'Praiseworthy' and ''[[Ali]]'' means 'Exalted' or 'High'.

The syntactic context will generally differentiate the name from the noun/adjective. However Arabic newspapers will occasionally place names in brackets, or quotation marks, to avoid confusion.

Indeed such is the popularity of the name ''Muhammad'' throughout parts of [[Africa]], [[Arabia]], the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], it is often  represented by the abbreviation "Md.", "Mohd.", "Muhd.", or just "M.".  In India, Pakistan, [[Bangladeshi name|Bangladesh]], [[Malaysian names|Malaysia]], Indonesia and the Philippines, due to its almost ubiquitous use as a first name, a person will often be referred to by their second name:
* Md. Dinar ibn Raihan
* Mohd. Umair Tanvir
* Md. Osman

===''{{transl|ar|Laqab}}''===
The ''laqab'' ({{lang|ar|لقب}}),&amp;nbsp;pl. ''alqāb'' ({{lang|ar|القاب}}); [[agnomen]]; [[cognomen]]; nickname; title, honorific; last name, [[surname]], family name.&lt;ref&gt;dnsi.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Hans-Wehr-English-Arabic-Dctionary-Searchable-Format-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The ''laqab''  is typically descriptive of the person.

An example is the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] (of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' fame). ''{{transl|ar|Harun}}'' is the Arabic version of the name ''[[Aaron]]'' and ''{{transl|ar|al-Rasheed}}'' means "the Rightly-Guided".

In ancient Arab societies, use of a ''laqab'' was common, but today is restricted to the surname, or family name, of birth.

===''{{transl|ar|Nasab}}''===
{{See also|Patronymic#Arabic}}
&lt;!-- '''Note:''' in accordance with [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Arabic)]], the Arabic particle '''بن''' ("son of") should be transliterated '''''ibn''''' unless a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Arabic)#Primary transcription|primary transcription]] requires the colloquial form '''''bin''''' (e.g. [[Osama bin Laden]]). --&gt;

The ''nasab'' ({{lang|ar|نسب}}) is a [[patronymic]] or series of patronymics.  It indicates the person's heritage by the word ''ibn'' ({{lang|ar|ابن}} "son", colloquially ''bin'') or ''ibnat'' ( "daughter", also {{lang|ar|بنت}} ''bint'', abbreviated ''bte.'').

[[Ibn Khaldun]] ({{lang|ar|ابن خلدون}}) means "son of Khaldun". Khaldun is the father's personal name or, in this particular case, the name of a remote ancestor.

Several ''nasab'' names can follow in a chain to trace a person's ancestry backwards in time, as was important in the [[tribe|tribally]] based society of the ancient Arabs, both for purposes of identification and for socio-political interactions. Today, however, ''ibn'' or ''bint'' is no longer used (unless it is the official naming style in a country, region, etc.: Adnen bin Abdallah). The plural is ''{{transl|ar|'Abnā}}'' for males and ''{{transl|ar|Banāt}}'' for females. However, ''{{transl|ar|Banu}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|Bani}}'' is tribal and encompasses both sexes.

===''{{transl|ar|Nisbah}}''===
{{main article|Nisbat (onomastics)}}
The ''[[Nisbat (onomastics)|nisbah]]'' ({{lang|ar|نسبة}}) surname could be an everyday name, but is mostly the name of the ancestral tribe, city, country, or any other term used to show relevance. It follows a family through several generations. It most often appears as a demonym (ex. البغدادي "Al-Baghdadi", meaning that the person is of Baghdad or descendant of people from Baghdad).

The ''laqab'' and ''nisbah'' are similar in use, thus, a name rarely contains both.

===''{{transl|ar|Kunya}}''===
{{main article|Kunya (Arabic)}}
A ''[[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]]'' ({{lang-ar|كنية}}, ''kunyah'')&lt;ref&gt;Shahpurshah Hormasji Hodivala, Historical Studies in Mug̲h̲al Numismatics, Numismatic Society of India, 1976 (Reprint of the 1923 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[teknonym]] in Arabic names. It is a component of an Arabic name, a type of [[epithet]], in theory referring to the bearer's first-born son or daughter. By extension, it may also have hypothetical or metaphorical references, e.g. in a ''[[nom de guerre]]'' or a nickname, without literally referring to a son or a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pedzisai Mashiri]], [http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Journal%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Zimbabwe/vol26n1/juz026001007.pdf "Terms of Address in Shona: A Sociolinguistic Approach"], ''[[Zambezia: The Journal of Humanities of the University of Zimbabwe|Zambezia]],'' XXVI (i), pp. 93–110, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Sabri Khalil al-Banna was known as [[Abu Nidal]], "father of struggle".

Use of a kunya implies a familiar but respectful setting.

A kunya is expressed by the use of ''[[Abu (Arabic term)|abū]]'' (father) or ''[[Umm (Arabic term)|umm]]'' (mother) in a [[idafah|genitive construction]], i.e. "father of" or "mother of" as an [[honorific]] in place of or alongside [[given name]]s in the [[Arab world]] and the [[Islamic world]] more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, ''Islamic Names: An Introduction'', Edinburgh University Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-85224-563-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-85224-563-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A kunya may also be a nickname expressing the attachment of an individual to a certain thing, as in [[Abu Bakr]], "father of the camel foal", given because of this person's kindness towards camels.

==Islamic naming practices==
{{see also|List of Arabic theophoric names}}
A common name-form among Arab Muslims is the prefix ''{{transl|ar|[[Abd (Arabic)|ʿAbd]]}}'' ("servant", {{abbr|fem.|feminine}} ''{{transl|ar|ʿAmah}}'') combined with the name of [[Allah]] (God), ''{{transl|ar|Abdullah}}'' ({{lang|ar|عبد الله}} "servant of God"), or with one of the [[Names of God in Islam|epithets of Allah]]. 

As a mark of deference, ''{{transl|ar|ʿAbd}}'' is usually not conjoined with the prophets' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Metcalf|first=Barbara D.|title=Islam in South Asia in Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pR0LzVCpfw8C&amp;pg=PA344|date=2009-09-08|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-3138-5|page=344|quote=One must avoid names whose ambiguity suggests something unlawful. It is for this reason that the scholars forbid having names like 'Abd al-Nabi (Slave of the Prophet).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless such names are accepted in some areas.  Its use is not exclusive to Muslims and in Lebanon and Egypt, the name ''Abdel-Massih'', "Servant of Christ", is a common Christian last name.

During the Persian [[Ghurid dynasty]], [[Amir Suri]] and his son [[Muhammad ibn Suri]] adopted Muslim names despite being non-Muslims.  Other non-Muslim peoples, such as the [[Kalash people|Kalash]], also take names such as Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/modernity-and-muslims-encroach-on-unique-tribe-in-pakistan-1433370643&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/documents/print/WSJ_-A016-20150604.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Converts to Islam may often continue using the native non-Arabic non-Islamic names that are without any polytheistic connotation, or association.

==Christian naming practices==
To an extent [[Arab Christians]] have names indistinguishable from Muslims, excepting some explicitly Islamic names, e.g. ''Muhammad''. Some common Christian names are:
* Arabic versions of Christian names (e.g. saints' names: ''{{transl|ar|Buṭrus}}'' for ''[[Saint Peter]]'').
* Names of [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] or [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]] origin.
* Use of [[Europe]]an names, especially [[French language|French]], Greek and, to a lesser extent, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ones (in [[Morocco]]). This has been a centuries-long convention for Christian Arabs, especially in the [[Levant]]. For example: [[Émile Eddé]], [[George Habash]], [[Charles Helou]], [[Camille Chamoun]].
* Names in honor of Jesus Christ:
: ''{{transl|ar|Abd al-Yasuʿ}}'' ({{abbr|masc.|masculine}} ) / ''{{transl|ar|Amat al-Yasuʿ}}'' ({{abbr|fem.|feminine}}) ("Slave of Jesus")
: ''{{transl|ar|Abd al-Masiḥ}}'' (masc.) / ''{{transl|ar|Amat al-Masiḥ}}'' (fem.) ("Slave of the [[Messiah]]")
: Derivations of ''{{transl|ar|Maseeḥ}}'' ("Messiah"): ''{{transl|ar|Masūḥun}}'' ("Most Anointed"), ''{{transl|ar|Amsāḥ}}'' ("More Anointed"), ''{{transl|ar|Mamsūḥ}}'' "Anointed" and ''{{transl|ar|Musayḥ}}'' "Infant Christ". The [[Semitic root|root]], ''{{transl|ar|M-S-Ḥ}}'', means "to anoint" (as in ''[[masah]]'') and is cognate to the [[Messiah in Judaism|Hebrew ''{{transl|he|Mashiah}}'']].
* ''{{transl|ar|Abd al-Ilāh}}'' ("Worshipper of God") is a Christian equivalent to the common Muslim name Abdullah.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Dynastic or family name==
Some people, especially in the Arabian Peninsula, when descendant of a famous ancestor, start their last name with ''Āl'' "family, clan" ({{rtl-lang|ar|آل}}), like the [[House of Saud]] {{lang|ar|ﺁل صعود}} ''Āl Ṣaʻūd'' or [[Al ash-Sheikh]] ("family of the [[sheikh]]"). ''Āl'' is distinct from the [[al-|definite article]] ({{rtl-lang|ar|ال}}).  If a reliably-sourced version of the Arabic spelling includes {{rtl-lang|ar|آل}} (as a separate graphic word), then this is {{em|not}} a case of the definite article, so {{transl|ar|Al}} (capitalised and followed by a space, not a hyphen) should be used. ''Ahl'', which has a similar meaning, is sometimes used and should be used if the Arabic spelling is {{rtl-lang|ar|أهل}}.

Dynasty membership alone does {{em|not}} necessarily imply that the dynastic {{rtl-lang|ar|آل}} is used – e.g. [[Bashar al-Assad]].

===Example===
&lt;big&gt;'''{{lang|ar|محمد بن سلمان بن امین الفارسی}}'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Muḥammad ibn Salmān ibn Amīn al-Farsī&lt;br /&gt;

:''Ism'' - Muḥammad (proper name, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} "praised")
:''Nasab'' - Salmān (father's name, lit. "secure")
:''Nasab'' - Amīn (grandfather's name, "trustworthy")
:''Nisbah'' - al-Farsī ("the Persian").

"Muḥammad, son of Salmān, son of Amīn, the Persian"

This person would simply be referred to as "Muḥammad" or by his [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]], which relates him to his first-born son, e.g. ''Abū Karīm'' "father of Karīm". To signify respect or to specify which Muḥammad one is speaking about, the name could be lengthened to the extent necessary or desired.

== Common mistakes by foreigners ==
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{original research|date=September 2012}}
{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}
}}

Non-Arabic speakers often make these mistakes:
* Separating "the X of Y" word combinations (see [[iḍāfah]]):
** With "Abdul": Arabic names may be written "Abdul (something)", but "Abdul" means "servant of the" and is not, by itself, a name. Thus for example, to address Abdul Rahman bin Omar al-Ahmad by his given name, one says "Abdul Rahman", not merely "Abdul". If he introduces himself as "Abdul Rahman" (which means "the servant of the Merciful"), one does not say "Mr. Rahman" (as "Rahman" is not a family name but part of his &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[theophoric]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; personal name); instead it would be Mr. al-Ahmad, the latter being the family name.
** People not familiar with Arabic [[sandhi]] in ''iḍāfah'': ''Habībullāh'' = "beloved (''Habīb'') of (''ul'') God (''[[Allāh]]'')"; here a person may in error report the man's name as "forename ''Habib'', surname ''Ullah''". Likewise, people may confuse a name such as Jalālu-d-dīn ("The majesty of the religion") as being "Jalal Uddin", or "Mr. Uddin", when "Uddin" is not a surname, but the second half of a two-word name (the desinence ''-u'' of the [[construct state]] nominative, plus the [[al-|article]], appearing as ''-d-'', plus the genitive ''dīn[i]'').  To add to the confusion, some immigrants to Western countries have adopted Uddin as a surname, although it is grammatically incorrect in Arabic outside the context of the associated "first name". Even [[Indian Muslims]] commit the same error. If a person's name is Abd-ul-Rahim ("servant of [[R-Ḥ-M|the Merciful]]"), others may call him Mr. Abdul ("servant of the") which would sound quite odd to a native speaker of Arabic.
* Not distinguishing ''{{transl|ar|ʻalāʾ}}'' from ''{{transl|ar|Allah}}'': Some Muslim names include the Arabic word ''{{transl|ar|ʻalāʾ}}'' ({{lang|ar|علاء}} "nobility"). Here, ⟨ʻ⟩ represents the ''[[ayin]]'', a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]], ⟨ʾ⟩ represents the [[hamza]], a [[glottal stop]], and ⟨l⟩ is spelled and pronounced at ordinary length, /l/. In ''{{transl|ar|Allāh}}'', the ''l'' is written twice (⟨ll⟩) and pronounced twice as long (a [[geminate]]), as /lː/ or /ll/. In Arabic pronunciation, ''{{transl|ar|ʻalāʾ}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|Allāh}}'' are clearly different. But [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], [[Iranian people|Iranians]], and [[India]]ns may not pronounce some Arabic sounds as a native Arabic speaker would, and thus tend to pronounce them identically. For example, the name ''{{transl|ar|ʻAlāʾ al-dīn}}'' ([[Aladdin (name)]], "the Nobility of the Faith") is sometimes misspelled as ''{{transl|ar|Allāh al-dīn}}''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} There is another name ''{{transl|ar|ʻAlaʾ-Allah}}'' (''Aliullah'', "the Nobility of God"), which uses both distinctly.
* Taking ''{{transl|ar|bin}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ibn}}'' for a middle name: As stated above, these words indicate the order of the family chain. Westerners often confuse them with middle names, especially when they're written as "Ben", as it is the case in some countries. For example, Sami Ben Ahmed would be mistakenly addressed as Mr. Ben Ahmed. To correctly address the person, one should use Mr. Sami Ahmed or Mr. Ahmed.
* Grammar: As between all languages, there are differences between Arabic grammar and the grammar of other languages. Arabic forms noun compounds in the opposite order from Indo-Iranian languages, for example. During the war in [[Afghanistan]] in 2002, a [[BBC]] team found in [[Kabul]] an [[internally displaced person]] whose name they stated as "Allah Muhammad". This may be a misspelling for ''{{transl|ar|ʻalāʾ}}'', for if not, by the rules of Arabic grammar, this name means "the Allah who belongs to Muhammad", which would be unacceptable religiously. However, by the rules of [[Iranian languages]] and most [[languages of India]], this name does mean "Muhammad who belongs to Allah", being the equivalent of the Arabic "Muhammadullah". [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Most Afghans]] speak Iranian languages. Such Arabo-Iranian or Arabo-Indian mixed-language compound names are not uncommon in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Tajikistan. There is, for example, the Pakistani/Indian name ''Allah-Ditta'' which joins the Arabic ''Allah'' with the Punjabi ''Ditta'' "given".

==Arab family naming convention==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Tiny Tim (musician)]] --&gt;
In Arabic culture, as in many parts of the world, a person's ancestry and family name are very important. An example is explained below.

Assume a man is called ''Saleh ibn Tariq ibn Khalid al-Fulan''.
* ''Saleh'' is his personal name, and the one that his family and friends would call him by.
* ''ibn'' translates as "son of", so ''Tariq'' is Saleh's father's name.
* ''ibn Khalid'' means that Tariq is the son of Khalid, making Khalid the grandfather of Saleh.
* ''al-Fulan'' would be Saleh's family name.
Hence, ''Saleh ibn Tariq ibn Khalid al-Fulan'' translates as "Saleh, son of Tariq, son of Khalid; of the family al-Fulan."

The Arabic for "daughter of" is ''bint.'' A woman with the name ''Fatimah bint Tariq ibn Khalid al-Goswami'' translates as "Fatimah, daughter of Tariq, son of Khalid; of the family al-Goswami."

In this case, ibn and bint are included in the official naming. Most Arab countries today, however, do not use 'ibn' and 'bint' in their naming system. If Saleh were an Egyptian, he would be called ''Saleh Tariq Khalid al-Fulan'' and Fatimah would be ''Fatimah Tariq Khalid al-Goswami.''

If Saleh marries a wife (who would keep her own [[maiden name|maiden]], family, and surnames), their children will take Saleh's family name. Therefore, their son Mohammed would be called ''Mohammed ibn Saleh ibn Tariq al-Fulan.''

However, not all Arab countries use the name in its full length, but conventionally use two- and three-word names, and sometimes four-word names in official or legal matters. Thus the first name is the personal name, the middle name is the father's name and the last name is the family name.

==Arabic names and their biblical equivalent==
The Arabic names listed below are used in the Arab world, as well as some other Muslim regions, with correspondent Hebrew, English, [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Greek equivalents in many cases. They are not necessarily of Arabic origin, although some are. Most are derived from Syriac transliterations of the Hebrew Bible. For more information, see also Iranian, Malay, Pakistani, and Turkish names.

* The popular romanization of the Arabized and Hebrew names are written first, then the standardized romanization are written in oblique. Notice that Arabized names may have variants.
* If a literal Arabic translation of a name exists, it will be placed after the final standardized romanization. 
* If an Arabic correlation is ambiguous, ''(?)'' will be placed following the name in question.
*: &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Yassou' is the Arab Christian name, while [[ʿĪsā]] is the Muslim version of the name, as used in the [[Qur'an]]. There is debate as to which is the better rendition of the Aramaic Yeshua, because both names are of late origin.
*: &lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; Youhanna is the Arab Christian name of John, while Yahya is the Muslim version of the name, as used in the Qur'an. They have completely different triconsonantal roots: ''H-N-N'' ("grace") vs ''H-Y-Y'' ("Life").  Specifically, Youhanna may be the Biblical John the Baptist or the apostle.  Yahya refers specifically to John the Baptist.
* ''El'', the Hebrew word for strength/might or deity, is usually represented as ''īl'' in Arabic, although it carries no meaning in classical and modern Arabic. The only exception is its usage in the archaic Iraqi dialect.

==Indexing==
According to the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], Arabic names are [[Subject indexing|indexed]] by their surnames. Names may be alphabetized under ''Abu'' ''Abd'' and ''ibn'', while names are not alphabetized under ''al-'' and ''el-'' and are instead alphabetized under the following element.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/CHIIndexingComplete.pdf Indexes: A Chapter from The Chicago Manual of Style]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6WQIXWdqH Archive]).

'''Avraham Stern''' ({{lang-he-n|אברהם שטרן}}, ''Avraham Shtern''), alias '''Yair''' ({{lang-he|יאיר}}; December 23, 1907 – February 12, 1942) was one of the leaders of the Jewish paramilitary organization [[Irgun]]. In September 1940, he founded a breakaway militant [[Zionist]] group named [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], called the "Stern Gang" by the British authorities and by the mainstream in the [[Yishuv]] Jewish establishment.&lt;ref name="Nachman Ben-Yehuda 1995. Pp. 322"&gt;Nachman Ben-Yehuda. ''The Masada Myth: Collective Memory and Mythmaking in Israel''. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1995. Pp. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Stern was born in [[Suwałki]], present-day [[Poland]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]). During the [[First World War]] his mother fled the Germans with him and his brother [[David Stern (Israeli politician)|David]]. They found refuge with her sister in Russia. When he was separated from his mother the 13-year-old Avraham earned his keep by carrying river water in [[Siberia]]. Eventually he stayed with an uncle in [[St. Petersburg]] before walking home to Poland. At the age of 18, in 1925, Stern emigrated on his own to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, ''Free Jerusalem: Heroes, Heroines and Rogues Who Created the State of Israel'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern studied at the [[Hebrew University]] on [[Mount Scopus]] in [[Jerusalem]]. He specialized in Classical languages and literature (Greek and Latin). His first political involvement was to found a student organization called “Hulda,” whose regulations stated it was dedicated “solely to the revival of the Hebrew nation in a new state.”&lt;ref name="Nechemia Ben-Tor p. 320"&gt;Nechemia Ben-Tor, ''The Lehi Lexicon'', p. 320 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1929 Palestine riots|1929 riots in Palestine]], Jewish communities came under attack by local Arabs, and Stern served with the [[Haganah]], doing guard duty on a synagogue rooftop in Jerusalem’s Old City.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, ''Free Jerusalem'', p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern’s commander and friend [[Avraham Tehomi]] quit the Haganah because it was under the authority of the local labor movement and union. Hoping to create an independent army, and also to take a more active and less defensive military position, Tehomi founded the [[Irgun|Irgun Zvai Leumi]] ("National Military Organization" known for short as the "Organization"). Stern joined the Irgun and completed an officer’s course in 1932.

During his life Stern wrote dozens of poems embodying a physical, almost sensual, love for the Jewish homeland and a similar attitude towards martyrdom on its behalf. One analyst referred to the poems as expressing the eroticism of death together with de-eroticism of women.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Hazani: Red carpet, white lilies: Love of death in the poetry of the Jewish underground leader Avraham Stern, ''Psychoanalytic Review'', vol. 89, 2002, pp 1-48&lt;/ref&gt; Stern’s poetry was heavily influenced by Russian and Polish poetry, especially [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]’s.&lt;ref&gt;Yaira Ginossar, ''Not for Us the Saxophone Sings'', pp. 73-78, 85 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; His song ''Unknown Soldiers'' was adopted first by the Irgun and later by the Lehi as an underground anthem.  In it Stern sang of Jews who would not be drafted by other countries while they wandered in Exile from their own country, but rather who would enlist in a volunteer army of their own, go underground and die fighting in the streets, only to be buried secretly at night. One of the commanders of Lehi, [[Israel Eldad]], claimed this song (along with two others, written by [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]] and [[Vladimir Jabotinsky]]) actually led to the creation of the underground.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, ''Free Jerusalem'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In other poems from the same period, up to eight years before he founded the Lehi underground, Stern detailed the feelings of revolutionaries hiding in basements or sitting in prison and wrote of dying in a hail of bullets. One example of his poetry is: “You are betrothed to me, my homeland \ According to all the laws of Moses and Israel… \ And with my death I will bury my head in your lap \ And you will live forever in my blood.”

Stern became one of the university’s top students. He was awarded a stipend to study for a doctorate in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. Avraham Tehomi made a special trip to Florence to recall him, in order to make him his deputy in the Irgun.&lt;ref name="Nechemia Ben-Tor p. 320" /&gt;

Stern spent the rest of the 1930s traveling back and forth to Eastern Europe to organize revolutionary cells in Poland and promote immigration of Jews to Palestine in defiance of British restrictions (this was therefore known as “illegal immigration”).

Stern developed a plan to train 40,000 young Jews to sail for Palestine and take over the country from the British colonial authorities. He succeeded in enlisting the Polish government in this effort. The Poles began training Irgun members and arms were set aside, but then Germany invaded Poland and began the [[Second World War]]. This ended the training, and immigration routes were cut off.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, ''Free Jerusalem'', pp. 153, 168&lt;/ref&gt; Stern was in Palestine at the time and was arrested the same night the war began. He was incarcerated together with the entire High Command of the Irgun in the Jerusalem Central Prison and Sarafand Detention Camp.

==Lehi==
[[File:Flag of the Lehi movement (blue on white).svg|thumb|right|Flag of the Lehi movement.]]
While under arrest, Stern and the other members of the Irgun argued about what to do during the war. He founded [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] in August 1940 initially under a different name, it adopted the name Lehi, a Hebrew acronym for Lohamei Herut Israel, meaning Fighters for the Freedom of Israel, in September 1940.&lt;ref name="Nachman Ben-Yehuda 1995. Pp. 322"/&gt; The movement was formed after Stern and others split from the Irgun, when the latter adopted the Haganah’s policy of supporting the British in their fight against the [[Nazis]].

Stern rejected collaboration with the [[British Empire|British]], and claimed that only a continuing struggle against them would lead eventually to an independent Jewish state and resolve the Jewish situation in the Diaspora. The British [[White Paper of 1939]] allowed only 75,000 Jews to [[Aliyah|immigrate]] to Palestine over five years, and no more after that unless local Arabs gave their permission.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bowyer Bell, ''Terror Out of Zion'', pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; But actually Stern’s opposition to British colonial rule in Palestine was not based on a particular policy; Stern defined the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] as “foreign rule” regardless of their policies and took a radical position against such imperialism even if it were to be benevolent.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Eldad, ''The First Tithe'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lehi Museum in Tel Aviv.JPG|thumb|223x223px|Lehi Museum in Tel Aviv. The room where Abraham Stern, Lehi commander, was shot by a British policeman on 12/2/1942.]]
Stern was unpopular with the official Jewish establishment leaders of the Haganah and Jewish Agency and also those of the Irgun. His movement drew an eclectic crew of individuals, from all ends of the political spectrum, including people who became prominent such as [[Yitzhak Shamir]], later an [[prime minister of Israel|Israeli prime minister]], who supported Jewish settlement throughout the land, and who opposed ceding territory to Arabs in negotiations; [[Natan Yellin-Mor]] who later became a leader of the peace movement in Israel advocating negotiations and accommodation with the Palestinians, and [[Israel Eldad]], who after the underground war ended spent nearly 15 years writing tracts and articles promoting extreme right wing, nationalist brand of Zionism.

Stern  began organizing his new underground army by focusing on four fronts: 1) publishing a newspaper and making clandestine radio broadcasts offering theoretical justifications for urban guerilla warfare; 2) obtaining funds for the underground, either by donations or by robbing British banks; 3) opening negotiations with foreign powers for the purpose of saving Europe’s Jews and developing allies in the struggle against the British in Palestine; 4) actual military-style operations against the British.

None of these projects went well for the new underground. Without money or a printing press the stenciled newspapers were few and hard to read. The bank robberies and operations against British policemen resulted in shootouts in the streets and both British and Jewish police were killed and injured. A British sting operation entrapped Stern into attempting to negotiate with the Italians and Germans, and this further tainted Lehi’s reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Nechemia Ben-Tor, ''The Lehi Lexicon'', p. 87 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1941, Stern attempted to make an agreement with the German Nazi authorities, offering to "actively take part in the war on Germany's side" in return for German support for Jewish immigration to Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish state. Another attempt to contact the Germans was made in late 1941, but there is no record of a German response in either case.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, J. (1995). The Stern Gang. Frank Cass.&lt;/ref&gt; These appeals to Germany were in direct opposition to the views of other Zionists, such as [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], who wanted Britain to defeat the Nazis even as they wanted to expel the British from Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/module/2011/12/6/main-feature/1/terror-out-of-zion [[Elliot Jager]], "Terror Out of Zion,"] [[Jewish Ideas Daily]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 5687 abraham stern(yair) grave.jpg|225px|right|thumb|Grave of Avraham Stern in the [[Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery]].]]
Wanted posters appeared all over the country with a price on Stern’s head. Stern wandered from safe house to safe house in Tel Aviv, carrying a collapsible cot in  a suitcase. When he ran out of hiding places he slept in apartment house stairwells. Eventually he moved into a Tel Aviv apartment rented by Moshe and Tova Svorai, who were members of Lehi. Moshe Svorai was caught by British detectives who raided another apartment, where two Lehi members were shot dead, and Svorai and one other wounded were hospitalized. Stern’s Lehi “contact”, Hisia Shapiro, thought she might have been followed one morning and stopped bringing messages. On 12 February 1942 she came with one last message, from the Haganah, offering to house Stern for the duration of the war if he would give up his fight against the British. Stern gave Shapiro a letter in reply declining the safe haven and suggesting cooperation between Lehi and the Haganah in fighting the British. A couple of hours later British detectives arrived to search the apartment and discovered Stern hiding there. It was the mother of one of the [[Lehi (group)|"Lehi"]] members who inadvertently led the police to Stern's hiding place in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="Barr2011p317"/&gt; Two neighbors were brought to attest to the propriety of the search. After they had left, Tova Svorai was also taken away so that Stern was alone with three armed policemen.  Then, in circumstances that remain disputed today, Stern was shot dead.&lt;ref name=Golan&gt;Zev Golan, ''Free Jerusalem'', pp. 231-234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, ''Stern: The Man and His Gang'', pp. 41-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Black&gt;I. Black, "The Stern Solution", ''The Guardian'', Feb 15, 1992, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "most secret" report made by the police to the British mandatory government said, "Stern was ...  just finishing lacing his shoes when he suddenly leapt for the window opposite. He was half way out of the window when he was shot by two of the three policemen in the room."&lt;ref name=Black/&gt; Assistant Superintendent [[Geoffrey J. Morton]], the most senior policeman present, later wrote in his memoirs that he had feared Stern was about to set off an explosive device as he had previously threatened to do if captured.&lt;ref name=Black/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Morton, Just The Job, Some Experiences of a Colonial Policeman, pp. 144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

The police version was dismissed by Stern's followers and many others, who believed that Stern had been shot in cold blood.&lt;ref name=Black/&gt; Morton successfully sued four publishers of books which claimed he murdered Stern, including the English publisher of ''[[The Revolt]]'',&lt;ref name=Black/&gt; which settled without consulting the author, [[Menachem Begin]], who wanted to go to court.&lt;ref&gt;Max Seligman, attorney for M. Begin, letter to Oswald Hickson, Collier and Co., Solicitors, March 25, 1953, file no. 923, in Jabotinsky Institute Archives, file 49/3/13&lt;/ref&gt; Lehi tried unsuccessfully to assassinate Morton at least three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Nachman Ben-Yehuda | title = Political Assassination by Jews | page = 174 | publisher = [[State University of New York Press]] | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-7914-1166-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binyamin Gepner, a former Lehi member who in 1980 interviewed another policeman Stewart who had been present at Stern's death, said that Stewart had effectively admitted Stern was murdered but later refused to repeat it.&lt;ref name=Black/&gt; The policeman whose gun was trained on Stern until Morton arrived, Bernard Stamp, said in a 1986 interview broadcast on [[Israel Radio]], that Morton's account was "hogwash." According to Stamp, Morton pulled Stern from the couch on which he was sitting, "sort of pushed him, spun him around, and Morton shot him." Stamp has been cited saying Stern was killed while unarmed with no chance of escape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zev Golan]], ''Stern: The Man and His Gang'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Tova Svorai recalled in a memoir:

"At about 9:30 there was a knock at the door, too gentle a tapping to signal the presence of the police. Yair…went into the closet, and only then did I open the door. At the door stood the 'good' detective Wilkins with two men behind him. Wilkins was always very polite, too polite perhaps. He asked me why I hadn't gone to visit my husband Moshe and if I weren't worried about him. I told him that if I had gone to the hospital I would have been arrested immediately. They searched my room…then they went downstairs and brought two neighbors, women, so they might have witnesses…they went over to the closet…one of the policemen opened it. Yair was nowhere to be seen. The policemen thrust his left hand into the closet and began searching, and when his hand came upon Yair he pulled him out. At the same time he put his right hand into his back pocket and took out his gun. I ran between him and Yair and said "Don't shoot! If you shoot, you shoot me"…. in my innocence I thought I had saved Yair's life…how wrong I was. They made him sit on the sofa…more detectives appeared, they had handcuffs and used them to bind Yair's hands behind his back….they told me to get dressed and go downstairs…I got into a small car…suddenly I heard three shots." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=סבוראי|first=משה וטובה|title=מאצ"ל ללח"י: סיפור אישי|year=1989|publisher=הוצאת המחברים|pages=363|language=Hebrew}} (Moshe and Tova Svorai, From Etzel to Lehi: A Personal Story, self-published, 1989, p363)&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, Yair, born a few months after Stern's killing, is a veteran broadcast journalist and TV news anchor who once headed Israel Television.

In 1981, the town of [[Kokhav Yair|Kochav Yair]] (Yair's Star) was founded and named after Stern's nickname.

'''Ayman Abd El Aziz Nour''' ({{lang-arz|أيمن عبد العزيز نور}}, {{IPA-arz|ˈʔæjmæn ʕæbdelˈʕaziːz ˈnuːɾ|IPA}}; born 5 December 1964) is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] politician, a former member of the Egyptian [[People's Assembly of Egypt|Parliament]], founder and chairman of the [[Tomorrow Party|El Ghad]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/nour-supports-brotherhood-morsy Nour supports Brotherhood Morsy] ''Egypt Independent'', 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He left Egypt following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecairopost.com/news/78414/politics/court-to-consider-withdrawing-ayman-nours-citizenship|title=Court to consider withdrawing Ayman Nour’s citizenship|date=23 January 2014|agency=Cairo Post|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he has stated he has gone to [[Lebanon]] for treatment of a wound he sustained while in prison and hopes to return to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.aswatmasriya.com/news/view.aspx?id=27ae6c65-d5f8-4c96-8709-533a41724923|title=Egyptian vote more one-sided than Mubarak's days - Ayman Nour|date=27 May 2014|agency=Aswat Masriya|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Candidacy and arrest==
Nour was the first man to ever compete against former [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] for the presidency of Egypt in 2005. He was the first runner-up in the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] with 7% of the vote according to government figures and estimated at 13% by independent observers, although no independent observers were allowed to monitor the elections. Shortly after placing a distant second, in what are widely believed to have been corrupt elections, he was imprisoned by Mubarak under allegations of "forgery" which have been widely criticized to have been politically motivated and corrupt charges. Nour was released on "health grounds" on 18 February 2009 only a few months before he would have completed his prison sentence.&lt;ref name="Egypt's Nour released from jail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7897703.stm|title=Egypt's Nour released from jail|date=18 February 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219182544/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7897703.stm| archivedate=19 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the fall of Mubarak in the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|2011 Revolution]], Nour intended to run for the now-vacant presidency, but was disqualified by the Presidential Election Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Egyptian candidates barred from elections|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-17717268|website=www.bbc.com|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nour was stripped of his [[parliamentary immunity]] and arrested on 29 January 2005. He was charged with forging PAs (Powers of Attorney) to secure the formation of the el-Ghad party. Nour vehemently denied the charges (from prison).

The arrest, occurring in an election year, was widely criticized by governments around the world as a step backwards for Egyptian democracy. Few seem to regard the charges as legitimate. Nour remained active despite his imprisonment, using the opportunity to write critical articles and make his case and cause better known.

In February 2005, [[Condoleezza Rice]] abruptly postponed a visit to Egypt, reflecting U.S. displeasure at the jailing of Nour, who was reported to have been brutally interrogated.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Glen [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54613-2005Feb25.html Rice Drops Plans for Visit to Egypt] ''The Washington Post'' 26 February 2005; Retrieved 15 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, the government announced the following month that it would open elections to multiple candidates.

In March 2005, following a strong intervention in Cairo by a group of Members of the European Parliament led by Vice-President Edward McMillan-Scott (UK, Conservative), Nour was freed and began a campaign for the Egyptian presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Daniel [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29477-2005Mar12.html Egypt Frees An Aspiring Candidate Presidential Hopeful Is Released on Bail] ''The Washington Post'' 13 March 2005; Retrieved 20 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December 2005 he was sentenced to five years in jail. Though [[diabetes|diabetic]], Nour engaged in a two-weeks long hunger strike to protest his trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/egypt/egypt-051224-voa01.htm Former Egyptian Presidential Candidate Sentenced to 5 Years Hard Labor] Voice of America, 24 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Nour's verdict and sentencing made global headlines and were the first item of news on most international news broadcasts, including the [[BBC]].

On the day of Nour's guilty verdict and sentencing, the [[White House Press Secretary]] released the following statement denouncing the government's action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on Conviction of Egyptian Politician Ayman Nour|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051224-1.html|date=24 December 2005|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives]]|accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The United States is deeply troubled by the conviction today of Egyptian politician Ayman Nour by an Egyptian court. The conviction of Mr. Nour, the runner-up in Egypt's 2005 presidential elections, calls into question Egypt's commitment to democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. We are also disturbed by reports that Mr. Nour's health has seriously declined due to the hunger strike on which he has embarked in protest of the conditions of his trial and detention.
The United States calls upon the Egyptian government to act under the laws of Egypt in the spirit of its professed desire for increased political openness and dialogue within Egyptian society, and out of humanitarian concern, to release Mr. Nour from detention.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2006, Rice visited Mubarak yet never spoke Nour's name publicly. When asked about him at a news conference, she referred to his situation as one of Egypt's setbacks. Days later, Mubarak told a government newspaper that Rice "didn't bring up difficult issues or ask to change anything." From prison, Nour stated "I pay the price when [Rice] speaks [of me], and I pay the price when she doesn't," Nour said. "But what's happening to me now is a message to everybody."&lt;ref&gt;Spolar, Christine: Egypt reformer feels iron hand of the law] Chicago Tribune (IL); 3 June 2006, Retrieved 20 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007 President Bush, speaking at a conference of dissidents in the Czech Republic, revisited the issue of Ayman Nour, saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Bush Visits Prague, Czech Republic, Discusses Freedom|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/06/20070605-8.html |date=5 June 2007|publisher=U.S. National Archives |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There are many dissidents who couldn't join us because they are being unjustly imprisoned or held under house arrest. I look forward to the day when a conference like this one include Alexander Kozulin of Belarus, Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, Oscar Elias Biscet of Cuba, Father Nguyen Van Ly of Vietnam, Ayman Nour of Egypt. (Applause.) The daughter of one of these political prisoners is in this room. I would like to say to her, and all the families: I thank you for your courage. I pray for your comfort and strength. And I call for the immediate and unconditional release of your loved ones.
...
I have asked Secretary Rice to send a directive to every U.S. ambassador in an un-free nation: Seek out and meet with activists for democracy. Seek out those who demand human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nour was released on health grounds on 18 February 2009.&lt;ref name="Egypt's Nour released from jail"/&gt; It has been alleged that his release from prison was due to U.S. President Obama demanding his release as a condition to meet with Mubarak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1880767,00.html|title=Egypt Frees a Dissident: A Gesture for Obama?|work=[[Time Magazine|TIME]] |first=Scott|last=Macleod|date=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama campaign was highly effective in getting out the vote, in using technology to identify voters, and in capitalizing on growing segments of the voting population.

"President Obama won reelection, not by going after independent voters, but by going after emerging groups in the U.S. population. By race, age and gender, voters made clear that America is made up of many parts, and the Obama team captured more of them, and delivered more of them to the polls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama Capitalizes On Emerging Voter Groups|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/07/164582496/obama-capitalizes-on-emerging-voter-groups|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=November 18, 2012 |author=Renee Montqgne|author2=Cokie Roberts|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Beatus of Liébana''' (c. 730 – c. 800) was a [[monk]], [[theologian]] and [[geographer]] from the former [[Duchy of Cantabria]] and [[Kingdom of Asturias]], in modern [[Cantabria]], northern [[Spain]], who worked and lived in the [[Picos de Europa]] mountains of the region of [[Liébana]]. He is best remembered today as the author of the ''[[Commentary on the Apocalypse]]''.

==Biography==
Beatus was likely born and raised in Liébana, possibly from a poor family. As confessor to Queen [[Adosinda]], wife of [[Silo of Asturias]], and as teacher of [[Alcuin|Alcuin of York]] and Etherius of [[Osma]], Beatus exercised wide influence.&lt;ref name=citd&gt;[http://www.christdesert.org/cgi-bin/martyrology.dynamic.5.cgi?name=beatus_of_liebana "St. Beatus of Liébana", Christ in the Desert Monastery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303191623/http://www.christdesert.org/cgi-bin/martyrology.dynamic.5.cgi?name=beatus_of_liebana |date=2014-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best remembered today as the author of the ''Commentary on the Apocalypse'', written in 776, then revised in 784 and again in 786. The ''Commentary'' was popular during the [[Middle Ages]] and survives in at least 34 manuscripts (usually called a ''beatus'') from the 10th through the 16th centuries. Not all of the manuscripts are complete, and some exist only in fragmentary form. Twenty-six of these manuscripts are lavishly decorated in the [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]], [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]], or [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style of [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]].

Beatus was a strong opponent of the [[Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] [[Christology]] put forward by [[Elipando|Elipandus]], Bishop of Toledo and founder of the [[Adoptivi]], and Bishop [[Felix (Bishop of Urgell)|Felix of Urgell]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Elipandus and Felix declared that Jesus, in respect to his human nature, was the adopted son of God by God's grace, thus emphasizing the distinction between the divinity and the humanity of Christ. Beatus and other opponents of adoptionism, such as Alcuin and [[Paulinus II of Aquileia]], feared that this view would so divide the person of the Savior that the reality of the incarnation would be lost. In addition, many theologians were concerned that this adoptionism was a new version of the [[Nestorianism]] advanced by [[Nestorius]]. This debate largely died with the deaths of the proponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=González|first1=Justo L.|title=A History of Christian Thought Volume II: From Augustine to the Eve of the Reformation|date=2010|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=9781426721915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEXOzNeSgWoC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109|page=109-111|accessdate=7 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author and theologian==
{{main article|Commentary on the Apocalypse|Beatus map}}

The ''Commentary on the Apocalypse'' is a work of erudition but without great originality, made up principally of compilations. Beatus includes long extracts from the texts of the Fathers of the Church and Doctors of the Church, especially [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Ambrose]], [[Ticonius]], [[Irenaeus]], and [[Isidore of Seville]]. He adds to this the commentary on the [[Book of Daniel]] by [[Jerome]].

The Beatus text was regarded as a symbol of Christian resistance to the [[Muslim]]s who dominated much of the Iberian Peninsula (see [[al-Andalus]]) in the early Middle Ages.

[[File:Coinage with Byzas 2nd 3rd century CE.jpg|thumb|Coinage with idealized depiction of Byzas, the founder of [[Byzantium]], [[Thrace]], around the time of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161–180).]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Byzas''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: Βύζας, ''Býzas'') was the eponymous founder of [[Byzantium]] (Ancient Greek: Βυζάντιον, ''Byzántion''), the city later known as [[Constantinople]] and then [[Istanbul]].

==Founder of Byzantium==
Byzantion was an ancient Greek colony, on the ruins of which the city of Constantinople was built.
The founder of Byzantion, Byzas, was son of King Nisos of Megara.

According to Greek mythology, Byzas was son of Poseidon and his mother, Keroessa, was the daughter of Io and Zeus.

During the 7th century BC, the Greek city-states were expanding and establishing new colonies. The Dorian city-state of Megara, near Athens, was also searching for sites to set up yet another colony. After asking the oracle of Delphi, the Megarean king Nisos sent his son Byzas in search of "the land opposite the city of the blind".

When Byzas arrived to where the Sea of Marmaras meets the Sea of Bosporos, on the border of Europe and Asia, he realized the meaning of the oracle. On the Asian shore, opposite to where he was, a colony, Chalcedon, had already been established. Byzas decided that Chalcedon was the prophesied 'city of the blind', as it had not taken advantage of the European shore.

To build his new city, in 667 BC Byzas chose wisely. He selected the European shore of the south end of Bosporos and gave the new city his name, Byzantion.
Later, Byzas married Fidalea, daughter of king Varvizos (or Varvisios) of Thrace. The inhabitants of ancient Byzantion considered Byzas as their founder and, according to ancient sources, honoured him by raising a statue of Byzas and his wife, Fidalea, in a noticeable place in the city.

The ancients had a very good understanding of the advantages that Byzantion had over Chalcedon, as the colony of Byzantion commanded the entrance to two seas, the entrance to both the Black Sea, through Sea of Bosporos, and the Aegean Sea, through the Sea of Marmaras (Propondis was is its ancient name).

Apart from the story of the Pythian oracle of Apollonian Delphi, as described by the Greek geographer and historian [[Strabo]] (63 BC - 23 AD) and by the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (1st century AD), there are other versions of the maxim referring to the "blind people". The Greek historian [[Herodotos]] (5th century BC) wrote that when the Persian general [[Megabazos]] arrived at Byzantium, he called the people of Chalcedon blind because although they had a choice of sites, they chose the worse one.

'''Denise Ann Darvall''' (27 February 1942{{spaced ndash}}3 December 1967)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancestry24.com/?group=on&amp;s=search&amp;ref=recent&amp;srchName=&amp;srchSurname=darvall ancestry42] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130117004633/http://ancestry24.com/?group=on&amp;s=search&amp;ref=recent&amp;srchName=&amp;srchSurname=darvall |date=17 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[organ donation|donor]] in the world’s first successful human [[heart transplant]], performed at [[Groote Schuur Hospital]], [[South Africa]], by a team of surgeons led by [[Christiaan Barnard]].
== Injuries ==
Darvall was seriously injured in a [[car accident]] on Main Road in [[Observatory, Cape Town|Observatory]], [[Cape Town]]. She and her family were visiting friends for afternoon tea and went shopping for cake. She and her mother were run over by a driver who failed to see them, due to a large truck that obscured his vision of them, and their vision of his car. Her mother died immediately. Darvall sustained a [[skull fracture]] and severe head injuries, after the car flung her  across the road and her head hit the wheel cap of her own car. She could not stay alive without [[life support]], and was essentially [[brain death|brain dead]]. At 9 p.m. on the day of the accident, the resuscitation team stopped trying to revive her.

== Father gives permission ==
Edward Darvall arranged for his fourteen-year son, who had witnessed the accident, to be taken away from the hospital. The 66-year-old Edward was also given a sedative, and he waited while doctors attempted to save his daughter.  Two doctors, Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman, informed him that there was nothing further they could do for Denise. Bosman explained that there was a man in the hospital they might be able to help, and asked Edward if he would consider allowing them to transplant Denise's heart.&lt;ref name="Every Second Counts, Bosman and Venter ask Edward Darvall for permission, page 189"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBYTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=%22Bosman+and+Venter+withdrew,+stressing+that+he+should+take+as+long+as+he+needed+to+consider+their+request.+They+would+understand+if+he+declined+to+give+his+consent.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6j-6f3srVAhVGx1QKHb4qBbYQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bosman%20and%20Venter%20withdrew%2C%20stressing%20that%20he%20should%20take%20as%20long%20as%20he%20needed%20to%20consider%20their%20request.%20They%20would%20understand%20if%20he%20declined%20to%20give%20his%20consent.%22&amp;f=false ''Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart''], Donald McRae, New York: Putnam, 2006, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt;


Edward Darwal later said that he only thought about his daughter for four minutes, he took him to reach his decision, and gave his permission.&lt;ref name="Every Second Counts, Bosman and Venter ask Edward Darvall for permission, page 189" /&gt;

The public record shows that Edward Darvall mostly shunned publicity. He had undergone major stomach surgery, but his strength of character and dignity earned him many admirers. Before the joint funeral of his wife and daughter, he asked for donations to be sent to the Groote Schuur cardiac unit.

Darvall was present at the trial of the drunk driver who was convicted guilty of murder. Darvall, heartbroken, made a statement through a lawyer, asking the magistrate to show the “greatest possible mercy” to the driver. "The tragic death of his daughter was not meaningless, but benefited humanity," he said..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://transplantaciya.com/peresadka-serdca/|title=Heart transplant|last=|first=|date=|website=transplantaciya.com|language=ru-RU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declaration of death ==
Surgeons had a serious ethical problem because death then could only be declared by whole-body standards. The [[brain death|Harvard Criteria of Brain Death]] was not developed until 1968, nor was it adopted in South Africa or elsewhere for some years. The problem in this case was that, although Denise's brain was damaged, her heart was healthy. Various reports over the years attributed conflicting reasons for her heart stopping. For forty years, Barnard's brother Marius kept a secret: that rather than wait for her heart to stop beating, at Marius’s urging, Christiaan had injected [[potassium]] into Denise’s heart to paralyze it and thus, to render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.&lt;ref&gt;''Every Second Counts'', McRae, page 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organ donation ==
After her father gave his consent, Darvall's [[heart]] was donated to [[Louis Washkansky]]. Her [[kidney]]s were given to 10-year-old Jonathan van Wyk. Due to [[apartheid]], the kidney donation to Van Wyk was controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malan|first1=M|title=Darvall, Denise|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/denise-darvall|website=sahistory.org|publisher=South Africa History|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he was [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|black]], while Denise was [[White South African|white]]. Washkansky would only live for another 18 days, succumbing to pneumonia.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on 25 March 1947, in [[Pinner]], [[Middlesex]], the eldest child of Stanley Dwight (1925–1991) and only child of Sheila Eileen ([[née]] Harris; 1925–2017),&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435132/Family-detective-Elton-John.html |title=Family Detective: Elton John |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=22 November 2006 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |last=Barratt |first=Nick |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Elton John 'in shock' after his mother dies aged 92 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42220913 |accessdate=12 November 2018 |work=BBC News | date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Elton John's father didn't approve of his career path |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11542512 |accessdate=12 November 2018 |work=NZ Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised in a [[council house]] by his maternal grandparents, in Pinner. His parents married in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Marriages: MAR 1945 3a 1257 Dwight Stanley = Harris Sheila E&lt;/ref&gt; when the family moved to a nearby semi-detached house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/Elton_John_Birthplace |title=55 Pinner Hill Road |publisher=On This Very Spot |date=25 March 1947 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barratt |first=Nick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/exclusions/familyhistory/fheltonjohn.xml |title=Family detective: Elton John |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 November 2006 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/111_Potter_Street |title=111 Potter Street |publisher=On This Very Spot |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Pinner Wood Junior School, Reddiford School and [[Pinner County Grammar School]], until the age of 17, when he left just prior to his [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Level]] examinations to pursue a career in the music industry.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Norman |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Norman (author) |date=1991 |title=Elton John |publisher=Fireside |isbn=0671797298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;Elizabeth Rosenthal, ''His Song: The Musical Journey of Elton John'', Billboard Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VisualDoc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Elton John: The Visual Documentary |first=Nigel |last=Goodall |year=1993 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |isbn=0-7119-3078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he began to consider a career in music seriously, Elton John's father, who served as a [[flight lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Air Force]], tried to steer him toward a more conventional career, such as banking.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt; John has stated that his wild stage costumes and performances were his way of letting go after such a restrictive childhood.&lt;ref name="VisualDoc" /&gt; Both of John's parents were musically inclined, his father having been a trumpet player with the Bob Millar Band, a semi-professional big band that played at military dances.&lt;ref name="VisualDoc"/&gt; The Dwights were keen record buyers, exposing John to the popular singers and musicians of the day, and John remembers being immediately hooked on rock and roll when his mother brought home records by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;

Elton John started playing his grandmother's piano as a young boy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/668291963/watch-elton-john-get-worse-at-the-piano-in-time-traveling-christmas-ad|title=Tear-Jerker British Ad Re-Creates Elton John's Christmas Past|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within a year, his mother heard him picking out [[Winifred Atwell]]'s "The Skater's Waltz" by ear.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; After performing at parties and family gatherings, at the age of 7 he took up formal piano lessons. He showed musical aptitude at school, including the ability to compose melodies, and gained some notoriety by playing like [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] at school functions.  At the age of 11, he won a junior scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. According to one of his instructors, John promptly played back, like a "gramophone record", a four-page piece by [[George Frideric Handel]] that he heard for the first time.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;
[[File:Royal Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|right|Elton studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London for five years.]]
For the next five years, he attended Saturday classes at the Academy in central London, and has stated that he enjoyed playing [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and singing in the choir during Saturday classes, but that he was not otherwise a diligent classical student.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;  "I kind of resented going to the Academy", he says.  "I was one of those children who could just about get away without practising and still pass, scrape through the grades."&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; He has claimed that he would sometimes skip classes and ride around on the [[London Underground]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; Several instructors have testified that he was a "model student", and during the last few years, he was taking lessons from a private tutor in addition to his classes at the Academy.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;

Elton John's mother, though also strict with her son, was more vivacious than her husband, and something of a free spirit.  With Stanley Dwight uninterested in his son and often physically absent, John was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandmother.  When his father was home, the Dwights would have terrible arguments that greatly distressed their son.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; When John was 14, they divorced. His mother then married a local painter, Fred Farebrother, a caring and supportive stepfather whom John affectionately referred to as "Derf", his first name in reverse.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; They moved into flat No.&amp;nbsp;1A in an eight-unit apartment building called Frome Court, not far from both previous homes.  It was there that John wrote the songs that launched his career as a rock star; he lived there until he had four albums simultaneously in the American Top 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/EJ_Frome_Court |title=Frome Court |publisher=On This Very Spot |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 15, with the help of his mother and stepfather, Reginald Dwight became a weekend pianist at a nearby pub, the Northwood Hills Hotel, playing Thursday to Sunday nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qOECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 |title=Music |work=Atlanta Magazine |page=76 |accessdate=15 January 2016 |date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/find/spot.php?spot_web_name=Northwood_Hills_Pub |title=Northwood Hills Pub – On This Very Spot |publisher=onthisveryspot.com |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known simply as "Reggie", he played a range of popular standards, including songs by [[Jim Reeves]] and [[Ray Charles]], as well as songs he had written himself.&lt;ref name="Costello interview"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Elton John |url=http://www.sundancechannel.com/films/500328605 |series=Spectacle |serieslink=Spectacle: Elvis Costello with... |airdate=2008 |season=1 |number=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428144534/http://www.sundancechannel.com/films/500328605 |archivedate=28 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bernardin|Stanton|1996|p=70}} A stint with a short-lived group called the Corvettes rounded out his time.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal" /&gt;

In 1962, Dwight and his friends formed a band called [[Bluesology]]. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&amp;B]] musicians like [[the Isley Brothers]], [[Major Lance]] and [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles]]. In 1966, the band became musician [[Long John Baldry]]'s supporting band, and played 16 times at the [[Marquee Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/long-john-baldry |title=The Marquee Club: Long John Baldry – Biography |publisher=themarqueeclub.net |accessdate=25 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704172041/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/long-john-baldry |archivedate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the two first met in 1967, they recorded what would become the first Elton John/Bernie Taupin song: "Scarecrow". Six months later Dwight was going by the name "Elton John" in homage to two members of Bluesology: saxophonist [[Elton Dean]] and vocalist [[Long John Baldry]].&lt;ref name="Costello interview"/&gt; His name was legally changed to Elton Hercules John on 7 January 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/45571/page/403/data.pdf “Change of Name”].

Their early output included a contender for the UK entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969]], for Lulu, called "I Can't Go On (Living Without You)". It came [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969|sixth]] of six songs.

[[File:Elton John on stage.jpg|thumb|left|Elton John on stage in 1971]]
On the advice of music publisher Steve Brown, John and Taupin started writing more complex songs for John to record for DJM. The first was the single "[[I've Been Loving You]]" (1968), produced by [[Caleb Quaye]], Bluesology's former guitarist. In 1969, with Quaye, drummer Roger Pope, and bassist Tony Murray, John recorded another single, "[[Lady Samantha]]", and an album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''. For their follow-up album, ''[[Elton John (album)|Elton John]]'', John and Taupin enlisted [[Gus Dudgeon]] as producer and [[Paul Buckmaster]] as musical arranger. ''Elton John'' was released in April 1970 on DJM Records/[[Pye Records]] in the UK and [[Uni Records]] in the US, and established the formula for subsequent albums – gospel-chorded rockers and poignant ballads. The album's first single, "[[Border Song]]", peaked at 92 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second single, "[[Your Song]]", reached number seven in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number eight in the US, becoming John's first hit single as a singer.&lt;ref name="Charts"&gt;[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John "Elton John: UK Chart History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214060116/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John |date=14 February 2015 }}.

[[File:Elton John.jpg|thumb|left|Elton John on the piano during a live performance in 1975]]
John formed his own label named [[The Rocket Record Company]] (distributed in the US by MCA and initially by Island in the UK) and signed acts to it – notably [[Neil Sedaka]] (John sang background vocals on Sedaka's "[[Bad Blood (Neil Sedaka song)|Bad Blood]]") and [[Kiki Dee]], in whom he took a personal interest. Instead of releasing his own records on Rocket, he opted for a $8 million contract offered by [[MCA Records|MCA]]. When the contract was signed in 1974, MCA reportedly took out a $25 million insurance policy on John's life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/elton-john/news/artists/8828/56076/56108 Elton John | Rolling Stone Music] {{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} 2001 encyclopedia.

In 1974, John collaborated with [[John Lennon]] on his cover of [[the Beatles]]' "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]", the B-side of which was Lennon's "One Day at a Time." In return, John was featured on "[[Whatever Gets You thru the Night]]" on Lennon's ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' album. Later that year, in what would be Lennon's last major live performance, the pair performed these two number&amp;nbsp;1 hits, along with the Beatles' "[[I Saw Her Standing There]]", at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. Lennon made the rare stage appearance with John and his band to keep the promise he had made that he would appear on stage with him if "Whatever Gets You Thru The Night" became a U.S. number one single.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Woolf, Scott Jennings and James L.

[[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] asked John to play a character called the "Local Lad" in the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film adaptation]] of the [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'', and to perform the song "[[Pinball Wizard]]".

"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]" was the hit single from this album and captured an early turning point in John's life. The album's release signalled the end of the Elton John Band, as an unhappy and overworked John dismissed Olsson and Murray, two people who had contributed much of the band's signature sound and who had helped build his live following since the beginning.&lt;ref name="Hombach"/&gt;

==Musicianship==
[[File:Elton John Bernie Taupin 1971.JPG|thumb|right|Elton John with Bernie Taupin (left) in 1971. They have collaborated on more than thirty albums to date.]]

Elton John has written with his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin since 1967, when he answered an advertisement for talent placed in the popular U.K. music publication, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', by [[Liberty records]] [[A&amp;R]] man [[Ray Williams (producer)|Ray Williams]].&lt;ref name="bilb"/&gt; The pair have collaborated on more than thirty albums to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C181 |title=Songwriters Hall of Fame – Bernie Taupin Biography |publisher=songwritershalloffame.org |accessdate=26 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618183615/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C181 |archive-date=18 June 2010 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The writing style that Elton John and Bernie Taupin use involves Taupin writing the lyrics on his own, and John then putting them to music, with the two never in the same room during the process. Taupin would write a set of lyrics, then post them to John, wherever he was in the world, who would then lay down the music, arrange it, and record.&lt;ref&gt;Syd Field

Random House, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about their 50-year partnership in November 2017, John stated, "we've never ever had an argument professionally or personally which is extraordinary because most songwriters sometimes split up because they get jealous of each other and it's exciting because it's never changed from the first day we wrote songs. I still write the song when he's not there and then I go and play it to him. So the excitement is still the same as it was from day one and that's kept it fresh and it's kept it exciting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elton John celebrates 50 years of hits with songwriting partner Bernie Taupin |url=https://www.abc.net.au/7.30/elton-john-celebrates-50-years-of-hits-with/9150850 |accessdate=26 October 2018 |agency=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Sexuality and family===

In the late 1960s, Elton John was engaged to be married to his first lover, secretary Linda Woodrow, who is mentioned in the song "[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]".&lt;ref name=RS76&gt;{{cite web |first=Cliff |last=Jahr |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/davidbowie/articles/story/8718858/elton_john_its_lonely_at_the_top |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QZv8N38L?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/davidbowie/articles/story/8718858/elton_john_its_lonely_at_the_top |archivedate=24 July 2007 |title=Elton John: It's Lonely at the Top |work=Rolling Stone |date=7 October 1976 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul Myers |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l118517OoewC&amp;pg=PA133 |title=''It Ain't Easy: Long John Baldry and the Birth of the British Blues'', page 133 |publisher=Greystone Books, 2007, |accessdate=2 February 2010 |isbn=978-1-55365-200-7 |date=6 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He married German recording engineer Renate Blauel on 14 February 1984, in [[Darling Point, New South Wales|Darling Point]], Sydney, with speculation that the marriage was a [[beard (companion)|cover]] for his [[homosexuality]]. John came out as [[bisexuality|bisexual]] in a 1976 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',&lt;ref name=RS76/&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt; but after his divorce from Blauel in 1988, he told the magazine he was "comfortable" being gay.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Rhiel, David Bruce Suchoff, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1o8YQZQhqGoC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=''The seductions of biography'' |page=23 |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |isbn=978-0-415-91090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, he began a relationship with [[David Furnish]], a former advertising executive and now filmmaker originally from [[Toronto]], Canada. On 21 December 2005 (the day the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004|Civil Partnership Act]] came into force), John and Furnish were amongst the first couples to form a [[civil partnership in the United Kingdom]], which was held at the [[Windsor Guildhall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Independent |date=8 October 2012 |first=Elton |last=John |title=The historic fight for equality must go on.

Fireside, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, John was criticised by some Christian groups in the U.S. after describing [[Sexuality of Jesus|Jesus]] as a "compassionate, super-intelligent gay man who understood human problems". [[Bill Donohue]], president of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]] and opponent of gay marriage, responded: "To call Jesus a homosexual is to label him a sexual deviant. But what else would we expect from a man who previously said, 'From my point of view, I would ban religion completely.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/19/elton-john-jesus-gay |title=Sir Elton John claims Jesus was gay |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2015 |first=Adam |last=Gabbatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, John stated he preferred civil partnerships over marriage for gay people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.frontiersmedia.com/frontiers-blog/2014/12/22/sir-elton-john-david-furnish-get-married-sharethelove/ |title=Sir Elton John and David Furnish Get Married, #ShareTheLove |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=8 March 2015 |first=Karen |last=Ocamb |work=Frontiers Media |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402163706/http://www.frontiersmedia.com/frontiers-blog/2014/12/22/sir-elton-john-david-furnish-get-married-sharethelove/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2012, John had changed his position and become a staunch supporter of [[same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom]]. He was quoted as saying: "There is a world of difference between calling someone your 'partner' and calling them your 'husband'. 'Partner' is a word that should be preserved for people you play tennis with, or work alongside in business. It doesn't come close to describing the love that I have for David, and he for me.

In 2013, Elton John resisted calls to boycott Russia in protest at the [[Russian gay propaganda law]], but told fans at a Moscow concert that the Russian laws were "inhumane and isolating" and he was "deeply saddened and shocked over the current legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/09/elton-john-moscow-russia-gay-rights?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=Elton John voices gay rights concerns at Moscow concert |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Sean |last=Michaels |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2014 interview, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] spoke of John in an attempt to show that there was no gay discrimination in Russia, stating; "Elton John – he's an extraordinary person, a distinguished musician, and millions of our people sincerely love him, regardless of his sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="Russia"/&gt; John responded by offering to introduce the president to Russians abused under Russian legislation banning "homosexual propaganda".&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/elton-john-vladimir-putin-russian-gay-legislation "Elton John to Putin: I will show you gay people victimised under Russian law"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807045908/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/elton-john-vladimir-putin-russian-gay-legislation |date=7 August 2016 }}.

John has said that he took risks with unprotected sex during the 1980s and considers himself lucky to have avoided catching AIDS during the AIDS epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/elton-john-science-can-stop-aids-but-to-end-the-plague-we-need-love-7966167.html |title=Elton John: Science can stop Aids but to end the plague we need love |work=The Independent |first=Elton |last=John |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2015 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, he joined with [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] to record the single "[[That's What Friends Are For]]", with all profits being donated to the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]].

Elton John became more closely associated with AIDS charities following the deaths of his friends Ryan White in 1990 and Freddie Mercury in 1991, raising large amounts of money and using his public profile to raise awareness of the disease. He founded the [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]] in 1992 as a charity to fund programmes for HIV/AIDS prevention, for the elimination of prejudice and discrimination against HIV/AIDS-affected individuals, and for providing services to people living with or at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. This cause continues to be one of his personal passions. In 1993, he began hosting his annual [[Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party|Academy Award Party]], which has become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry, and has raised over {{US$|200&amp;nbsp;million|link=yes}}.&lt;ref name="Foundation"/&gt;

[[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] '''Eric Edward ("Chink") Dorman-Smith''' (24 July 1895 – 11 May 1969), who later changed his name to '''Eric Edward Dorman O'Gowan''', was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] whose career in the [[British Army]] began in the [[World War I|First World War]] and closed at the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. In the 1950s, Dorman-Smith became an officer in the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA). In the 1920s, during the [[interwar period]], he was one of the military thinkers in various countries, like [[Heinz Guderian]] in Germany and [[Charles de Gaulle]] in France, who realised that technology and motorisation were changing the way that wars and battles were fought. Influenced by [[J. F. C. Fuller]], [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], [[B. H. Liddell Hart]], and many others, Dorman-Smith tried to change the culture of the British Army and held a number of teaching and training roles in various parts of the [[British Empire]]. Although he made several contributions in advisory roles during the [[Western Desert Campaign|campaigns in the Western Desert]] from 1940 to 1941, it was not until May 1942 that he went on active service again. His service in the Second World War is shrouded in controversy and ended when he was fired from his command in August 1944.

==Early life==
Dorman-Smith was born to a mixed-religion couple in Bellamont Forest, [[Cootehill]], [[County Cavan]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=ABC-CLIO&gt;[http://www.historyandtheheadlines.abc-clio.com/ContentPages/ContentPage.aspx?entryId=1145270&amp;currentSection=1130224&amp;productid=3 Dorman-Smith, Eric "Chink" (1895–1969)] History and the Headlines. Abc-clio.com; retrieved 23 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was received into the Catholic Church four days after his birth as a result of his Catholic mother's pleading. {{Clarify|date=September 2013}} His younger brothers, Victor and Reggie, were baptised [[Protestant]] (though all three boys are listed as Catholic in the 1901 Census).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1901/Cavan/Cootehill/Bellmont_Forest/1045485/&lt;/ref&gt; His best friend as a child in Cootehill was [[John Charles McQuaid]], the local doctor's son, who was later appointed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin|Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]].&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 10"&gt;Greacen p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 12, he was sent to St Anthony's, a Catholic school in Eastbourne, Sussex. His Cavan accent and buck teeth made him stand out and, in the effort to modify his accent, he developed a [[stutter]].&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 15"&gt;Greacen p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; While there, his parents moved to [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]] in England and, after a year, he was moved to [[Lambrook]], which was a school attended by his younger brothers, whereupon his stutter vanished. In 1910, he went to [[Uppingham School]], [[Rutland]], where he befriended [[Brian Horrocks]], a future general.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 17"&gt;Greacen p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; During his school days he showed that he had strong principles, in particular there were episodes of casual [[antisemitism|anti-semitism]] towards friends of his which he reportedly took steps to address.&lt;ref name="Greacen p.20 and 26"&gt;Greacen pp. 20, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorman-Smith's father insisted he take the entrance exam for the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in December 1912 and he scored 6969/12600, being placed 69th in the order of merit, thus obtaining one of the 172 available places.&lt;ref name="Greacen p.21"&gt;Greacen p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks also succeeded, ranked 171. After two terms, he passed out in exemplary fashion, leaving Horrocks to complete a third term, achieving 515/600 in military history and 2031/2800 in general military subjects. His overall score was 7976/10,500, placing him 10th.&lt;ref name="Greacen p.27"&gt;Greacen p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the 1st Battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers (later the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]]) on 25 February 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28806|page=1551|date=24 February 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; just six months before the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name=ABC-CLIO/&gt; Dorman-Smith gained his nickname "Chink" on his first night in the officers' mess when his fellow [[subaltern]], Richard Vachell, noted his resemblance to the [[Chinkara]] antelope mascot that the regiment had had to leave behind when they moved back to England from [[British Raj|India]].&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 28"&gt;Greacen p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
"Chink", along with the rest of his battalion, then serving as part of the [[9th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Brigade]] of the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]], were sent to France on 13 August 1914, nine days after Britain entered the First World War, and were some of the first troops of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to arrive. The battalion, and Dorman-Smith himself, were involved in the [[Battle of Mons]], where he was wounded in the [[Great Retreat|retreat]].&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 36"&gt;Greacen p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he was involved in the battles of [[Battle of Messines (1914)|Messines]], [[Battle of Armentières|Armentières]] and [[First Battle of Ypres|Ypres]] and, after being promoted on 15 November to the [[Acting (rank)|temporary rank]] of [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29001|page=10555|date=8 December 1914|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; received another wound on 9 December.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 37"&gt;Greacen p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to substantive lieutenant on 2 January 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29111|page=2945|date=23 March 1915|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1915 the battalion was involved in fighting at Railway Wood, near Ypres, during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. Although he had received a shrapnel wound and four lesser injuries from rifle bullets, he organised, under heavy fire, a withdrawal of the survivors of his battalion, for which he was awarded one of the first batch of the [[Military Cross]] (MC).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29438|page=582|date=11 January 1916|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 44"&gt;Greacen p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to temporary [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 26 June 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29245|page=7443|date=27 July 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was [[mentioned in dispatches]] on 1 January 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29422|page=46|date=31 December 1915|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his rank of captain was made permanent on 26 August 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29881|page=12635|date=26 December 1916|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a difficult period of convalescence, he was sent to teach [[trench warfare]] to new recruits and in January 1917 he was posted to the Northern School of Instruction.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 49"&gt;Greacen p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to active service in July 1917 and he was temporarily promoted to the acting rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] on 16 October and was made [[second-in-command]] (2IC) of the 10th (Service) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30618|page=4289|date=5 April 1918|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Kitchener's Army]] battalion, then serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as part of the [[68th Brigade (United Kingdom)|68th Brigade]] of the [[23rd Division (United Kingdom)|23rd Division]].&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt;

In November 1917, Dorman-Smith was posted as a captain to the Italian Piave Front&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 50"&gt;Greacen p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; on attachment to the 68th Brigade School, and from 4 April until 6 July 1918 he served as [[adjutant]] to the 12th (Service) Battalion, [[Durham Light Infantry]], another Kitchener's Army unit, serving in the same 68th Brigade of the 23rd Division.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 51"&gt;Greacen p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He was mentioned in dispatches a second time on 30 May 1918&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30711|page=6332|date=28 May 1918|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was again promoted to the temporary rank of major on 7 July 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30941|page=11849|date=4 October 1918|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as 2IC to the battalion and finished the war in Genoa, recovering from an attack of gastroenteritis, with a [[Medal bar|bar]] added to his MC. Upon his discharge from hospital he was appointed Commandant of the British Troops and sent to Milan.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 51"&gt;Greacen p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In Milan on 3 November 1918, he met [[Ernest Hemingway]], who had been wounded at the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian front]] and decorated with the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor|Italian Silver Medal of Bravery]] while serving with the Red Cross.{{sfn|Oliver|1999|p=80}} He was posted to the Military Landing Staff at [[Taranto]] before returning to England as adjutant to the Northumberland Fusiliers. He was mentioned in dispatches a third time on 9 January 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31106|page=280|date=3 January 1919|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1921, the regiment was posted to his native Ireland as part of the effort to repress the rebellion.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 84"&gt;Greacen p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; His battalion was part of the Curragh [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]] and from its headquarters in [[Carlow]], its role was to patrol the county of [[Kilkenny]]. He discovered that his childhood nurse had married the local IRA brigadier and on one occasion, helped her bury a cache of hand grenades on the grounds of Bellamont Forest prior to a raid by the [[Black and Tans]] but otherwise remained politically neutral.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 86"&gt;Greacen p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 87"&gt;Greacen p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==
His period of duty in Ireland ended in February 1922 and he moved to the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR), still as adjutant of his regiment. He witnessed the breakdown of transport and communications after the French sent troops into the Ruhr basin in January 1923 to enforce war reparations.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 91"&gt;Greacen p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, he left his regiment to become an instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he became acquainted with [[Richard O'Connor]]; the duo went on a walking tour of the Austro-Italian Alps at the end of 1924.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 94"&gt;Greacen p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Dorman-Smith sat the entrance examination for the [[Staff College, Camberley]]. In the Strategy paper the examiner, [[J. F. C. Fuller]], awarded him 1,000 marks out of a possible 1,000. The advantage of gaining the p.s.c. (passed Staff College) was that the two-year course provided a network of 180 highly trained officers for help afterwards. By arriving with such a splash, it is probable that Dorman-Smith became regarded with suspicion by people who would one day be his peers and superior officers.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 96-7"&gt;Greacen p. 96-7&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Dorman-Smith's fellow students there included the future [[general officer]]s of the [[World War II|Second World War]], including [[Philip Christison]], [[Evelyn Barker]], [[Oliver Leese]], [[Eric Hayes]], [[John Hawkesworth (British Army officer)|John Hawkesworth]], [[Ronald Penney]], [[John Whiteley (British Army officer)|John Whiteley]], [[Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman]], [[Eric Paytherus Nares|Eric Nares]], [[Charles Norman]], [[Stanley Kirby]], [[Wilfrid Lewis Lloyd|Wilfrid Lloyd]], [[Reginald Savory]] and [[Clement West]].&lt;ref name="Smart88"&gt;Smart, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 1928 he passed out Grade A in the top four and publicly burned his lecture notes, including those from [[Bernard Montgomery]], one of the instructors.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 102"&gt;Greacen p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; They had already clashed on numerous occasions and "Chink" had also failed to attend his class on ''The Registering of Personality'', which he regarded as unnecessary for the formulation of successful tactics. He then became the first infantryman to hold the post of instructor of tactics at Chatham, the [[Royal Engineers]]' equivalent of the Staff College. In 1929 he was commissioned to write a textbook on military tactics, which became an official army handbook, ''Infantry Section Leaders' Training'', within two years.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 111"&gt;Greacen p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to the [[Brevet (military)|brevet rank]] of major on 1 January 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33676|page=61|date=2 January 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July he was appointed [[brigade major]] to the 6th Experimental Brigade at [[Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut|Blackdown]], under [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], who, along with Richard O'Connor and [[Claude Auchinleck]], were the most significant influences on his career and his most prominent supporters. Wavell aimed to increase the mobility of the army and led exercises to this aim, in which Dorman-Smith assisted. He encouraged Dorman-Smith to ignore the standard manuals and devise new tactical approaches. Promoted to substantive major on 23 November 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33998|page=7608|date=24 November 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1934, on the recommendation of O'Connor, he was appointed to the [[War Office]] at the brevet rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]], which he was promoted to on 1 July 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34066|page=4230|date=3 July 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 115"&gt;Greacen p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt; He allied himself with Liddell Hart in a crusade against the use of horses in the army. He devised an estimate of British casualties over the first year of a big war into three categories; 25 percent caused by enemy action, 25 percent by indifferent generalship and accidents of war, 50 percent by the Treasury.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 116"&gt;Greacen p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at that time Dorman-Smith began to clash with [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], whom he viewed as the epitome of a traditional [[Royal Horse Artillery]] officer, with little interest in the requirements of modern mechanised warfare.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 116"/&gt; On a return to the Staff College, Camberley in 1936, he had to deliver lectures on tactics which he considered already outdated. He spent his leisure time devising with Philip Christison, one of his fellow students at the Staff College almost a decade before and then a fellow instructor, more up-to-date theories of supply, staff duties and tactical handling, only to be reprimanded by [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]], the Commandant of the Staff College.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 125"&gt;Greacen p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

After sixteen months, rather than the customary three years, Dorman-Smith was promoted to substantive lieutenant colonel on 26 April 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34393|page=2805|date=30 April 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]] (CO) of the 1st Battalion of his regiment, now retitled the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, then serving in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt; His farewell speech to the Staff College on the success of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Abyssinia Crisis|Abyssinian campaign]] was not well received, probably because of its emphasis on the more mechanised approach of the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] compared with the British Army.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 127"&gt;Greacen p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, Dorman-Smith clashed with his new command about his disregard for polo training and he was far from impressed by their military ability. He tried, without success, to break down barriers between British and Egyptian companies, probably another campaign that would be held against this unconventional officer.

Late in 1937, he went to [[Mersa Matruh]] to re-design the fortifications.  His assessment of the terrain was to colour his estimate of [[Neil Ritchie]]'s generalship when facing [[Erwin Rommel]]'s assault in mid-1942, and he seems to have realised that [[First Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] was going to be the decisive battleground in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 133"&gt; Greacen p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1938, he was offered the post of Director of Military Training for India, a major-general's appointment, and he left Egypt in May. He was promoted to brevet colonel and to the temporary rank of [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]] on 10 May&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34514|page=3421|date=27 May 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his permanent rank was advanced to colonel on 1 July (with seniority backdated to 10 May 1937).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34527|page=4242|date=1 July 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later Regimental History thanks Dorman-Smith for his modernising efforts in helping the battalion to survive the desert campaign, although it appears that they were glad to see the back of him.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 135-6"&gt;Greacen p. 135-36&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, he soon got to know the [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]]'s loyal aide, "Bunny" Careless, who developed an antipathy that might have re-surfaced when Dorman-Smith was his brigade commander in Italy in 1944.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 139"&gt;Greacen p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The occupant of the office next door to Dorman-Smith was the Deputy Chief, General Staff, Claude Auchinleck. They became close companions and went on hill-walks before breakfast each day.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 140"&gt;Greacen p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; They developed a plan to transform the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] but the outbreak of the Second World War put paid to them. In January 1940, Auchinleck was appointed to command [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]] in England. In August of that year, Wavell asked Dorman-Smith to take over command of the Staff College, [[Haifa]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], taking over the position from Brigadier [[Alexander Galloway]].&lt;ref name="Mead126"&gt;Mead, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
===The Middle East and North Africa===
In October 1940, over a year after the outbreak of the Second World War, Wavell, the C-in-C of [[Middle East Command]], asked Dorman-Smith to look into the feasibility of taking the offensive against the Italian forces who had invaded Egypt from Libya. On delivery of his report, he was sent as an adviser to Major-General Richard O'Connor and the [[Western Desert Force]] (WDF).&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 153"&gt;Greacen p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mead126"/&gt;

Dorman-Smith is credited by [[historian]] [[Correlli Barnett]]&lt;ref name="Barnett p. 34 and 339"&gt;Barnett p. 34 and 339&lt;/ref&gt; with planning [[Operation Compass]] and with the discovery of a gap in the Italian lines south of [[Sidi Barrani]].&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 162"&gt;Greacen p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sent back to Haifa while the WDF carried out his daring plan with great success. In January 1941, Wavell again asked him to report to O'Connor and assess the progress of the campaign in order to distil what could be learned from its success.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 165"&gt;Greacen p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed with the army until, in early February, the [[Tenth Army (Italy)|Italian 10th Army]] surrendered near [[Benghazi]]. O'Connor sent him back to Cairo to ask Wavell's permission to advance on [[Tripoli]] but in the meantime [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], had instructed Wavell to send troops to the aid of Greece, ending Operation Compass. "Chink" returned to Haifa on 13 February 1941.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 170"&gt;Greacen p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1941, he was temporarily appointed Brigadier General Staff (BGS) and watched from a distance while Erwin Rommel won back all the territory that O'Connor had gained and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] were pushed out of the [[Balkans]] and [[Greece]]. He conveyed several messages to Major-General [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Bernard Freyberg]] who was preparing the [[Battle of Crete|defence of Crete]]. His temporary appointment ended at the end of May and he again returned to the Staff College, Haifa.&lt;ref name="Mead127"&gt;Mead, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; When the news arrived that Wavell was going to be replaced by Auchinleck as C-in-C in the Middle East in July, Dorman-Smith probably thought that he stood a chance of getting a permanent role closer to the action but no job offer was made. By December, he had made up his mind to retire from the army.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 188"&gt;Greacen p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; He had a meeting with Auchinleck and was appointed Liaison Officer for Persia and Iraq. Although he realised that was a meaningless sinecure, he stayed on. In February 1942, Auchinleck sent him to assess the condition of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]], commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Neil Ritchie]]. His conclusion, shared by everyone he consulted, was that Ritchie, although an excellent staff officer, should be replaced but Auchinleck took no action.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 192"&gt;Greacen p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; After a few more unproductive months in which he again offered his resignation (which Auchinleck tore up) he worked on a proposal for a Higher Command School with [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Jan Smuts]].&lt;ref name="Mead127"/&gt; He was offered on 8 May a choice of major-general positions, an unspecified role under Wavell in India or Deputy Chief of the General Staff in Cairo.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 193"&gt;Greacen p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; "Chink" accepted the latter and was promoted to acting major-general on 16 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35645|page=3293|date=24 July 1942|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 6 August 1942, when he was sacked, Dorman-Smith, a full colonel but holding the acting rank of major-general,&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt; served as chief of staff to Auchinleck, the C-in-C Middle East. Auchinleck took over command of the Eighth Army on 25 June after the failure of Ritchie to provide effective resistance to the Axis forces and took Dorman-Smith along to act as his staff officer. Dorman-Smith's novel use of intelligence derived from [[Ultra]] decrypts, led them to formulate tactics based on systematic attacks on the weak points of the German forces, notably the Italian formations, which proved successful in slowing down and finally disrupting the German advance. The stream of bad news from this war zone in the weeks prior to Auchinleck's assumption of personal command, had led to a crisis of confidence in Whitehall. Churchill and Alan Brooke, now the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]], the professional head of the British Army, visited Cairo in August 1942 to take stock of the situation. They were not impressed by Auchinleck's poor grasp of public relations work and decided that a change of command was required.&lt;ref name="Alanbrooke p. 224"&gt;Alan Brooke p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

The key moment of the entire desert war saw Dorman-Smith and Auchinleck finally stop Rommel in a few days of desperate fighting in the [[First_Battle_of_El_Alamein]] in and around Ruweisat Ridge in early July, where their direct and centralized control of the ragged 8th Army defeated the panzers. General Montgomery used the Auchinleck and Dorman-Smiths concepts to conduct and win the defensive battle at the [[Battle_of_Alam_el_Halfa]] a few weeks later. 

Brooke had spoken to his former protégé Ritchie and various other senior officers whom he knew from his days with the horse artillery and came to the conclusion that Dorman-Smith was a poor advisor to Auchinleck,

{{quote|I was beginning to be suspicious that "Chink" Dorman-Smith, one of his staff officers, was beginning to exercise far too much influence on him (Auchinleck). Dorman-Smith had a most fertile brain, continually producing new ideas, some of which (not many) were good and the rest useless.|Alanbrooke&lt;ref name="Alanbrooke p. 224"&gt;Alan Brooke p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; (This diary entry was written in January 1942, when Dorman-Smith had little access to Auchinleck and had spent more time in Haifa than in Cairo.)}}

Major St J. Oswald, a G2 Staff Officer at Eighth Army HQ who eventually rose to the rank of major-general, said of Dorman-Smith, "He really was as near being a lunatic as you can get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Monty: The Making of a General 1887-1942 |last1=Hamilton |first1=Nigel |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |year= 1981 |page=612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his services in the Middle East Dorman-Smith was twice mentioned in dispatches, on 30 December 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35396|page=7340|date=26 December 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 24 June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36065|page=2853|date=22 June 1943|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service in Britain and Italy===
Dorman-Smith never held any important military positions after this date. He reverted to the rank of brigadier on 11 September 1942 and was soon appointed to command the [[160th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Wales|160th Infantry Brigade]].&lt;ref name="Officers of the British Army" /&gt; part of the [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]], a first line [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) formation, commanded by Major-General [[Robert Knox Ross|Robert Ross]]. The 53rd Division was serving in [[Kent]], preparing and training for the [[invasion of Normandy]], as part of [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]], then commanded by Lieutenant-General [[James Gammell]], who was replaced in mid-November by Lieutenant-General [[Montagu Stopford]].&lt;ref name="Mead127"/&gt; Another unfortunate meeting took place on 20 November, when Churchill paid a visit to the 53rd Division and invited "Chink" to the official lunch party. The latter found himself in an argument with the Prime Minister and gave him a patronising lecture on military tactics.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 256"&gt;Greacen p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, in May 1943, Exercise Spartan took place and although his brigade performed well, however, there was no official recognition. To compound his misfortune, on 11 November 1943, Dorman-Smith learned that the new XII Corps commander, in succession to Stopford who was being posted to India, was going to be Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie, who he had been so critical of in North Africa. Believing that it would be too embarrassing to serve directly under Ritchie, Dorman-Smith wrote to Major-General Ross, with the request that he be moved to a new post. As a result, on 21 November he was ordered to vacate his command and stay on leave of absence until further notice, although Ross made it clear to Dorman-Smith that this was in no way a reflection on his efficiency.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 264"&gt;Greacen p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mead128"&gt;Mead, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Remaining virtually unemployed for the next few months, in late April 1944 Dorman-Smith learned that he was to be given command of the [[3rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Brigade]], part of the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry Division]], commanded by Major-General [[Ronald Penney]], then fighting on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]] in the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio beachhead]]. By now, however, his reputation was such that all the senior British commanders in Italy, from [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]], C-in-C of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI), who had succeeded General Auchinleck as C-in-C Middle East in August 1942, along with his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General [[John Harding, 1st Baron Harding of Petherton|John Harding]], and Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese, the Eighth Army commander, all wished to turn him down, but were overruled by Brooke, who made it clear to Dorman-Smith that this was his "sink or swim" moment.&lt;ref name="Mead128"/&gt; Alexander, Harding and Leese had all been fellow students at Camberley in the late 1920s, Alexander in the year senior, Harding − "independent of mind and short of stature"&lt;ref&gt;Greacen, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; − and one who Dorman-Smith greatly respected, in the year below, whereas Leese had been in Dorman-Smith's year.&lt;ref name="Mead128"/&gt;

However, Penney, his new divisional commander, who had been a fellow student at the Staff College, Camberley in the late 1920s, was not at all happy with his new brigade commander, greeting him with the words "I didn't want you before and I don't want you now". There was some history behind this. At the Staff College the two men had clashed, Dorman-Smith frequently deriding him while Penney then believed that "Chink" would be a staff officer and one who should not command troops in battle, and refused to change his opinion.&lt;ref name="Mead128"/&gt; Furthermore, Dorman-Smith's predecessor, Brigadier J. G. James, had been hugely popular in his brigade, causing some resentment among the battalion commanders.

When Dorman-Smith arrived in the Anzio beachhead, the fighting was reminiscent of the fighting on the Western Front almost 30 years before, with static warfare replacing the mobility that had existed in the Western Desert.&lt;ref name="Mead128"/&gt; Soon after his arrival, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Lucian Truscott]], commanding the U.S. VI Corps (under which the 1st Division had been serving since January), received orders from his superior, [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark]], commanding the [[United States Army North|American Fifth Army]], to break out of the Anzio beachhead. This was to coincide with the Allied forces further south in their successful attempt in breaching the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]]. Dorman-Smith's brigade spearheaded the 1st Division's advance up the western flank of Italy, along the way becoming engaged in numerous small-scale fights while trying to reach the [[Tiber|River Tiber]]. During most of this period Penney was away, having been badly injured in February by a shell in some of the fiercest fighting at Anzio. He was replaced on a temporary basis by Major-General John Hawkesworth, yet another of Dorman-Smith's fellow students at Camberley, and a close friend, but he returned to his [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Division]] in Palestine in late May, and was replaced by Brigadier [[Charles Loewen]], the [[Commander, Royal Artillery]] (CRA) of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] who, unlike Hawkesworth, was a total stranger to "Chink", but one who he respected. Penney returned to the division, now advancing forwards to the [[Gothic Line]] defences, in mid-June, but his injuries rendered him unfit to continue in command and relinquished control of the division to Loewen, now a major general, in late July. Soon afterwards, however, Dorman-Smith himself was relieved of command of the 3rd Brigade.&lt;ref name="Mead128"/&gt;

Despite his brigade having performed well thus far, he was sacked again after it was alleged that his battalion commanders had complained about his leadership. Penney, reporting to Leese, the Eighth Army commander, declared him "unfit for brigade command".&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 291"&gt;quotation from diary of General Sir Sidney Kirkman&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances behind his demotion are controversial. He was in command of three battalions. James Hackett wrote in 1984 that Dorman-Smith was summoned by the divisional commander to give his opinion of his superior officer, a procedure that annoyed and offended him. Neither of the other two officers left accounts of the episode, however. The only evidence rests on the report of the divisional commander, which is tainted by inaccuracies in that at least one of the three officers did not lay a complaint. Greacen's biography includes a summary of the differences between the three accounts of this episode made by Penney on various occasions.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 287-93"&gt;Greacen p. 287-93&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he was relieved on 13 August and returned to the United Kingdom, retiring from the army, after almost 30 years' service, on 14 December, and was granted the honorary rank of brigadier.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36837|page=5723|date=12 December 1944|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Mead states that "Even for a British Army which had advanced beyond recognition between 1939 and 1944, Dorman-Smith was too clever and he compounded this sin by being intolerant of those with lesser intellects and, moreover, of letting it show. It was his misfortune to be associated with failure in the Western Desert, but his antagonism of the military establishment meant that he would probably never have advanced to the heights to which his intellectual gifts would otherwise have qualified him."&lt;ref name="Mead127−128"&gt;Mead, p. 127−128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Ireland==
Four years after he was forcibly retired from the British Army, he changed his name from Dorman-Smith to O'Gowan, having long been aware that his father was descended from the O'Gowans, who had once been a ruling family in [[Ulster]].&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 12"&gt;Greacen p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 he had contested the safe Tory seat of [[Wirral (UK Parliament constituency)|Wirral, Cheshire]] for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. He won 14,302 votes and retained his deposit, coming third, with [[Selwyn Lloyd]] easily retaining the seat for the Conservatives with 51% of the votes of those who cast ballots. "Chink" retired to [[Dublin]]. Eve joined him in November 1945, gave birth to Christopher on 10 May 1946 and to Rionagh in December 1947. He began to study in the library at University College, Dublin, after his application to read for a degree was rejected.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 297"&gt;Greacen p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his military career, Dorman-Smith had retained contacts with Ireland. He did not inherit Bellamont Forest until his father died in March 1948 and his parents had long ceased to reside there, leading to the estate becoming run-down by the time he took it over but he had paid regular visits during the 20s and 30s. The estate was {{convert|11|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the Ulster border and at times it became a place of interest to the Republicans. During one of Dorman-Smith's stays, [[Éamon de Valera]] who seems to have been interested in learning of "Chink's" views on the state of the Irish army, made an informal and unannounced visit.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 109"&gt;Greacen p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at the Staff College, Camberley in 1927 to 1928, two Irish Army officers paid an official visit - after rebukes from the United Kingdom for visiting [[Fort Leavenworth]] in the United States and [[Bernard Montgomery]], the senior lecturer, ordered a boycott so the welcoming party consisted only of the Commandant and Dorman-Smith.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 101"&gt;Greacen p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, he joined [[Clann na Poblachta]], a new party led by [[Seán MacBride]], who had been an Irish Republican Army officer in [[Carlow]] during Dorman-O'Gowan's posting there. His ties and allegiance to the UK were fading fast. In May 1951 he stood for election to the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] as an independent candidate in [[Cavan (Dáil constituency)|Cavan]], since Clann were already supporting another candidate. He polled just 495 votes - the lowest of the eight candidates.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 303"&gt;Greacen p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; He later became an [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] advisor to the IRA Executive during the 1950s [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Border Campaign]].&lt;ref name=Liddell&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/OGOWAN.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives,  King's College London, University of London]; retrieved 23 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

His first contact with the IRA seems to have been in the aftermath of their raid on the [[Gough Barracks]] in [[Armagh]] on 12 June 1954.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 310"&gt;Greacen p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Chief of Staff [[Tony Magan]] and the Adjutant-General [[Charlie Murphy]] visited him for discussions at Bellamont Forest.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 312"&gt;Greacen p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1954, he spoke at a reunification rally in Manchester, making it clear that he was distancing himself from the policies of the UK. He grew frustrated at not being made part of the decision-making process of the IRA and when a raid on Omagh went wrong, he began to realise that the IRA did not meet his ideals of efficiency.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 313"&gt;Greacen p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1955–56, his estate was used as a training-ground by the IRA two weekends a year but he was excluded from playing a role despite his eagerness to assist.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 313"&gt;Greacen p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; He does not appear to have kept these contacts secret. Dame [[Daphne du Maurier]], wife of his former Sandhurst adjutant [[Frederick Browning|Frederick "Boy" Browning]], wrote a story about this side of his life, ''A Border-Line Case''.{{sfn|Du Maurier|2006|pp=101–163}}

The British establishment appears to have dismissed him as a harmless crank.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 317"&gt;Greacen p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 1956, after the failure of [[Border Campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Operation Harvest]] and the introduction of the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]], [[Charlie Murphy]] and [[Seán Cronin]] visited to convey the message that his usefulness to the IRA was over.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 318"&gt;Greacen p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics and reputation==
Dorman-Smith was an unorthodox commander and has attracted contrasting opinions.&lt;ref name=ABC-CLIO/&gt; To some, such as [[B. H. Liddell Hart]], he was "...the outstanding soldier of his generation".&lt;ref name="Mead126"/&gt; To others, such as Field Marshals [[Michael Carver, Baron Carver|Michael Carver]] and [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alanbrooke]], he was a "sinister influence" and the major cause of Auchinleck's dismissal. Montgomery called him "a menace" but despite his antipathy, the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] was fought on a plan very close to that conceived by Dorman-Smith for Auchinleck. Montgomery made skilful use of the defensive system which he had been instrumental in planning and laying out. Carver, however, points out that Montgomery did make a decisive alteration to this plan by bringing up troops that were to have been held in reserve in the Nile Delta to form a continuous line of defence.&lt;ref name="Carver p. 137"&gt;Carver p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this was to reduce the need for mobility for which the British Army in terms of organisation, training and communications was not highly skilled − despite the efforts of people such as Dorman-Smith to reform it.&lt;ref name="Carver p. 144"&gt;Carver p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The key characteristic of Dorman-Smith's career is that he was not politically astute and made a number of enemies in the 1920s and 1930s who worked against him, including Penney, Montgomery and most significantly in view of his fall from grace, Brooke, "I had been worried for some time by Auchinleck's handling of armoured formations, mainly due to his listening to the advice of "Chink" Dorman-Smith."&lt;ref name="Alanbrooke p. 235"&gt;Alanbrooke p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery finally initiated battle at El Alamein at a later date than had previously been envisaged in the Auchinleck-Dorman-Smith plan, which was partly responsible for their dismissals.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

He sued Churchill, forcing him to amend ''The Hinge of Fate'', part of his history of the Second World War, so that an implied slur on the fighting mettle of Auchinleck was removed.&lt;ref name=Liddell/&gt; Less acrimoniously, Montgomery was forced to tone down his criticisms of his predecessors in the Eighth Army, when he published his memoirs in August 1958. When Field Marshal [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] brought out his memoirs in 1961, "Chink" was preparing his case but his legal team advised him to withdraw.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 332"&gt;Greacen p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural contacts==
His next meeting with Hemingway after the latter's departure from Genoa in 1919, was in Paris in 1922, where "Chink" was spending his vacation with his parents.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 60"&gt;Greacen p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway was living there with his wife Hadley and working as a freelance journalist. He invited Dorman-Smith to accompany them to [[Montreux]].  They spent their days fishing and climbing mountains and Hemingway alluded to this holiday in ''Green Hills of Africa''. They decided to show Hadley around Milan and crossed the St Bernard Pass on foot - an adventure commemorated by Hemingway in ''A Moveable Feast''.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 63"&gt;Greacen p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

They met up over Christmas 1922, again in Montreux and spent the visit luging and skiing.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 65"&gt;Greacen p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 1923, Hemingway visited Dorman-Smith in Cologne on behalf of the Toronto Star newspaper.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 92"&gt;Greacen p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;  During the following summer, he visited them in Paris where Hemingway introduced him to the intelligentsia, including [[John Dos Passos]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ford Madox Ford]] and [[Ezra Pound]]. Hemingway's first book, ''In Our Time'', was dedicated to Dorman-Smith and includes some anecdotes from "Chink's" memories of the Mons campaign.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 69"&gt;Greacen p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1924, he paid another visit to Paris and became [[godparent|godfather]] to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s eldest son [[Jack Hemingway|John]].&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 70"&gt;Greacen p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, in company with Dos Passos, [[Donald Ogden Stewart]] and Robert McAlmon, they visited the San Fermin festival in Pamplona in July and participated in the bull-running.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 74"&gt;Greacen p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Proof of the high esteem in which [[Hemingway]] held Dorman-Smith is contained in his 1924 poem, ''To Chink Whose Trade is Soldiering''.  However, after their next meeting in April 1926, when Dorman-Smith was accompanying an army rugby team to Paris,&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 80"&gt;Greacen p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; they gradually drifted apart because of the stresses of Dorman-Smith's military career and the changes in Hemingway's life. They did not meet again until Dorman-Smith was touring the USA in April 1950.{{sfn|Meyers|1985|pp=471–474}}

==Personal life==
He did not marry young and conducted a series of affairs until on 29 December 1927, he married Estelle, Lady Berney; their union was childless.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 104"&gt;Greacen p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; During his period in [[Haifa]] in 1940, he met Eve Nott, with whom he began an affair. They wed on 17 May 1949 at Westminster Registry Office.&lt;ref name="Greacen p. 299"&gt;Greacen p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; He had a son and a daughter, Christopher and Rionagh and seven grandchildren and five great grandchildren. Dorman-Smith's youngest brother, [[Reginald Dorman-Smith|Reginald]], was Governor of [[Burma]] at the time of the Japanese invasion during the Second World War. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} His other brother Victor, was a [[Royal Navy]] [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]].

==Death==
Dorman-Smith died from stomach cancer on 11 May 1969 at Lisdarne hospital, Cavan, at the age of 73.

'''George III''' (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738{{efn|name=date|24 May in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian calendar]] in use in Great Britain until 1752.}} – 29 January 1820) was [[List of British monarchs|King of Great Britain]] and [[King of Ireland]] from 25 October 1760 until [[Acts of Union 1800|the union of the two countries]] on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] until his death in 1820. He was concurrently Duke and [[prince-elector]] of [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick-Lüneburg ("Hanover")]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] before becoming [[King of Hanover]] on 12 October 1814. He was the third British monarch of the [[House of Hanover]], but unlike his two predecessors, he was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language,&lt;ref name="rh"&gt;{{cite web|website=Official website of the British monarchy|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=18 April 2016|title=George III|url=https://www.royal.uk/george-iii-r-1760-1820|date=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and never visited Hanover.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 314; Fraser, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

His life and with it his reign, which were longer than those of any of his predecessors, were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]], becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. Further wars against [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] from 1793 concluded in the defeat of [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.

In the later part of his life, George III had recurrent, and eventually permanent, [[Mental disorder|mental illness]]. Although it has since been suggested that he had [[bipolar disorder]] or the blood disease [[porphyria]], the cause of his illness remains unknown. After a final relapse in 1810, a [[Regency era|regency]] was established, and George III's eldest son, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]], ruled as [[Prince Regent]]. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.

Historical analysis of George III's life has gone through a "kaleidoscope of changing views" that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Until it was reassessed in the second half of the 20th century, his reputation in the United States was one of a tyrant; and in Britain he became "the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism".&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Francis Ayscough with the Prince of Wales (later King George III) and Edward Augustus, Duke of York and Albany by Richard Wilson.jpg|thumb|left|George (right) with his brother [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany]], and their tutor, [[Francis Ayscough]], later [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of [[Bristol Cathedral|Bristol]], c. 1749|alt=Conversation piece in oils: Ayscough dressed in black with a clerical collar stands beside a settee on which the two boys sit, one wearing a grey suit the other a blue one. He holds a sheet of paper; the boys hold a book.]]
George was born in London at [[Norfolk House]] in [[St James's Square]]. He was the grandson of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], and the eldest son of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], and [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]]. As he was born two months prematurely and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by [[Thomas Secker]], who was both Rector of [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James's]] and [[Bishop of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were the [[Frederick I of Sweden|King of Sweden]] (for whom [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]] stood proxy), his uncle the [[Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Duke of Saxe-Gotha]] (for whom [[Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos|Lord Carnarvon]] stood proxy) and his great-aunt the [[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover|Queen of Prussia]] (for whom [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton#Marriage and issue|Lady Charlotte Edwin]] stood proxy).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=7712|date=20 June 1738|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince George grew into a healthy but reserved and shy child. The family moved to [[Leicester Square]], where George and his younger brother [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany]], were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 23–41&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first British monarch to study science systematically. Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing, and riding. His religious education was wholly [[Church of England|Anglican]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 42–44, 55&lt;/ref&gt; At age 10, George took part in a family production of [[Joseph Addison]]'s play ''[[Cato, a Tragedy|Cato]]'' and said in the new prologue: "What, tho' a boy! It may with truth be said, A boy in ''England'' born, in England bred."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Historian [[Romney Sedgwick]] argued that these lines appear "to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated".&lt;ref&gt;Sedgwick, pp. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt;

George's grandfather, King George II, disliked the Prince of Wales, and took little interest in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury at the age of 44, and George became [[heir apparent]] to the throne. He inherited his father's title of [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George [[Prince of Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=9050|date=16 April 1751|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt; (the title is not automatically acquired).
[[File:George, Prince of Wales (1738-1820), by Jean-Étienne Liotard.jpg|thumb|left|Pastel portrait of George as [[Prince of Wales]] by [[Jean-Étienne Liotard]], 1754|alt=Head-and-shoulders portrait of a young clean-shaven George wearing a finely-embroidered jacket, the blue sash of the Order of the Garter, and a powdered wig.]]
In the spring of 1756, as George approached his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at [[St James's Palace]], but George refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidant, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], who would later serve as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 51–52; Hibbert, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; George's mother, now the [[Dowager]] Princess of Wales, preferred to keep George at home where she could imbue him with her strict moral values.&lt;ref&gt;Bullion, John L. (2004). [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/46829 "Augusta, princess of Wales (1719–1772)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford University Press. {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/46829}}. Retrieved 17 September 2008 (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
In 1759, George was smitten with [[Lady Sarah Lennox]], sister of the [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]], but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage. "I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation," he wrote, "and consequently must often act contrary to my passions."&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 54; Brooke, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, attempts by the King to marry George to [[Princess Sophie Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] were resisted by him and his mother;&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 36–37; Brooke, p. 49; Hibbert, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Sophie married the [[Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Margrave of Bayreuth]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, at the age of 22, George succeeded to the throne when his grandfather, George II, died suddenly on 25 October 1760, two weeks before his 77th birthday. The search for a suitable wife intensified. On 8 September 1761 in the [[Chapels Royal|Chapel Royal]], [[St James's Palace]], the King married Princess [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], whom he met on their wedding day.{{efn|George was falsely said to have married a [[Quakers|Quakeress]] named [[Hannah Lightfoot]] on 17 April 1759, prior to his marriage to Charlotte, and to have had at least one child by her. However, Lightfoot had married Isaac Axford in 1753, and had died in or before 1759, so there could have been no legal marriage or children. The jury at the 1866 trial of [[Lavinia Ryves]], the daughter of imposter [[Olivia Serres]] who pretended to be "Princess Olive of Cumberland", unanimously found that a supposed marriage certificate produced by Ryves was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C5895849 Documents relating to the case]. [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]. Retrieved 14 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} A fortnight later on 22 September both were crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]]. George remarkably never took a mistress (in contrast with his grandfather and his sons), and the couple enjoyed a genuinely happy marriage until his mental illness struck.&lt;ref name="rh" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite journal|first=John|last=Cannon|title=George III (1738–1820)|journal=[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|date=September 2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10540|accessdate=29 October 2008}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; They had 15 children—nine sons and six daughters. In 1762, George purchased Buckingham House (on the site now occupied by [[Buckingham Palace]]) for use as a family retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt; His other residences were [[Kew Palace|Kew]] and [[Windsor Castle]]. St James's Palace was retained for official use. He did not travel extensively, and spent his entire life in southern England. In the 1790s, the King and his family took holidays at [[Weymouth, Dorset]],&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 378; Cannon and Griffiths, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt; which he thus popularised as one of the first seaside resorts in England.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==
{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War}}
George, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: "Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 612&lt;/ref&gt; He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Lord Hardwicke]], to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 156; Simms and Riotte, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties,{{efn|For example, the letters of [[Horace Walpole]] written at the time of the accession defended George but Walpole's later memoirs were hostile.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, pp. 22, 115–117, 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;}} the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 86; Watson, pp. 67–79&lt;/ref&gt; George was also perceived as favouring [[Tory]] ministers, which led to his denunciation by the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] as an autocrat.&lt;ref name="rh" /&gt; On his accession, the [[Crown land]]s produced relatively little income; most revenue was generated through taxes and excise duties. George surrendered the [[Crown Estate]] to Parliamentary control in return for a [[civil list]] annuity for the support of his household and the expenses of civil government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/who-we-are/our-history/|title=Our history|author=The Crown Estate|year=2004|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims that he used the income to reward supporters with bribes and gifts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kelso, Paul|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/06/monarchy.princessmargaret|journal=[[The Guardian]]|title=The royal family and the public purse|date=6 March 2000|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are disputed by historians who say such claims "rest on nothing but falsehoods put out by disgruntled opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 88; this view is also shared by Brooke (see for example p. 99).&lt;/ref&gt; Debts amounting to over £3&amp;nbsp;million over the course of George's reign were paid by Parliament, and the civil list annuity was increased from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;Medley, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; He aided the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] with large grants from his private funds,&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 194; Brooke, pp. xv, 214, 301&lt;/ref&gt; and may have donated more than half of his personal income to charity.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Of his art collection, the two most notable purchases are [[Johannes Vermeer]]'s ''[[The Music Lesson|Lady at the Virginals]]'' and a set of [[Canaletto]]s, but it is as a collector of books that he is best remembered.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King's Library]] was open and available to scholars and was the foundation of a new national library.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 196–198&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a receding chin and his forehead slopes away from the bridge of his nose making his head look round in shape.]]
In May 1762, the incumbent Whig government of the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] was replaced with one led by the Scottish Tory [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]]. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish prejudices amongst the English.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 145; Carretta, pp. 59, 64 ff.; Watson, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wilkes]], a member of parliament, published ''[[The North Briton]]'', which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for [[seditious libel]] but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and found guilty ''in absentia'' of blasphemy and libel.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763, after concluding the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under [[George Grenville]] to return to power.

Later that year, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] placed a limit upon the westward expansion of the American colonies. The Proclamation aimed to divert colonial expansion to the north (to Nova Scotia) and to the south (Florida). The Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions.{{efn|An American taxpayer would pay a maximum of sixpence a year, compared to an average of twenty-five shillings (50 times as much) in England.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon and Griffiths, p. 505; Hibbert, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763, the total revenue from America amounted to about £1&amp;nbsp;800, while the estimated annual cost of the military in America was put at £225&amp;nbsp;000. By 1767, it had risen to £400&amp;nbsp;000.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon and Griffiths, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;}} The central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Black, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to "[[no taxation without representation]]". In 1765, Grenville introduced the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], which levied a [[stamp duty]] on every document in the British colonies in North America. Since newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] to accept the office of Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 122–133; Hibbert, pp. 107–109; Watson, pp. 106–111&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]] to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 122–133; Hibbert, pp. 111–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Rockingham, with the support of Pitt and the King, repealed Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act, but his government was weak and he was replaced in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created [[Earl of Chatham]]. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in [[History of New York City (1665–1783)|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 137; Hibbert, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and the [[Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]] took over the government, although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the [[British general election, 1768|general election]], and came top of the poll in the [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex constituency]]. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. Wilkes was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared [[Henry Luttrell, 2nd Earl of Carhampton|the runner-up]] as the victor.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 154–160; Brooke, pp. 147–151&lt;/ref&gt; Grafton's government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] to return to power.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 167–168; Hibbert, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:King George III of England by Johann Zoffany.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait by [[Johann Zoffany]], 1771|alt=Three-quarter length seated portrait of a clean-shaven George with a fleshy face and white eyebrows wearing a powdered wig.]]
George was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 260; Fraser, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; but his piety was not shared by his brothers. George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals. In 1770, his brother [[Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn]], was exposed as an adulterer, and the following year Cumberland married a young widow, [[Anne, Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn|Anne Horton]]. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession. George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign. The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]]. Shortly afterward, another of George's brothers, [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh]], revealed he had been secretly married to [[Maria, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Maria, Countess Waldegrave]], the illegitimate daughter of Sir [[Edward Walpole]]. The news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 272–282; Cannon and Griffiths, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord North's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George's words was "one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]".&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In 1773, the tea ships moored in [[Boston Harbor]] were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard, an event that became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]]. In Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was "certainly criminal".&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; With the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the [[Intolerable Acts]] by the colonists: the [[Port of Boston]] was shut down and the [[Explanatory charter|charter]] of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] was [[Massachusetts Government Act|altered]] so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by [[the Crown]] instead of elected by the lower house.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Up to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George's "hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet's opinions even when sceptical of their success. The detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the [[American Revolution]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Americans characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==American War of Independence==
{{Main|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War}}

The [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] was the culmination of the civil and political [[American Revolution]] resulting from the [[American Enlightenment]]. Brought to a head over the lack of American representation in Parliament, which was seen as a denial of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] and often popularly focused on direct taxes levied by Parliament on the colonies without their consent, the colonists resisted the imposition of direct rule after the [[Boston Tea Party]]. Creating self-governing provinces, they circumvented the British ruling apparatus in each colony by 1774. Armed conflict between British regulars and colonial militiamen broke out at the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775. After [[Olive Branch Petition|petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament]] were ignored, the rebel leaders were [[Proclamation of Rebellion|declared traitors]] by the Crown and a year of fighting ensued. The colonies [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared their independence]] in July 1776, listing grievances against the British king and legislature while asking the support of the populace. Among George's other offences, the Declaration charged, "He has abdicated Government here&amp;nbsp;... He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people." The gilded equestrian statue of George III in New York was pulled down.&lt;ref&gt;Carretta, pp. 97–98, 367&lt;/ref&gt; The British captured the city in 1776, but lost Boston, and the [[Saratoga campaign|grand strategic plan]] of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of the British Lieutenant-General [[John Burgoyne]] at the [[Battles of Saratoga|Battle of Saratoga]].

George III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shaughnessy, ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the Victorian author [[Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet|George Trevelyan]], the King was determined "never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal."&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, vol. 1 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The King wanted to "keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse".&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, vol. 1 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent historians defend George by saying in the context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory,&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=cg&gt;Cannon and Griffiths, pp. 510–511&lt;/ref&gt; and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; After Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal, they remained a small minority.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 180–182, 192, 223&lt;/ref&gt; With the setbacks in America, Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] asked to transfer power to [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Lord Chatham]], whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration, but Chatham refused to co-operate. He died later in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1778, [[Early modern France|France]] (Britain's chief rival) signed a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|treaty of alliance]] with the United States and the conflict escalated. The United States and France were soon joined by [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], while Britain had no major allies of its own. [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford|Lord Gower]] and [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath|Lord Weymouth]] both resigned from the government. Lord North again requested that he also be allowed to resign, but he stayed in office at George III's insistence.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 275–276&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the [[Gordon riots]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the [[Siege of Charleston]] in 1780, Loyalists could still believe in their eventual victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the [[Battle of Camden]] and the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1781, the news of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis's]] surrender at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered,&lt;ref name=cg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. The [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaties of Paris]], by which Britain recognised the independence of the American states and [[Spanish Florida|returned Florida]] to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, [https://history.state.gov/milestones/1776-1783/treaty Treaty of Paris, 1783]. Retrieved 5 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; When [[John Adams]] was appointed [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American Minister to London]] in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, "I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C.F. (editor) (1850–56), ''The works of John Adams, second president of the United States'', vol. VIII, pp. 255–257, quoted in Ayling, p. 323 and Hibbert, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional struggle==
With the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] to replace him. [[Charles James Fox]], however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]]. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the [[Fox–North Coalition]]. The Duke of Portland became Prime Minister, with Fox and Lord North, as Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;
[[File:National-Debt-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''A new way to pay the National Debt'' (1786), James Gillray caricatured King George III and Queen Charlotte awash with treasury funds to cover royal debts, with Pitt handing him another [[money bag]].|alt=Centre: George III, drawn as a paunchy man with pockets bulging with gold coins, receives a wheel-barrow filled with money-bags from William Pitt, whose pockets also overflow with coin.

The King disliked Fox intensely, for his politics as well as his character; he thought Fox was unprincipled and a bad influence on the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ayling, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; George III was distressed at having to appoint ministers not of his liking, but the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons, and could not be displaced easily. He was further dismayed when the government introduced the India Bill, which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the [[East India Company]] to Parliamentary commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 243; Pares, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Although the King actually favoured greater control over the Company, the proposed commissioners were all political allies of Fox.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the House of Commons passed it, George authorised [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|Lord Temple]] to inform the [[House of Lords]] that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. The bill was rejected by the Lords; three days later, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and [[William Pitt the Younger]] was appointed Prime Minister, with Temple as his Secretary of State. On 17 December 1783, Parliament voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a "high crime" and Temple was forced to resign. Temple's departure destabilised the government, and three months later the government lost its majority and Parliament was dissolved; the subsequent [[British general election, 1784|election]] gave Pitt a firm mandate.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

For George III, Pitt's appointment was a great victory. It proved that he was able to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 272–279&lt;/ref&gt; During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 316; Carretta, pp. 262, 297&lt;/ref&gt; The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 222–230, 366–376&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time George's health was deteriorating. He had a mental illness, characterised by acute mania, which was possibly a symptom of the genetic disease [[porphyria]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. G. Röhl|Röhl, John C. G.]]; Warren, Martin; Hunt, David (1998). ''Purple Secret: Genes, "Madness" and the Royal Houses of Europe''.

At the end of the parliamentary session, he went to [[Cheltenham Spa]] to recuperate. It was the furthest he had ever been from London—just short of 100&amp;nbsp;miles (150&amp;nbsp;km)—but his condition worsened. In November he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him to foam at the mouth and making his voice hoarse. George would frequently repeat himself, and write sentences with over 400 words at a time, as well as his vocabulary becoming more complex, possible symptoms of [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22122407|title=Was George III a manic depressive?|date=15 April 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=23 July 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His doctors were largely at a loss to explain his illness, and spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he shook hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King of Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 329–335; Brooke, pp. 322–328; Fraser, pp. 281–282; Hibbert, pp. 262–267&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards, and the King's doctors, who included [[Francis Willis (physician)|Francis Willis]], treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out "evil humours".&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 334–343; Brooke, p. 332; Fraser, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled over the terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most reasonable for George III's eldest son and [[heir apparent]], the Prince of Wales, to act as regent, to Pitt's consternation Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 338–342; Hibbert, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

After George's recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 349–350; Carretta, p. 285; Fraser, p. 282; Hibbert, pp. 301–302; Watson, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, [[Margaret Nicholson]] in 1786 and [[John Frith (assailant)|John Frith]] in 1790, contributed to his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Carretta, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Hadfield]]'s failed attempt to shoot the King in the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and [[Bannister Truelock]]. George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that he fell asleep in the interval.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 181–182; Fraser, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolution]] of 1789, in which the [[List of French monarchs|French monarchy]] had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France declared war on Great Britain in 1793; in the war attempt, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of ''[[habeas corpus]]''. The [[War of the First Coalition|First Coalition]] to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 395–396; Watson, pp. 360–377&lt;/ref&gt; The [[War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition]], which included Austria, Russia, and the [[Ottoman Empire]], was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the [[French Consulate|First Consul]] of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].

A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 408–409&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]] that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland". George used the opportunity to drop the title "king of France", which [[British claims to the French throne|English and British Sovereigns had maintained]] since the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].&lt;ref name=weir286&gt;Weir, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that George adopt the title "[[British Emperor|Emperor of the British Isles]]", but he refused.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; As part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain [[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|legal disabilities]] that applied to [[Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholics]]. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the King had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 414; Brooke, p. 374; Hibbert, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]], [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Henry Addington]]. Addington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 402–409&lt;/ref&gt;

George did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an "experiment".&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, the war resumed but public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war, and instead favoured Pitt. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French. George's review of 27,000 volunteers in [[Hyde Park, London]], on 26 and 28 October 1803 and at the height of the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' said, "The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 October 1803, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A courtier wrote on 13 November that, "The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack, his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour's warning."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 597&lt;/ref&gt; George wrote to his friend [[Richard Hurd (bishop)|Bishop Hurd]], "We are here in daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion&amp;nbsp;... Should his troops effect a landing, I shall certainly put myself at the head of mine, and my other armed subjects, to repel them."&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 30 November 1803, quoted in Wheeler and Broadley, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]]'s famous naval victory at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], the possibility of invasion was extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nelson/gallery8/default.htm|title=Nelson, Trafalgar, and those who served|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1807), James Gillray caricatured George's dismissal of the Ministry of All the Talents.|alt=The King, his face obscured by a pillar, kicks out at the behinds of a group of well-fed ministers.]]
In 1804, George's recurrent illness returned; after his recovery, Addington resigned and Pitt regained power. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George III refused. [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and Sweden. This [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]], however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt's health and he died in 1806, reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Lord Grenville became Prime Minister, and his "[[Ministry of All the Talents]]" included Fox. The King was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox's death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. To boost recruitment, the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the Armed Forces. George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set up such a measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Pares, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; They were dismissed and replaced by the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] as the nominal Prime Minister, with actual power being held by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Spencer Perceval]]. Parliament was dissolved, and the [[United Kingdom general election, 1807|subsequent election]] gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of the Duke of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little actual significance.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:George III by Henry Meyer.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving by [[Henry Hoppner Meyer|Henry Meyer]] of George III in later life|alt=Monochrome profile of elderly George with a long white beard]]

In late 1810, at the height of his popularity,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 381; Carretta, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; already virtually blind with [[cataract]]s and in pain from [[rheumatism]], George became dangerously ill. In his view the malady had been triggered by stress over the death of his youngest and favourite daughter, [[Princess Amelia of the United Kingdom|Princess Amelia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; The Princess's nurse reported that "the scenes of distress and crying every day&amp;nbsp;... were melancholy beyond description."&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted the need for the [[Regency Acts#Care of King During his Illness, etc. Act 1811|Regency Act of 1811]],&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 383; Hibbert, pp. 397–398&lt;/ref&gt; and the Prince of Wales acted as Regent for the remainder of George III's life. Despite signs of a recovery in May 1811, by the end of the year George had become permanently insane and lived in seclusion at Windsor Castle until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 285; Hibbert, pp. 399–402&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Spencer Perceval]] was [[Assassination of Spencer Perceval|assassinated in 1812]] and was replaced by [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]. Liverpool oversaw British victory in the Napoleonic Wars. The subsequent [[Congress of Vienna]] led to significant territorial gains for Hanover, which was upgraded from an electorate to a [[Kingdom of Hanover|kingdom]].

Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He developed [[dementia]], and became completely blind and increasingly deaf. He was incapable of knowing or understanding that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 453–455; Brooke, pp. 384–385; Hibbert, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, and for the last few weeks of his life was unable to walk.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Windsor Castle]] at 8:38&amp;nbsp;pm on 29 January 1820, six days after the death of his fourth son, the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Duke of Kent]]. His favourite son, [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Frederick, Duke of York]], was with him.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Duke of York to George IV, quoted in Brooke, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; George III was buried on 16 February in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/royal-burials/royal-burials-chapel-since-1805/|website=St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|publisher=Dean and Canons of Windsor|title=Royal Burials in the Chapel since 1805|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

George was succeeded by two of his sons, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], who both died without surviving legitimate children, leaving the throne to the only legitimate child of the Duke of Kent, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], the last monarch of the House of Hanover.

==Legacy==
George III lived for 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days: both his life and his reign were longer than those of any of his predecessors and subsequent kings. Only Queens [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] and [[Elizabeth II]] [[List of British monarchs by longevity|have since lived]] and [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|reigned longer]].

[[File:TransitOfVenus1769.png|thumb|Extract from ''Observations on the Transit of Venus'', a manuscript notebook from the collections of George III, showing George, Charlotte and those attending them.]]
George III was dubbed "Farmer George" by satirists, at first to mock his interest in mundane matters rather than politics, but later to contrast his homely thrift with his son's grandiosity and to portray him as a man of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Carretta, pp. 92–93, 267–273, 302–305, 317&lt;/ref&gt; Under George III, the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] reached its peak and great advances were made in fields such as science and industry. There was unprecedented growth in the rural population, which in turn provided much of the workforce for the concurrent [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; George's collection of mathematical and scientific instruments is now owned by [[King's College London]] but housed in the [[Science Museum, London]], to which it has been on long-term loan since 1927. He had the [[King's Observatory]] built in [[Richmond-upon-Thames]] for his own observations of the [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1769 transit of Venus]]. When [[William Herschel]] discovered [[Uranus]] in 1781, he at first named it ''Georgium Sidus'' (George's Star) after the King, who later funded the construction and maintenance of Herschel's 1785 [[40-foot telescope]], which was the biggest ever built at the time.

George III hoped that "the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve",&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised. While very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists,&lt;ref&gt;Carretta, pp. 99–101, 123–126&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; The grievances in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] were presented as "repeated injuries and usurpations" that he had committed to establish an "absolute Tyranny" over the colonies. The Declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant. Contemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating "attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power", while the other "derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Reitan, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the latter of these two assessments, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as [[Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet|Trevelyan]] and [[Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|Erskine May]], promoted hostile interpretations of George III's life. However, in the mid-twentieth century the work of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]], who thought George was "much maligned", started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Reitan, pp. xii–xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of the later twentieth century, such as [[Herbert Butterfield|Butterfield]] and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter,&lt;ref&gt;Macalpine, Ida; Hunter, Richard A. (1991) [1969]. ''George III and the Mad-Business''. Pimlico. {{ISBN|978-0-7126-5279-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: "Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence&amp;nbsp;... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors&amp;nbsp;... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth."&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

* 20 April 1751 – 25 October 1760: ''His Royal Highness'' The Prince of Wales
* 25 October 1760 – 29 January 1820: ''His Majesty'' The King

In Great Britain, George III used the official [[Style (manner of address)|style]] "George the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]], and so forth". In 1801, when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] united with [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], he dropped the title of king of France, which had been used for every English monarch since [[Edward III of England|Edward III's]] [[British claims to the French throne|claim to the French throne]] in the medieval period.&lt;ref name=weir286/&gt; His style became "George the Third, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith."&lt;ref name=p390&gt;Brooke, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, he was "Duke of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and [[Lüneburg]], [[Arch-Treasurer]] and [[Prince-elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]" (''Herzog von Braunschweig und Lüneburg, Erzschatzmeister und Kurfürst des Heiligen Römischen Reiches''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D7S8qxVz4MC&amp;pg=PA326|title=Universalgeschichte des Staates: von der vorstaatlichen Gesellschaft zum Staat der Industriegesellschaft|first=Bernd|last=Marquardt|date=28 July 2018|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|via=Google Books|isbn=9783643900043}}&lt;/ref&gt;) until the end of the empire in 1806. He then continued as duke until the [[Congress of Vienna]] declared him "King of Hanover" in 1814.&lt;ref name=p390/&gt;

===Arms===
Before his succession, George was granted the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms]] differenced by a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of five points [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], the centre point bearing a [[fleur-de-lis]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] on 27 July 1749. Upon his father's death, and along with the dukedom of Edinburgh and the position of heir-apparent, he inherited his difference of a plain label of three points [[Argent]]. In an additional difference, the crown of Charlemagne was not usually depicted on the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|arms of the heir]], only on the Sovereign's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm|title=Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family|author=Velde, François|date=19 April 2008|publisher=Heraldica|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his succession until 1800, George bore the royal arms: [[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]], I [[Gules]] three lions [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant guardant]] in [[Pale (heraldry)|pale]] Or ([[Royal Arms of England|for England]]) [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] Or a lion [[Attitude (heraldry)#Rampant|rampant]] within a [[Orle (heraldry)#Tressure|tressure]] flory-counter-flory Gules ([[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|for Scotland]]); II Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for France); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent ([[Coat of arms of Ireland|for Ireland]]); IV [[Division of the field|tierced per pale and per chevron]] (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a [[Variation of the field#Semé|semy]] of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse [[Attitude (heraldry)#Courant|courant]] Argent ([[Saxon Steed|for Saxony]]), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of [[Charlemagne]] Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite book|author=[[William Berry (genealogist)|Berry, William]]|year=1810|title=An introduction to heraldry containing the rudiments of the science|pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinches|first=John Harvey|author2=Pinches, Rosemary|title=The Royal Heraldry of England |series=Heraldry Today |year=1974|publisher=Hollen Street Press |location=Slough, Buckinghamshire |isbn=978-0-900455-25-4|pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], the royal arms were amended, dropping the French quartering. They became: Quarterly, I and IV England; II Scotland; III Ireland; overall an escutcheon of Hanover surmounted by an electoral bonnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15324|page=2|date=30 December 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, after the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Hanover]] became a kingdom, the electoral bonnet was changed to a crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17149|page=1|date=29 June 1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hudson Austin''' (born 26 April 1938) is a former general in the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]] of [[Grenada]]. After the killing of [[Maurice Bishop]], he formed a military government with himself as chairman to rule [[Grenada]].

==History==
Hudson Austin was a member of the [[New Jewel Movement]] in Grenada. He was an early member of the military wing of the party and received military training in [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. He participated in the 1979 revolution which established the [[People's Revolutionary Government]] with [[Maurice Bishop]] at its head. After the revolution, Austin was in charge of the military forces of Grenada.

In October 1983, factional political issues within the government led deputy prime minister [[Bernard Coard]] to place Maurice Bishop under house arrest and to take control of the government. Austin supported the action. Popular demonstrations afterwards broke out against the detention of Bishop. In the course of one demonstration, Bishop was freed from house arrest. Bishop was eventually executed by army soldiers along with many civilians.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

After the execution of Bishop, Austin disbanded the existing government and formed a military council with himself as chairman that would rule "until normality is restored." He made a radio announcement in which he claimed Bishop had led a mob to seize Fort Rupert, headquarters of the armed forces, with the intention of eliminating the NJM leadership and the army. As a result, Austin said, "the Revolutionary Armed Forces were forced to storm the fort, and in the process the following persons were killed: Maurice Bishop, Unison Whiteman, Vincent Noel, [[Jacqueline Creft]], Norris Bain and Fitzroy Bain among others." He then announced a four-day total curfew, warning the people, "No one is to leave their house. Anyone violating this curfew will be shot on sight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/austinradio.html|title=RMC 19 October 1983 Radio Announcement austinradio.html|work=thegrenadarevolutiononline.com|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Martial law|military government]] lasted for six days, until the [[United States]] [[invasion of Grenada|invaded Grenada]] on 25 October 1983. Austin was arrested, along with all of those in the government and army who were alleged to have either participated in the decision to kill Bishop or were in the army [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] that carried out the orders. He was sentenced to death along with Coard and the other coup leaders in 1986, but their sentences were later commuted to [[life in prison]].

In mitigation pleas made in 2007, while he sought to be released from prison he made no attempt to deny his responsibility for what happened in 1983. In the plea it was said that he "understand(s) the need to satisfy action for loss and suffering and the trauma of the Grenadian people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/JusticeBelle.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65l8nBWeE?url=http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/JusticeBelle.html |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin was released from prison on 18 December 2008, together with Colville McBarnett and John Ventour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=20081219&amp;id=hKc_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wVYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1546,2399445 "Grenada releases 3 coup prisoners"], The Victoria Advocate, 19 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Grant''' (1793–1836) was a 19th-century Texas politician, physician and military participant in the Texas Revolution.

==Early life==
James Grant was born on July 28, 1793, in Ross-shire, Scotland, son of William Grant. His paternal grandfather, Alexander Grant, was a veteran of the [[battle of Culloden]] of 1746 who later became a director of the [[East India Company]] and was the last man to escape from the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]].&lt;ref name=reid13&gt;Reid (2007), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant attended medical school, and in 1812 he joined the East India Company. Despite his young age, with the influence of his cousin [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg]], he was named the surgeon for the ''General Stuart''. Just before leaving on his maiden voyage, Grant married Margaret Urquhart, the daughter of an East India Company official.&lt;ref name=reid14&gt;Reid (2007), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next seven years, Grant made three voyages with the East India Company to India and to China. In a brief visit home, he fathered a son, Stewart Majoribanks, who was born in 1817. His daughter Jamesina was born five years later. On his voyages, Grant, like most of his comrades, did a little trading of his own, resulting in a respectable fortune.&lt;ref name=reid14/&gt;

In 1823, he traveled to northern Mexico, ending up in Texas. He became interested in real estate and purchased an estate in Parras, Coahuila, Mexico in 1825.&lt;ref name="tshaonline.org"&gt;Thomas W. Cutrer, "TOLER, DANIEL J.", Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fto11], accessed June 10, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In Coahuila, he was soon involved in politics, where he became secretary of the Executive Council. In 1832, he was a member of the legislature of [[Coahuila and Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bruce Blake, "GRANT, JAMES", Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fgr12], accessed June 09, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 and 1833, he tried his hand in colonizing a settlement near [[Goliad]]. In 1833, Grant moved to [[Nacogdoches]], Texas. From March through April, 1835, Grant was secretary of the legislature of Coahuila and Texas at Monclova, Mexico.
In Coahuila, he acquired vast landholdings and was friends to the Federalist Mexicans and enemies to the Centralists. In 1834 and 1835 he was "Jefe de Armas" or Commander of the local military police. In the spring of 1836, Grant and the Mexican legislators were forced to flee Coahuila when President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] sent General [[Martín Perfecto de Cos]] with a regiment of the Mexican army to disperse the congress.&lt;ref name="tshaonline.org"/&gt;

==Texas Revolution==

He was soon a member of the [[Texian Army]], serving from December 1835 through March 1836, during the [[Texas Revolution]] and fighting in the [[Siege of Bexar]].&lt;ref name=hardin78&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In San Antonio, he would help plan the assault on Bexar&lt;ref name=santos5&gt;Santos (1968), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and negotiate the surrender of Cos. He served as a Goliad delegate to the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]].

In early December, Grant was advocating for an expedition to invade [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], suggesting Houston was not the person to be in charge of the Texian Army.&lt;ref name=hardin107&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; By January 10, 1836, Grant and [[Frank W. Johnson]], who were old partners in Monclova land deals, were seeking volunteers to join a Federal Volunteer Army of Texas to march on Matamoros.&lt;ref name=todish30&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, [[Sam Houston]] arrived in Goliad to take command of the army that Grant and Johnson had recruited. He soon discovered that Grant and Johnson had established themselves as commanders of the army. Houston went along with the Texian army, instilling camaraderie as they reached [[Refugio, Texas]]. In Refugio he approached the soldiers, telling them how a small army could not conquer a city of 12,000 and thereby convinced over half of the men to quit. That same day, Houston would receive word that he had been removed by the council as commander of the army and had been replaced by [[James Fannin]]. Houston left the army and traveled to negotiate with the [[Cherokee]]s in the [[East Texas|eastern]] region of Texas.&lt;ref name=hardin110&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; For several months it was unclear if Grant, Fannin, Johnson, or Houston was in charge of the Texian army.&lt;ref name=todish30/&gt;

In the early spring of 1836, Grant and [[Frank W. Johnson]] continued their quest towards Matamoros. As co-commanders of the [[Matamoros Expedition]] with about 70 to 100 men, they went as far as San Patricio to gather horses for their expedition.&lt;ref name=santos65&gt;Santos (1968), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant was informed that Mexican Captain Nicolás Rodríguez and a small company formerly from Fort Lipantitlán was in the area. Grant confronted and overtook them, confiscated their horses and took the men as prisoners to San Patricio. Within a few days the prisoners had escaped, alerting Mexican forces. Splitting into smaller groups, the Texians searched for mounts and supplies, proceeding all the way to [[Raymondville, Texas|Santa Rosa Ranch]]. Grant and a group of fifteen [[Texians]] while foraging, were attacked by members of General [[José de Urrea]]'s cavalry. Grant was killed in the [[battle of Agua Dulce]] at 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on March 2, 1836.&lt;ref name=hardin111&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Le Bitoux worked as a substitute music teacher.&lt;ref name="martelthepink"/&gt;

Le Bitoux founded the Front homosexuel d'action révolutionnaire (FHAR) in [[Nice]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halperinjeanlebitoux"/&gt; By 1978, he ran for the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] as a "homosexual candidate" alongside [[Guy Hocquenghem]]; they lost the election.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halperinjeanlebitoux"/&gt;

In 1979, Le Bitoux founded ''[[Gai pied]]'', the first long-running commercially published gay magazine in France;&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halperinjeanlebitoux"/&gt; its name was coined by philosopher [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref name="martelthepink"/&gt; However, Le Bitoux stepped down in 1983 due to the magazine's increasingly consumerist orientation.&lt;ref name="libfavereau"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Favereau|first1=Eric|title="Jean Le Bitoux, militant de la mémoire gay"|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2010/04/30/jean-le-bitoux-militant-de-la-memoire-gay_623516|accessdate=11 August 2016|work=[[Libération]]|date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Bitoux joined [[AIDES]], an HIV/AIDS awareness non-profit organization, in 1985.&lt;ref name="libfavereau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="broquaagir"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broqua|first1=Christophe|title=Agir pour ne pas mourir !

In 1989, Le Bitoux founded the Mémorial de la Déportation Homosexuelle, a nonprofit organization for the remembrance of homosexuals victims of Nazi Germany9.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halperinjeanlebitoux"/&gt; Initially, the organization was met with homophobia from some Holocaust survivors, who wrongly feared they were being smeared.&lt;ref name="ilparaitcelse"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Celse|first1=Michel|title=Il paraît que le mouvement gai a 100 ans...|journal=Vacarme|date=1997|volume=3|issue=3|pages=44–46|doi=10.3917/vaca.003.0044|url=http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_ARTICLE=VACA_003_0044&amp;DocId=9565&amp;hits=3937+3936+3935+3857+3856+3855+3662+3661+3660+|accessdate=14 August 2016|via=[[Cairn.info]]|registration=yes|quote=Cette revendication se heurte régulièrement à des refus violemment homophobes de la part de différentes associations d’anciens déportés, qui y voient une entreprise visant à salir leur mémoire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Le Bitoux co-authored the memoir of [[Pierre Seel]], a French homosexual who was deported by the Nazis for being gay.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halperinjeanlebitoux"/&gt;

By the 1990s, Le Bitoux argued that anti-LGBT legislations in France harked back to laws devised by [[François Darlan]] of the Vichy government to end same-sex prostitution in 1942, not Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="ordremoral143"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boninchi|first1=Marc|title=Vichy et l'ordre moral|url=http://www.cairn.info/vichy-et-l-ordre-moral--9782130553397-page-143.htm|date=2005|publisher=PUF|location=Paris|isbn=9782130553397|oclc=420826274|pages=143–193|via=[[Cairn.info]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marc Boninchi, a Law professor at the [[University of Lyon]], has argued that the first instance of legal discrimination dates back to prosecutor [[Charles Dubost]]'s 1941 recommendations.&lt;ref name="ordremoral143"/&gt; Meanwhile, Le Bitoux's 2002 ''Les oubliés de la mémoire'' led President [[Jacques Chirac]] to acknowledge the homosexual victims of World War II.&lt;ref name="halperinjeanlebitoux"/&gt;

Le Bitoux was a co-founder of the [[Centre LGBT Paris-Île-de-France]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="whoswho241"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aldrich|first1=Robert|last2=Wotherspoon|first2=Garry|title=Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415159821|oclc=46843939|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Le Bitoux was openly gay, and was rejected by his family for being gay.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt; Drawn to [[Maoism]] in his early twenties, he also left due to homophobia.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt; He contracted HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="halperinjeanlebitoux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="libfavereau"/&gt;

==Death==
Le Bitoux died on 21 April 2010 in Paris, France.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"/&gt; A memorial service conducted by [[Patrick Bloche]] was held in his honor at the city hall of the [[11th arrondissement of Paris]], with a performance by the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]].&lt;ref name="halperinjeanlebitoux"/&gt; He was buried at the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="libfavereau"/&gt;

[[File:Flag of Georgia Battalion.svg|thumb|right|280px|This flag designed by Joanna Troutman known as the "Troutman Flag" was used by the Georgia Battalion under the command of [[William Ward (Texas)|William Ward]] which marched from [[Macon, Georgia]] to participate in the fight against Mexico and were killed in the [[Battle of the Alamo]] in 1836]]

'''Joanna Troutman''' also '''Johanna Troutman''' (19 February 1818 &amp;ndash; 23 July 1879) sewed a flag for a battalion of Georgia volunteers who were leaving to fight in the [[Texas Revolution]], which became known as the [[Troutman flag]], consisting of a five-pointed blue star and the words "Liberty or Death" on a white silk field. On the reverse side was the Latin phrase UBI LIBERTAS HABITAT, IBI NOSTRA PATRIA EST which means "Where liberty dwells, there is our fatherland". On 8 January 1836 the flag was raised at [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]] which is now part of modern [[Freeport, Texas]]. The original flag was badly damaged by accident and only shreds flew in battle.&lt;ref name=troutman&gt;tshaonline.org, ''Troutman, Joanna''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Georgians, who were led by [[William Ward (Texas)|William Ward]], suffered a harsh fate. Though they escaped the [[Battle of Coleto]] and the capitulation of [[James W. Fannin]]'s command, they were pursued by [[José de Urrea]]'s cavalry. Out of ammunition, they finally surrendered and were marched back to Goliad to join the rest of Fannin's captured troops. On 27 March 1836 they were nearly all executed in the [[Goliad massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;tshaonline.org, ''Ward, William''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Baldwin County, Georgia]] on 19 February 1818, Troutman was the daughter of Hiram Bainbridge Troutman. In 1839 she married Solomom L. Pope and moved to a plantation in [[Knoxville, Georgia]] called Elmwood. The couple had four sons. Her husband died in 1872 and in 1875 she wed W. G. Vinson, who served in the Georgia state legislature. She died on 23 July 1879 at Elmwood and was buried next to her first husband. At the request of Texas governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt]] her remains were transferred to the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in 1913. Her portrait hangs in one of the legislative chambers of the Texas Capitol.&lt;ref name=troutman/&gt;

'''James John Henry Hislop''' (1825 – 23 October 1909) was a [[Convict era of Western Australia|convict]] [[penal transportation|transported]] to [[Western Australia]].  After the expiry of his sentence, he became the first ex-convict in Western Australia to be appointed a teacher.

==Life==
John Hislop was a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] in the [[British Army]] before being sentenced to seven years transportation for an unknown crime.  He arrived in Western Australia on board the ''Pyrenees'' in June 1851 and received his [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]] on arrival in the colony.  In October 1853 he married Bridget Mulqueen, with whom he would have twelve children.

Hislop was officially appointed the government schoolteacher at [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]] in 1853, but it is said that he was already conducting the school before then. He ran the school for nine years, during which time he taught [[John Forrest|John]] and [[Alexander Forrest]].  He was considered a poor teacher by the Board of Education, which wrote that the "school had not progressed as satisfactorily as the Board would wish".

In 1862, Hislop was charged with obtaining money by false pretences.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Josef Erwin Bachmann''' (12 October 1944 [[Reichenbach im Vogtland]], [[Saxony]] – 24 February 1970) became widely known in [[Germany]] for his [[assassination]] attempt on the [[Marxist]] activist [[Rudi Dutschke]], firing three bullets at him, on 11 April 1968. He was convicted of the attack and sentenced to a seven-year prison sentence. While in prison in 1970, Bachmann committed suicide.

==Attack==
Bachmann approached Dutschke, whom he had never met, in the street, having found out his address from the ''Einwohnermeldeamt'', the registration office. Asking him if he was really Rudi Dutschke, he took out a gun and shot him in the head. Later on he told the judge that he had done it out of hate, calling Dutschke a "dirty [[communist]] pig". After the shooting, Bachmann fled to a cellar where he took an overdose of sleeping pills but still continued firing his gun at police officers trying to approach him. He was taken to a hospital to deal with the effects of his overdose.

Dutschke survived the assassination attempt but suffered brain damage and was forced to learn to speak again. He was left with severe health problems which in 1979 led to his death in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]].

After Bachmann's conviction, he and Dutschke corresponded by letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lieber Josef Bachmann: Diese Briefe schrieb Dutschke an seinen Attentäter|url=http://www.bild.de/politik/2010/an-attentaeter-josef-bachmann-12348078.bild.html|website=Der Bild|date=27 April 2010|accessdate=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachmann committed suicide on the night of 23-24 February 1970 by suffocating himself with a plastic bag over his head.

==In media==
Bachmann was portrayed by [[Tom Schilling]] in the 2008 film ''[[Der Baader Meinhof Komplex]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">'''Klaus Riedel''' (August 2, 1907 &amp;ndash; August 4, 1944) was a German [[rocket]] pioneer. He was involved in many early liquid-fuelled rocket experiments, and eventually worked on the [[V-2]] missile programme at [[Peenemünde Army Research Center]].

==History==
Riedel was born in [[Wilhelmshaven]], the son of a naval officer. His mother died when he was twelve years old, and his father two years later. The orphaned Riedel was raised by his grandmother in [[Bernstadt auf dem Eigen|Bernstadt]]. He went on to study as a machinist at the [[Technical University of Berlin]] and to work at [[Löwe Automobil|Löwe]]. While in Berlin, he attended a public lecture on rocketry by [[Rudolf Nebel]] on behalf of Germany's amateur rocket group, the ''[[Verein für Raumschiffahrt]]'' (VfR - "Spaceflight Society") and joined the group straight away, becoming very active in its efforts to build a working rocket  that resulted in the [[Mirak (rocket)|Mirak]] and [[Repulsor rocket]]s, providing his family's farm as a testing ground.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/mirak.htm | title = Mirak | publisher = [[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100107193935/http://astronautix.com/lvs/mirak.htm | archivedate = 2010-01-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the VfR disbanded in 1933, Riedel was invited by [[Wernher von Braun]] to join him in the army's rocket programme. He accepted, and worked from Peenemünde when the team moved there. Riedel's position was "Head of the Test Laboratory" and his work seems to have been mostly concerned with developing the mobile support equipment for the V-2.

He was killed in a car accident two days after his thirty-seventh birthday.

There is a memorial and small museum dedicated to him in Bernstadt and in 1970 a crater on the moon was named after him.

'''Kubaba''' (in the ''Weidner'' or ''[[Esagila]] Chronicle'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc19/weidner.html The Weidner Chronicle (ABC 19) or Esagila Chronicle].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: '''Kug-Bau''') is the [[Queen regnant|only queen]] on the ''[[Sumerian King List]]'', which states she reigned for 100 years – roughly in the Early Dynastic III period (ca. 2500-2330 BC) of [[History of Sumer|Sumerian history]]. In later times, she was worshipped as a goddess.

==Queen==
Kubaba is one of very few women to have ever ruled in their own right in Iraqi history.  Most versions of the king list place her alone in her own dynasty, the 3rd Dynasty of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], following the defeat of Sharrumiter of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], but other versions combine her with the 4th dynasty, that followed the primacy of the king of [[Akshak]]. Before becoming monarch, the king list says she was an [[Alewife (trade)|alewife]].

The ''Weidner Chronicle'' is a propagandistic letter, attempting to date the shrine of [[Marduk]] at [[Babylon]] to an early period, and purporting to show that each of the kings who had neglected its proper rites had lost the primacy of Sumer. It contains a brief account of rise of "the house of Kubaba" occurring in the reign of [[Puzur-Nirah]] of Akshak: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the reign of Puzur-Nirah, king of Akšak, the freshwater fishermen of [[Esagila]] were catching fish for the meal of the great lord Marduk; the officers of the king took away the fish. The fisherman was fishing when 7 (or 8) days had passed [...] in the house of Kubaba, the tavern-keeper [...] they brought to Esagila. At that time BROKEN[4] anew for Esagila [...] Kubaba gave bread to the fisherman and gave water, she made him offer the fish to Esagila. Marduk, the king, the prince of the Apsû, favored her and said: "Let it be so!" He entrusted to Kubaba, the tavern-keeper, sovereignty over the whole world." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her son [[Puzur-Suen]] and grandson [[Ur-Zababa]] followed her on the throne in Sumer as the fourth Kish dynasty on the king list, in some copies as her direct successors, in others with the Akshak dynasty intervening. Ur-Zababa is also known as the king said to be reigning in Sumer during the youth of [[Sargon the Great]] of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], who militarily brought much of the Near East under his regime shortly afterward.

== Goddess ==
Shrines in honour of Kubaba spread throughout [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Weidner "Chronicle" mentioning Kubaba from Grayson, A.K. (1975) "Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Munn, Mark (2004). "Kybele as Kubaba in a Lydo-Phrygian Context": Emory University cross-cultural conference "Hittites, Greeks and Their Neighbors in Central Anatolia" (Abstracts)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] area, she may be identified with Kebat, or [[Hebat|Hepat]], one title of the Hurrian Mother goddess [[Hannahannah]] (from Hurrian ''hannah'', "mother").  [[Abdi-Heba]] was the palace mayor, ruling [[Jerusalem]] at the time of the [[Amarna letters]] (1350 BC).

Kubaba became the tutelary goddess who protected the ancient city of [[Carchemish]] on the upper [[Euphrates]], in the late Hurrian/early [[Hittites|Hittite]] period.&lt;ref&gt;F. Graf, ''Nordionische Kulte'' (Rome) 1985:111, noted by Jan N. Bremmer, "Attis: A Greek God in Anatolian Pessinous and Catullan Rome" ''Mnemosyne'', Fourth Series, '''57'''.5 (2004:534-573) p. 539.&lt;/ref&gt; Relief carvings, now at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] (Anadolu Medeniyetleri Müzesi), [[Ankara]], show her seated, wearing a cylindrical headdress like the ''polos'' and holding probably a [[tympanum (hand drum)]] or possibly a mirror in one hand and a [[Opium|poppy capsule]] (or perhaps [[pomegranate]]) in the other. She plays a role in [[Luwian language|Luwian]] texts and a minor role in Hittite texts, mainly in Hurrian rituals.

According to Emanuel Laroche, Maarten J. Vermaseren, and Mark Munn, her cult later spread and her name was adapted for the main goddess of the Hittite successor kingdoms in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Laroche 1960; Vermaseren 1977; Munn, 2004&lt;&lt;/ref&gt;  This deity later developed into the [[Phrygia]]n [[Cybele|''matar kubileya'']] ("mother Cybele"),&lt;ref&gt;Munn, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; who was depicted in [[petroglyph]]s and mentioned in accompanying inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.H.E. Haspels]], ''The Highlands of Phrygia'' 1971, I 293 no 13, noted in Walter Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', 1985, III.3.5 notes 17 and 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Phrygian goddess otherwise bears little resemblance to Kubaba, who – according to Herodotus – was a sovereign deity at [[Sardis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] 5.102.1, noted by Munn 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her [[Lydia]]n name was '''Kuvav''' or '''Kufav''' which [[Ionia|Ionian Greeks]] initially transcribed '''Kybêbê''', rather than ''Kybele''; Jan Bremmer notes in this context the 7th century [[Semonides of Amorgos]], who calls one of her Hellene followers a ''kybêbos''.&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer 2004:539 notes Semonides Fr 39 (West).&lt;/ref&gt; Bremmer observes that in the following century she was further Hellenized by [[Hipponax]], as "Kybêbê, daughter of [[Zeus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer 2004:539 notes Hipponax Fr 125 Degani equivalent to Fr 127 West.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) handles deportation in the United States, often in conjunction with advice from the [[U.S. State Department|U.S. Department of State]].&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{Cite book|contribution=Deportation|title=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2007|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0815199.html|accessdate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such bans are often temporary, depending on the circumstances of each case, however, anyone previously deported or denaturalized is automatically barred from re-entering the United States without a waiver issued by the U.S. Department of State.

Other locales  where his bombs did detonate include the [[London Stock Exchange]], the [[Bank of England]], and an otherwise unidentified government building, injuring several people, including a security  guard who lost an eye and a hand. O'Doherty sent a bomb to Bishop [[Gerard William Tickle|Gerard Tickle]], the Roman Catholic chaplain to the [[British Army]], after reading a newspaper story which purportedly quoted the bishop as stating that British soldiers did nothing wrong on Bloody Sunday. The bomb was stuffed into a hollowed-out Bible but failed to detonate.

After being "stuck" in Paris for five months disputing with U.S. immigration authorities over his right to return to California, where he had lived for almost 20 years, he was officially barred from re-entering the U.S., despite the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS)'s approval of his immigrant visa petition, which should have allowed him to return. U.S. immigration authorities in Europe charged that he had been living in the U.S. illegally and was therefore ineligible for the approved green card (permanent residency visa) for which he had traveled to the U.S. Consulate in Paris to pick up per the directive from DHS. ''"What I didn't know is that I should not have left the country"'', Ungerman later realized, ''"but I should have worked out with a lawyer to convert my immigrant-visa approval into an actual immigrant status from inside the country. Instead I went out to Paris, where I had been 'invited' to pick up my visa at the U.S. Consulate.

'''Loelia Mary, Lady Lindsay of Dowhill''', [[née]] '''Ponsonby''' (6 February 1902 – 1 November 1993), was a British peeress, needlewoman and magazine editor.

== Family and first marriage ==

Lindsay was the only daughter of the courtier [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby|Sir Frederick Ponsonby]], later 1st [[Baron Sysonby]], and [[Victoria Ponsonby, Baroness Sysonby|Victoria Lily (Kennard), Lady Sysonby]], the well-known cook book author. She spent her early years at [[St James's Palace]], Park House at Sandringham and Birkhall. One of the [[Bright Young People]], she met the twice divorced [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster]]. They were married on 20 February 1930 in a blaze of publicity, with [[Winston Churchill]] as the best man, but were unable to have children.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1440479/Anne-Duchess-of-Westminster.html Anne Duchess of Westminster]&lt;/ref&gt; Her marriage to the enormously wealthy peer failed and was described by [[James Lees-Milne]] as "a definition of unadulterated hell". It was dissolved in 1947 after years of separation.&lt;ref name="Loelia"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/6455125/Lady-Lindsay-of-Dowhill.html Lady Lindsay of Dowhill]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life after divorce ==

After her divorce, Loelia, Duchess of Westminster, established herself as a skillful hostess at [[Send, Surrey]], occupying herself with needlework and gardening, passions she had inherited from her mother.&lt;ref name="Loelia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsay"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-loelia-lindsay-1501819.html Loelia Lindsay]&lt;/ref&gt; Her needlework collection was bequeathed to the National Trust. In the 1950s, she worked as a feature editor for ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]]'' magazine, and covered the wedding of [[Prince Rainier III of Monaco]] and [[Grace Kelly]].&lt;ref name="Loelia"/&gt;

Her second marriage, to the divorced explorer [[Sir Martin Lindsay, 1st Baronet]], came as a surprise to her friends&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; but was much more successful.&lt;ref name="Loelia"/&gt; The couple were married on 1 August 1969. Sir Martin, a devoted husband,&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; died in 1981 and Lady Lindsay chose to spend her last years in nursing homes. Her memoirs, written in 1961 and titled ''Grace and Favour: The Memoirs of Loelia, Duchess of Westminster'', are a significant record of aristocratic life between the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Loelia"/&gt;

'''Micah D. Fowler''' (born March 5, 1998) is an American actor with [[cerebral palsy]]. He is most known for his roles in ''[[Labor Day (film)|Labor Day]]'' and as JJ DiMeo in the television series ''[[Speechless (TV series)|Speechless]]''.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/20/speechless-micah-fowler-breakout-star|author=Dalene Rovenstine|title=Speechless: Micah Fowler is the breakout star|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 20, 2016|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler has also had minor roles in ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]''.

==Early life==
The younger brother of actress [[Kelsey Fowler]], he grew up in [[Barnegat Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="sand"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnegat Teen May Be Breakout Star of Fall TV Season|url=http://thesandpaper.villagesoup.com/p/barnegat-teen-may-be-breakout-star-of-fall-tv-season/1572315|website=The SandPaper|accessdate=October 8, 2016|date=Sep 13, 2016|quote=Now a local teen has a chance to make it big on television. Barnegat's Micah Fowler – Kelsey's younger brother – will make his national TV debut at 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 21 in a new ABC show called "Speechless."}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up performing in local theater productions along with his sister. After his sister started taking roles on Broadway, Fowler thought he might like to advance his acting career as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micah Fowler Biography|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5094896/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|website=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Micah D. Fowler started pursuing acting at the age of 5, which led him to roles on ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He booked his role for ''[[Labor Day]]'' at age thirteen. For his most recent role, as "JJ DiMeo" on ''[[Speechless (TV series)|Speechless]]'', he found out he booked the role on his eighteenth birthday. In an interview with ''[[People magazine]]'', Fowler said it was the "best birthday present ever!"&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Brittany|title=Speechless Star Micah Fowler Opens Up About Thriving with Cerebral Palsy: 'I Don’t Let It Define Me'|url=http://people.com/celebrity/speechless-micah-fowler-opens-up-thriving-cerebral-palsy/|website=People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his role on ''Speechless'', he said it is a challenge to play JJ. Although Fowler is able to speak, the JJ character does not speak, so Fowler has to compensate with dramatic facial expressions and body movements. It's said that Fowler's humor gets the show's biggest laughs.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; He said he sometimes just wants to blurt out what he is feeling or saying.&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

Fowler and the character he portrays both have cerebral palsy, and he is one of few actors with a disability playing a character with a disability on primetime network television.&lt;ref name="bzf"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lange|first1=Ariane|title=Meet The Teen Who’s Casually Making Sitcom History|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/micah-fowler-speechless-abc|website=Buzzfeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation==
When not performing, Fowler devotes his time as an ambassador for the [[Cerebral Palsy Foundation]] (CPF). After each episode of ''Speechless'', the CPF's website posts content and short informational videos about cerebral palsy. Fowler encourages, "So the next time you watch ''Speechless'', take 10 minutes to check out their post for the night."&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

==Personal life==
When taking the role for ''Speechless'', Fowler had to move from New Jersey to Los Angeles. To take the role, he sacrificed by missing much of his sled hockey season and much of his senior year. He plans to attend his graduation ceremony in the spring.&lt;ref name="bzf" /&gt;

While Fowler had previously been somewhat averse to social media, after landing the role on ''Speechless'', he did join Instagram and Twitter in an effort to promote the show.

Growing up he said he was a huge fan of movies and television. He said, "I couldn't help but notice the lack of characters dealing with disabilities."&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; He hopes to be in a ''[[Star Wars]]'' film or a Marvel movie.&lt;ref name="bzf" /&gt;

'''Michael Garrison''' (born November 28, 1956 in [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], [[Oregon]], died on March 24, 2004 in [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]], Oregon) was a [[synthesist]] from [[Oregon]], United States.

==Life and career==
Michael Earl Garrison was born in Roseburg, Oregon, on November 28, 1956 to William Garrison and Sharon (Walker) Curry.&lt;ref name="orbituarybend"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/article/20040331/NEWS05/403310711/ |title=Orbituary |date=31 March 2004 |website= |publisher=[[The Bulletin|The Bulletin (Bend)]] |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked as a banker and his mother was a homemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.musik4fun.com/musik/musik-allgemein/36909-verstorbene-musiker/index2.html#post176838
 |title=Verstorbene Musiker |author=Adelbert von Deyen |date=9 September 2007 |website=Music4Fun.com |publisher= |language=German |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Garrison died on March 24, 2004 in Bend, Oregon, of massive liver failure from prolonged overuse of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Mark S|title=Crossing the Bridge of Air|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/michaelgarrison.html|website=Perfect Sound Forever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrison graduated from Bend High School in 1975 and attended the [[University of Idaho]] where he served as the president of the Central Oregon chapter of the University of Oregon Duck Athletic Club.&lt;ref name="orbituarybend"/&gt; While studying music and psychology at the University of Idaho, he started to form the basis for his first release on his own label, ''Windspell Records'', later known as ''Garrisongs Music''. The original work was titled ''In The Regions of Sunreturn'' (see [http://www.discogs.com/Michael-Garrison-In-The-Regions-Of-Sunreturn/master/123395]) and was created under the impression of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions. Later he signed with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 1980, the sleeve design was altered. When re-issued on CD through Windspell in the early 1990s, the title was changed to ''In The Regions of Sunreturn and Beyond'' since there were some extra tracks included with the album.

He was influenced by the European innovators of electronic music, like [[Klaus Schulze]], [[Tangerine Dream]], and [[Jean Michel Jarre]].

'''Muhtereme Hatun''' ({{lang-ota|محترمه خاتون}}) was a consort of Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Life==
Muhtereme Hatun's son Şehzade Mehmed was born at Amasya, when Bayezid was still a prince. According to Turkish tradition, all princes were expected to work as provincial governors as a part of their training. Mehmed was sent to Kefe and Muhtereme accompanied him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

Mehmed died in 1505 and Muhtereme retired to Bursa. She and Mükrime Hatun, wife of Şehzade Şehinşah, endowed the Eşrefzade Mosque at Iznik. She is buried in [[Muradiye Complex]], Bursa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=

'''Nazila Fathi''' (born December 28, 1970) is an Iranian-Canadian author and former Teheran correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]]''. She also reported on Iran for both ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Agence France-Presse]]''. In her book ''The Lonely War'' she interweaves her personal history with that of Iran, from the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Revolution]] until, when continuing to report from Iran became life-threatening in 2009, she was forced into exile.

==Biography==
{{expand section|1=additional material mined from the cited sources|date=April 2015}}
Fathi was born in Tehran in 1970.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Mozaffari |first=Nahid |date=31 December 2014 |title=Nazila Fathi's 'The Lonely War' is a Memoir of Iran |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/books/nazila-fathis-the-lonely-war-is-a-memoir-of-iran.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a senior civil servant in the Ministry of Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Nazila Fathi interview with Anna Maria Tremonti on The Current |date=11 December 2014 |title=Nazila Fathi's account of growing up in Revolutionary Iran |medium=Radio program |url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/Special+Coverage/Franklin/Audio/ID/2634262492/ |time=3:50 minutes in |location=Toronto |publisher=[[CBC Radio]] |access-date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied English at [[Islamic Azad University|Azad University]], and while there began working as a translator for foreign reporters.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; From that beginning she became a stringer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and [[Agence France-Presse]].&lt;ref name=publisher&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465069996 |title=Full Details: The Lonely War |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by the Iranian government's multi-year press accreditation process, Fathi moved to Canada in 1999 and became a Canadian citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Nazila Fathi interview with Anna Maria Tremonti on The Current |date=11 December 2014 |title=Nazila Fathi's account of growing up in Revolutionary Iran |medium=Radio program |url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/Special+Coverage/Franklin/Audio/ID/2634262492/ |time=14:05 minutes in |location=Toronto |publisher=CBC Radio |access-date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned an MA in political science and women's studies from the [[University of Toronto]] in 2001 before returning to Tehran as a correspondent for ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=publisher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fathi |first=Nazila |date=16 January 2010 |title=The Iranian Exile's Eye |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/weekinreview/17fathi.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests]], Fathi and other journalists reported on the violence by the Iranian government against peaceful protestors. In early 2009, the Iranian government banned international journalists to stop coverage of the protests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/06/16/iran.journalists.banned/index.html?iref=24hours |title=Iran bans international journalists from covering rallies |author= |date=16 June 2009 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Fathi continued to report. In June 2009, other journalists were arrested by Iranian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=21 June 2009 |title=Newsweek Reporter Detained |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/203015 |journal=Newsweek |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724195003/http://www.newsweek.com/id/203015 |archivedate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/2009/06/iranian-newspaper-raided-25-employees-detained.php |title=Iranian newspaper raided, employees detained |author= |date=23 June 2009 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fathi was placed under surveillance by the government, and threats were made against her life.

She subsequently became an associate at [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs|Harvard's Belfer Center]], a [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism|Nieman]] Fellow and a [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy|Shorenstein]] Fellow.&lt;ref name=publisher /&gt;&lt;ref name=thecrimson&gt;{{cite news |last=Jahnke |first=Mark R. |date=16 February 2012 |title=15 Questions with Nazila Fathi |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/16/15-Questions-Nazila-Fathi/?page=single |newspaper=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of notable '''overturned convictions''' in Canada.

== Robert Baltovich ==
'''[[Robert Baltovich]]''' was convicted in March 1992 of the murder of his girlfriend, Elizabeth Bain, in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]]. Bain disappeared on June 19, 1990, after telling her mother she was going to "check the tennis schedule" on campus. On June 22, her car was found with a large bloodstain in the back seat, but her body was never found.

Baltovich consistently maintained his innocence throughout the trial and his lawyers suggested that the so-called "Scarborough Rapist", who was later identified as serial killer and rapist [[Paul Bernardo]], might be responsible for the murder. He was nonetheless convicted and served eight years in prison until Baltovich's lawyers appealed, after which Baltovich was released on bail in March 2001. In December 2004, the Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside the conviction. In 2005, Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney-General announced that Baltovich would face a new trial on charges of second-degree murder, at an unspecified date, but the trial never took place. With no Crown case, the judge directed the jury to make a finding of not guilty on April 22, 2008.&lt;ref name="notguilty"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== James Driskell ==
'''[[James Driskell]]''' was convicted for the first-degree murder of Perry Harder, whose remains were found in a shallow grave outside [[Winnipeg]], three months after his disappearance. Driskell was linked to the crime with three hairs found in his van that supposedly belonged to Harder, but [[DNA test]]s years later found that the hairs did not belong to the victim.

In 2005, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Irwin Cotler used a special Criminal Code of Canada provision to quash the conviction, stay the charges, and order a new trial for Driskell, but the Manitoba Department of Justice decided not to order a new trial. It instead entered a stay of proceedings and called for a public inquiry, ending Driskell's conviction without exonerating him.&lt;ref name="driskell"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthony Hanemaayer ==
'''Anthony Hanemaayer''' was charged for breaking and entering, and alleged assault with a weapon against a 15-year-old girl at her home in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] on September 29, 1987&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aidwyc.org/cases/historical/anthony-hanemaayer/&lt;/ref&gt;. During the trial in 1989, the Crown decided to withdraw charges of the assault, however, Hanemaayer was still convicted and sentenced for breaking and entering charges. Hanemaayer pleaded guilty to avoid a lengthy prison sentence, and was sentenced to two years less a day in a provincial reformatory. He was released in June 1990 after serving sixteen months in prison, including eight months in pre-trial detention.

At the time of the attack in 1987, the Scarborough area was being plagued by the so-called 'Scarborough Rapist', who was later identified as serial killer and rapist [[Paul Bernardo]]. He was convicted of numerous sexual assaults in Scarborough, sexual assaults elsewhere, and the murders of three girls he committed with his wife [[Karla Homolka]].

In 2006, Bernardo confessed to the 1987 assault and provided a detailed account to investigating officers, who also interviewed Hanemaayer several weeks later but did not inform him of Bernardo's confession. Hanemaayer became aware of Bernardo's confession in late 2007, after which he appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal in June 2008. As a result, the court cleared Hanemaayer of the convictions and Justice Rosenberg stated that "it is profoundly regrettable that errors in the justice system led to this miscarriage of justice and the devastating effect it has had on Mr. Hanemaayer and his family."

In June 2010, Hanemaayer commenced a $1.1 million lawsuit for damages suffered as a result of his 1989 conviction for the assault. The courts made a decision not to compensate him, however.&lt;ref name="Hanemaayer"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ivan Henry ==
'''[[Ivan Henry]]''' was convicted of multiple sexual assaults in Vancouver, Canada from 1980 to 1982. Similar assaults continued while he was jailed, leading to further investigation by police. His conviction was overturned in 2010. Henry was imprisoned for 27 years.

== Réjean Hinse ==
'''[[Réjean Hinse]]''' was convicted for aggravated robbery and sentenced to 15 years in prison for his alleged part in the armed robbery in December 1961 of a general store in [[Mont-Laurier]], [[Québec]]. He campaigned to establish his innocence based on the fact that he had been in Montreal, over two hundred kilometres away, at the time the crime was committed. In 1997 he was acquitted by the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that evidence presented at his trial was insufficient to convict him of aggravated robbery. Hinse was awarded $13.1 million compensation, payable by the Quebec and Canadian Federal governments, the largest wrongful conviction award in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="Hinse"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Donald Marshall, Jr. ==
'''[[Donald Marshall, Jr.]]''', at the time 17, was convicted of murdering acquaintance Sandy Seale in 1971 and sentenced to life in prison. The two had confronted Roy Ebsary, an older man they encountered in Wentworth Park in [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]], during the late evening with the intent to "roll a drunk". A short scuffle occurred and Seale fell mortally wounded by a knife blow.  Ebsary admitted that he had stabbed Seale but then lied about his role to the police who immediately focused on Marshall, who was 'known to them' from previous incidents.

Marshall spent 11 years in jail before being acquitted by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in 1983. A witness came forward to say he had seen another man stab Seale, and several prior witness statements pinpointing Marshall were recanted. Ebsary was subsequently tried and convicted of manslaughter.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Martensville satanic sex scandal ==
The '''[[Martensville satanic sex scandal]]''' occurred in [[Martensville]], [[Saskatchewan]], in 1992 where a mother alleged that a local woman who ran a babysitting service and day care centre in her home had sexually abused her child. Police began an investigation and allegations began to snowball. More than a dozen persons, including five police officers from two different forces, ultimately faced over 100 charges connected with running a Satanic cult called The Brotherhood of The Ram, which allegedly practiced ritualized sexual abuse of numerous children at a "Devil Church".

The son of the day care owner was tried and found guilty, but a new investigation concluded that the original trial was motivated by 'emotional hysteria.' In 2003, defendants sued for wrongful prosecution. In 2004, Ron and Linda Sterling received $924,000 in reparations.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;

== David Milgaard ==
'''[[David Milgaard]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission of Inquiry into the Wrongful Conviction of David Milgaard|url=http://www.justice.gov.sk.ca/milgaard/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603201514/http://www.justice.gov.sk.ca/milgaard/|archivedate=2014-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was convicted of raping and murdering 20-year-old nursing assistant [[Gail Miller (murder victim)|Gail Miller]] in 1969. When she was found on a snowbank, Milgaard and his friends, Ron Wilson and Nichol John, were picking up their friend, Albert Cadrain. Tipped off by Cadrain, who admitted he was mostly interested in the $2,000 reward for information, British Columbia police arrested Milgaard in May 1969 and sent him back to Saskatchewan where he was charged with Miller's murder. Cadrain testified that he had seen Milgaard return the night of Miller's murder in blood-stained clothing.

Both Wilson and John were also called to testify against him. They had told police that they had been with Milgaard the entire day and that they believed him to be innocent, but they changed their stories for the court. Wilson later recanted his testimony claiming that he had been told he was personally under suspicion and wanted to alleviate the pressure on himself. Milgaard was sentenced to life in prison in January 1970.

Milgaard appealed his conviction several times, but was blocked both by bureaucracy and by a justice system unreceptive to those who were not willing to admit their guilt. But in July 1997, a  [[DNA test|DNA]] laboratory in the United Kingdom released a report confirming that semen samples on the victim's clothing did not originate with Milgaard—for all intents and purposes clearing Milgaard of the crime. The Saskatchewan government then apologized for the wrongful conviction, and [[Larry Fisher (murderer)|Larry Fisher]] was arrested days later. Fisher had been living in Cadrain's basement at the time of the murder.

== Guy Paul Morin ==
'''[[Guy Paul Morin]]''' was a suspect in the October 1984 rape and murder of his 9-year-old next-door neighbour, [[Christine Jessop]]. Morin was found not guilty of murder at his first trial in 1986, but convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment at his second trial after the Crown appealed. Improvements in [[DNA testing]] led to a test in 1995 which excluded Morin as the murderer, after which Morin's appeal of his conviction was allowed (i.e., the conviction was reversed), and a directed verdict of acquittal entered in the appeal.

== Willie Nepoose ==
'''[[Willie Nepoose]]''' was convicted in 1987 for the 1986 murder of Rose Marie Desjarlais.  In 1992 the conviction was overturned when it was discovered one of the witnesses had perjured herself, the police had not disclosed some evidence, and evidence was discovered that he was with his brothers in a hotel at the time of the murder.

== Romeo Phillion ==
'''[[Romeo Phillion]]''' was convicted of the 1967 murder of Ottawa firefighter Leopold Roy, after making a confession to police which he recanted two hours later. He spent 31 years in prison and five years on parole. The case was reopened in 2006, and in March 2009, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned his 1972 murder conviction and granted him a new trial, in part because a 1968 police report establishing a clear alibi for Phillion had not been turned over to his defence lawyer in his original trial.

== Thomas Sophonow ==
'''[[Thomas Sophonow]]''' was tried three times in the 1981 murder of doughnut-shop clerk Barbara Stoppel. Sophonow spent four years imprisoned but was acquitted by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in 1985.

== Steven Truscott ==
'''[[Steven Truscott]]''', at the time 14, was convicted in 1959 for the rape and murder of 12-year-old Lynne Harper. Truscott was initially sentenced to death, but this was later commuted to life imprisonment. He continued to maintain his innocence until 2007, when his conviction was declared a miscarriage of justice and he was formally acquitted of the crime. On July 7, 2008, the government of Ontario awarded him $6.5 million in compensation.

== William Mullins-Johnson ==

'''[[William Mullins-Johnson]]''', of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario was found guilty of the first-degree murder of his niece, Valin Johnson, after a two and half week trial in September 1994. He was convicted after a jury trial in which now-disgraced forensic pathologist [[Charles Randal Smith|Charles Smith]]'s evidence played a major role in determining the time of death, the cause of death, and whether the girl had been sexually assaulted. Mullins-Johnson had babysat Valin, 4, and her 3-year-old brother on the evening of June 26, 1993. When the girl's mother returned home, she did not check on her daughter. At 7 a.m. the next day she found Valin dead in bed.

A local pathologist performed an autopsy on Valin. Then "consultation reports" were sought from Smith and four other specialists, based on tissue samples and other evidence from the autopsy. Smith was the only consultant to conclude Valin was sexually assaulted at the time of death. That contradicted the defence's point that Valin, who had a history of vomiting in bed, might have died of natural causes. The jury convicted, which the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld in 1996. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed a further appeal in 1998.

Attempts were made to clear his name based on available DNA technology, but the tissue could not be located by Smith, who was given the evidence by the pathologist who did the autopsy, until 2005, 11 years after the trial, when the missing tissue samples turned up in Smith’s office. William Mullins-Johnson was released on bail in 2005, pending review of his case. On July 16, 2007, a report by three expert pathologists (written unbeknownst to the lawyers working on his behalf) determined there was no evidence that the girl was sexually assaulted, and the Ontario Attorney General [[Michael Bryant (politician)|Michael Bryant]] said that William Mullins-Johnson's conviction “cannot stand” and that he should be acquitted by the appeals court. On October 15, 2007 he was acquitted by the Ontario Court of Appeal.

In 2010, five years after filing a $13 million lawsuit for wrongful conviction, Mullins-Johnson and the [[Government of Ontario]] reached a $4.25 million [[Settlement (litigation)|out-of-court settlement]].

'''Paul Friedmann''' (1840 - c. 1900) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] and an early [[Zionist]].
==Biography==
Paul Friedmann was born in [[Koenigsberg]] to a Jewish family. &lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel'',Raphael Patai, New York 1971, vol. 1,  p.364.&lt;/ref&gt; He was related to [[Moses Mendelssohn]]. 

Much distressed over the fate of the [[Russian Jews]] after the persecutions of 1882-1890, in 1890 he visited the land of [[Midian]] and resolved to found a colony there. He had a [[steamboat|steam-yacht]] (''Israel'') built in [[Scotland]], and went to [[Krakow]] personally to select the first immigrants. Twenty-four of these, under the leadership of Friedmann, [[Baron von Seebach]], and Lieutenant Thiele, with a doctor, a chemist, and a builder, left [[Cairo]] in the middle of November, 1891.

A landing was made at [[Sharm al-Moza]] on the east side of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]; but the new colony did not last for more than two months. Internal dissensions broke out between the leaders, who were all [[Christianity|Christians]], and the Jews. The [[Egypt]]ian government also feared complications with the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] soldiers encamped not far off, and ordered the undertaking to be abandoned. Friedmann, who had sunk 170,000 [[German gold mark|marks]] in the project, brought suit against the Egyptian government for £25,000. The Russian consul in [[Cairo]] also opened an investigation, and violent denunciatory articles appeared in the Egyptian press, especially in connection with the death of one of the settlers who had been forced to leave the encampment because of insubordination. In connection with the venture, Friedmann privately published ''Das Land Madian'' (Berlin, 1891).

A doubles specialist, he won 2 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] men's doubles titles (1 [[Australian Open]] and 1 [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/pieter-aldrich/a066/titles-and-finals| title=Peter Aldrich &amp;#124; Titles and Finals &amp;#124; ATP World Tour &amp;#124; Tennis  |website=ATP World Tour |access-date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldrich reached the World No. 1 doubles ranking in 1990.

== Career ==
Aldrich won the first of 9 career doubles titles in 1988 at [[Charleston, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-07-08/sports/26236343_1_decomposed-body-guillermo-perez-roldan-pieter-aldrich |title=Starr Finds Son's Decomposed Body  |website=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=8 July 1988 |access-date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Aldrich won the men's doubles titles at both the Australian Open and the U.S. Open, partnering his fellow South African player [[Danie Visser]]. The pair were also doubles runners-up at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/scores/draws/archive/pdfs/players/7c29e190-9203-4d93-880c-034d8194287c_MD.pdf |title=Pieter Aldrich Gentlemen's Doubles Record  |website=Official Website of Wimbledon |access-date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1990 also saw Aldrich win his first (and only) top-level singles title at [[Newport, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/07/15/Aldrich-wins-Hall-of-Fame-tennis-tourney/3985648014400/ |title=Aldrich wins Hall of Fame tennis tourney  |website=United Press International |date=15 July 1990 |access-date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/16/sports/results-plus-790090.html |title=RESULTS PLUS  |website=The New York Times |date=16 July 1990 |access-date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His career-high ranking in singles was world No. 64, which he achieved in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/pieter-aldrich/a066/rankings-history |title=Peter Aldrich &amp;#124; Rankings History &amp;#124; ATP World Tour &amp;#124; Tennis |website=ATP World Tour|access-date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrich won the final doubles title of his career in 1992 in Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stevegtennis.com/draw-results/atp/Johannesburg/1992/#to_d |title=ATP Johannesburg Draw (Men's) - 1992 |website=Steve G Tennis |access-date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was considered to be the first "modern" artist from Indonesia (then [[Dutch East Indies]]), and his paintings corresponded with nineteenth-century romanticism which was popular in Europe at the time. He also expressed his cultural roots and inventiveness in his work.

==Early life==
Raden Saleh Syarif Bustaman was born in 1807 in [[Semarang]] on the island of [[Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (present-day [[Indonesia]]). He was born into a noble [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] family where his father was [[Sayyid]] Husen bin Alwi bin Awal bin Yahya, an Indonesian of Arab descent. He was the grandson of [[Sayyid]] Abdullah Bustaman maternally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Algadri, Hamid |year=1994|page=187|location=Jakarta, Indonesia|title=Dutch Policy against Islam and Indonesians of Arab Descent in Indonesia|publisher=LP3ES|isbn=979-8391-31-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGJwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=raden+saleh+bustaman&amp;dq=raden+saleh+bustaman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p9y5TaDnKOXdiAKunJAV&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raden Saleh has family connection to [[Habib Ali Kwitang]] through his sister, Roqayah, who once married to Abdurrahman (father of Ali Kwitang) but gave no offsprings.

==Travel to Europe==
[[File:Raden Saleh.jpg|thumb|upright|''Raden Saleh'', c. 1840, credited to [[Friedrich Carl Albert Schreuel]]]]
Young Raden Saleh was first taught in [[Bogor]] by the Belgian artist A.J. Payen. Payen acknowledged the youth's talent, and persuaded the colonial government of the Netherlands to send Raden Saleh to the Netherlands to study art. He arrived in Europe in 1829 and began to study under [[Cornelius Kruseman]] and [[Andreas Schelfhout]].

It was from Kruseman that Raden Saleh studied his skills in portraiture, and later was accepted at various European courts where he was assigned to do portraits. While in Europe, in 1836 Saleh became the first indigenous Indonesian to be initiated into [[Freemasonry]]. From 1839, he spent five years at the court of [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], who became an important patron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artdaily.com/news/37139/Rare-Work-by-Javanese-Artist-Raden-Saleh-to-be-Offered-at-Christie-s#.VOL5dShFV5gl Art Daily- Rare Work by Javanese Artist Raden Saleh to be Offered at Christie's] Retrieved February 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

From Schelfhout, Raden Saleh furthered his skills as a landscape painter. Raden Saleh visited several European cities, as well as Algiers. In [[The Hague]], a lion tamer allowed Raden Saleh to study his lion, and from that his most famous painting of animal fights was created, which subsequently brought fame to the artist. Many of his paintings were exhibited at the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam. Several of his paintings were destroyed when the Colonial Dutch pavilion in Paris was burnt in 1931.

==Return to Dutch East Indies==

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van de kunstschilder Raden Saleh. TMnr 60005151.jpg|thumb|upright|Raden Saleh in 1872]]
Raden Saleh returned to Dutch East Indies in 1852,&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;"Pioneer Between Worlds", ''National Geographic Indonesia'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} after living in Europe for 20 years. He worked as conservator for the colonial collection of government art and continued painting portraits of the Javanese aristocracy, and many more landscape paintings. Returning to Java, he expressed his uneasiness of living in the colonies, stating that "here, people only talks about coffee and sugar, then sugar and coffee" in one of his letters.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Upon returning, Saleh built a house in [[Cikini]] (now [[Cikini Hospital]]), based on the [[Callenberg Castle]] where he had stayed during his European travels {{circa}} 1844. Surrounded by vast grounds, most of them were converted into public gardens in 1862, and were closed in the turn of the century. In 1960, the [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]] was built in the former gardens. The house itself is still used today as a hospital.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|26}}

He married a young aristocratic woman of [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], Raden Ayu Danudirdja, in 1867 and subsequently moved to [[Bogor]], where he rented a house near the [[Bogor Botanical Gardens]] with a view of [[Mount Salak]]. He later took his wife to travel in Europe, visiting countries such as the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Italy. His wife however contracted an illness while in Paris, the exact illness is still not known, and was so severe that they both immediately returned to Bogor.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|30}} She died on 31 July 1880,&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|30}} following her husband's death three months earlier.

==Death==
On Friday morning, 23 April 1880, Saleh suddenly fell sick. He claimed that he was poisoned by one of his servants, but later examination showed that his blood flow was disrupted due to a clot near his heart. Saleh was buried two days later in Kampung Empang, Bogor. As reported in Javanese Bode newspaper, 28 April 1880, his funeral was "attended by various land lords and Dutch officials, and even by curious students from nearby school."&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|30}}

==Painting==
During his stay in Paris, Saleh met [[Horace Vernet]] whose painting frequently took themes of African wildlife. Compared to Vernet, Saleh's painting seems to be more influenced by the romantic painter [[Eugène Delacroix]]. This could be seen in one of Saleh's work, ''Hunting Lion'', 1840, which has similar composition to Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]''. However, Werner Kraus, a researcher in the Southeast-Asian Art Center of [[Passau]], German, said that Saleh "never mentioned Delacroix. Perhaps he saw Delacroix's, and possibly Vernet's, works during an exhibition."&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

===''The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro''===
[[File:Raden Saleh - Diponegoro arrest.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro]]'', 1857, [[Merdeka Palace|Merdeka Palace Museum]], Jakarta.]]
Raden Saleh is particularly remembered for his historical painting, ''The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro'',&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|26}} which depicted the betrayal of the rebel leader [[Prince Diponegoro]] by the colonial government, thus ending the [[Java War]] in 1830. The Prince was tricked into entering Dutch custody near [[Magelang]], believing he was there for negotiations of a possible cease-fire. He was captured through treachery and later deported.

The event had been previously painted by a Dutch painter [[Nicolaas Pieneman]], commissioned by Lieutenant General [[Hendrik Merkus de Kock]]. It is thought that Saleh saw this painting during his stay in Europe. Saleh made significant changes in his version of the painting; Pieneman painted the scene from the right, Saleh from the left. Pieneman depicts Diponegoro with resigned expression, while in Saleh's he appears to be outraged. Pieneman gave his painting the title ''Submission of Prince Diponegoro'', while Saleh gave ''The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro''. It is known that Saleh deliberately painted Diponegoro's Dutch captors with large heads to make them appear monstrous, as opposed to the more proportionally depicted Javanese.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|26}}

Raden Saleh’s work has been regarded as a sign of incipient nationalism in what was then the Dutch East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/08/02/raden-saleh-s-masterpieces-undergo-restoration.html|title=Raden Saleh’s masterpieces  to undergo restoration |author=Novia D. Rulistia |date=August 2, 2013 |work= |publisher= The Jakarta Post|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be seen it the depiction of Diponegoro's men. Pieneman had never been to the Indies, and so depicted Diponegoro's men in a more Arabic fashion. Saleh's version has a more accurate depiction of native Javanese clothing, with some figures wearing [[batik]] and [[blangkon]].

Saleh finished this painting in 1857 and presented it to [[William III of the Netherlands|Willem III of Netherlands]] in [[The Hague]]. It was returned to Indonesia in 1978 as a realization of a cultural agreement between the two countries in 1969, regarding the return of cultural items which were taken, lent, or exchanged to the Dutch in the previous eras. Even though the painting did not fall under any of those categories, because Saleh presented it to the King of the Netherlands and it was never in the possession of Indonesia, it was nevertheless returned as a gift from the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]], and is currently displayed at the [[Merdeka Palace]] Museum in [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|26}}

'''Raimundo Lida''' (1908–1979) was an [[Argentine]] philologist, philosopher of language, literary critic and essayist.  He specialised in [[Romance languages|Romance]] philology, aesthetics, the literature of the [[Spanish Golden Age]] and [[modernist literature]]. He taught at [[Harvard University]] from 1953, where he was chair of the department of Romance Languages.  The second of three children, his siblings were the [[hematologist]] Emilio Lida and [[María Rosa Lida de Malkiel]], also a philologist.

== Life ==
Lida was born to a Jewish family in [[Lviv|Lemberg]], the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Ukraine).  His parents took the family to [[Buenos Aires]] when he was a few months old. The family spoke [[Yiddish]] as a first language, but the children became assimilated. There he grew up and received a wholly secular education. His older brother Emilio became a hematologist and his younger sister Maria Rosa Lida also became a philologist.

In 1930 Lida became an Argentine citizen, after studying his high school at the Colegio Nacional Manuel Belgrano. He obtained a university degree in the Department of Philosophy and Literature at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], where he graduated in 1931.  He became a philologist under the influence of [[Amado Alonso]], his teacher and mentor. His interest in philosophy was influenced by [[Alejandro Korn]] and [[Francisco Romero (philosopher)|Francisco Romero]]. He gained his doctorate at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] with a dissertation on aesthetics and language of [[George Santayana|Santayana]], published in book form in 1943, by the University of Tucumán Press.

In 1931 he began working with Alonso and [[Pedro Henríquez Ureña]] at the Instituto de Filología, and was Assistant Editor of the "Revista de Filología Hiispánica". He also collaborated with Victoria Ocampo in "Sur", and in other literary reviews. Lida taught aesthetics and literature at the National University of La Plata, and Literature at the Instituto Superior del Profesorado Secundario and at the Colegio Libre de Estudios Superiores, in Buenos Aires.

&lt;!---
Al concluir  la carrera de Letras, en la Universidad de Buenos Aires, en 1931, ingresó al Instituto de Filología, donde fue colaborador muy cercano de [[Amado Alonso]] y de [[Pedro Henríquez Ureña]] en la Colección de Estudios Estilísticos y la Biblioteca de Dialectología Hispanoamericana. Fue Secretario de redacción de la ''Revista de Filología Hispánica''. Colaboró activamente con Victoria Ocampo en la revista ''Sur'', y en otras revistas culturales. Entre 1935 y 1947 fue profesor de Estética en la Universidad Nacional de la Plata, ''ad honorem'' y desde 1933 a 1947 enseñó en el Instituto Superior del Profesorado Secundario, en Buenos Aires.

En 1947, bajo el peronismo, se debió exiliar con su familia a México. Fue invitado por [[Alfonso Reyes]] a integrarse a [[El Colegio de México]], donde fundó la ''Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica'' y poco después el Centro de Estudios Lingüísticos y Literarios. También enseñó en la [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] y en el México City College, colaboró en ''Cuadernos Americanos'' y fundó la colección de Lengua y estudios literarios en el Fondo de Cultura Económica. En 1953 sucedió a su maestro A. Alonso en la [[Universidad de Harvard]], en la que llegó a ser jefe del departamento de Lenguas Romances. En 1968 fue nombrado Smith Professor of French and Spanish Literatures. Fue profesor invitado en diversas universidades de Estados Unidos. En 1958 se naturalizó estadounidense.

Entre las distinciones recibidas se cuentan el Master in Arts Honoris Causa, Harvard (1954) y la beca Guggenheim (1939 y 1960); fue elegido miembro de la American Academy of Arts and Sciences(1970) y de la [[Academia Argentina de Letras]] (1975), entre otros. Además de sus publicaciones, fue traductor al castellano de obras científicas y literarias; entre otros de [[Moritz Geiger]], [[Karl Vossler]], [[Helmut Hatzfeld]], [[G. Santayana]], [[W. Dilthey]], [[C. G. Jung]] y [[Leo Spitzer]].

Casó en primeras nupcias con la profesora en filosofía, Leonor García (Buenos Aires, 1908-1998), madre de sus hijos Fernando (n. 1936, Buenos Aires) y [[Clara Lida]] (n. 1941, Buenos Aires). Su segunda esposa fue la hispanista Denah Levy Lida (Nueva York, 1923-Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2007), profesora de la Brandeis University y autora de importantes trabajos sobre B. Pérez Galdós y el refranero sefardí.
---&gt;
In 1947, to escape the conditions under [[Juan Peron]], he took his family into exile in Mexico. He was invited by [[Alfonso Reyes]] to  [[El Colegio de México]], where he founded the foremost scholarly journal, ''Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica'', and the  Center for Linguistic and Literary Studies.

In 1953, Lida succeeded his former professor Amado Alonso, who had been teaching at Harvard University since 1946.  Lida became chair of the department of Romance Languages and held the Smith Chair. In addition to his own work, he published translations in Spanish of a range of scientific, philosophical and literary works, by such authors as [[Moritz Geiger]], [[Karl Vossler]], [[Helmut Hatzfeld]], [[George Santayana]], [[W. Dilthey]] and [[Leo Spitzer]].

In 1958 he became a naturalized US citizen.

After many disagreements with the management and group members, Williams left Take That in 1995 to launch a solo career, in which all but one of his 11 studio albums reached [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|number one]] in the UK. Williams also released seven number-one singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top40.about.com/od/artistsls/p/robbiewilliams.htm |title=Robbie Williams Profile |publisher=Top40.about.com |date=13 February 1974 |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014084438/http://top40.about.com/od/artistsls/p/robbiewilliams.htm |archivedate=14 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2010, he rejoined Take That.

==Early life==
Williams was born on 13 February 1974 in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], Staffordshire, England. His parents, Janet (''[[née]]'' Farrell) and Peter Williams (also known as Pete Conway), ran a pub called the Red Lion in [[Burslem]], before his father became the licensee at the [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale FC]] Social Club; this led to Williams' lifelong affinity for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherwin|first=Phil|title=The Port Vale Miscellany|publisher=The History Press|location=Brimscombe Port|year=2010|page=10|isbn=978-0-7524-5777-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather was Irish and hailed from [[Kilkenny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://kclr96fm.com/news/robbie-williams-grandfather-came-from-kilkenny/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915121421/http://kclr96fm.com/news/robbie-williams-grandfather-came-from-kilkenny/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 September 2012 |title=Robbie Williams grandfather came from Kilkenny |publisher=KCLR96FM |date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams attended [[St Margaret Ward Catholic School]] in [[Tunstall, Staffordshire|Tunstall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/news/Robbie-doing-kids-awards/article-339261-detail/article.html | title=Robbie doing it for the kids with awards | date=19 September 2008 | publisher=''[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]'' | accessdate=8 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before attending dance school UKDDF in Tunstall. He participated in several school plays, and his biggest role was that of the [[Artful Dodger]] in a production of ''[[Oliver!]]'', the musical adaptation of the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/northern-advocate/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503444&amp;objectid=11004700 “Robbie Williams: The ego has flown”].

==Take That==
{{Main|Take That}}

===1990–1995: first stint===

In 1990, the sixteen-year-old Williams was the youngest member to join Take That. According to the documentary ''[[Take That: For the Record]]'', his mother read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested that he try out for the group. He met fellow member [[Mark Owen]] on the day of his audition/interview with [[Nigel Martin-Smith]]. Although the majority of the group's material was written and performed by [[Gary Barlow]], Williams performed lead vocals on their first Top Ten hit "[[Could It Be Magic]]", "[[I Found Heaven]]", and "[[Everything Changes (Take That song)|Everything Changes]]". However, he had conflicts with Martin-Smith over the restrictive rules for Take That members, and he began drinking more [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and dabbling in [[cocaine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1479447/Robbie-Drugs-gave-me-best-times-of-my-life.html “Robbie: 'Drugs gave me best times of my life']. The Telegraph. Retrieved 14 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1994, Williams's drug abuse had escalated; he a had near drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]].&lt;ref name="Robbie Williams early career"&gt;{{cite web|title=Robbie Williams early career|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Williams,_Robbie/Biography/|work=Discographies, biographies, news|publisher=StarPulse.com|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary ''For the Record'', he was unhappy with his musical ideas not being taken seriously by lead singer Barlow and Martin-Smith; his desire to explore [[hip hop]] and [[rap (music)|rap]] conflicted with the Take That's usual ballads. Barlow explained in interviews that Williams had given up trying to offer creative input.

Noting Williams' increasingly belligerent behaviour and poor attendance at rehearsals, and worried that he might drop out during the group's upcoming tour, Orange and Barlow took their concerns to Martin-Smith. During one of the last rehearsals before the tour commenced, the three confronted Williams about his attitude and stated they wanted to do the tour without him. He agreed to quit and left the group in July 1995; it would be the last time for twelve years that they were all together. Despite the departure of Williams, Take That completed their [[Nobody Else Tour]] as a four-piece. They later disbanded on 13 February 1996, Williams's 22nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/broken-promises-as-take-that-can-take-no-more-1318879.html “Broken promises as Take That can take no more”]. Independent. Retrieved 14 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, Williams was photographed by the press partying with the members of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] at [[Glastonbury Festival]]. Following his departure, he became the subject of talk shows and newspapers as he acknowledged his plans to become a solo singer, and he was spotted partying with [[George Michael]] in France. However, a clause in his Take That contract prohibited him from releasing any material until after the group was officially dissolved, and he was later sued by Martin-Smith and forced to pay $200,000 in commission. After various legal battles over his right to a solo career, Williams succeeded in getting released from his contract with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. On 27 June 1996, Williams signed with [[Chrysalis Records]].

===2009–present: second stint===

By March 2009, Williams had shown interest in rejoining [[Take That]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/5058174/Robbie-Williams-ready-to-rejoin-Take-That.html |title=Telegraph.co.cuk|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=23 December 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the band completed their [[The Circus Live]] without him. In spite of rumours that Williams was working in [[New York City|New York]] with Take That in September that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/robbie-williams/47535 |title=Robbie Williams and Take That reunite in New York studio? &amp;#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the day of the [[Children in Need]] charity concert at [[The Royal Albert Hall]] in November they were still performing separately. However, both did join with the other acts in the final song of the evening, with Williams putting his arm around Gary Barlow and singing "[[Hey Jude]]".

On 15 July 2010, Williams reconciled with his former colleaguess and rejoined Take That. In November 2010 the Take That album ''[[Progress (Take That album)|Progress]]'' was released, becoming the fastest selling album since 2000 and the second fastest selling album in UK history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestudentpocketguide.com/interviews/Take_That |title=Take That Interview &amp;#124; Student Pocket Guide Online: |publisher=Thestudentpocketguide.com |accessdate=2 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930032541/http://www.thestudentpocketguide.com/interviews/Take_That |archivedate=30 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group traveled across the UK on their [[Progress Live]] tour, which included eight nights at [[Wembley Stadium]] in London,&lt;ref name="wembleystadium.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wembleystadium.com/pressbox/pressReleases/take-that-sold-out |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228171126/http://www.wembleystadium.com/pressbox/pressReleases/take-that-sold-out |archivedate=28 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then continued across Europe. The tour was the fastest selling in UK history with ticket hotlines and websites crashing under the demand.&lt;ref name="wembleystadium.com"/&gt;

In August 2012, Take That performed at the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. Williams was due to perform with Take That but missed the performance because his wife gave birth at around the same time; the group performed as a four-piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Martinovic|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a386293/take-that-george-michael-to-feature-in-london-2012-closing-ceremony.html |title=Take That, George Michael to feature in London 2012 closing ceremony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although still officially part of the Take That,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2017/0319/860909-barlow/|title=Barlow says Robbie can return to Take That any time|date=19 March 2017|work=RTE.ie|access-date=20 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams chose not to return for group's [[III (Take That album)|seventh]] and [[Wonderland (Take That album)|eighth]] studio albums and their accompanying tours, focusing instead on his solo commitments. He continued to write music with his colleagues and performed with the group on several occasions since 2011's Progress tour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37907388|title=Take That join Robbie at Brits gig|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=8 November 2016|work=BBC News|access-date=20 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans on returning for a full tour to celebrate Take That's 25th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/lorraine/news/a845330/robbie-williams-take-that-reunion-details-wrong/|title=Robbie reveals he got Take That reunion details wrong|date=13 December 2017|work=Digital Spy|access-date=20 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solo career==

===1996–1998: ''Life thru a Lens'' and ''I've Been Expecting You''===
{{Main|Life thru a Lens|I've Been Expecting You}}
After leaving Take That, Williams launched his solo career starting off in 1996 by covering [[George Michael]]'s "[[Freedom (Robbie Williams song)|Freedom]]", the single reached number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="8notes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8notes.com/biographies/robbie_williams.asp |title=Robbie Williams |publisher=8notes.com |accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordings for Williams's first album began at London's Maison Rouge studios in March 1997. Shortly after his introduction to [[Guy Chambers]], Williams released "[[Old Before I Die]]" which would be the first single taken from his debut album. The single reached number two on the UK Charts;&lt;ref name="8notes" /&gt; however, it was largely ignored on international charts. His debut album, ''[[Life thru a Lens]]'', was released in September 1997. The album launched with his first live solo gig at the [[Élysée Montmartre]] theatre in Paris, France. The album debuted at number eleven on the [[UK Albums Chart]].

Williams released what would be the fourth single taken from his album. "Angels" became Williams' best-seller in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="BPI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&amp;r_id=27952 |title=Award Certification for "Angels" |publisher=BPI |accessdate=4 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080103043315/http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&amp;r_id=27952 |archivedate = 3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song, apart from becoming a hit around Europe and Latin America, caused sales of his album to skyrocket.

A cover of a track from [[World Party]]'s album, ''Egyptology'', became Williams' second number one hit in the UK.&lt;ref name="UK Top 40 Database" /&gt; Williams finished the year with a European Tour late in 1999.

He took two weeks off from his tour to record ''[[Swing When You're Winning]]'', his fourth studio album. Born from his lifelong love for [[Frank Sinatra]]{{spaced ndash}}combined with the success of the track "[[Have You Met Miss Jones?]]" that he recorded for the film ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones' Diary]]'' in 2001{{spaced ndash}}the album was recorded at [[Capitol Studios]] in Los Angeles.

Williams took the chance to duet with his long-time friend [[Jonathan Wilkes]], ''Little Voice'' star [[Jane Horrocks]], ''Saturday Night Live'' star [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Rupert Everett]] and actress [[Nicole Kidman]]. The first single released from the album was a duet with Kidman, on "[[Somethin' Stupid]]".

===2002–2005: ''Escapology'' and ''Intensive Care''===
{{Main|Escapology (album)|Greatest Hits (Robbie Williams album)|Intensive Care (album)}}
In 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking £80&amp;nbsp;million contract with EMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robbie signs '£80m' deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2291605.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=2 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract included a number of provisos, including the label ceding greater creative control to the artist and a commitment to breaking Williams into the US market. So far it is the biggest music deal in British history. The deal was brokered by [[Ingenious Media]], a UK corporate finance advisory business. Williams began working on what would be his fifth studio album, spending a year in the recording studio. The album heralded a new era for Williams. He had taken a more active role in the making of this album.  "One Fine Day", "Nan's Song", and "[[Come Undone (Robbie Williams song)|Come Undone]]" were the first songs that Williams wrote without the input of Guy Chambers. Most of the songs were recorded in Los Angeles.

The album's first single, "[[Feel (Robbie Williams song)|Feel]]", written by Williams and Chambers, was recorded as a demo. When they started working on the album and were trying to re-record the vocals, Williams felt unsatisfied with it, so he decided to include the demo version and then release it as the first single. When the single was released in late 2002, it became Williams' biggest international hit, going number one in The Netherlands and Italy, as well as reaching the top ten in many European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robbie Williams – Feel (Single) |url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Robbie+Williams&amp;titel=Feel&amp;cat=s |publisher=GfK Dutch Charts |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Williams' fifth studio album, ''[[Escapology (album)|Escapology]]'', was released in late 2002, it hit number one in at least 10 countries around the world.

In October 2004, Williams released, ''[[Greatest Hits (Robbie Williams album)|Greatest Hits]]'', a retrospective of his career, and also, to reveal the new tracks he had been working on with the then-new collaborator, [[Stephen Duffy]]. "[[Radio (Robbie Williams song)|Radio]]", the compilation's first single, debuted at number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]]&lt;ref name="UK Top 40 Database" /&gt; (becoming Williams' sixth number-one hit). When the compilation was later released it debuted at number one in the UK&lt;ref name="UK Top 40 Database" /&gt; and was the best selling album of the year in the UK&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk" /&gt; and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/plat2006.html |title=IFPI Platinum Europe Awards – 2006 |publisher=IFPI |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years after the release of "Angels", the British public voted it as the "Best Single of the Past Twenty-Five Years" at the [[2005 Brit Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/news/brits2005/wdyt_2.shtml |title=Brits25: Did your favourites get awards? |publisher=BBC |date=9 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After touring Latin America in late 2004 for the promotion ''Greatest Hits'', Williams started working on his sixth studio album. Recorded at his house in the [[Hollywood Hills]], the album was co-written by [[Stephen Duffy]] over the course of 24 months. The album ''[[Intensive Care (album)|Intensive Care]]'' was launched in Berlin on 9 October. It became an international hit. In November 2005, Williams took home the [[MTV Europe Music Awards|MTV Europe Music Award]] for 'Best Male', but also, entered in ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'' when he announced his World Tour for 2006, selling 1.6&amp;nbsp;million tickets in one single day.&lt;ref name="sp-13394"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Robbie-Williams-Enters-The-Guinness-Book-of-World-Records-13394.shtml |title=Robbie Williams Enters The Guinness Book of World Records |date=26 November 2005 |publisher=Softpedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006151507/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Robbie-Williams-Enters-The-Guinness-Book-of-World-Records-13394.shtml |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams kicked off his ''[[Close Encounters Tour|Close Encounters World Tour]]'' in South Africa in April 2006, when he finished his European leg of the tour. 2.5&amp;nbsp;million people had seen the show, and after touring Latin America and Australia the numbers went up to 3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Time |url=http://www.emimusic.com.mx/portal/hgxpp001.aspx?{{formatnum:224135}},O,S,0,PAG;CONC;26;2;D;372970;1;PAG;, |title=EMI Music Mexico |publisher=Emimusic.com.mx |accessdate=23 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019102950/http://www.emimusic.com.mx/portal/hgxpp001.aspx?%7B%7Bformatnum%3A224135%7D%7D%2CO%2CS%2C0%2CPAG%3BCONC%3B26%3B2%3BD%3B372970%3B1%3BPAG%3B%2C |archivedate=19 October 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams released his much anticipated dance/electro album, ''[[Rudebox (album)|Rudebox]]'', on 23 October 2006. It featured collaborations with the [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[William Orbit]], Soul Mekanik, [[Joey Negro]], [[Mark Ronson]], Chris Grierson, and The Orr Boys. It received mixed reviews: Allmusic gave it a four star rating, the ''[[NME]]'' 8 out of 10, and Music Week and MOJO were equally positive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/robbie-williams/8052 |title=NME Magazine on "Rudebox" |work=NME |location=UK  |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it received much weaker reviews from some of the British press. The album sold 2x Platinum in Europe with sales of over 2&amp;nbsp;million making it the fastest platinum-selling album of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/plat2006.html |title=IFPI Certifications, November 2006 |publisher=Ifpi.org |date=1 September 2005 |accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote his album, Williams commissioned a series of short films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=2&amp;subID=1514 |title=Goodbye to the hard sell |publisher=Thefirstpost.co.uk |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=23 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011164546/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=2&amp;subID=1514 |archivedate=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Goodbye to the Normals'' was directed by [[Jim Field Smith]] and features "Burslem Normals" by Williams.

Rumours of a new studio album co-written with Guy Chambers surfaced in early 2007, along with known commitments required by Williams to his EMI contract. British singer-songwriter [[Laura Critchley]] commented that she had sung vocals for three songs, and said that it would not be released until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Three WAGs on Rob's bed |author=Dominik Lemanski |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/16180/Three-WAGs-on-Rob-s-bed/ |work=Daily Star |date=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, it was confirmed that Williams had written material with Guy Chambers and [[Mark Ronson]]. A spokesman said that Williams was planning to begin the recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009. This will probably be the last Williams album released by EMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/28/robbie-williams-album-mark-ronson |title=robbie williams album-mark ronson |work=The Guardian |date= 28 January 2009|accessdate=23 December 2009 | location=London | first=Sean | last=Michaels}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his official website, Williams confirmed that he was working with producer [[Trevor Horn]] on his new album, which would eventually be titled ''[[Reality Killed the Video Star]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.it/music/inuscita/dischi_all.asp |title=New album title – Page 4 |publisher=MTV |accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the song "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]" by Horn's former band [[The Buggles]].

[[File:Robbiein2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Williams performing at the [[Sydney Super Dome]] in 2009]]
In October 2010, Williams released his second greatest hits album, ''[[In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010]]'', to celebrate 20 years as a performing artist. A single, "[[Shame (Robbie Williams song)|Shame]]", was also released, which was written and sung by Williams and Barlow.

On 21 October 2011 Williams signed with [[Island Records]] ([[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]]), following his departure from his previous record label EMI in 2010.

Williams was the opening act at the [[Diamond Jubilee Concert]], which was co-organised by [[Gary Barlow]], held outside [[Buckingham Palace]] on 4 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robbie Williams opens Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9311358/Robbie-Williams-opens-Queens-Diamond-Jubilee-concert.html |work=The Telegraph |date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the end of August his official website began a countdown to the release of information regarding his latest solo material, with an image of his face and his mind unveiled daily as the countdown expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/86107/Robbie-Williams-Teases-New-Single-Losers |title=Robbie Williams Teases New Single 'Losers' – Celebrity News, Hollywood Gossip &amp; Photos, Movie Reviews, Competitions |publisher=Entertainmentwise |date=28 August 2012 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''[[Take the Crown (album)|Take the Crown]]'', the album debuted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] making it Williams' tenth number one album. It also marked the second time that Williams had a number one single ("Candy") and album at the same time on the chart. The first time was in 2001 when "[[Somethin' Stupid]]" and ''[[Swing When You're Winning]]'' were number one on the singles and albums chart respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/robbie-williams-crowned-king-of-the-charts-with-number-1-single-and-album-1701/ |title=Robbie Williams crowned king of the charts with Number 1 single and al |publisher=Officialcharts.com |accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saad Eddin Ibrahim''' ({{lang-arz|سعد الدين إبراهيم}}, {{IPA-arz|ˈsæʕd edˈdiːn ebɾˤɑˈhiːm|IPA}}) (born 31 December 1938) is an [[Egyptian American]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] and author. He is one of Egypt's leading [[human rights]] and [[democracy]] activists, and a strong critic of former Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]].

==Biography==

Born in Bedeen, [[Mansoura]], [[Egypt]], Ibrahim is credited for playing a leading role in the revival of Egypt's contemporary research-based [[civil society]] movement. For most of his professional career Saad Eddin Ibrahim was a professor of sociology at the [[American University in Cairo]].  He is the founder of both the [[Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies]] in [[Cairo]] and the [[Arab Organization for Human Rights]]. He is married to Barbara Lethem Ibrahim. [[Barbara Ibrahim]] is the director of the Gerhart Center for Civic Engagement and Philanthropy in [[Cairo]]. The Ibrahims have two children, Randa and Amir Ibrahim. Randa has two kids Lara and Seif, and Amir has Adam and Gebriel.

Well before his confrontations with the Egyptian government in the early 2000s, Ibrahim had become a controversial figure in Egypt. He reversed his earlier criticism of [[Anwar Sadat]] for his peace initiative with Israel. He gained the respect of Egypt's human rights and civil society community for championing different causes, including [[Copts]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]s. and other minorities at a time of rising sectarian tensions.

Ibrahim was arrested, imprisoned and prosecuted in 2000 for using [[European Union]] funds for [[election monitor]]ing, and for allegedly defaming Egypt's image abroad.  He was sentenced to seven years in prison.  His defense team countered that the real motives behind the government's prosecution of Ibrahim and his assistants was his outspoken criticism of President Hosni Mubarak and his administration. He was tried twice on the same charges in State Security Courts, winning each time on appeal. During a third trial before the highest civil court in 2003, he was cleared of all charges and released, but not before a storm of international protest had put the Mubarak regime on the defensive.

As an independent-minded intellectual, Ibrahim has supported fair elections when they were viewed as incompatible with Egyptian politics, promoted international democratic alliances, and accepted NGO funding from any source that shares peaceful and democratic values, including those in the US.  He has recently been under attack in the official press for calling on the U.S. Congress to condition its military aid to Egypt on improvements in the country's human rights record and the freeing of another [[political prisoner]], [[Ayman Nour]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Al-Ahram|Al-Ahram Weekly]],'' June 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Ibrahim was awarded the Ion Ratiu Democracy Lecture Prize at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, where he previously had been a public policy scholar. He is currently a Board member of the [[Arab Democracy Foundation]].

Ibrahim taught sociology at Indiana's [[DePauw University]] from 1967 to 1974. During the academic year 2008-2009, Ibrahim lived in the United States as a professor of political sociology at Indiana University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.depauw.edu/news/index.asp?id=22189|title=Newspaper Profiles Former Prof. Saad Ibrahim, Among World's "Most Prominent Human Rights Activists" - DePauw University|work=DePauw University|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a visiting fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Harvard University.  Ibrahim is currently the Wallerstein Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Drew University Center on Religion, Culture &amp; Conflict &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drew.edu/crcc/about-the-center|title=About the Center {{!}} Center on Religion, Culture &amp; Conflict {{!}} Drew University|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Madison, New Jersey.

==Sentence==

On 2 August 2008, an [[Egyptian Judicial System|Egyptian court]] sentenced Ibrahim to two years of prison for 'defaming Egypt'. He was granted a bail of 10,000 Egyptian pounds (US$1,890) and his lawyer expressed his will to appeal. It is reported that Ibrahim is currently in exile outside of Egypt, to avoid probable arrest upon his return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Sources close to Ibrahim reported that he also feared assassination upon his return to Egypt. Despite these concerns, however, on Wednesday, August 5, 2010 Ibrahim [http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/prominent-activist-returns-cairo returned] to Cairo for a visit with his family. He was greeted warmly by friends, family and supporters at Cairo Airport. In view of persistent reports of the failing health of Hosni Mubarak, growing tensions over presidential succession in Egypt and then upcoming October, 2010 elections for the Majlis al-Sha'ab (People's Assembly), supporters of Ibrahim were concerned about his safety.

As of summer 2012 Ibrahim was living in Cairo and running the Ibn Khaldun Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/morsis-bloodless-coup-spikes-the-armys-guns|title=Morsi's bloodless coup spikes the army's guns|work=The National|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the [[University of Ljubljana]]  and international director of the [[Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities]] of the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/bih/aboutus/staff/zizek|title=Slavoj Zizek - International Director — The Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, Birkbeck, University of London|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He works in subjects including [[continental philosophy]], [[political theory]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[film criticism]], [[Marxism]], [[Hegelianism]] and [[theology]].

In 1989, Žižek published his first English text, ''[[The Sublime Object of Ideology]]'', in which he departed from traditional [[Marxist]] theory to develop a [[materialist]] conception of [[ideology]] that drew heavily on [[Lacanian psychoanalysis]] and [[Hegelian idealism]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Slavoj-Zizek|title=Slavoj Zizek - Slovene philosopher and cultural theorist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;"Slavoj Žižek," by Matthew Sharpe, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISSN|2161-0002}}, http://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/. 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His early theoretical work became increasingly eclectic and political in the 1990s, dealing frequently in the critical analysis of disparate forms of popular culture and making him a popular figure of the academic [[leftism|left]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Boyle.

===Education===
In 1967, during an era of [[liberalization]] in [[Titoism|Titoist]] Yugoslavia, Žižek enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]] and studied philosophy and sociology.&lt;ref name="lacan.com"&gt;Tony Meyers [http://www.lacan.com/zizekchro1.htm Slavoj Zizek - His Life] lacan.com, from: Slavoj Zizek, London: Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had already begun reading French [[Structuralism|structuralists]] prior to entering university, and in 1967 he published the first translation of a text by [[Jacques Derrida]] into Slovenian.&lt;ref name="mladina.si 42"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200442/clanek/nar-kdo_je_kdaj--ursa_matos/ |title= Tednik, številka 42, Slavoj Žižek |publisher= Mladina.Si |date= 24 October 2004 |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mladina.si 42"/&gt; 
An early influence at university, [[Božidar Debenjak]], taught the philosophy of [[German idealism]] and introduced the thought of the [[Frankfurt School]] to Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dpu.mirovni-institut.si/9letnik/debenjak.php |title= Delavsko-punkerska univerza |publisher= Dpu.mirovni-institut.si |date= 22 February 1999 |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debenjak's reading of Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]'' from the perspective of Hegel's '' [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' influenced many future Slovenian philosophers, including Žižek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200904/dr__bozidar_debenjak__filozof |title= Tednik, številka 04, Dr. Božidar Debenjak, filozof |publisher= Mladina.Si |date= 6 February 2009 |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek frequented the circles of dissident intellectuals, including the [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]] philosophers [[Tine Hribar]] and [[Ivo Urbančič]],&lt;ref name="mladina.si 42"/&gt; and published articles in alternative magazines, such as ''[[Praxis School|Praxis]]'', ''Tribuna'' and ''Problemi'', which he also edited.&lt;ref name=slovenskapomlad/&gt; In 1971 he accepted a job as an assistant researcher with the promise of tenure, but was dismissed after his Master's thesis was denounced by the authorities of being "non-Marxist".&lt;ref name="p37"&gt;Žižek's response to the article "Če sem v kaj resnično zaljubljena, sem v življenje Sobotna priloga Dela, p. 37 (19.1. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the University of Ljubljana in 1981 with a [[Doctor of Arts]] in Philosophy for his dissertation entitled ''The Theoretical and Practical Relevance of French Structuralism''.&lt;ref name="lacan.com"/&gt;

He spent the next few years undertaking [[national service]] in the [[Yugoslav army]] in [[Karlovac]].&lt;ref name="lacan.com"/&gt;

===Career===
During the 1980s, Žižek edited and translated [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dskp-drustvo.si/prevajalci.php |title=Prevajalci&amp;nbsp;– Društvo slovenskih književnih prevajalcev |publisher=Dskp-drustvo.si |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105042135/http://www.dskp-drustvo.si/prevajalci.php |archivedate=5 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used Jacques Lacan's work to interpret [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] and Marxist philosophy.

In 1985, Žižek completed a second doctorate ([[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[psychoanalysis]]) at the [[University of Paris VIII]]&lt;ref name="lacan.com"/&gt; under [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] and [[François Regnault]].

He wrote the introduction to Slovene translations of [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s and [[John Le Carré]]'s detective novels.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} 
In 1988, he published his first book dedicated entirely to [[film theory]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He achieved international recognition as a [[Social theory|social theorist]] with the 1989 publication of his first book in English, ''The Sublime Object of Ideology''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Žižek has been publishing in journals such as ''[[Lacanian Ink]]'' and ''[[In These Times]]'' in the United States, the ''[[New Left Review]]'' and ''[[The London Review of Books]]'' in the United Kingdom, and with the Slovenian [[Social liberalism|left-liberal]] magazine ''[[Mladina]]'' and newspapers ''[[Dnevnik (Ljubljana)|Dnevnik]]'' and ''[[Delo]]''. He also cooperates with the Polish leftist magazine ''[[Krytyka Polityczna]]'', regional southeast European left-wing journal ''[[Novi Plamen]]'', and serves on the editorial board of the psychoanalytical journal ''Problemi''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Žižek is a series editor of the [[Northwestern University Press]] series Diaeresis that publishes works that "deal not only with philosophy, but also will intervene at the levels of ideology critique, politics, and art theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diaeresis series page|url=http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/diaeresis|website=Northwestern University Press|publisher=Northwestern University Press|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
In the late 1980s, Žižek came to public attention as a columnist for the alternative youth magazine ''[[Mladina]]'', which was critical of Tito's policies, Yugoslav politics, especially the [[militarization]] of society. He was a member of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] until October 1988, when he quit in protest against the [[JBTZ trial]] together with 32 other Slovenian intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=103 |title=Skupinski protestni izstop iz ZKS |date=28 October 1998 |publisher=Slovenska Pomlad |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180147/http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=103 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1988 and 1990, he was actively involved in several political and [[civil society]] movements which fought for the [[democratization]] of Slovenia, most notably the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=31&amp;aofs=3 |title=Odbor za varstvo človekovih pravic |date=3 June 1998 |publisher=Slovenska Pomlad |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180306/http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=31&amp;aofs=3 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Slovenian presidential election, 1990|first free elections]] in 1990, he ran as the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democratic Party]]'s candidate for Slovenian presidency (an office formally abolished in the [[Constitution of Slovenia|1991 constitution]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Despite his activity in liberal democratic projects, Žižek has remained committed to the communist ideal and has been critical of right-wing circles, such as nationalists, [[Conservatism|conservatives]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] both in Slovenia and worldwide. He wrote that the [[Cankar Hall|convention center]] in which nationalist [[Slovene writers]] hold their conventions should be blown up, adding, "Since we live in the time without any sense of irony, I must add I don't mean it literally."&lt;ref name="Interview_part_two"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6FZv9WUfX?url=http://www.delo.si/zgodbe/sobotnapriloga/slavoj-zizek-bog-daj-da-bi-ciniki-na-oblasti-res-vedeli-kaj-pocnejo.html Interview] with Žižek – part two, [[Delo]], 2 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he jokingly made the following comment in May 2013, during [[Subversive Festival]]: "If they don't support [[SYRIZA]], then, in my vision of the democratic future, all these people will get from me [is] a first-class one-way ticket to [a] [[gulag]]."

In a 2008 interview with [[Amy Goodman]] on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', he described himself as a "communist in a qualified sense," and in another appearance in October 2009 he described himself as a "radical leftist."&lt;ref name="democracynow.org"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/11/everybody_in_the_world_except_us ''Democracy Now!'' television program online transcript], 11 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/15/slovenian_philosopher_slavoj_zizek_on_the |title=Slovenian Philosopher Slavoj Zizek on Capitalism, Healthcare, Latin American "Populism" and the "Farcical" Financial Crisis |publisher=Democracynow.org |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Žižek appeared in the [[Arte]] documentary ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'' in which he defended the idea of communism.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In 2013, he corresponded with imprisoned Russian activist and [[Pussy Riot]] member [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]].&lt;ref name="Guardian, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot's prison letters to Slavoj Žižek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot's prison letters to Slavoj Žižek|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/15/pussy-riot-nadezhda-tolokonnikova-slavoj-zizek}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=All hearts were beating for you as long as you were perceived as just another version of the liberal-democratic protest against the authoritarian state.

Just before the [[2017 French presidential election]], Žižek stated that one could not choose between [[Emmanuel Macron|Macron]] and [[Marine Le Pen|Le Pen]], arguing that the [[neoliberalism]] of Macron just gives rise to [[neo-fascism|neofascism]] anyway. This was in response to many on the left calling for support for Macron to prevent a Le Pen victory.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, Slavoj (3 May 2017).

In 2003, Žižek wrote text to accompany [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]]'s photographs in a catalog for [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]]. Questioned as to the seemliness of a major intellectual writing ad copy, Žižek told ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', "If I were asked to choose between doing things like this to earn money and becoming fully employed as an American academic, kissing ass to get a tenured post, I would with pleasure choose writing for such journals!"&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Joshua.

Žižek and his thought have been the subject of several documentaries. The 1996 ''[[Liebe Dein Symptom wie Dich selbst!]]'' is a German documentary on him. In the 2004 ''[[The Reality of the Virtual]]'', Žižek gave a one-hour lecture on his interpretation of Lacan's tripartite thesis of the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} ''[[Zizek!]]'' is a 2005 documentary by [[Astra Taylor]] on his philosophy. The 2006 ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]''  and 2012 ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Ideology]]''  also portray Žižek's ideas and cultural criticism. ''[[Examined Life]]'' (2008) features Žižek speaking about his conception of [[ecology]] at a garbage dump. He was also featured in the 2011 ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'', directed by [[Jason Barker]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

# Against [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of ideology as described in ''[[The German Ideology]]'', [[false consciousness]] prevents people from seeing how things really are. Building upon Althusser, ideology is thoroughly unconscious and functions as a series of justifications and [[Spontaneous order|spontaneous]] socio-symbolic rituals which support virtual authorities.
# [[The Real]] is not experienced as something which is ordered in a way that gives satisfactory meaning to all its parts in relation to one another. Instead the Real is experienced as through the lens of hegemonic systems of representation and reproduction, while resisting full inscription into ordering system ascribed to it. This in turn may lead subjects to experience the Real as generating political resistance.

Drawing on Lacan's notion of the barred subject, the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] is a purely negative [[entity]], a void of negativity (in the Hegelian sense), which allows for the flexibility and reflexivity of the Cartesian [[Cogito ergo sum|cogito]] (transcendental subject).&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinnerbrink2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|title=The Hegelian 'Night of the World': Žižek on Subjectivity, Negativity, and Universality|journal=International Journal of Žižek Studies|year=2008|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://zizekstudies.org/index.php/ijzs/article/view/136|accessdate=17 August 2012|issn=1751-8229|quote=This extraordinary analysis of the transcendental imagination, critique of Heidegger, and rereading of Hegelian 'night of the world,' together contribute to a reassertion of the radicality of the 'Cartesian subject'—that thoroughly repudiated theoretical spectre which nonetheless continues to 'haunt Western academia' (1999: 1–5). This unorthodox reading of the Hegelian 'night of the world'—the radical negativity that haunts subjectivity—is developed further in an explicitly political direction, which helps explain a critique of the 'Fukuyamaian' consensus, shared both by moral-religious conservatives and libertarian 'postmodernists', that global capitalism remains the 'unsurpassable horizon of our times'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though consciousness is opaque (following Hegel), the epistemological gap between the In-itself and For-itself is immanent to reality itself;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Umbr(a): The Object|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k7QbBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Umbr(a) Journal|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9780979953965|first = Tom|last = Eyers|first2 = Graham|last2 = Harman|first3 = Adrian|last3 = Johnston|first4 = Guy Le|last4 = Gaufey|first5 = Todd|last5 = McGowan|first6 = Duane|last6 = Rousselle|first7 = Jelica Šumič|last7 = Riha|first8 = Rado|last8 = Riha}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kant's antinomies|antinomies]] of Kant, [[quantum physics]], and [[Alain Badiou]]'s 'materialist' principle that 'The One is Not', point towards an inconsistent ("Barred") Real itself (that Lacan conceptualized prior).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FAqM5rxWWKwC|publisher = Verso Books|date = 2012-05-22|isbn = 9781844679027|first = Slavoj|last = Zizek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are multiple Symbolic interpretations of the Real, they are not all relatively "true". Two instances of the Real can be identified: the abject Real (or "real Real"), which cannot be wholly integrated into the symbolic order, and the symbolic Real, a set of signifiers that can never be properly integrated into the horizon of sense of a subject. The truth is revealed in the process of transiting the contradictions; or the real is a "minimal difference", the gap between the infinite judgement of a [[reductionism|reductionist]] materialism and experience as lived,&lt;ref&gt;Zizek, On Belief&lt;/ref&gt; the "Parallax" of dialectical antagonisms are inherent to reality itself and [[dialectical materialism]] (contra [[Friedrich Engels]]) is a new materialist Hegelianism, incorporating the insights of Lacanian psychoanalysis, set theory, quantum physics, and contemporary continental philosophy.

===Political thought and the postmodern subject===
Žižek argues:
* The state is a system of regulatory institutions that shape our behavior. Its power is purely symbolic and has no normative force outside of collective behavior. In this way, the term ''the law'' signifies society's basic principles, which enable interaction by prohibiting certain acts.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, ''For They Know Not What They Do''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Political decisions have become depoliticized and accepted as natural conclusions. For example, controversial policy decisions (such as reductions in social welfare spending) are presented as apparently "objective" necessities. Although governments make claims about increased citizen participation and democracy, the important decisions are still made in the interests of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. The [[two-party system]] dominant in the United States and elsewhere produces a similar illusion.&lt;ref&gt;''A Plea for Intolerance''&lt;/ref&gt; It is still necessary to engage in [[Political particularism|particular]] conflicts – such as labor disputes – but the trick is to relate these individual events to the larger struggle. Particular demands, if executed well, might serve as ''metaphorical condensation'' for the system and its injustices.

==Criticism==
There are two main themes of critique of Žižek's ideas: his failure to articulate an alternative or program in the face of his denunciation of contemporary social, political, and economic arrangements, and his lack of rigor in argumentation.&lt;ref name="ViolentVisions"/&gt;

===Ambiguity and unclear alternatives===
Žižek's philosophical and political positions are not always clear, and his work has been criticized for a failure to take a consistent stance.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Gabriel (2011). [http://www.alpineanarchist.org/r_anarchist_hypothesis.html The Anarchist Hypothesis, or Badiou, Žižek, and the Anti-Anarchist Prejudice] Alpine Anarchist. Retrieved 4 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While he has claimed to stand by a revolutionary Marxist project,  his lack of vision concerning the possible circumstances which could lead to successful revolution makes it unclear what that project consists of. According to John Gray and John Holbo, his theoretical argument often lacks grounding in historical fact, which makes him more provocative than insightful.&lt;ref name="ViolentVisions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=John|title=The Violent Visions of Slavoj Žižek|journal=New York Review of Books|date=12 July 2012|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/jul/12/violent-visions-slavoj-zizek/|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holbo-2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holbo|first=John|title=On Žižek and Trilling|journal=Philosophy and Literature|date=1 January 2004|volume=28|issue=2|pages=430–440|doi=10.1353/phl.2004.0029|quote=...an unhealthy anti-liberal is one, like Z+iz=ek, who ticks and tocks in unreflective revulsion at liberalism, pantomiming that he is de Maistre (or Abraham) or Robespierre (or Lenin) by turns, lest he look like Mill.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holbo-CT-2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Holbo|first=John|title=Zizek on the Financial Collapse&amp;nbsp;– and Liberalism|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2010/12/17/zizek-on-the-financial-collapse-and-liberalism/|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=Crooked Timbers|date=17 December 2010|quote=To review: Zizek does this liberal = neoliberal thing. Which is no good. And he doesn't even have much to say about economics. And Zizek does this liberal = self-hating pc white intellectuals thing. Which is no good.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Scruton]] has written in "Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left", "To summarize Žižek's position is not easy: he slips between philosophical and psychoanalytical ways of arguing, and is spell-bound by [[Lacan]]'s gnomic utterances. He is a lover of paradox, and believes strongly in what [[Hegel]] called 'the labour of the negative' though taking the idea, as always, one stage further towards the brick wall of paradox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scruton |first=Roger |date=2015 |title=Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left |publisher=Bloomsbury |page=256 |isbn=1408187337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek's refusal to present an alternative vision has led critics to accuse him of using unsustainable Marxist categories of analysis and having a 19th-century understanding of class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavoj Zizek responds to his critics|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|work=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=July 3, 2012|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/07/slavoj-zizek-responds-to-his-critics/|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ernesto Laclau]] argued that "Žižek uses class as a sort of ''[[deus ex machina]]'' to play the role of the good guy against the multicultural devils."&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Ernesto Laclau and Slavoj Žižek ''Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary Dialogues on the Left''. Verso. London, New York City 2000. pp. 202–206&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such analysis, however, is not systematic and draws on critical accounts of [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]], as well as [[post-structuralism]] and Lacanian [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=VanAuken&amp;Haig-2010&gt;{{cite news|title=Zizek in Manhattan: An intellectual charlatan masquerading as "left"|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2010/nov2010/zize-n12.shtml|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=World Socialist Web Site|date=12 November 2010|author=Bill Van Auken|author2=Adam Haig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek does not agree with critics who claim he believes in a historical necessity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no such thing as the Communist [[big Other]], there's no historical necessity or [[teleology]] directing and guiding our actions. (In [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: "''Ni komunističnega velikega Drugega, nobene zgodovinske nujnosti ali teleologije, ki bi usmerjala in vodila naša dejanja''".)&lt;ref name="Interview_part_two"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''Living in the End Times'', Žižek suggests that the criticism of his positions is itself ambiguous and multilateral: &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] I am attacked for being anti-Semitic ''and'' for spreading [[Zionism|Zionist]] lies, for being a covert Slovene nationalist ''and'' unpatriotic traitor to my nation, for being a crypto-Stalinist defending terror ''and'' for spreading Bourgeois lies about Communism... so maybe, just maybe I am on right path, the path of fidelity to freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek. "Living in the End Times".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unorthodox style and scholarship===
Critics complain of a theoretical chaos in which questions and answers are confused and in which Žižek constantly recycles old ideas which were scientifically refuted long ago or which in reality have quite a different meaning than Žižek gives to them.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. David Bordwell, "Slavoj Žižek: Say Anything", DavidBordwell.net blog, April 2005.[http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/zizek.php]; Philipp Oehmke, "Welcome to the Slavoj Zizek Show". ''Der Spiegel Online (International edition)'', 7 August 2010 [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-most-dangerous-philosopher-in-the-west-welcome-to-the-slavoj-zizek-show-a-705164.html]; [[Jonathan Rée]], "Less Than Nothing by Slavoj Žižek&amp;nbsp;– review. A march through Slavoj Žižek's 'masterwork'". ''The Guardian'', 27 June 2012.[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/27/less-than-nothing-slavoj-zizek-review]&lt;/ref&gt; Harpham calls Žižek's style "a stream of nonconsecutive units arranged in arbitrary sequences that solicit a sporadic and discontinuous attention."&lt;ref&gt;Harpham [http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v29/v29n3.harpham1.html "Doing the Impossible: Slavoj Žižek and the End of Knowledge"]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill concurs: "a dizzying array of wildly entertaining and often quite maddening rhetorical strategies are deployed in order to beguile, browbeat, dumbfound, dazzle, confuse, mislead, overwhelm, and generally subdue the reader into acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, [http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol5-2001/n17oneill "The Last Analysis of Slavoj Žižek"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such presentation has laid him open to accusations of misreading other philosophers, particularly [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Žižek carries over many concepts from Lacan's teachings into the sphere of political and social theory, but has a tendency to do so in an extreme deviation from its psychoanalytic context.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Parker, ''Slavoj Žižek: A Critical Introduction'' (Pluto Press: London and Sterling, 2004) p.78-80. For example, Žižek's appropriation of Lacan's discussion of [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] in his 1959/1960 seminar, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis''. In this seminar, Lacan uses Antigone to defend the claim that "the only thing of which one can be guilty is of having given ground relative to one's desire" (Slavoj Žižek, ''The Metastases of Enjoyment'', Verso: London, 1994; p.&amp;nbsp;69). However, as Parker notes, Antigone's act (burying her dead brother in the knowledge that she will be buried alive) was never intended to effect a revolutionary change in the political status quo; yet, despite this, Žižek frequently cites Antigone as a paradigm of ethico-political action.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to some critics, Žižek's conflation of Lacan's unconscious with Hegel's unconscious is mistaken. Noah Horwitz, in an effort to dissociate Lacan from Hegel, interprets the Lacanian unconscious and the Hegelian unconscious as two totally different mechanisms. Horwitz points out, in Lacan and Hegel's differing approaches to the topic of speech, that Lacan's unconscious reveals itself to us in [[parapraxis]], or "slips-of-the-tongue". We are therefore, according to Lacan, alienated from language through the revelation of our desire (even if that desire originated with the Other, as he claims, it remains peculiar to us). In Hegel's unconscious, however, we are alienated from language whenever we attempt to articulate a particular and end up articulating a universal. For example, if I say 'the dog is with me', although I am trying to say something about this particular dog at this particular time, I actually produce the universal category 'dog', and therefore express a generality, not the particularity I desire. Hegel's argument implies that, at the level of sense-certainty, we can never express the true nature of reality. Lacan's argument implies, to the contrary, that speech reveals the true structure of a particular unconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Horwitz, "Contra the Slovenians: Returning to Lacan and away from Hegel" (''Philosophy Today'', Spring 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;24–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a very negative review of Žižek's magnum opus ''Less than Nothing'', the British political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] attacked Žižek for his celebrations of violence, his failure to ground his theories in historical facts, and his ‘formless radicalism’ which, according to Gray, professes to be communist yet lacks the conviction that communism could ever be successfully realized. Gray concluded that Žižek's work, though entertaining, is intellectually worthless: 'Achieving a deceptive substance by endlessly reiterating an essentially empty vision, Žižek's work amounts in the end to less than nothing.'&lt;ref name="ViolentVisions"/&gt;

===Accusations of self-plagiarism in 2014===
Žižek's tendency to recycle portions of his own texts in subsequent works resulted in the accusation of [[self-plagiarism]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2014, after Žižek published 
an op-ed in the magazine which contained portions of his writing from an earlier book.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/slavoj-zizek-self-plagiarized-new-york-times-269221|title=Slavoj Žižek On 'Self Plagiarism' in The New York Times: What's the Big Deal?|date=10 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Žižek expressed perplexity at the harsh tone of the denunciation, emphasizing that the recycled passages in question only acted as references from his theoretical books to supplement otherwise original writing.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt;

On 11 July 2014, American weekly newsmagazine ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that in an article published in 2006 Žižek plagiarized substantial passages from an earlier review that first appeared in the journal ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'', a publication condemned by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as the organ of a "white nationalist hate group."&lt;ref name="American_Renaissance_Plagiarism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/did-marxist-philosophy-superstar-slavoj-zizek-plagiarize-white-nationalist-journal-258433 |title= Did Marxist Philosophy Superstar Slavoj Žižek Plagiarize a White Nationalist Journal?|work= Newsweek |date=11 July 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in response to the allegations, Žižek stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was writing the text on Derrida which contains the problematic passages, a friend told me about [[Kevin B. MacDonald|Kevin Macdonald's]]  theories, and I asked him to send me a brief resume. The friend send [sic] it to me, assuring me that I can use it freely since it merely resumes another's line of thought. Consequently, I did just that – and I sincerely apologize for not knowing that my friend's resume was largely borrowed from Stanley Hornbeck's review of Macdonald's book. [...] As any reader can quickly establish, the problematic passages are purely informative, a report on another's theory for which I have no affinity whatsoever; all I do after this brief resume is quickly dismissing Macdonald's theory as a new chapter in the long process of the destruction of Reason. In no way can I thus be accused of plagiarizing another's line of thought, of "stealing ideas". I nonetheless deeply regret the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Michelle|title=Slavoj Žižek Sorta Kinda Admits Plagiarizing White Supremacist Journal|url=http://gawker.com/slavoj-zizek-sorta-kinda-admits-plagiarizing-white-supr-1604590014|website=Gawker.com|publisher=Gawker Online|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chomsky===
[[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Žižek saying Žižek is guilty of "using fancy terms like polysyllables and pretending you have a theory when you have no theory whatsoever,"  and also said that Žižek’s theories never go "beyond the level of something you can explain in five minutes to a twelve-year-old."&lt;ref&gt;Springer, Mike (28 June 2013).

'''Vasudhārā''', whose name means "stream of gems" in [[Sanskrit]], is the Buddhist [[bodhisattva]] of wealth, prosperity, and abundance. She is popular in many Buddhist countries and is a subject in Buddhist legends and art. Originally an Indian bodhisattva, her popularity has spread to southern Buddhist countries. Her popularity, however, peaks in [[Nepal]] where she has a strong following among the Buddhist [[Newars]] of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and is thus a central figure in [[Newar Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pratapaditya, Pal. (1985) Art of Nepal. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; She is named Shiskar Apa in [[Lahul and Spiti]]. She is related to Hindu great goddess Lakshmi, and her Sanskrit name Vasundhara indicates she is the source of the eight "bountiful Vasus."  Therefore, according to the epic Mahabharat, she is the bounty that is the waters of the river Ganges—the goddess, Ganga whose origin is the snows of the Himalayas.

Her short [[mantra]] is ''oṃ Vasudhāre svāhā''.

== Buddhist water libation ==
In [[Burmese Buddhism]], the water ceremony, called  ''yay zet cha'', which involves the ceremonial pouring of water from a glass into a vase, drop by drop, concludes most Buddhist ceremonies including donation celebrations and feasts. This ceremonial libation is done to share the accrued [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] with all other living beings in all 31 planes of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Burmese supernaturalism |last=Spiro |first=Melford E. |year=1996 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-1-56000-882-8 |pages=44–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the water is poured, a confession of faith, called the ''hsu taung imaya dhammanu'', is recited and led by the monks.&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddhism and society: a great tradition and its Burmese vicissitudes |last=Spiro |first=Melford E. |year=1982 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-04672-6 |pages=213–214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the merit is distributed by the donors, called ''ahmya wei''  by saying ''Ahmya ahmya ahmya yu daw mu gya ba gon law'' three times, with the audience responding ''thadu'', Pali for "well done." The earth goddess Vasudhara  is invoked to witness these meritorious deeds.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt; Afterward, the libated water is poured on soil outside, to return the water to Vasudhara.

==Mantra==
Her mantra is "Om Shri Vasudhara Ratna Nidhana Kashetri Soha", when one takes up Vasudhara practice, 800 mantras (8 rounds of a mala) should be recited on the first day, then 300 mantras (3 rounds of a mala) on every day afterwards, one mala's worth of mantras in the morning, when time permits before work, another mala's worth of mantras when time permits in the late afternoon/evening, perhaps after work, the final mala's worth of mantras before sleeping, or 3 malas all at once any time of the day. It is said that devotees will accumulate 7 kinds of prosperity - wealth, quality, offspring, long life, happiness, praise and wisdom, enabling her devotess to be better equipped to practise generosity, in itself a cause for wealth, as well as having enough resources to be able to engage in spiritual practices. It also believed her practise leads to Enlightenment.

==Legends==

===The Inquiry of the Layman Sucandra===
The origin of Vasudhārā in Buddhism appears in the Buddhist text The Vasudhara Dharani.&lt;ref name="p. 248"&gt;Shaw, Miranda. (2006) Buddhist Goddesses of India p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a legend in the text known as “The Inquiry of the Layman Sucandra,” an impoverished layman named Sucandra approaches the Buddha Shakyamuni requesting a way to obtain large amounts gold, grain, silver, and gems in order to feed his large family and engage in acts of charity with the surplus fortune. Shakyamuni, aware of a mantra about the bodhisattva Vasudhara that would suit his purposes, bestows Sucandra with an incantation and religious ritual that when followed would result in good fortune and prosperity brought on by Vasudhara herself. Upon commencing the rituals and teaching them to others, Sucandra begins to prosper. Noticing his success, the monk Ananda asked Shakyamuni how he had obtained this fortune so quickly. Shakyamuni instructs Ananda to also practice the Vasudhara Dharani and “impart it to others ‘for the good of many’.”.&lt;ref name="p. 248" /&gt;

Although “The Inquiry of the Layman Sucandra” seems to contradict the Buddha’s renunciation of material possessions and earthly pleasures, Shakyamuni does not instruct the monk to recite the mantra for material benefit but instead he stresses that the mantra is for “‘the good of many’ and for ‘the happiness of many’.”&lt;ref name="p. 248" /&gt; Thus the mantra is meant more as means of alleviating suffering rather than obtaining wealth through Vasudhara, who not only grants physical wealth and abundance but also spiritual wealth and abundance.&lt;ref name="p. 248" /&gt;

===Legends from Taranatha===
[[File:Legend of Vasudhara (Ashvaghosha Avadana) LACMA M.91.239.jpg|thumb|right|Legend of Vasudhara, 1744 painting from [[Nepal]]]]
Several other legends describing Vasudhara’s generosity are found in the writings of [[Taranatha]] (1575–1634), a prominent [[Tibet]]an monk and scholar. According to his history, the bodhisattva Vasudhara granted the monk Buddhajnana three hundred pearl necklaces every day. Buddhajnana was also blessed with a steady stream of buyers to purchase these necklaces. With this success, the monk was able to invest his fortune into the monastery by supporting his fellow monks and students, purchasing votive statues and ritual objects, and making generous donations to the monastery. Because he did not use the money amassed for his own personal gain, Vasudhara continued to bestow these gifts on Buddhajnana for the rest of his life.
Another legend in Taranatha’s history echoes the legend of “The Inquiry of the Layman Sucundra.” According to the legend, a poor philosopher was struggling to support his family. He encounters a monk devoted to the practice of meditation who teaches him the rites and rituals necessary to meditate on the goddess Vasudhara. He began the rituals and quickly prospered, receiving a large amount of land and a prestigious teaching post at a monastery. As a result, he, like the monk who had once helped him in his time of need, also shared the rites and rituals of Vasudhara with others.

Like the legend of the Inquiry of the Layman Sucandra" these legends are significant because they encourage both the lay and monastic worship of Vasudhara.&lt;ref name="p. 248" /&gt; In addition, they stress the importance of charity, teaching worshippers to share in their good fortune rather than amassing it for themselves.

==Iconography in Buddhist art==
[[File:Vasudhara at Crocker Art Museum.jpg|thumb|A gilt bronze Vasudhara from Nepal, 12th century CE]]
In [[Buddhist art]], Vasudhara has a consistent [[iconography]]. She can easily be identified as a bodhisattva by the elaborate headdress and the extensive amount of jewelry she wears.&lt;ref name="p. 130"&gt;Getty, Alice. (1928) The Northern Gods of Buddhism. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  Her skin has a golden hue in bronze and painted images. This color is associated with precious metals and symbolizes opulence, fertility, and generosity in Buddhist iconography. Vasudhara is typically seated on a lotus flower base in the lalitasana, or royal pose, with one foot tucked in towards her and the other hanging of the flower base but resting on a small treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Pal, Pratapaditya. (2003). Art from the Himalayas and China. p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  She can, however, also be represented in a standing position.&lt;ref name="p. 255"&gt;Shaw, Miranda. (2006) Buddhist Goddesses of India. p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;  When standing, Vasudhara has a full vase representing abundance underneath each foot.&lt;ref name="p. 255" /&gt;  
 
Despite this consistency in her representations, the [[Hindu iconography#Multiple heads and arms|number of her arms]] may differ from image to image. In visual representations, Vasudhara can have as few as two arms and as many as six. The two-armed representations are more common in [[Tibetan art]] and [[Indian art]], while six-armed representations are almost exclusive to Nepalese art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanart.org/search/set.cfm?setid=352&amp;page=1 Himalayan Art: Buddhist Deity: Vasudhara (Main Page)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the six-armed image originates in India, they are rare and only few examples have been found.

Vasudhara or Vasundhara, the 'treasure holder', is a popular Newar goddess of fertility and prosperity, and a consort of the wealth-god Jambhala. She sits in the posture of 'royal ease' on a moon disc and a pink lotus, with her left leg drawn up and her extended right foot resting (similar posture to Green Tara - showing her willingness to "come down from her lotus throne" to help those who call upon her) upon a white conch shell (symbolising having conquered/having perfect control of speech) and a golden treasure-vase (wealth/prosperity). She is beautiful and attractive, as youthful as a sixteen-year-old, and her golden body scintillates with radiant light. Her three beautiful and smiling faces are coloured red (right - red being the colour of controlling), golden (centre, golden being the colour of increasing), and red (left), representing perfect compassion, wisdom understanding, awareness and insight into the past, present and future, she is adorned with the five divine silks and the eight jewelled ornaments. Her first right hand makes the gesture of generosity, while her other two right hands hold the 'Three Jewels' of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, - symbolising the necessity of maintaining the commitments of refuge to the three jewels, and a golden rosary, symbolising continuous practise and self-examination, vital to enlightenment. With her three left hands she holds a small treasure-vase, for long life and intitiation, an ear of grain, for abundant harvests and earthly benefits, and a sacred text to grant wisdom. In her hands, Vasudhara holds a variety of objects attributed to her. Most representations show her holding a sheaf of corn in her left hand, symbolizing an abundant harvest.&lt;ref name="p. 252"&gt;Shaw, Miranda. (2006) Buddhist Goddesses of India. p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;  She may also be holding a gem or small treasure, a symbol of wealth. Representations with more arms, such as the six-armed Nepali representation, also depict her holding a full vase and the [[Mahayana Sutras#Perfection of Wisdom texts|Book of Wisdom]]. With her free hands, Vasudhara performs [[mudra]]s. A commonly seen mudra in paintings and figurines featuring Vasudhara is the varada mudra, also known as the charity mudra, which symbolizes the “pouring forth of divine blessings.”&lt;ref name="p. 252" /&gt;
In her 2 armed one faced form, she has a golden body, representing the earth element, Ratnasambhava in her crown, sometimes 2 eyes or 3 eyes, if with 3 eyes - representing perfect awareness, understanding, compassion, wisdom and insight into the past, present and future. Her 2 hands holding a sheaf or corn for agricultural prosperity and to "sew the seeds" of enlightenment, and either a single wishfulfilling jewel or a bowl of wish fulfilling jewels for wealth and wish fulfilment.  
Vasudhara is the subject of numerous bronzes and paintings. She is predominantly the central figure of bronze sculptures or painted [[mandala]]s. She may also, however, appear alongside her consort, [[Vaiśravaṇa]] (Jambhala) the Buddhist God of Riches. Despite his status, she surpasses him in popularity and is more commonly the central figure of her own mandalas.

==In Nepali Buddhism==
[[File:Mandala of Vasudhara LACMA M.77.19.7.jpg|thumb|[[Nepalese painting]] of the [[Mandala]] of Vasudhara, 1495]]
Vasudhara is particularly popular in [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepali Buddhism]] among the Buddhist Newars of the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. In this region she is a common household deity. This is known from the countless number of bronzes and paintings found representing her. These images are small in size, typically 18&amp;nbsp;cm or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Aslop, Ian. (1984) “Five Dated Nepalese Metal Sculptures.” Artibus Asiae, Vol. 45. JSTOR. p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of their small size it is known that these images were primarily for private use, namely household veneration of the goddess. Additionally, there is a cult dedicated to her worship followed by the [[Newar Buddhism|Buddhist Newars]].&lt;ref&gt;Aslop, Ian. (1984) “Five Dated Nepalese Metal Sculptures.” Artibus Asiae, Vol. 45. JSTOR. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  Followers of this cult believe that her worship brings wealth and stability. Despite the strong following of this cult by the Buddhist Newars, unfortunately, it is now in decline.

As the Bodhisattva of abundance and prosperity, her popularity in this region is due to the predominance of agriculture and trade essential to the economy of the Kathmandu Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Pal, Pratapaditya. (1985) Art of Nepal. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  The Newars believe that her veneration will generally result in good fortune.

===Mandala===
[[File:Vasudhara Mandala, by Jasaraja Jirili, Nepal, dated 1365. Sotheby's.jpg|thumb|right|Vasudhara Mandala, by Jasaraja Jirili, [[Nepal]], 1365]]
One of the earliest Nepalese representations of Vasudhara is a [[pauhba]] (textile art depicting Hindu and Buddhist images on course cotton), dating back to 1015 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Pal, Pratapaditya. (1975) Nepal: Where the Gods are Young. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  This pauhba is known as the [[Mandala]] of Vasudhara. The goddess is the central image of this mandala, which depicts scenes of dedication, ritual initiation, festive music, and dance associated with her worship. Its purpose is didactic (to teach). The mandala teaches the importance of worshipping Vasudhara primarily through the narrative of a non-believer whom she converted to belief.&lt;ref&gt;Pal, Pratapaditya. (1975) Nepal: Where the Gods are Young. p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Tibetan Buddhism==
In addition to her popularity in Nepal, Vasudhara is also an important “wealth deity” in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="p. 260"&gt;Shaw, Miranda. (2006) Buddhist Goddesses of India. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;  Although popular in Tibet, Vasudhara does not assume as important a role as she does in Nepalese Buddhism. In Tibet, the worship of Vasudhara is limited to mostly lay people as opposed to worship by both lay and monastic life. This is because Tibetan monastic life regards Vasudhara as a “benefactor of the laity” and instead primarily engages in the worship of the goddess Tara for all their needs.&lt;ref name="p. 260" /&gt;  This, however, does not mean that monastic life disregards her completely. They do perform rites and rituals to the goddess habitually but it is usually at the request of a patron. She is considered to be one of the 21 Taras, also known as "Golden/Yellow Tara" Tibetan: Dolma Sermo, another name is Norgyunma.

===Differences in Iconography===
The iconography of Vasudhara varies slightly in this region. In Tibetan art she appears more commonly with two arms. The six-armed representations, however, also exist and it is believed they filtered into Tibet through Nepal because of the late appearance of these images in manuscripts and art.&lt;ref name="p. 260" /&gt; Unlike Nepalese art, Vasudhara rarely appears alone in Tibetan art. Instead she is paired with Jambhala or appears alongside other deities.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda. (2006) Buddhist Goddesses of India. p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these slight differences, most of her iconography remains unchanged and Vasudhara can be easily recognized by her attributes in most Buddhist art.

==Parallels with Lakshmi==

Vasudhara is often compared to the Hindu goddess [[Lakshmi]]. As goddesses of wealth, both deities have a similar iconography and are worshipped for their role in an abundant harvest.&lt;ref name="p. 259"&gt;Shaw, Miranda. (2006) Buddhist Goddesses of India. p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;  Both assume a golden hue in artistic representations, perform the same mudra, and hold similar objects. For example, Vasudhara and Lakshmi are often depicted holding gems or having pots of treasure under their feet. It is believed that the convention of depicting Vasudhara standing on vases originated from earlier representations of Lakshmi.&lt;ref name="p. 259" /&gt; Furthermore, both goddesses are often depicted paired with their respective consorts, Lakshmi alongside [[Vishnu]] and Vasudhara alongside [[Jambhala]].

Boxingscene.com. Retrieved 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boxer, Klitschko is a three-time world [[heavyweight]] champion, the [[list of WBC world champions#Heavyweight|second longest reigning WBC heavyweight champion of all time]], has the [[longest reigning heavyweight champions|fifth longest combined world championship reign in history]] at 2,735 days, the [[List of WBC world champions#Heavyweight|third longest individual WBC heavyweight title streak of all time]] at 9 consecutive defenses and the [[longest reigning heavyweight boxing champions#Most wins in heavyweight title bouts in different eras|4th longest combined title streak in the modern heavyweight history]] at 15 title bouts. He held the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] title from 1999 to 2000; the [[The Ring (magazine)|''Ring'' magazine]] title from 2004 to 2005; and the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] title twice, from 2004 to 2005 and from 2008 to 2013.

Standing at 2.01&amp;nbsp;metres (6&amp;nbsp;feet 7&amp;nbsp;inches), Klitschko was renowned for having exceptional ring dominance. With an 87% [[knockout]] percentage, he holds one of the highest knockout-to-fight ratios of any world champion in heavyweight boxing history, while also possessing a highly durable [[chin (combat sports)|chin]]. His two losses came via a shoulder injury and a deep cut above his eye, both of which were recorded as [[technical knockout|stoppages]] rather than outright knockouts; in both fights he was leading on the judges' scorecards.

Klitschko is the only heavyweight boxer to have reigned as world champion in three different decades. Along with [[Oliver McCall]], he is also the only world heavyweight champion to have never been [[knockdown (boxing)|knocked down]] in any fight. Klitschko and [[George Foreman]] are the only heavyweight boxers in history to defend a world title after turning 40.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesweetscience.com/feature-articles/17760-vitali-klitschko-retires-to-pursue-politics&lt;/ref&gt; Being the first professional boxing world champion to hold a PhD degree, and in reference to his punching power, Klitschko's nickname was "Dr. Ironfist". His younger brother, [[Wladimir Klitschko|Wladimir]], is a former unified world heavyweight champion. From 2006 until 2015, Vitali and Wladimir dominated heavyweight boxing, a period typically known as the "[[Klitschko brothers|Klitschko Era]]" of the division.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Boxing-Wladimir-Klitschkos-Loss-Signals-End-of-Era-96845&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxinginsider.com/columns/can-mariusz-wach-end-the-klitschko-era-of-dominance/&lt;/ref&gt;

Klitschko formally began his political career in 2006 when he placed second in the Kiev mayoral race. In 2010, he founded the party [[Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform]] (UDAR) and was elected into parliament for this party [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2012|in 2012]]. He was a leading figure in the 2013–2014 [[Euromaidan]] protests, and he announced his possible candidacy for the [[President of Ukraine|Ukrainian presidency]] but later withdrew and endorsed [[Petro Poroshenko]].{{#tag:ref|[[Petro Poroshenko]] was [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2014|elected]] [[President of Ukraine]] on 25 May 2014.&lt;ref name="to Be Inaugurated June 7"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20140529-707812.html |title=Petro Poroshenko to Be Inaugurated as Ukraine President June 7 |author=Lukas Alpert |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=29 May 2014 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529234158/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20140529-707812.html |archivedate=29 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} He was elected Mayor of Kiev on 25 May 2014.&lt;ref name="votecountKMEIU4614"&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/207829.html Klitschko officially announced as winner of Kyiv mayor election], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (4 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Klitschko headed the election list of the winner of the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], the [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc]], but he gave up his parliamentary seat to stay on as Mayor of Kiev.&lt;ref name=noresKM/&gt;&lt;ref name=noresKMid/&gt;&lt;ref name="allcountedCECIU81114"/&gt; On 28 August 2015 the [[UDAR]] party merged into Petro Poroshenko Bloc.&lt;ref name=mergeudar&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/286616.html Klitschko becomes leader of Petro Poroshenko Bloc 'Solidarity' party], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (28 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Klitschko thus became the new party leader.&lt;ref name=mergeudar/&gt; Klitschko was reelected as mayor on 15 November 2015.&lt;ref name="interfax1"&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/304188.html Kyiv Mayor Klitschko reelected with 66.5% of vote, 100% of ballot protocols processed – preliminary data].

As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Klitschko won the [[super-heavyweight]] championship at the first [[World Military Games]] in Italy in 1995. In the same year he won a silver medal at the [[1995 World Amateur Boxing Championships|World Championships]] in Berlin, Germany, where he was defeated by Russia's [[Alexei Lezin]] in the final. In his autobiography, published in Germany in 2004, the boxer revealed that he tested positive for a banned [[anabolic steroid|steroid]] in 1996. He attributed the presence of the drug to treatment of a leg injury, but was dismissed from the Ukrainian boxing team and missed the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/2389404/Boxing-Klitschko-admits-steroid-abuse.html|title=Klitschko admits steroid abuse|date=2 November 2004|work=Telegraph Sport|accessdate=8 April 2010|location=London|first=Bob|last=Mee}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Wladimir moved up from [[heavyweight]] to super heavyweight to take his place in the squad and won the Olympic gold medal. His amateur record was 195–15 with 80 knockouts.

===WBO heavyweight champion===
Klitschko began his professional boxing career in 1996, winning his first twenty-four fights by either early [[knockout]] or [[technical knockout]]. He and Wladimir signed with the German athlete-promotion company Universum. With both brothers holding PhDs and being multilingual, their refined and articulate personalities made for mainstream marketability when they moved to Germany and Universum. In time, they became national celebrities in their adopted home country. In his 25th pro fight on 26 June 1999, Klitschko won the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[Heavyweight]] title from [[Herbie Hide]] of the United Kingdom by a second-round knockout. He successfully defended the title twice. He defeated Ed Mahone by knockout in the third round and beat [[Obed Sullivan]], who retired after the ninth round.

===Title loss to Byrd===
{{Main|Vitali Klitschko vs. Chris Byrd}}
By April 2000 Vitali Klitschko was unbeaten and a rising star in the heavyweight division, having won all 27 of his contests by knockout. On 1 April, Klitschko had a third title defense against the American [[Chris Byrd]], who was a late replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Songalia |first =Ryan |title =Byrd: Vitali Klitschko Quit, He Knew I Would Stop Him!|publisher =BoxingScene.com |date =28 September 2011 |url =http://www.boxingscene.com/byrd-vitali-klitschko-quit-he-knew-i-stop-him--44306 |accessdate =24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrd made himself a difficult target and tried to thwart Klitschko's offense by being elusive. Klitschko won most of the rounds and was heading towards a comprehensive points victory when he suffered a serious shoulder injury. After the ninth round, Klitschko notified his corner that he had a shoulder pain and [[submission (combat sport)|threw in the towel]], thus handing Klitschko his first defeat and awarding Byrd the win by RTD. At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko had won 8 of 9 rounds on one judge's scorecard, and 7 of 9 on the two others. Klitschko, who was later diagnosed with a torn [[rotator cuff]], received much criticism for quitting the fight. Klitschko rebounded from his loss to Byrd by reeling off five victories in a row, earning himself a shot at [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Heavyweight Champion [[Lennox Lewis]].

===Klitschko vs. Lennox Lewis===
{{Main|Lennox Lewis vs. Vitali Klitschko}}
The fight between Lewis and Klitschko was to take place in December 2003, and Klitschko signed for a tune-up fight on 21 June 2003 as part of the undercard of Lewis' fight with [[Kirk Johnson]] for the [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] title, as the WBC would not sanction the fight for their title. Johnson, however, pulled out of the fight due to injury and Klitschko, due to his being in training for a fight on the same day as Lewis, took the fight on short notice. Immediately after he accepted, the WBC elected to sanction the fight as a title match and Lewis' ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' title was also up for grabs in addition to his [[lineal championship|lineal]] title.

Klitschko, a 4–1 underdog, dominated the early going with many harder punches. He stunned Lewis in the second round with two hard rights, leaving a cut under on Lennox's left eye.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/sports/boxing-lewis-cuts-the-deepest-and-retains-his-title.html?scp=10&amp;sq=klitschko%20lewis&amp;st=cse|title=Lewis Cuts the Deepest and Retains His Title|last=Freeman|first=Mike|date=22 June 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third, Lewis landed a big right hand that opened a deep cut above Klitschko's left eye.&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt; Before the seventh round, the ringside doctor inspected the wound and deemed it severe enough to threaten eye damage if struck again, stopping the fight despite Klitschko's pleas to continue. Klitschko was ahead on all three judges' scorecards 58–56 (4 rounds to 2) at the time of the stoppage, but because the wound was a result of punches from Lewis, Lewis won by [[technical knockout]].&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt;

Negotiations for a 6 December rematch began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing-lewis-set-to-retire-after-rematch-with-klitschko-588533.html|title=Boxing: Lewis set to retire after re-match with Klitschko|date=31 July 2003|work=The Independent|location=London, UK|first=Kieran|last=Daley|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After negotiations collapsed, Vitali defeated Kirk Johnson in a WBC Eliminator bout on 6 December date,&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Vitali_Klitschko_vs._Kirk_Johnson Vitali Klitschko vs. Kirk Johnson&amp;nbsp;– Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia]. Boxrec.com. Retrieved 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; setting up a mandatory rematch with Lewis. In January 2004, the WBC announced that it would strip Lewis of the belt if he let pass a 15 March deadline to sign for a rematch with Vitali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2004-01-25-lewis-wbc_x.htm|title=WBC to Lewis: Fight or else|work=USA Today|first1=Dan|last1=Rafael|date=27 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Lewis announced his retirement and vacated the title. For years after this fight, Klitschko would still occasionally call out Lewis, despite the fact that Lewis has been retired since early 2004, for a rematch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=16423.html|title=Vitali Klitschko Only Interested in Lennox Lewis, Valuev|publisher=Boxingscene.com|accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time the Klitschko brothers moved from [[Hamburg]], Germany to Los Angeles. In January 2004 they notified Universum that they would not re-sign when their contracts expired in April. Universum sued the brothers, arguing that their recent injuries had triggered a clause binding them beyond April. The suit was ultimately resolved in favor of the Klitschkos in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=21793&amp;more=1|title=Klitschko Bros KO Universum|publisher=Eastsideboxing.com|accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WBC and ''The Ring'' heavyweight champion===
Klitschko faced South African [[Corrie Sanders]] on 24 April 2004 for the WBC heavyweight championship and ''The Ring'' belts that had been vacated by Lewis. Sanders had stopped younger brother Wladimir in the second round (TKO) on 8 March 2003. Klitschko took a heavy shot in round one by Sanders and almost knocked down right at the end of the round, but by using upper-body movement and accurate punching he broke down Sanders over the following rounds, forcing referee Jon Schorle to stop the bout in the eighth. Vitali landed 60% of his power punches.

===Klitschko vs. Williams===
Klitschko's first WBC title defense was against British boxer [[Danny Williams (boxer)|Danny Williams]]. Williams had become suddenly marketable from a KO over [[Mike Tyson]] in round 4. Klitschko scored a technical knockout against Williams in 8 rounds on 11 December 2004, while wearing an orange cloth to show support for the Ukrainian presidential opposition movement. Klitschko knocked Williams down in the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 8th rounds before the fight was stopped. Immediately afterward, Klitschko dedicated his victory to democracy in his native Ukraine and also to the Ukrainian presidential candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]], whom he supported in 26 December 2004, [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|election revote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E3DF1F31F931A25751C1A9629C8B63&amp;fta=y|title=Klitschko Remains a Champion in a Dominating Show of Force|work=The New York Times|date=12 December 2004|accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005–2007 retirement===
On 9 November 2005, Klitschko announced his retirement from professional boxing and vacated his title. He had been training to fight [[Hasim Rahman]], however, nine days before the fight, he injured his leg while sparring. He snapped his [[anterior cruciate ligament]], which with surgery would take up to a year to heal and possibly prove career ending. To avoid keeping the title out of use he retired. The WBC was grateful for his consideration. On other occasions he cited regrets about his suddenly mounting injuries, a desire to leave the sport while still on top and political aspirations in his home country of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2220413|title=Rahman: If not Vitali, bring on Wlad|publisher=ESPN|date=10 November 2005|accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his retirement, the WBC conferred "champion emeritus" status on Klitschko, and assured him he would become the mandatory challenger if and when he decided to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Gareth A.|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/3184341/David-Haye-confident-he-can-take-down-both-Klitschko-brothers.html|title=David Haye confident he can take down both Klitschko brothers|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 October 2008|accessdate=1 November 2009|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second WBC heavyweight championship===
On 3 August 2008 the WBC awarded Klitschko a chance to regain his WBC Heavyweight title. After Vitali's retirement, his younger brother had established dominance in the division, winning two of the four world titles available. The reigning WBC Champion was [[Samuel Peter]] (who had lost a decision to Wladimir in a thrilling fight in 2005). At the time, there was interest in a potential Peter vs. Wladimir unification match. Instead, Vitali took advantage of his champion emeritus status and secured a title challenge against Peter. The fight was arranged on 11 October 2008 at [[O2 World (Berlin)|O2 World, Berlin]]. It would be one of the most anticipated heavyweight fights in the past few years. Both men had a rightful claim to being the champion and the stakes for the future of the heavyweight division were high. Despite some questioning Vitali's decision to return after four years, he managed to regain his title in dominating fashion. Klitschko had Peter intimidated from the first round and stunned him with accurate hard punches. Klitschko kept the hard-punching Nigerian off with an effective left jab and took control in the center of the ring. Over eight rounds, Klitschko completely dismantled and outfought the younger champion. After the eighth round, Peter slumped on his stool, shook his head and asked that the bout be stopped. With the Samuel Peter victory, Klitschko technically became one of the few men to ever hold a version of the World Heavyweight Championship three times&amp;nbsp;– WBO (1999–2000), WBC (2004–2005) and WBC (2008–2012).

===Klitschko vs. Gómez, Arreola, Johnson===
On 21 March 2009, Klitschko defeated [[Juan Carlos Gómez]] by TKO in the ninth round. Gómez tried to use his movement to thwart Vitali, but seemed unable to cope with the power and physical strength of his opponent. As the rounds progressed, Klitschko began imposing himself on Gómez more and more. Gómez soon became wary of Klitschko's power and also began to tire physically. By the sixth round, Vitali was in total control. The end came when the referee stopped the fight in the ninth round as Gómez appeared unable to withstand any more hits.

On 26 September, Klitschko earned a one-sided TKO victory over [[Chris Arreola]] at the Staples Center in Los Angeles when Arreola's trainer, Henry Ramirez, asked the referee to stop the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/8274233.stm|title=Dominant Klitschko beats Arreola|date=27 September 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arreola was considered at the time one of the division's hardest punchers; however, Klitschko kept Arreola at bay with his left jab and hit him almost at will with his right. Arreola had been influenced by Samuel Peter's defeat to Klitschko in 2008, in which Peter had tried to box from the outside. He therefore employed a game-plan which involved applying constant pressure to Vitali in order to force him into a high tempo fight. Despite his best efforts, the bout became one sided very quickly. Klitschko consistently proved himself faster, sharper and much fitter than Arreola.

On 12 December, Vitali defeated [[Kevin Johnson (boxer)|Kevin Johnson]] by unanimous decision, winning almost every round. Johnson, a skillful fighter, tried to negate Klitschko's strength with angles and head movement. Though he proved hard to hit, he failed to launch any sustained attack of his own. After the Johnson bout, Klitschko's camp began negotiations for a potential fight with former WBA Champion [[Nikolai Valuev]], but the match failed to materialize due to economic disagreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Klitschko vs. Sosnowski, Briggs, Solis===
On 29 May 2010, Vitali Klitschko defeated [[Poles|Polish]] heavyweight contender [[Albert Sosnowski]] by KO at 2:30 in round 10 of 12. Sosnowski was knocked down by a right hand in the 10th round, prompting referee Jay Nady to immediately wave off the fight. The fight took place at [[Veltins-Arena]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]], Germany.[[File:Klitschko vs Sosnowski.JPG|left|thumb|Klitschko vs Sosnowski, 29 May 2010]]
Vitali Klitschko weighed in at 112&amp;nbsp;kg (247&amp;nbsp;lbs), while Sosnowski weighed in at 110&amp;nbsp;kg (242.5&amp;nbsp;lbs).
This voluntary defense was Vitali's 4th defense of the WBC Heavyweight title. Sosnowski was the No. 11 ranked heavyweight according to the WBC prior to this bout.

On 17 August 2010, it was announced that Klitschko would defend his WBC title against [[Shannon Briggs]] on 16 October of that year. Klitschko completely dismantled his challenger with superior hand speed. Briggs struggled to land any meaningful punches, as Klitschko won every round decisively. After a few rounds, Briggs was receiving a vicious and sustained beating which caused him serious facial injuries. Considering the beating he was receiving, there was some suggestion that the referee should have stopped the bout during the last few rounds. Klitschko had retained his belt with official scores of 120–107, 120–105, and 120–107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sukachev|first=Alexey|title=Vitali Klitschko Gives Briggs a Brutal Beating in Hamburg|publisher=BoxingScene.com|date=16 October 2010|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=31898|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vitali Klitschko Keeps His Title|work=The New York Times|date=17 October 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/sports/17sportsbriefs-Wbc.html?_r=1&amp;ref=vitaliklitschko|accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the post-fight interview, the American boxer Briggs said: "I've fought George Foreman, I've fought Lennox Lewis, and Vitali's the best." While Klitschko did not knock down Briggs, the latter collapsed after the fight and was hospitalized with facial fractures and a torn biceps.

Klitschko's next fight was against mandatory challenger [[Odlanier Solis]].

The fight lasted less than one whole round, as a right hand to Solis's temple wobbled Solis, who then twisted his knee. Klitschko won by KO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klitschko.com/eng/Home.html Profile], Klitschko.com.

===Klitschko vs. Adamek, Chisora, Charr===
{{Main|Vitali Klitschko vs. Tomasz Adamek}}
Now aged 40, Klitschko retained his WBC heavyweight title against [[Tomasz Adamek]] on 10 September 2011 in Poland, winning by TKO in the 10th round. The referee stopped the bout after Adamek received punishing blows and was ruled out, as he was no longer able to defend himself.

After turning 41 on 19 July 2012, Vitali became one of the oldest Heavyweight Champions in history. Despite having a four-year hiatus from the sport, Vitali has proven to be a remarkably effective and dominant Heavyweight Champion once again. Alongside his brother Wladimir, he also fights on for their shared ambition of holding all four Heavyweight Championship belts together, an ambition that was realised on 2 July 2011 when brother Wladimir defeated [[David Haye]] to win the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Heavyweight Championship.

In January 2012, he was awarded WBC Fighter of the Year for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/sports/20120118/170829386.html|title=Klitschko Named WBC Fighter of 2011|date=18 January 2012|agency=RIA Novosti|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klitschko was in negotiations for a possible bout with former WBA Heavyweight title holder David Haye on 3 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/15927657.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Haye confirms Kiltschko fight talks|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/boxing/3968197/David-Haye-could-fight-Vitali-Klitschko-in-March.html|location=London, UK|work=The Sun|first=Pat|last=Sheehan|title=David Haye could fight Vitali Klitschko in March}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/8924501/David-Haye-has-a-deal-on-the-table-to-go-ahead-and-fight-WBC-world-heavyweight-champion-Vitali-Klitschko-next-year.html|location=London, UK|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Gareth A.|last=Davies|title=David Haye has a deal on the table to go ahead and fight WBC world heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko next year|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitali won the majority of the rounds boxing a disciplined fight with changing angles and superior footwork. Chisora, constantly coming forward delivering punishing body shots, failed to wear down the older man. The scores were: 118–110, 118–110, and 119–111.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/17086859 Vitali Klitschko taken the distance by Dereck Chisora in Munich] BBC.co.uk (19 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Vitali visited a hospital to check his shoulder, claiming he injured it in the fight. A doctor confirmed a ligament tear was suffered in his left shoulder. Klitschko said he "suddenly lost strength in the left hand" and was forced to only use his right. The injury was believed to have happened in the second or third round.

During the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and the following [[Orange Revolution]], the [[Klitschko brothers]] openly supported the candidacy of [[Viktor Yushchenko]].&lt;ref name=LIGA&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://file.liga.net/person/229-vitalii-klichko.html Short bio], LIGA&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, (Vitali) Klitschko was appointed an adviser to [[President of Ukraine|President]] Yushchenko.&lt;ref name=LIGA/&gt; In October 2006, he was promoted to full-time adviser.&lt;ref name=LIGA/&gt;

[[File:Klitschko Kramnik 2002 Dortmund.jpg|thumb|left|Vitali Klitschko (left) playing chess with [[Vladimir Kramnik]], Dortmund, 2002.]]
In 1996, Klitschko graduated from the Pereyaslav-Khmelnytsky Pedagogical Institute (Ukraine)&lt;ref name=LIGA/&gt; and was accepted into the postgraduate study program at the [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]]. On 29 February 2000, he presented his doctoral thesis on "talent and sponsorship in sports"&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/fw32002.htm CyberBoxingZone News, 29-02-2000 "Calling Dr. Klitschko"]. Retrieved 7 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; at the "Kyiv University of Physical Science and Sports" and his PhD in Sports Science was conferred.

Klitschko has lived for years in Germany (in addition to residing in [[Kiev]]).&lt;ref name="SpiegelVK29612"/&gt; According to Klitschko "Germany adopted me, I really love Germany, but I'm not German".&lt;ref name="SpiegelVK29612"/&gt;

Both Vitali and his brother are avid [[chess]] players. Vitali is a friend of former world chess champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] and the two have played, with Kramnik always winning. Vitali has commented that "chess is similar to boxing. You need to develop a strategy, and you need to think two or three steps ahead about what your opponent is doing. You have to be smart. But what's the difference between chess and boxing? In chess, nobody is an expert, but everybody plays. In boxing everybody is an expert, but nobody fights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.hbo.com/boxing/fighters/klitschko_vitali/bio.html|title=Boxing: Fighters: Bio: VITALI KLITSCHKO|publisher=HBO.com|date=27 September 2009|accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitali and his brother also have been involved in charitable activities dedicated to supporting the needs of schools, churches and children. In 2002, the Klitschko brothers announced that they had agreed to work for [[UNESCO]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[File:winifred-emery-1896.jpg|thumb|right|Winifred Emery in 1896]]
'''Winifred Emery''' (1 August 1861 – 15 July 1924), born '''Maud Isabel Emery''', was an English actress and [[actor-manager]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  She was the wife of the actor [[Cyril Maude]].

Born into a family of actors, Emery began acting as a child. Her career grew through the 1880s and 1890s as she played leading roles in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of London. After a period away from the stage, she returned with leading roles in the company of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]]. She continued to act steadily in her own touring theatre company with her husband and in London theatres until 1922.

==Early life and career==
Emery was born in [[Manchester]], Lancashire, the daughter of [[Samuel Anderson Emery]] and granddaughter of John Emery, both well-known actors in their day. Her first stage appearance was in 1870, aged 8, in [[J. B. Buckstone]]'s ''The Green Bushes'' at the Alexandra Theatre in [[Liverpool]]. Her first London appearance was on 23 December 1874 when she played Happy New Year in the [[pantomime]] ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' at the [[Princess's Theatre, London|Princess's Theatre]]. In 1879 she joined [[Marie Litton]]'s company before appearing with [[Wilson Barrett]] at the [[Grand Theatre, Leeds|Grand Theatre]] in [[Leeds]]. She moved with Barrett to the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]] in London in October 1879.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;C. M. P. Taylor, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49696 Emery, Winifred (1861–1924)], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online ed., January 2008, accessed 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There she was first noticed by the critics when she appeared in the one-act play ''A Clerical Error''.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''The Sketch'', 7 December 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery appeared in ''A Bridal Tour'' at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in August 1880, and performed at the [[St James's Theatre]] with Sir [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]], [[William Hunter Kendal]] and [[Madge Kendal]]. In July 1881 she joined the company of [[Henry Irving]] at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], and there she appeared in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. She later played at [[Folly Theatre|Toole's Theatre]] and at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] with [[Thomas Thorne]] in ''[[The Rivals]]''. In 1884 she became the understudy for [[Ellen Terry]] at the Lyceum Theatre and toured the United States with Henry Irving, playing in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' and ''The Merchant of Venice''. Also for Irving, in October 1885 Emery played the title role in ''[[Olivia (play)|Olivia]]'' by [[William Gorman Wills|W. G. Wills]], and toured the United States again in 1887–8.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Emery married the actor [[Cyril Maude]] on 28 April 1888 at [[Kensington]] Register Office, and they had another marriage ceremony at the [[Savoy Chapel]] on 2 June 1888. She next appeared at the Vaudeville Theatre and, for [[Augustus Harris]], at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. Returning to the Vaudeville Theatre in February 1890, she played the title role in ''[[Clarissa]]'', adapted by [[Robert Williams Buchanan]] from the novel by [[Samuel Richardson]].&lt;ref&gt;''Clarissa'', ''[[The Times]]'', 7 February 1890&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, and at the same theatre, she played leading roles in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' and ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', among others.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; She starred in ''Judah'' by [[Henry Arthur Jones]] at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] in September 1890 before appearing at the Olympic Theatre with [[Wilson Barrett]] in December 1890.

May 1891 saw Emery back at the Shaftesbury Theatre, and in February 1892 she took the title role in the original production of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'' at the [[St James's Theatre]]. Between 1893 and 1895 Emery played the lead female roles for [[J. Comyns Carr]] at the [[Comedy Theatre]], where she appeared in [[Sydney Grundy|Grundy's]] ''The New Woman'' and ''Sowing the Wind'' and [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]]'s ''The Benefit of the Doubt''. Such was her fame by this time that her portrait was drawn by [[Aubrey Beardsley]], appearing in the January 1895 edition of ''[[The Yellow Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectorspost.com/emery.htm Winifred Emery], Collector's Post website, accessed 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1896 she appeared at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] under the management of Sir [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:winifred-emery-1901.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Emery with her children, c. 1901]]
In 1896 her husband became [[actor-manager]] of the [[Haymarket Theatre]], and Emery went with him, becoming his leading lady. However, owing to a period of illness and the birth of her son, she made just one appearance there between 1898 and 1905, in ''The Second in Command'', by Robert Marshall, in July 1901. She made her theatrical 'comeback' in February 1905, when she played Beatrice in ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' opposite [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]]. In January 1906 she appeared at the [[Novello Theatre|Waldorf Theatre]] as Mrs Pellender in ''The Superior Miss Pellender''. Emery formed her own theatrical company and with it she and her husband toured provincial theatres, the two of them starring in ''Olivia and Her Son'' by [[Horace Annesley Vachell]]. This play transferred to the [[Playhouse Theatre]], then under Cyril Maude's management, in March 1907.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

From 1907 to 1922 Emery played leading roles in numerous productions at West End theatres, including the Playhouse Theatre with her husband; His Majesty's Theatre in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''; Drury Lane in ''The Bunking of Betty''; the St James's Theatre in [[Thomas William Robertson|T. W. Robertson's]] ''[[Caste (play)|Caste]]''; the [[Lyric Theatre, London|Lyric Theatre]] in ''Sir Walter Ralegh''; the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in Pinero's ''The Schoolmistress''; the [[Apollo Theatre]] in ''Never Say Die'' by W. H. Post, starring [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]] (1913); the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck's]] ''The Betrothal'', and at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in Pinero's ''The Enchanted Cottage'' (1922). At the [[Royal Command Performance]] in May 1911 at Drury Lane before [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], Emery appeared in an excerpt from [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton's]] ''Money''; and at the Coronation Gala Performance for [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], held at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] on 27 June 1911, she played [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Critic (play)|The Critic]]'', directed by Sir [[Squire Bancroft]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Her last performance was at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] on 26 February 1923 in a charity production of ''The Ballad Monger''.

Emery died of stomach cancer at her home in [[Bexhill-on-Sea]] in Sussex, aged 62, and was buried at St Mark's Church in Bexhill.

==Family life==
Her children with Maude included [[Margery Maude]], who became an actress; Pamela Cynthia Maude (1893–1975); and [[John Cyril Maude]], who became a barrister, judge and Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p5788.htm The family of Winifred Emery] on thepeerage.com, accessed 8 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Pamela Maude married Major [[Billy Congreve|William La Touche Congreve]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]] on 1 June 1916. He was killed in action on 20 July 1916 during [[World War I]], for which he was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wakefieldfhs.org.uk/genealogyjunction/Eton/Eton%20Roll%20of%20Honour%20Latin%20text.html Eton College – Rolls of Honour], accessed 8 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 1919 she married Captain [[Brigadier the Hon. William Fraser|William Fraser]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (1890–1964), who eventually rose to the rank of [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/index340.htm Lord Saltoun of Abernethy] on cracroftpeerage.co.uk, accessed 8 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery brought up her niece, Winifred Isabel Emery (1890–1972),&lt;ref name=Gas&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/76473?docPos=1 Gascoyne, David], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', accessed 2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dark&gt;[[Sidney Dark|Dark, Sidney]] and Rowland Grey.

'''Zou Rong''' ({{zh|t=鄒容|p=Zōu Róng|w=Tsou Jung}}; 1885 &amp;ndash; 1905) was a Chinese nationalist, racialist and revolutionary martyr of the anti-Qing movement. He was born in [[Chongqing]], [[Sichuan]] Province, his ancestors having moved there from [[Meizhou]], Guangdong area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 泸州老窖的客家故事之二 迁川往事：忘不了的根，磨不灭的志| url=http://zwgk.gd.gov.cn/007208023/201306/t20130604_377035.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zou was sent to [[Japan]] at an early age, where he studied the successful Japanese way of modernization.

When he returned to China, he started to write essays on how to free the Chinese nation from the Manchu regime and foreign imperialism. In 1903, he published a  book on this topic: ''The Revolutionary Army'' (''geming jun'' 革命軍). The deeply patriotic book, informed by Republicanism and Social Darwinist racial theories, was widely read and had a profound influence on the revolutionary movement. Thousands of copies of the book were distributed internationally by [[Sun Yat-sen]]&lt;ref name="BergèreLloyd1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marie-Claire Bergère|author2=Janet Lloyd|title=Sun Yat-sen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh7M1u4IGFkC|year=1998|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4011-1|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; in support of the revolutionary cause.

Zou found the Qing government unable to deal with the contemporary crisis of colonization, weakness and corruption. For Zou, the Manchu were the source of China's inability to overcome traditional obstacles for modern reforms and he analyzed their mistakes and weaknesses point by point. Moreover, he condemned China's traditional monarchical system, which had made the Han Chinese "slaves" rather than "citizens." He was also influenced by racialist Han ideology, as evidenced in his distaste for the Manchu governing class, as he advocated “annihilation [of] the five million and more of the furry and horned Manchu race, cleansing ourselves of 260 years of harsh and unremitting pain, so that the soil of the Chinese subcontinent is made immaculate, and the descendants of the Yellow Emperor will all become Washingtons.”

His calls for sovereignty of the Chinese people included the establishment of a parliament, equal rights for women, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. These seemingly liberal democratic ideals were underpinned by a potentially genocidal ethnic nationalism; it was not the liberty of the individual, but the sovereignty of the ethnic nation-state ("A man cannot live without his country") that formed the foundations for the Republic of China as envisioned by Zou.

Zou lived in a foreign concession in Shanghai where he enjoyed extraterritorial rights and could not be sentenced to death by a Qing Court. Instead, he was closely associated with [[Zhang Binglin]] and implicated in the [[Subao Case|Subao incident]] as a result, which rendered him a prison sentence of two years; he fell ill while incarcerated and died in April 1905 at the age of 20.
