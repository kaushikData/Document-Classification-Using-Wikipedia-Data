A person experiencing avolition may stay at home for long periods of time, rather than seeking out work or peer relations.

== Psychopathology ==
People with avolition often want to complete certain tasks but lack the ability to initiate behaviours necessary to complete them. Avolition is most commonly seen as a symptom of some other disorder, but might be considered a primary clinical disturbance of itself (or as a coexisting second disorder) related to disorders of diminished motivation. In 2006, avolition was identified as a [[Symptom#Positive and negative|negative symptom]] of [[schizophrenia]] by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),&lt;ref name="Castonguay &amp; Oltmann"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Castonguay L, Oltmanns T | veditors = Castonguay L, Oltmanns T | year = 2013 | chapter = General Issues in Understanding and Treating Psychopathology | title = Psychopathology: From Science to Clinical Practice | pages = 5–6 | location = New York | publisher = Guildford Publications | isbn = 978-1-4625-2881-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been observed in patients with [[bipolar disorder]] as well as resulting from trauma.

Avolition is sometimes mistaken for other, similar symptoms also affecting motivation, such as [[aboulia]], [[anhedonia]] and [[asociality]], or strong general disinterest. For example, aboulia is also a restriction in motivation and initiation, but characterized by an inability to set goals or make decisions and considered a disorder of diminished motivation.&lt;ref name="pmid16030444"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marin RS, Wilkosz PA | title = Disorders of diminished motivation | journal = The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 377–88 | date = 2005 | pmid = 16030444 | doi = | url = http://www.yaroslavvb.com/papers/marin-disorders.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to provide effective treatment, the underlying cause of avolition (if any) has to be identified and it is important to properly differentiate it from other symptoms, even though they might reflect similar aspects of mental illness.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Social and clinical implications==
Implications from avolition often result in social deficits. Not being able to initiate and perform purposeful activities can have many implications for a person with avolition. By disrupting interactions with both familiar and unfamiliar people, it jeopardizes the patient's social relations. When part of a severe [[mental illness]], avolition has been reported, in first person accounts, to lead to physical and mental inability to both initiate and maintain relationships, as well as work, eat, drink or even sleep.&lt;ref name= "First Person Accounts"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Morrison B | veditors = LeCroy CW, Holschuh J | year = 2012 | chapter = 
Suicide: Disease, Loneliness, Social Isolation, Suicide, Negative Thoughts ... | title = First Person Accounts of Mental Illness and Recovery | pages = 53–57 | location = Hoboken, New Jersey | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | isbn = 978-0-470-44452-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinically, it may be difficult to engage an individual experiencing avolition in active participation of [[psychotherapy]]. Patients are also faced with the stresses of coping with and accepting a mental illness and the stigma that often accompanies such a diagnosis and its symptoms. Regarding schizophrenia, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] reported in 2013 that there currently are "no treatments with proven efficacy for primary negative symptoms"&lt;ref name="Negative Symptoms"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kring A, Smith D | year = 2013 | chapter = The Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia | title = Psychopathology: From Science to Clinical Practice | pages = 370–388 | veditors = Castonguay L, Oltmanns T | location = New York, NY | publisher = Guildford Publications | isbn = 978-1-4625-2881-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as avolition). Together with schizophrenia's chronic nature, such facts added to the outlook of never getting well, might further implicate feelings of hopelessness and similar in patients as well as their friends and family.

==Treatment==
Although [[Psychiatric medication|medication]] is the [[first-line treatment]] for most psychiatric disorders, it does not always improve every aspect of a patient's life, and for the negative symptoms in schizophrenia, the responses to anti-psychotics are less favourable than for positive symptoms.&lt;ref name=CarsonNursing&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carson | first1 = Verna Benner | name-list-format = vanc | title = Mental health nursing: the nurse-patient journey | date = 2000 | publisher = W.B. Saunders | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 978-0-7216-8053-8 | page = 638 | edition = 2nd | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QM5rAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, psychotherapy might be an alternative for the treatment of these symptoms, even if medication has a good effect on other manifestations of the disorder.

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy|Cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT), is the kind of psychotherapy that shows most promise in treating avolition (and other negative symptoms of schizophrenia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elis O, Caponigro JM, Kring AM | title = Psychosocial treatments for negative symptoms in schizophrenia: current practices and future directions | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | pages = 914–28 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23988452 | pmc = 4092118 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2013.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but more research is needed in the area. CBT focuses on understanding how thoughts and feelings influence behaviour, in order to help individuals develop methods and strategies to better handle the implications of their disorder. Some research suggests that CBT focusing on social skills and practice of interpersonal situations, like job interviews, seeing a doctor (to discuss medication, for example), or interacting with friends and co-workers, as well as seemingly simple things like riding a bus, might reduce negative symptoms of schizophrenia and be beneficial to patients with avolition.

Other forms of psychotherapy might also complement the role of medication and help patients, their families, and friends to work through emotional and other challenges of living with a chronic psychological disorder, including avolition.

The '''Breast International Group (BIG)-aisbl''' is a [[non-profit]] organisation for academic [[breast cancer]] research groups from around the world, with its headquarters at the Jules Bordet Institute in Brussels, Belgium.

BIG facilitates breast cancer research at international level by stimulating cooperation between its members and other academic networks, and collaborating with, but working independently from, the pharmaceutical industry. Such large-scale cooperation is crucial to make significant advances in breast cancer research, reduce the wasteful duplication of effort, and optimally serve those affected by the disease.

Founded by leading European opinion leaders in 1996, BIG now constitutes a network of 50 groups based in Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia and Australasia. These research entities are tied to approximately 3000 specialised hospitals and research centres worldwide. More than 30 clinical trials are run or are under development under the BIG umbrella. BIG also works closely with the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the North American Breast Cancer Groups (NABCG), so that together they act as a strong integrating force in the breast cancer research arena.

International collaboration makes it possible to conduct studies that would not be possible for a single research group or network to carry out on its own, especially as treatments become increasingly targeted. Combining efforts makes it possible to quickly enrol large numbers of patients, or to share data and knowledge and efficiently answer important scientific questions. Faster results mean faster direct benefits to patients.

BIG to date has been mainly focused on large adjuvant trials looking at questions related to optimal chemo-, hormono- and biological therapies, or to special groups of patients, such as the young or the elderly. BIG trials incorporate a substantial translational research component and emphasise the collection and banking of biological specimens for future research. However, BIG also provides a discussion forum for prevention trials and studies in advanced breast cancer, and it launched a biomarkers and drug development programme centred on neo-adjuvant studies, NeoBIG.

While nearing the end (in 2011) of its formal support by the European Commission under Framework Programme VI, the TRANSBIG consortium, managed by the BIG Headquarters, will leave a lasting legacy in the form of a biological materials bank (“biobank”). Extremely valuable for [[translational research]], this will allow researchers from around the world to access to genomic data and biospecimens. Moreover, many of the TRANSBIG committees and structures are being adapted to expand their expertise across BIG, benefitting the association in the longer term.

'''''Buck v. Bell''''', 274 U.S. 200 (1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Buck v. Bell|274|200|1927}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], written by Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], in which the Court ruled that a [[Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924|state statute]] permitting [[compulsory sterilization]] of the unfit, including the [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], "for the protection and health of the state" did not violate the Due Process clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  The Supreme Court has never expressly overturned ''Buck v. Bell''.

==Background==
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Carrie Buck.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Carrie Buck]] was a patient who was [[compulsory sterilization|compulsorily sterilized]].]] --&gt;
The concept of ''[[eugenics]]'' had been put forward in 1883 by [[Francis Galton]], who also coined the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Galton |first=Francis |title=Inquiries into Human Faculty and its Development |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=1883 |page=199 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trend first became popular in the [[United States]], and found proponents in Europe by the start of the 20th century; 42 of the 58 research papers presented at the First International Congress of Eugenics held in London in 1912, were from American scientists&lt;ref&gt;Pandora's Lab: Seven stories of Science gone wrong&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Indiana]] passed the first eugenic sterilization statute (1907), but it was legally flawed.  To remedy this situation, [[Harry Laughlin]] of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] (ERO) at the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]],  designed a model eugenic law that was reviewed by legal experts. In 1924 the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]] adopted a statute authorizing the [[compulsory sterilization]] of the [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] for the purpose of eugenics.  This 1924 statute was closely based on Laughlin's model.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;{{Citation |url=http://eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/static/themes/39.html |title=Buck vs. Bell Trial|work=Eugenics Archive |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter 46B of the Code of Virginia § 1095h–m (1924)|url = http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Chapter_46B_of_the_Code_of_Virginia_|website = www.encyclopediavirginia.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Looking to determine if the new law would pass a legal challenge, on September 10, 1924 Dr. Albert Sidney Priddy, superintendent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvtc.dmhmrsas.virginia.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618192444/http://www.cvtc.dmhmrsas.virginia.gov/ |archivedate=June 18, 2009 |df=mdy }} Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded]], filed a petition to his Board of Directors to sterilize [[Carrie Buck]], an 18-year-old patient at his institution who he claimed had a mental age of 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Buck v. Bell (1927)|url = http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Buck_v_Bell_1927|website = www.encyclopediavirginia.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priddy maintained that Buck represented a genetic threat to society. According to Priddy, Buck's 52-year-old mother possessed a mental age of 8 and had a record of [[prostitution]] and [[immorality]]. She had three children without good knowledge of their paternity. Carrie, one of these children, had been adopted and attended school for five years, reaching the level of sixth grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Buck, Carrie (1906–1983)|url = http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Buck_Carrie_Elizabeth_1906-1983|website = www.encyclopediavirginia.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Priddy, she had eventually proved to be "incorrigible" and eventually gave birth to an illegitimate child. Her adopted family had committed her to the State Colony as "[[feeble-minded]]", no longer feeling capable of caring for her. It was later discovered that Carrie's pregnancy was not caused by any "immorality" on her own part. In the summer of 1923, while her adoptive mother was away "on account of some illness," her adoptive mother's nephew raped Carrie, and Carrie's later commitment has been seen as an attempt by the family to save their reputation.&lt;ref name="Lombardo 1985 30–62"&gt;{{Citation |last=Lombardo |first=Paul A. |title=Three Generations, No Imbeciles: New Light on ''Buck v.

==Case==
While the litigation was making its way through the court system, Priddy died and his successor, Dr. John Hendren Bell, took up the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bell, John H. (1883–1934)|url = http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Bell_John_Hendren_1883-1934|website = www.encyclopediavirginia.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors issued an order for the sterilization of Buck, and her guardian appealed the case to the [[Circuit Court]] of Amherst County, which sustained the decision of the Board. The case then moved to the [[Supreme Court of Appeals]] of Virginia.

The appellate court sustained the sterilization law as compliant with both the state and federal constitutions, and it then went to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Buck and her guardian contended that the due process clause guarantees all adults the right to procreate which was being violated. They also made the argument that the Equal Protection Clause in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] was being violated since not all similarly situated people were being treated the same. The sterilization law was only for the "feeble-minded" at certain state institutions and made no mention of other state institutions or those who were not in an institution.

On May 2, 1927, in an 8–1 decision, the Court accepted that she, her mother and her daughter were "feeble-minded" and "promiscuous,"&lt;ref&gt;The court's majority opinion states that the court accepted the diagnoses of the Virginia medical personnel, not looking into whether they were correct: "Carrie Buck is a feeble-minded white woman who was committed to the State Colony above mentioned in due form. She is the daughter of a feeble-minded mother in the same institution, and the mother of an illegitimate feeble-minded child." [http://supreme.justia.com/us/274/200/case.html#205 274 U.S. at 205]&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was in the state's interest to have her sterilized. The ruling legitimized Virginia's sterilization procedures until they were repealed in 1974.

The ruling was written by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]  In support of his argument that the interest of "public welfare" outweighed the interest of individuals in their bodily integrity, he argued:

{{quote|We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains [[compulsory vaccination]] is broad enough to cover [[cutting the Fallopian tubes]].&lt;ref name=Buck207&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/274/200/case.html#207 274 U.S. at 207].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Holmes concluded his argument by declaring that "Three generations of [[imbeciles]] are enough".&lt;ref name=Buck207/&gt; The sole dissenter in the court, Justice [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]], a devout Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohns.edu/media/3/3528210f8dba49ee9fd325e9db9e987f.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113015710/http://www.stjohns.edu/media/3/3528210f8dba49ee9fd325e9db9e987f.pdf |archivedate=January 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }} "Silent Protest: A Catholic Justice Dissents in Buck v. Bell"&lt;/ref&gt; did not write a [[dissenting opinion]].

Carrie Buck was operated upon, receiving a compulsory [[salpingectomy]] (a form of [[tubal ligation]]). She was later paroled from the institution as a domestic worker to a family in [[Bland, Virginia]]. She was an avid reader until her death in 1983. Her daughter Vivian had been pronounced "feeble minded" after a cursory examination by ERO field worker Dr. Arthur Estabrook.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; According to his report, Vivian "showed backwardness",&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; thus the "three generations" of the majority opinion. It is worth noting that the child did very well in school for the two years that she attended (she died of complications from [[measles]] in 1932), even being listed on her school's honor roll in April 1931.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

Historian [[Paul A. Lombardo]] argued in 1985 that Buck was not "feeble-minded" at all, but that she had been put away to hide her rape, perpetrated by the nephew of her adoptive mother.&lt;ref name="Lombardo 1985 30–62"/&gt;  He also asserted that Buck's lawyer, Irving Whitehead, poorly argued her case, failed to call important witnesses, and was remarked by commentators to often not know what side he was on. It is now thought that this was not because of incompetence, but deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Murdoch |first=Stephen |title=IQ: A Smart History of a Failed Idea |year=2007 |pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead had close connections to the counsel for the institution and to Priddy.  Whitehead was a member of the governing board of the state institution in which Buck resided, had personally authorized Priddy's sterilization requests, and was a strong supporter of eugenic sterilization.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Effect of the ruling==

The effect of ''Buck v. Bell'' was to legitimize [[eugenic sterilization]] laws in the United States as a whole. While many states already had sterilization laws on their books, their use was erratic and effects practically non-existent in every state except for [[California]]. After ''Buck v. Bell'', dozens of states added new sterilization statutes, or updated their constitutionally non-functional ones already enacted, with statutes which more closely mirrored the Virginia statute upheld by the Court.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Peter (February/March 2003).

The Virginia statute which the ruling of ''Buck v. Bell'' supported was designed in part by the eugenicist [[Harry H. Laughlin]], superintendent of [[Charles Benedict Davenport]]'s [[Eugenics Record Office]] in [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York]]. Laughlin had, a few years previously, conducted a number of studies on the enforcement of sterilization legislation throughout the country and had concluded that the reason for their lack of use was primarily that the physicians who would order the sterilizations were afraid of prosecution by patients whom they operated upon. Laughlin saw the need to create a "Model Law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~wellerst/laughlin/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709175251/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~wellerst/laughlin/ |archivedate=July 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} Harvard website&lt;/ref&gt; which could withstand a test of constitutional scrutiny, clearing the way for future sterilization operations.  [[Adolf Hitler]] closely modelled his [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] on Laughlin's "Model Law".  The [[Third Reich]] held Laughlin in such regard that they arranged for him to receive an honorary doctorate from [[Heidelberg University]] in 1936.  At the [[Nuremberg trials]] after [[World War II]], Nazi doctors explicitly cited Holmes's opinion in Buck v. Bell as part of their defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Better for All the World: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity | last = Bruinius | first = Harry | publisher = [[Vintage Books]] | place = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-375-71305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterilization rates under eugenic laws in the United States climbed from 1927 until ''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma]]'', 316 U.S. 535 (1942). While ''Skinner v. Oklahoma'' did not specifically overturn ''Buck v. Bell'', it created enough of a legal quandary to discourage many sterilizations. By 1963, sterilization laws were almost wholly out of use, though some remained officially on the books for many years. Language referring to eugenics was removed from Virginia's sterilization law, and the current law, passed in 1988 and amended in 2013, only authorizes the voluntary [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] of those 18 and older, after the patient has given written consent and the doctor has informed the patient of the "consequences" as well as "alternative methods of contraception".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/eugenics/VA/VA.html | title=Eugenics: Compulsory Sterilization in 50 American States - Virginia | publisher=Lutz Kaelber, Associate Professor of Sociology, University of Vermont | accessdate=2013-05-14 | author=Kaelber, Lutz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[General Assembly of Virginia]] | title=Sexual Sterilization, Virginia Code §§ 54.1-2974 - 54.1-2980 | url=https://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+54.1-2974 | access-date=May 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Carrie Buck's sterilization and the court case was made into a television drama in 1994, ''[[Against Her Will: The Carrie Buck Story]]''. It was also referred to in 1934's sensational film ''[[Tomorrow's Children]]'', and was covered in the October 2018 ''[[American Experience (season 30)|American Experience]]'' documentary "The Eugenics Crusade".

Although this opinion and eugenics remain controversial, the decision in this case still stands. ''Buck v. Bell'' was cited as a precedent by the opinion of the court (part VIII) in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', but not in support of abortion rights. To the contrary, [[Justice Blackmun]] quoted it to justify that the constitutional right to abortion is not unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Roe v. Wade|volume=410|page=113|pin=154|year=1973}} ("The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim asserted by some amici that one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past.")&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1996 case of ''Fieger v. Thomas'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] both recognized and criticized ''Buck v. Bell''  by writing "as Justice Holmes pointed out in the only part of ''Buck v. Bell'' that remains unrepudiated, a claim of a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] based upon selective enforcement 'is the usual last resort of constitutional arguments.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/074/74.F3d.740.94-2379.94-2378.html Fieger v. Thomas], 74 F.3d 740, 750 (6th Cir. 1996) ("This claim of selective prosecution really amounts to a weak equal protection claim. And, as Justice Holmes pointed out in the only part of ''Buck v. Bell'' that remains unrepudiated, a claim of a violation of the Equal Protection Clause based upon selective enforcement 'is the usual last resort of constitutional arguments.'”).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] cited ''Buck v. Bell'' to protect the constitutional rights of a woman coerced into sterilization without procedural due process.&lt;ref name ="vaughn"&gt;{{ cite web | publisher=Case Text  | title=Vaughn v. Ruoff, 253 F.3d 1124, 1129 (8th Cir. 2001) | url=https://casetext.com/case/vaughn-v-ruoff | quote=It is true that involuntary sterilization is not always unconstitutional if it is a narrowly tailored means to achieve a compelling government interest. See Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200, 207–08, 47 S.Ct. 584, 71 L.Ed. 1000 (rejecting due process and equal protection challenges to compelled sterilization of mentally handicapped woman). It is also true that the mentally handicapped, depending on their circumstances, may be subjected to various degrees of government intrusion that would be unjustified if directed at other segments of society. See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 442–47, 105 S.Ct. 3249; Buck, 274 U.S. at 207–08, 47 S.Ct. 584. It does not follow, however, that the State can dispense with procedural protections, coerce an individual into sterilization, and then after the fact argue that it was justified. If it did, it would invite conduct, like that alleged in this case, that is ripe for abuse and error.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that error and abuse will result if the state does not follow the procedural requirements, established by ''Buck v. Bell'', for performing an involuntary sterilization.&lt;ref name="vaughn"/&gt;

'''Chlorine''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Cl''' and [[atomic number]] 17. The second-lightest of the [[halogen]]s, it appears between [[fluorine]] and [[bromine]] in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong [[oxidising agent]]: among the elements, it has the highest [[electron affinity]] and the third-highest [[electronegativity]], behind only [[oxygen]] and fluorine.

The most common compound of chlorine, [[sodium chloride]] (common salt), has been known since ancient times. Around 1630, chlorine gas was first synthesised in a chemical reaction, but not recognised as a fundamentally important substance. [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] wrote a description of chlorine gas in 1774, supposing it to be an [[oxide]] of a new element. In 1809, chemists suggested that the gas might be a pure element, and this was confirmed by [[Sir Humphry Davy]] in 1810, who named it from {{lang-grc|χλωρός|khlôros|pale green}} based on its colour.

Because of its great reactivity, all chlorine in the Earth's crust is in the form of [[ion]]ic [[chloride]] compounds, which includes table salt. It is the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|second-most abundant]] [[halogen]] (after fluorine) and twenty-first most abundant chemical element in Earth's crust. These crustal deposits are nevertheless dwarfed by the huge reserves of chloride in seawater.

Elemental chlorine is commercially produced from [[brine]] by [[electrolysis]]. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine led to the development of commercial [[Bleach (chemical)|bleaches]] and [[disinfectant]]s, and a [[reagent]] for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as [[polyvinyl chloride]], and many intermediates for the production of [[plastics]] and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in [[swimming pool]]s to keep them clean and [[swimming pool sanitation|sanitary]]. Elemental chlorine at high [[concentration]]s is extremely dangerous and [[poisonous]] for all living organisms, and was used in [[World War I]] as the first gaseous [[chemical warfare]] agent.

In the form of chloride [[ions]], chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the [[upper atmosphere]], chlorine-containing organic molecules such as [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s have been implicated in [[ozone depletion]]. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to [[hypochlorite]] in [[neutrophil]]s as part of the immune response against bacteria.

==History==
[[File:PSM V31 D740 Carl Wilhelm Scheele.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|[[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], discoverer of chlorine]]
The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride, has been known since ancient times; archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used as early as 3000 BC and brine as early as 6000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/weller/ |title=The earliest salt production in the world: an early Neolithic exploitation in Poiana Slatinei-Lunca, Romania |accessdate=2008-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430145935/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/weller/ |archivedate=April 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its importance in food was very well known in [[classical antiquity]] and was sometimes used as payment for services for Roman generals and military tribunes. Elemental chlorine was probably first isolated around 1200 with the discovery of ''[[aqua regia]]'' and its ability to dissolve gold, since chlorine gas is one of the products of this reaction: it was however not recognised as a new substance. Around 1630, chlorine was recognized as a gas by the Flemish chemist and physician [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood789&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 789–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Helmont|first1=Joannis Baptistae|title=Opera omnia [All Works]|date=1682|publisher=Johann Just Erythropel|location=Frankfurt-am-Main, (Germany)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qy5AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5#v=onepage&amp;q=flatibus&amp;f=false|language=Latin}}  From ''"Complexionum atque mistionum elementalium figmentum."''

(Take equal parts of saltpeter [i.e., sodium nitrate], vitriol [i.e., concentrated sulfuric acid], and alum:  dry each and combine simultaneously; distill off the water [i.e., liquid].

Take four ounces of this [viz, nitric acid], add one ounce of Armenian salt [i.e., ammonium chloride], [place it] in a strong glass alembic sealed by cement ([made] from wax, rosin, and powdered glass) [that has been] poured very hot; soon, even in the cold, gas is stimulated, and the vessel, however strong, bursts into fragments.) From ''"De Flatibus"'' (On gases), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qy5AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA408#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 408]:  ''"Sal armeniacus enim, &amp; aqua chrysulca, quae singula per se distillari, possunt, &amp; pati calorem:  sin autem jungantur, &amp; intepescant, non possunt non, quin statim in Gas sylvestre, sive incoercibilem flatum transmutentur."''  (Truly Armenian salt [i.e., ammonium chloride] and nitric acid, each of which can be distilled by itself, and submitted to heat; but if, on the other hand, they be combined and become warm, they cannot but be changed immediately into carbon dioxide [note:  van Helmont’s identification of the gas is mistaken] or an incondensable gas.)&lt;br&gt;

The element was first studied in detail in 1774 by Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], and he is credited with the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheele|first1=Carl Wilhelm|title=Om Brunsten, eller Magnesia, och dess Egenskaper|journal=Kongliga Vetenskaps Academiens Handlingar [Proceedings of the Royal Scientific Academy]|date=1774|volume=35|pages=89–116, 177–194|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015039452910;view=1up;seq=99|trans-title=On braunstein [i.e., pyrolusite, manganese dioxide], or magnesia, and its properties|language=Swedish}} [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015039452910;view=1up;seq=103 In section 6 on pp. 93–94 of his paper], Scheele described how chlorine was produced when a mixture of hydrochloric acid and manganese dioxide (''Brunsten'') was heated: ''"6) (a) På 1/2 uns fint rifven Brunsten slogs 1 uns ren Spiritus salis. … samt lukten fo̊rsvunnen."'' ( 6) (a) On one half ounce of finely ground Braunstein [pyrolusite] was poured one ounce of pure ''spiritus salis'' [spirit of salt, hydrogen chloride]. After this mixture had been standing in the cold for one hour, the acid had assumed a dark brown colour. One part of this solution was poured into a glass, which was placed over the fire. The solution gave off an odour like warm ''aqua regia'' and after one quarter’s hour duration, it was as clear and colourless as water, and the smell had disappeared.)

Scheele observed several of the properties of chlorine: the bleaching effect on [[Litmus test (chemistry)|litmus]], the deadly effect on insects, the yellow-green color, and the smell similar to [[aqua regia]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood792&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 792–93&lt;/ref&gt; He called it "''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air''" since it is a gas (then called "airs") and it came from [[hydrochloric acid]] (then known as "muriatic acid").&lt;ref name=krogt/&gt; He failed to establish chlorine as an element.&lt;ref name=krogt/&gt;

Common chemical theory at that time held that an acid is a compound that contains oxygen (remnants of this survive in the German and Dutch names of [[oxygen]]: ''sauerstoff'' or ''zuurstof'', both translating into English as ''acid substance''), so a number of chemists, including [[Claude Berthollet]], suggested that Scheele's ''dephlogisticated muriatic acid air'' must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, ''muriaticum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA158|page=158|title=The development of modern chemistry|author=Ihde, Aaron John|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|date=1984|isbn=978-0-486-64235-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1915|title = The discovery of the elements.

("In fact, oxygenated muriatic acid is not decomposed by charcoal, and it might be supposed, from this fact and those that are communicated in this Memoir, that this gas is a simple body.

The resulting liquid, known as "''Eau de Javel''" ("[[Javel water]]"), was a weak solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]].

Elemental chlorine solutions dissolved in [[base (chemistry)|chemically basic]] water (sodium and [[calcium hypochlorite]]) were first used as anti-[[putrefaction]] agents and [[disinfectant]]s in the 1820s, in France, long before the establishment of the [[germ theory of disease]].

[[File:Die chemischen elemente cl.jpg|thumb|Solid chlorine at −150&amp;nbsp;°C]]
Chlorine is the second [[halogen]], being a [[nonmetal]] in group 17 of the periodic table. Its properties are thus similar to [[fluorine]], [[bromine]], and [[iodine]], and are largely intermediate between those of the first two. Chlorine has the electron configuration [Ne]3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, with the seven electrons in the third and outermost shell acting as its [[valence electron]]s. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 800–4&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to [[periodic trend]]s, it is intermediate in [[electronegativity]] between fluorine and bromine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than fluorine and more reactive than bromine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine, but a stronger one than bromine. Conversely, the [[chloride]] ion is a weaker reducing agent than bromide, but a stronger one than fluoride.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; It is intermediate in [[atomic radius]] between fluorine and bromine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties similarly continuing the trend from iodine to bromine upward, such as first [[ionisation energy]], [[electron affinity]], enthalpy of dissociation of the X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. (Fluorine is anomalous due to its small size.)&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

All four stable halogens experience intermolecular [[van der Waals force]]s of attraction, and their strength increases together with the number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of chlorine are intermediate between those of fluorine and bromine: chlorine melts at −101.0&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at −34.0&amp;nbsp;°C. As a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of chlorine are again intermediate between those of bromine and fluorine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: thus, while fluorine is a pale yellow gas, chlorine is distinctly yellow-green. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as chlorine, results from the [[atomic electron transition|electron transition]] between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] antibonding ''π&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding ''σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' molecular orbital.&lt;ref name=Greenwood804&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 804–09&lt;/ref&gt; The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid chlorine at −195&amp;nbsp;°C is almost colourless.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

Like solid bromine and iodine, solid chlorine crystallises in the [[orthorhombic crystal system]], in a layered lattice of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. The Cl–Cl distance is 198&amp;nbsp;pm (close to the gaseous Cl–Cl distance of 199&amp;nbsp;pm) and the Cl···Cl distance between molecules is 332&amp;nbsp;pm within a layer and 382&amp;nbsp;pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of chlorine, 180&amp;nbsp;pm). This structure means that chlorine is a very poor conductor of electricity, and indeed its conductivity is so low as to be practically unmeasurable.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of chlorine}}
Chlorine has two stable isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl and &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl. These are its only two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl making up the remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the [[oxygen-burning process|oxygen-burning]] and [[silicon-burning process]]es.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cameron |first1=A. G.

The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with [[half-life|half-lives]] too short to occur in nature [[primordial element|primordially]]. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.0×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;y) and &lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;Cl (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 37.2&amp;nbsp;min), which may be produced from the [[neutron activation]] of natural chlorine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

The most stable chlorine radioisotope is &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is [[electron capture]] to isotopes of [[sulfur]]; that of isotopes heavier than &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is [[beta decay]] to isotopes of [[argon]]; and &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl may decay by either mode to stable &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;S or &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Ar.&lt;ref name=NUBASE&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003 |title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923135135/http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-23 |journal=[[Nuclear Physics A]] |volume=729 |issue=1 |pages=3–128 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 |bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |last1=Audi |first1=G. |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A.

Chlorine is intermediate in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, and is one of the most reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the [[standard electrode potential]]s of the X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; couples (F, +2.866&amp;thinsp;V; Cl, +1.395&amp;thinsp;V; Br, +1.087&amp;thinsp;V; I, +0.615&amp;thinsp;V; At, approximately +0.3&amp;thinsp;V). However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. Chlorination often leads to higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states to fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood804/&gt;

Given that E°({{sfrac|1|2}}O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) = +1.229&amp;thinsp;V, which is less than +1.395&amp;thinsp;V, it would be expected that chlorine should be able to oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble [[overpotential]] effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood853&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 853–56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen chloride===
[[File:DCl Neutron powder.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Structure of solid deuterium chloride, with D···Cl hydrogen bonds]]
The simplest chlorine compound is [[hydrogen chloride]], HCl, a major chemical in industry as well as in the laboratory, both as a gas and dissolved in water as [[hydrochloric acid]]. It is often produced by burning hydrogen gas in chlorine gas, or as a byproduct of chlorinating [[hydrocarbon]]s. Another approach is to treat [[sodium chloride]] with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] to produce hydrochloric acid, also known as the "salt-cake" process:&lt;ref name=Greenwood809/&gt;
:NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{overunderset|⟶|150&amp;thinsp;°C|&amp;thinsp;}} NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl
:NaCl + NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{overunderset|⟶|540–600&amp;thinsp;°C|&amp;thinsp;}} Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl
In the laboratory, hydrogen chloride gas may be made by drying the acid with concentrated sulfuric acid. [[Deuterium chloride]], DCl, may be produced by reacting [[benzoyl chloride]] with [[heavy water]] (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name=Greenwood809&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 809–12&lt;/ref&gt;

At room temperature, hydrogen chloride is a colourless gas, like all the hydrogen halides apart from [[hydrogen fluoride]], since hydrogen cannot form strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen chloride at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised.&lt;ref name=Greenwood809/&gt; Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system has many hydrates HCl·''n''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an [[azeotrope]] with boiling point 108.58&amp;thinsp;°C at 20.22&amp;thinsp;g HCl per 100&amp;thinsp;g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.&lt;ref name=Greenwood812&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous liquid hydrogen chloride is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its [[dielectric constant]] is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and {{chem|HCl|2|-}} ions – the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the [[bifluoride]] ions ({{chem|HF|2|-}}) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and chlorine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[quaternary ammonium cation|{{chem|NR|4|+}}]] (R = [[methyl group|Me]], [[ethyl group|Et]], [[butyl group|Bu&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;]]) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride is a poor solvent, only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as [[nitrosyl chloride]] and [[phenol]], or salts with very low [[lattice energy|lattice energies]] such as tetraalkylammonium halides. It readily protonates [[electrophile]]s containing lone-pairs or π bonds. [[Solvolysis]], [[ligand]] replacement reactions, and oxidations are well-characterised in hydrogen chloride solution:&lt;ref name=Greenwood818&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 818–19&lt;/ref&gt;
:Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SnCl + HCl ⟶ Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + PhH (solvolysis)
:Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COH + 3 HCl ⟶ {{chem|Ph|3|C|+|HCl|2|-}} + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (solvolysis)
:{{chem|Me|4|N|+|HCl|2|-}} + BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ⟶ {{chem|Me|4|N|+|BCl|4|-}} + HCl (ligand replacement)
:PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl ⟶ {{chem|PCl|4|+|HCl|2|-}} (oxidation)

===Other binary chlorides===
[[File:Nickel(II)-chloride-hexahydrate-sample.jpg|thumb|right|Hydrated [[nickel(II) chloride]], NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
Nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary chlorides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the [[noble gas]]es, with the exception of [[xenon]] in the highly unstable [[xenon dichloride|XeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and XeCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond [[bismuth]]); and having an electronegativity higher than chlorine's ([[oxygen]] and [[fluorine]]) so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not chlorides but rather oxides or fluorides of chlorine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood821&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821–44&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorination of metals with Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; usually leads to a higher oxidation state than bromination with Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when multiple oxidation states are available, such as in [[molybdenum(V) chloride|MoCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[molybdenum(III) bromide|MoBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Chlorides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydrochloric acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas. These methods work best when the chloride product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative chlorination of the element with chlorine or hydrogen chloride, high-temperature chlorination of a metal oxide or other halide by chlorine, a volatile metal chloride, [[carbon tetrachloride]], or an organic chloride. For instance, [[zirconium dioxide]] reacts with chlorine at standard conditions to produce [[zirconium tetrachloride]], and [[uranium trioxide]] reacts with [[hexachloropropene]] when heated under [[reflux]] to give [[uranium tetrachloride]]. The second example also involves a reduction in [[oxidation state]], which can also be achieved by reducing a higher chloride using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent. This may also be achieved by thermal decomposition or disproportionation as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;
: EuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1|2}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⟶ EuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl
: ReCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{overunderset|⟶|at "bp"|&amp;thinsp;}} ReCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: AuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{overunderset|⟶|160&amp;thinsp;°C|&amp;thinsp;}} AuCl + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Most of the chlorides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular chlorides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. [[Silver chloride]] is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for chlorine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;

===Polychlorine compounds===
Although dichlorine is a strong oxidising agent with a high first ionisation energy, it may be oxidised under extreme conditions to form the {{chem|Cl|2|+}} cation. This is very unstable and has only been characterised by its electronic band spectrum when produced in a low-pressure discharge tube. The yellow {{chem|Cl|3|+}} cation is more stable and may be produced as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood842&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 842–44&lt;/ref&gt;
:Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ClF + AsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{overunderset|⟶|−78&amp;thinsp;°C|&amp;thinsp;}} {{chem|Cl|3|+|AsF|6|-}}
This reaction is conducted in the oxidising solvent [[arsenic pentafluoride]]. The trichloride anion, {{chem|Cl|3|-}}, has also been characterised; it is analogous to [[triiodide]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood824/&gt;

===Chlorine fluorides===
The three fluorides of chlorine form a subset of the [[interhalogen]] compounds, all of which are [[diamagnetic]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood824&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 824–8&lt;/ref&gt; Some cationic and anionic derivatives are known, such as {{chem|ClF|2|-}}, {{chem|ClF|4|-}}, {{chem|ClF|2|+}}, and Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood835&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 835–42&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]] of chlorine are also known, such as [[cyanogen chloride]] (ClCN, linear), chlorine [[cyanate]] (ClNCO), chlorine [[thiocyanate]] (ClSCN, unlike its oxygen counterpart), and chlorine [[azide]] (ClN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Greenwood824/&gt;

[[Chlorine monofluoride]] (ClF) is extremely thermally stable, and is sold commercially in 500-gram steel lecture bottles. It is a colourless gas that melts at −155.6&amp;thinsp;°C and boils at −100.1&amp;thinsp;°C. It may be produced by the direction of its elements at 225&amp;thinsp;°C, though it must then be separated and purified from [[chlorine trifluoride]] and its reactants. Its properties are mostly intermediate between those of chlorine and fluorine. It will react with many metals and nonmetals from room temperature and above, fluorinating them and liberating chlorine. It will also act as a chlorofluorinating agent, adding chlorine and fluorine across a multiple bond or by oxidation: for example, it will attack [[carbon monoxide]] to form [[carbonyl chlorofluoride]], COFCl. It will react analogously with [[hexafluoroacetone]], (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, with a [[potassium fluoride]] catalyst to produce [[heptafluoroisopropyl hypochlorite]], (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CFOCl; with [[nitrile]]s RCN to produce RCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; and with the sulfur oxides SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to produce ClOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F and ClSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F respectively. It will also react exothermically and violently with compounds containing –OH and –NH groups, such as water:&lt;ref name=Greenwood824/&gt;
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 ClF ⟶ 2 HF + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[[Chlorine trifluoride]] (ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a volatile colourless molecular liquid which melts at −76.3&amp;thinsp;°C and boils at 11.8&amp;thinsp;°C. It may be formed by directly fluorinating gaseous chlorine or chlorine monofluoride at 200–300&amp;thinsp;°C. It is one of the most reactive known chemical compounds, reacting with many substances which in ordinary circumstances would be considered chemically inert, such as [[asbestos]], concrete, and sand. It explodes on contact with water and most organic substances. The list of elements it sets on fire is diverse, containing [[hydrogen]], [[potassium]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[sulfur]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and powdered [[molybdenum]], [[tungsten]], [[rhodium]], [[iridium]], and [[iron]]. An impermeable fluoride layer is formed by [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[aluminium]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], and [[silver]], which may be removed by heating. When heated, even such [[noble metal]]s as [[palladium]], [[platinum]], and [[gold]] are attacked and even the [[noble gas]]es [[xenon]] and [[radon]] do not escape fluorination. [[Nickel]] containers are usually used due to that metal's great resistance to attack by chlorine trifluoride, stemming from the formation of an unreactive nickel fluoride layer. Its reaction with [[hydrazine]] to form hydrogen fluoride, nitrogen, and chlorine gases was used in experimental rocket motors, but has problems largely stemming from its extreme [[Hypergolic propellant|hypergolicity]] resulting in ignition without any measurable delay. For these reasons, it was used in bomb attacks during the [[Second World War]] by the Nazis. Today, it is mostly used in nuclear fuel processing, to oxidise [[uranium]] to [[uranium hexafluoride]] for its enriching and to separate it from [[plutonium]]. It can act as a fluoride ion donor or acceptor (Lewis base or acid), although it does not dissociate appreciably into {{chem|ClF|2|+}} and {{chem|ClF|4|-}} ions.&lt;ref name=Greenwood828&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 828–31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chlorine pentafluoride]] (ClF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is made on a large scale by direct fluorination of chlorine with excess [[fluorine]] gas at 350&amp;thinsp;°C and 250&amp;thinsp;atm, and on a small scale by reacting metal chlorides with fluorine gas at 100–300&amp;thinsp;°C. It melts at −103&amp;thinsp;°C and boils at −13.1&amp;thinsp;°C. It is a very strong fluorinating agent, although it is still not as effective as chlorine trifluoride. Only a few specific stoichiometric reactions have been characterised. [[Arsenic pentafluoride]] and [[antimony pentafluoride]] form ionic adducts of the form [ClF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[MF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = As, Sb) and water reacts vigorously as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood832&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 832–35&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ClF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ⟶ 4 HF + FClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The product, [[chloryl fluoride]], is one of the five known chlorine oxide fluorides. These range from the thermally unstable FClO to the chemically unreactive [[perchloryl fluoride]] (FClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), the other three being FClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ClO, and F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. All five behave similarly to the chlorine fluorides, both structurally and chemically, and may act as Lewis acids or bases by gaining or losing fluoride ions respectively or as very strong oxidising and fluorinating agents.&lt;ref name=Greenwood875&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 875–80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chlorine oxides===
[[File:Chlorine dioxide gas and solution.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow [[chlorine dioxide]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas above a yellow chlorine dioxide solution. Solutions of pure chlorine dioxide are dark green: this solution is yellow due to impurities produced from its photodecomposition.]]
[[File:Dichlorine-heptoxide-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|Structure of [[dichlorine heptoxide]], Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, the most stable of the chlorine oxides]]
The [[chlorine oxide]]s are well-studied in spite of their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer. None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.&lt;ref name=Greenwood844&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 844–50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dichlorine monoxide]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) which may be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow [[mercury(II) oxide]]. It is very soluble in water, in which it is in equilibrium with [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make [[hypochlorite]]s. It explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of ammonia gas.&lt;ref name=Greenwood844/&gt;

[[Chlorine dioxide]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was the first chlorine oxide to be discovered in 1811 by [[Humphry Davy]]. It is a yellow paramagnetic gas (deep-red as a solid or liquid), as expected from its having an odd number of electrons: it is stable towards dimerisation due to the delocalisation of the unpaired electron. It explodes above −40&amp;thinsp;°C as a liquid and under pressure as a gas and therefore must be made at low concentrations for wood-pulp bleaching and water treatment. It is usually prepared by reducing a [[chlorate]] as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood844/&gt;
:{{chem|ClO|3|-}} + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ⟶ ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1|2}} Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Its production is thus intimately linked to the redox reactions of the chlorine oxoacids. It is a strong oxidising agent, reacting with [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], phosphorus halides, and [[potassium borohydride]]. It dissolves exothermically in water to form dark-green solutions that very slowly decompose in the dark. Crystalline clathrate hydrates ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·''n''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''n'' ≈ 6–10) separate out at low temperatures. However, in the presence of light, these solutions rapidly photodecompose to form a mixture of chloric and hydrochloric acids. Photolysis of individual ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules result in the radicals ClO and ClOO, while at room temperature mostly chlorine, oxygen, and some ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; are produced. Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is also produced when photolysing the solid at −78&amp;thinsp;°C: it is a dark brown solid that explodes below 0&amp;thinsp;°C. The ClO radical leads to the depletion of atmospheric ozone and is thus environmentally important as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood844/&gt;
:Cl• + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ⟶ ClO• + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:ClO• + O• ⟶ Cl• + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Chlorine perchlorate]] (ClOClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a pale yellow liquid that is less stable than ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine, oxygen, and [[dichlorine hexoxide]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Greenwood844/&gt; Chlorine perchlorate may also be considered a chlorine derivative of [[perchloric acid]] (HOClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include [[chlorine nitrate]] (ClONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, vigorously reactive and explosive), and [[chlorine fluorosulfate]] (ClOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive).&lt;ref name=Greenwood883&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 883–5&lt;/ref&gt; Dichlorine hexoxide is a dark-red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at −180&amp;thinsp;°C: it is usually made by reaction of chlorine dioxide with oxygen. Despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, it reacts more as though it were chloryl perchlorate, [ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which has been confirmed to be the correct structure of the solid. It hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids: the analogous reaction with anhydrous [[hydrogen fluoride]] does not proceed to completion.&lt;ref name=Greenwood844/&gt;

[[Dichlorine heptoxide]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) is the anhydride of [[perchloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and can readily be obtained from it by dehydrating it with [[phosphoric acid]] at −10&amp;thinsp;°C and then distilling the product at −35&amp;thinsp;°C and 1&amp;thinsp;mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being the only one to not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood844/&gt;

Chlorine forms four oxoacids: [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl), [[chlorous acid]] (HOClO), [[chloric acid]] (HOClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[perchloric acid]] (HOClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). As can be seen from the redox potentials given in the adjacent table, chlorine is much more stable towards disproportionation in acidic solutions than in alkaline solutions:&lt;ref name=Greenwood853/&gt;
:{|
|-
| Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O || {{eqm}} HOCl + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; || ''K''&lt;sub&gt;ac&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; l&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;

The hypochlorite ions also disproportionate further to produce chloride and chlorate (3 ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} 2 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + {{chem|ClO|3|-}}) but this reaction is quite slow at temperatures below 70&amp;thinsp;°C in spite of the very favourable equilibrium constant of 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;. The chlorate ions may themselves disproportionate to form chloride and perchlorate (4 {{chem|ClO|3|-}} {{eqm}} Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 {{chem|ClO|4|-}}) but this is still very slow even at 100&amp;thinsp;°C despite the very favourable equilibrium constant of 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;. The rates of reaction for the chlorine oxyanions increases as the oxidation state of chlorine decreases. The strengths of the chlorine oxyacids increase very quickly as the oxidation state of chlorine increases due to the increasing delocalisation of charge over more and more oxygen atoms in their conjugate bases.&lt;ref name=Greenwood853/&gt;

Most of the chlorine oxoacids may be produced by exploiting these disproportionation reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, [[sodium chlorite]] is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and as a source of chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is [[sodium chlorate]], mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp. The decomposition of chlorate to chloride and oxygen is a common way to produce oxygen in the laboratory on a small scale. Chloride and chlorate may comproportionate to form chlorine as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood856&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 856–70&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{chem|ClO|3|-}} + 5 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ⟶ 3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Perchlorates and perchloric acid (HOClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are the most stable oxo-compounds of chlorine, in keeping with the fact that chlorine compounds are most stable when the chlorine atom is in its lowest (−1) or highest (+7) possible oxidation states. Perchloric acid and aqueous perchlorates are vigorous and sometimes violent oxidising agents when heated, in stark contrast to their mostly inactive nature at room temperature due to the high activation energies for these reactions for kinetic reasons. Perchlorates are made by electrolytically oxidising sodium chlorate, and perchloric acid is made by reacting anhydrous [[sodium perchlorate]] or [[barium perchlorate]] with concentrated hydrochloric acid, filtering away the chloride precipitated and distilling the filtrate to concentrate it. Anhydrous perchloric acid is a colourless mobile liquid that is sensitive to shock that explodes on contact with most organic compounds, sets [[hydrogen iodide]] and [[thionyl chloride]] on fire and even oxidises silver and gold. Although it is a weak ligand, weaker than water, a few compounds involving coordinated {{chem|ClO|4|-}} are known.&lt;ref name=Greenwood856/&gt;

Like the other carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Cl bond is a common functional group that forms part of core [[organic chemistry]]. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the chloride anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between chlorine (3.16) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Cl bond is electron-deficient and thus [[electrophilic]]. [[Chlorination reaction|Chlorination]] modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways: chlorocarbons are typically denser than [[water]] due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen, and aliphatic organochlorides are [[alkylating agent]]s because chloride is a [[leaving group]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;M. Rossberg et al. "Chlorinated Hydrocarbons" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alkanes]] and [[aryl]] alkanes may be chlorinated under free radical conditions, with UV light. However, the extent of chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not [[regioselectivity|regioselective]] and often results in a mixture of various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the [[Friedel-Crafts halogenation]], using chlorine and a [[Lewis acid]] catalyst.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The [[haloform reaction]], using chlorine and [[sodium hydroxide]], is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as [[phosphorus pentachloride]] (PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[thionyl chloride]] (SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and do not have to be distilled out.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Many organochlorine compounds have been isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans.&lt;ref name="Gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Naturally Occurring Organohalogen Compounds | author = Gordon W.

Some types of organochlorides, though not all, have significant toxicity to plants or animals, including humans. Dioxins, produced when organic matter is burned in the presence of chlorine, and some insecticides, such as [[DDT]], are [[persistent organic pollutant]]s which pose dangers when they are released into the environment. For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid 20th century, also accumulates in food chains, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Ecotoxicology | publisher=Blackwell Science | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-632-03852-7 | page=68 | author=Connell, D.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ready homolytic fission of the C–Cl bond to create chlorine radicals in the upper atmosphere, [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s have been phased out due to the harm they do to the ozone layer.&lt;ref name=Greenwood844/&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
{{Main|Chlorine production|Chloralkali process}}
[[File:Liquid chlorine in flask.jpg|upright|thumb|Liquid chlorine analysis]]
Chlorine is too reactive to occur as the free element in nature but is very abundant in the form of its chloride salts. It is the twentieth most abundant element in Earth's crust and makes up 126&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] of it, through the large deposits of chloride minerals, especially [[sodium chloride]], that have been evaporated from water bodies. All of these pale in comparison to the reserves of chloride ions in seawater: smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground [[brine]] wells, such as the [[Great Salt Lake]] in Utah and the [[Dead Sea]] in Israel.&lt;ref name=Greenwood795&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 795&lt;/ref&gt;

Small batches of chlorine gas are prepared in the laboratory by combining hydrochloric acid and [[manganese dioxide]], but the need rarely arises due to its ready availability. In industry, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. This method, the [[chloralkali process]] industrialized in 1892, now provides most industrial chlorine gas.&lt;ref name="Greenwood798"/&gt; Along with chlorine, the method yields [[hydrogen]] gas and [[sodium hydroxide]], which is the most valuable product. The process proceeds according to the following [[chemical equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg|page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 NaCl + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaOH

The electrolysis of chloride solutions all proceed according to the following equations:

:Cathode: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:Anode: 2 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an [[asbestos]] (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an [[anode]], preventing the chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode.&lt;ref name="Euro Chlor3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-diaphragm-cell-process.aspx|title=The diaphragm cell process|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111191151/http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-diaphragm-cell-process.aspx|archivedate=2011-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the [[Causticity|caustic]] [[alkali]] is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, but they are not burdened with the problem of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] disposal and they are more energy efficient.&lt;ref name=Greenwood798/&gt;

Membrane cell electrolysis employs [[Semipermeable membrane|permeable membrane]] as an [[ion exchange]]r. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment, leaving at a lower [[concentration]]. This method also produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide but has the disadvantage of requiring very pure brine at high concentrations.&lt;ref name="Euro Chlor4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-membrane-cell-process.aspx|title=The membrane cell process|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111190719/http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-membrane-cell-process.aspx|archivedate=2011-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chloralkali membrane.svg|center|upright=2.75|thumb|Membrane cell process for chloralkali production]]

In the [[Deacon process]], hydrogen chloride recovered from the production of [[organochlorine compound]]s is recovered as chlorine.  The process relies on oxidation using oxygen:
: 4 HCl + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The reaction requires a catalyst.  As introduced by Deacon, early catalysts were based on copper.  Commercial processes, such as the Mitsui MT-Chlorine Process, have switched to chromium and ruthenium-based catalysts.&lt;ref name=chlorine&gt;Schmittinger, Peter ''et al.'' (2006) "Chlorine" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co., {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a06_399.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chlorine produced is available in cylinders from sizes ranging from 450&amp;nbsp;g to 70&amp;nbsp;kg, as well as drums (865&amp;nbsp;kg), tank wagons (15&amp;nbsp;tonnes on roads; 27–90&amp;nbsp;tonnes by rail), and barges (600–1200&amp;nbsp;tonnes).&lt;ref name=Greenwood796&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 796–800&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Sodium chloride is by a huge margin the most common chlorine compound, and it is the main source of chlorine and hydrochloric acid for the enormous chlorine-chemicals industry today. About 15000 chlorine-containing compounds are commercially traded, including such diverse compounds as chlorinated [[methane]]s and [[ethane]]s, [[vinyl chloride]] and its polymer [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[aluminium trichloride]] for [[catalysis]], the chlorides of [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], [[zirconium]], and [[hafnium]] which are the precursors for producing the pure elements, and so on.&lt;ref name=Greenwood792/&gt;

Quantitatively, of all elemental chlorine produced, about 63% is used in the manufacture of organic compounds, and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}} About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=793}} The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products.&lt;ref name=Greenwood796/&gt; The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are [[1,2-dichloroethane]] and [[vinyl chloride]], intermediates in the production of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. Other particularly important organochlorines are [[methyl chloride]], [[methylene chloride]], [[chloroform]], [[vinylidene chloride]], [[trichloroethylene]], [[perchloroethylene]], [[allyl chloride]], [[epichlorohydrin]], [[chlorobenzene]], [[dichlorobenzene]]s, and [[trichlorobenzene]]s. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, HOCl, NaClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, chlorinated isocyanurates, [[aluminium chloride|AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[silicon tetrachloride|SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[tin(IV) chloride|SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[phosphorus trichloride|PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[phosphorus pentachloride|PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[phosphoryl chloride|POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[arsenic trichloride|AsCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[antimony trichloride|SbCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Antimony pentachloride|SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Bismuth chloride|BiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[disulfur dichloride|S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[sulfur dichloride|SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[thionyl chloride|SOCI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[chlorine trifluoride|ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[iodine monochloride|ICl]], [[iodine trichloride|ICl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[titanium(III) chloride|TiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[titanium(IV) chloride|TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[molybdenum(V) chloride|MoCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[iron(III) chloride|FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[zinc chloride|ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and so on.&lt;ref name=Greenwood796/&gt;

==== Combating putrefaction ====
[[File:A G Barraque.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine-Germain Labarraque]] ]]

In France (as elsewhere), [[Catgut|animal intestines]] were processed to make musical instrument strings, [[Goldbeater's skin]] and other products. This was done in "gut factories" (''boyauderies''), and it was an odiferous and unhealthy process. In or about 1820, the [[Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale]] offered a prize for the discovery of a method, chemical or mechanical, for separating the [[Peritoneum|peritoneal]] membrane of animal intestines without [[putrefaction]].&lt;ref name="nbu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite book |author=Knight, Charles |page=427 |title=Arts and sciences |volume=1 |publisher=Bradbury, Evans &amp; Co. |date=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize was won by [[Antoine-Germain Labarraque]], a 44-year-old French chemist and pharmacist who had discovered that Berthollet's chlorinated bleaching solutions ("''[[Javel water|Eau de Javel]]''") not only destroyed the smell of putrefaction of animal tissue decomposition, but also actually retarded the decomposition.&lt;ref name="knight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bouvet2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bouvet, Maurice |language=French |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/pharm_0035-2349_1950_num_38_128_8662 |trans-title=The great pharmacists: Labarraque (1777–1850) |title=Les grands pharmaciens: Labarraque (1777–1850) |journal=Revue d'Histoire de la Pharmacie |date=1950 |volume=38 |issue=128 |pages=97–107 |doi=10.3406/pharm.1950.8662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labarraque's research resulted in the use of chlorides and hypochlorites of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) and of sodium ([[sodium hypochlorite]]) in the ''boyauderies.''  The same chemicals were found to be useful in the routine [[Disinfectant|disinfection]] and deodorization of [[latrine]]s, [[sewerage|sewers]], markets, [[abattoir]]s, [[anatomical theatre]]s, and morgues.&lt;ref name="gedeon"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gédéon, Andras |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw9qq7Ghjp4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Science and technology in medicine |publisher=Springer |date=2006 |pages=181–82 |isbn=978-0-387-27874-2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220856/https://books.google.com/books?id=vw9qq7Ghjp4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |archivedate=2015-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were successful in [[hospital]]s, [[Lazaretto|lazarets]], [[prison]]s, [[Hospital|infirmaries]] (both on land and at sea), [[Magnanery|magnaneries]], [[stable]]s, cattle-sheds, etc.; and they were beneficial during [[exhumation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the disinfecting properties of Labarraque's preparations of chlorine |author=Labarraque, Antoine Germain |others=Translated by James Scott |date=1828 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pD0XAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220856/https://books.google.com/books?id=pD0XAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |archivedate=2015-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[embalming]], outbreaks of epidemic disease, fever, and [[Blackleg (disease)|blackleg]] in cattle.&lt;ref name="nbu"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hoefer, Jean Chrétien Ferdinand |contribution=Labarraque, Antoine-Germain |title=Nouvelle biographie universelle |volume=28 |pages=323–24 |ol=24229911M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disinfection ====
Labarraque's chlorinated lime and soda solutions have been advocated since 1828 to prevent infection (called "contagious infection", presumed to be transmitted by "[[miasma theory of disease|miasmas]]"), and to treat [[putrefaction]] of existing wounds, including septic wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, James (trans.). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pD0XAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the disinfecting properties of Labarraque's preparations of chlorine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220856/https://books.google.com/books?id=pD0XAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=2015-12-31 }}'' (S. Highley, 1828) Accessed Nov 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1828 work, Labarraque recommended that doctors breathe chlorine, wash their hands in chlorinated lime, and even sprinkle chlorinated lime about the patients' beds in cases of "contagious infection".  In 1828, the contagion of infections was well known, even though the agency of the [[Microorganism|microbe]] was not discovered until more than half a century later.

During the [[1832 cholera epidemic|Paris cholera outbreak]] of 1832, large quantities of so-called ''chloride of lime'' were used to disinfect the capital. This was not simply modern [[calcium chloride]], but chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute [[calcium hydroxide]]) to form [[calcium hypochlorite]] (chlorinated lime). Labarraque's discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms, and by doing so, effectively deodorised the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] of Paris.&lt;ref name="corbin"&gt;Corbin, Alain (1988).

Harvard University Press. pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt; These "putrid miasmas" were thought by many to cause the spread of "contagion" and "infection" – both words used before the germ theory of infection. Chloride of lime was used for destroying odors and "putrid matter". One source claims chloride of lime was used by Dr. John Snow to disinfect water from the cholera-contaminated well that was feeding the Broad Street pump in 1854 London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Wiley|year=2010|chapter-url=http://samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9780470561324_sample_411014.pdf|title=White's Handbook of Chlorination and Alternative Disinfectants|place=Hoboken, NJ|page=452|author=Lewis, Kenneth A.|doi=10.1002/9780470561331.ch9|isbn=978-0-470-56133-1|chapter=Ch. 9 Hypochlorination – Sodium Hypochlorite}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; though three other reputable sources that describe that famous cholera epidemic do not mention the incident.&lt;ref name= Vinten&gt;Vinten-Johansen, Peter, Howard Brody, Nigel Paneth, Stephen Rachman and Michael Rip.

==== Semmelweis and experiments with antisepsis ====
[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Ignaz Semmelweis]] ]]
Perhaps the most famous application of Labarraque's chlorine and [[base (chemistry)|chemical base]] solutions was in 1847, when [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] used chlorine-water (chlorine dissolved in pure water, which was cheaper than chlorinated lime solutions) to disinfect the hands of Austrian doctors, which Semmelweis noticed still carried the stench of decomposition from the dissection rooms to the patient examination rooms. Long before the germ theory of disease, Semmelweis theorized that "cadaveric particles" were transmitting decay from fresh medical cadavers to living patients, and he used the well-known "Labarraque's solutions" as the only known method to remove the smell of decay and tissue decomposition (which he found that soap did not). The solutions proved to be far more effective antiseptics than soap (Semmelweis was also aware of their greater efficacy, but not the reason), and this resulted in Semmelweis's celebrated success in stopping the transmission of [[childbed fever]] ("puerperal fever") in the maternity wards of [[Vienna General Hospital]] in [[Austria]] in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_chlorine/sec_content.asp?CID=1166&amp;DID=4476&amp;CTYPEID=109 |title=Chlorine Story |publisher=americanchemistry |accessdate=2008-07-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429214443/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_chlorine/sec_content.asp?CID=1166&amp;DID=4476&amp;CTYPEID=109 |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, during World War I in 1916, a standardized and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, was developed by [[Henry Drysdale Dakin]] (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called [[Dakin's solution]], the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment of a wide variety of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern times, where it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see [[Century Pharmaceuticals]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rezayat | first1 = C. | last2 = Widmann | first2 = W.

==== Public sanitation ====

[[File:Liquid Pool Chlorine.jpg|thumb|Liquid Pool Chlorine]]

The first continuous application of chlorination to drinking U.S. water was installed in [[Jersey City]], New Jersey in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cotruvo, Victor Kimm, Arden Calvert. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/drinkingwater.pdf “Drinking Water: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. March 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1918, the [[US Department of Treasury]] called for all drinking water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for [[water purification]] (such as in water treatment plants), in [[disinfectant]]s, and in [[bleach]]. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| author = Hammond, C. R.|title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|edition = 81st| publisher =CRC press| date = 2000| isbn = 978-0-8493-0481-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorine is usually used (in the form of [[hypochlorous acid]]) to kill [[bacteria]] and other microbes in [[drinking water]] supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather [[sodium hypochlorite]], formed from chlorine and [[sodium hydroxide]], or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the proteins in human hair and skin. The distinctive 'chlorine aroma' associated with swimming pools is not the result of chlorine itself, but of [[chloramine]], a chemical compound produced by the reaction of free dissolved chlorine with amines in organic substances. As a disinfectant in water, chlorine is more than three times as effective against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' as [[bromine]], and more than six times as effective as [[iodine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koski T. A. |author2=Stuart L. S. |author3=Ortenzio L. F.|title=Comparison of chlorine, bromine, iodine as disinfectants for swimming pool water|journal = Applied Microbiology|volume = 14|issue = 2|date = 1966|pages = 276–79|pmid=4959984|pmc=546668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often impractical to store and use poisonous chlorine gas for water treatment, so alternative methods of adding chlorine are used. These include [[hypochlorite]] solutions, which gradually release chlorine into the water, and compounds like [[sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione]] (dihydrate or anhydrous), sometimes referred to as "dichlor", and [[trichloro-s-triazinetrione]], sometimes referred to as "trichlor". These compounds are stable while solid and may be used in powdered, granular, or tablet form. When added in small amounts to pool water or industrial water systems, the chlorine atoms hydrolyze from the rest of the molecule forming hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which acts as a general biocide, killing germs, micro-organisms, algae, and so on.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=860}}{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=411}}

=== Use as a weapon ===

==== World War I ====
{{Main|Chemical weapons in World War I}}

Chlorine gas, also known as bertholite, was first [[chemical warfare|used as a weapon]] in [[World War I]] by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]].&lt;ref&gt;"Battle of Ypres" ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEN2015&gt;{{cite journal | first = Sarah | last = Everts | url = http://chemicalweapons.cenmag.org/when-chemicals-became-weapons-of-war/ | title = When Chemicals Became Weapons of War | journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News | volume = 93 | issue = 8 | date = February 23, 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160330203223/http://chemicalweapons.cenmag.org/when-chemicals-became-weapons-of-war/ | archivedate = March 30, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the soldiers, it had the distinctive smell of a mixture of pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung the back of the throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] of the lungs to form [[hydrochloric acid]], destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal. Human respiratory systems can be protected from chlorine gas by [[gas mask]]s with [[activated charcoal]] or other filters, which makes chlorine gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, [[Fritz Haber]] of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate [[IG Farben]], which developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an [[trench|entrenched]] enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC&amp;pg=PA226| page=226| title=Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production| isbn=978-0-262-69313-4| author1=Smil, Vaclav| date=2004-04-01| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220856/https://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC&amp;pg=PA226| archivedate=2015-12-31| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its first use, both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly [[phosgene]] and [[mustard gas]].&lt;ref name="First World War"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm|title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas|publisher=First World War.com|accessdate=2007-08-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821004525/http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm|archivedate=2007-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iraq ====
{{Main|Chlorine bombings in Iraq}}

Chlorine gas was also used during the [[Iraq War in Anbar Province]] in 2007, with insurgents packing [[truck bomb]]s with [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] shells and chlorine tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused by the force of the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.&lt;ref name="cnnchlorine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/03/17/iraq.main/index.html|last=Mahdi|first=Basim|publisher=CNN|date=2007-03-17|accessdate=2007-03-17|title=Iraq gas attack makes hundreds ill|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317201051/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/03/17/iraq.main/index.html|archivedate=2007-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chlorine bomb BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6660585.stm|publisher = BBC News|date = 2007-05-17|accessdate = 2007-05-17|title = 'Chlorine bomb' hits Iraq village|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5v7G8QFjq?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6660585.stm|archivedate = 2010-12-20|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2014, it was reported that the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] had used chlorine gas in the town of Duluiyah, [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/198796-isis-chlorine-attack-report/|title=ISIS chlorine attack on security forces confirmed – Iraq officials|publisher=RT|date=October 24, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024181858/http://rt.com/news/198796-isis-chlorine-attack-report/|archivedate=October 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory analysis of clothing and soil samples confirmed the use of chlorine gas against Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] Forces in a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack on 23 January 2015 at the Highway 47 Kiske Junction near Mosul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/efilp3g8mxwiev4/Lab-Report-Kisic-Junction-Chlorine.pdf?dl=0|title=Lab report on chlorine gas usage|publisher=Kurdistan Region Security Council |date=March 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==
The [[chloride]] anion is an [[Mineral (nutrient)|essential nutrient]] for metabolism. Chlorine is needed for the production of [[hydrochloric acid]] in the stomach and in cellular pump functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_schlorid_crs.htm |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331211149/http://med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_schlorid_crs.htm |archivedate=31 March 2009 |title=Blood (Serum) Chloride Level Test}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main dietary source is table salt, or sodium chloride. Overly low or high concentrations of chloride in the blood are examples of [[electrolyte disturbance]]s. [[Hypochloremia]] (having too little chloride) rarely occurs in the absence of other abnormalities. It is sometimes associated with [[hypoventilation]].&lt;ref name="pmid3764530"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lavie|first1=CJ| last2=Crocker|first2=EF|last3=Key|first3=KJ |last4=Ferguson|first4=TG |title=Marked hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with severe compensatory hypoventilation |journal=South.

Chlorine is detectable with measuring devices in concentrations as low as 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60&amp;nbsp;ppm. About 1000&amp;nbsp;ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas.&lt;ref name=Greenwood792/&gt; The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{PGCH|0115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes.&lt;ref name=tox&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Environmental Research|volume = 85|issue = 2|date = 2001 |doi = 10.1006/enrs.2000.4110 |title = The Toxicology of Chlorine|author = Winder, Chris|pages = 105–14|pmid = 11161660|bibcode = 2001ER.....85..105W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30&amp;nbsp;ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO).

When used at specified levels for water disinfection, the reaction of chlorine with water is not a major concern for human health.

In the U.S., most dental specialists attain Board Certification (Diplomate Status) by completing a series of written and oral examinations with the appropriate Boards. e.g. Diplomate, American Board of Periodontics.

Each fully qualifies the holder to practice [[dentistry]] in at least the jurisdiction in which the degree was presented, assuming local and federal government licensure requirements are met.

==Dental specialties==
In addition to general dentistry, there are about 9 recognized [[dental specialties]] in the US, Canada, India and Australia. To become a specialist requires one to train in a residency or advanced graduate training program. Once residency is completed, the doctor is granted a certificate of specialty training. Many specialty programs have optional or required advanced degrees such as a master's degree: (MS, MSc, MDS, MSD, MDSc, MMSc, MPhil, or MDent), doctoral degree: (DClinDent, DChDent, DMSc, PhD), or [[Medical school|medical degree]]: (MD/MBBS specific to [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|maxillofacial surgery]] and sometimes [[oral medicine]]).

The following are not currently recognized dental specialties in the US:
*[[Dental Anesthesiology|Anesthesiology]] (programs currently undergoing CODA accreditation and ADA review): 2–3 years
*[[Oral medicine]]: 2–4 years
*[[Special needs dentistry]] 3 years
*[[Cosmetic Dentistry]] - ranges from a weekend course to a 1-year course depending on the certificate issuing agency.

Dentists who have completed accredited specialty training programs in these fields are designated registrable (U.S. "Board Eligible") and warrant exclusive titles such as orthodontist, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, endodontist, pedodontist, periodontist, or prosthodontist upon satisfying certain local (U.S. "Board Certified"), (Australia/NZ: "FRACDS"), or (Canada: "FRCD(C)") registry requirements.

==Australia==
Australia has nine dental schools:
* [[University of Sydney]] NSW
* [[Charles Sturt University]], NSW*
* [[Griffith University]], QLD*
* [[University of Queensland]], QLD
* [[James Cook University]], QLD*
* [[University of Adelaide]], SA
* [[La Trobe University]], VIC*
* [[University of Melbourne]], VIC
* [[University of Western Australia]], WA

(*) indicates new university dental programs that have opened up to aim at increasing the number of rural dental students entering and to return to rural practice. Traditional "sandstone" universities have been Sydney, Melbourne, Queensland, Adelaide and Western Australia.

Sydney (as of 2001), Melbourne (as of 2010) and Western Australia (as of 2013) have switched to 4-year graduate program that require a previous bachelor's degree for admission.

Post-graduate training is available in all dental specialties. Degrees awarded used to be Master of Dental Surgery/Science (MDS/MDSc), but lately have changed to Doctorate in Clinical Dentistry (DClinDent).

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has only one dental school:
* [[University of Otago]], [[Dunedin]]

The Faculty of Dentistry awards Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) and Master of Community Dentistry (MComDent) for public health &amp; community dentistry, and Doctorate in Clinical Dentistry (DClinDent) for the other dental specialties.

The body responsible for registering dental practitioners is the [[Dental Council of New Zealand]] (DCNZ).

===Trans Tasman mutual recognition===
Both Australia and New Zealand recognize the educational and professional qualifications and grant professional licenses via reciprocity identical to the United States and Canada.

===General Dental Council of the UK===
The United Kingdom [[General Dental Council]] had been recognizing the Australian and New Zealand dental qualification as registrable degree until 2000. Graduates who have applied for dental license registration in the United Kingdom now have to sit the Overseas Registration Exam (ORE), a three-part examination.

===Canadian registration===
Australia and Canada have a reciprocal accreditation agreement which allows graduates of Canadian or Australian dental schools to register in either country. However, this only applies to the graduates of 2011 class and does not apply to the previous years graduates.

===Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons===
Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons (RACDS) is a post-graduate body that focuses on post-graduate training of general practitioners and specialist dentists. Additional post-graduate qualifications can be obtained through the College after the candidate has completed the Primary Examination (basic science examination in Anatomy, Histology, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology and Microbiology) and the Final Examination (clinical subjects in dentistry). After the successful completion of the examinations and meeting the College requirements, the candidate is awarded the title of Fellow of Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons (FRACDS). For the dental specialists, the exam pathway is similar (Primary Examinations) and then clinical/oral examinations just prior to completing the specialist training leads to the award of the title Member of Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons in Special Field Stream (MRACDS(SFS)). For the busy GP dentists, MRACDS in general stream is also available.

==Canada==
{{Main|Dentistry in Canada}}
There are ten approved dental schools in Canada:
*[[Faculty of Dentistry, U of T|University of Toronto]] (1868)
*[[McGill University]] (1905)
*[[Université de Montréal]] (1905)
*[[Dalhousie University]] (1908)
*[[University of Alberta]] (1923)
*[[University of Manitoba]] (1958)
*[[University of British Columbia]] (1964)
*[[University of Western Ontario]] (1966)
*[[University of Saskatchewan]] (1968)
*[[Université Laval]] (1971)

Several Universities in Canada offer the DDS degree, including the [[University of Toronto]], the [[University of Western Ontario]], the [[University of Alberta]], and [[Dalhousie University]], while the remaining Canadian dental schools offer the Doctor of Dental Medicine degree to their graduates.

Additional qualifications can be obtained through the [[Royal College of Dentists|Royal College of Dentists of Canada (RCDC)]], which administers examinations for qualified dental specialists as part of the [[dentistry]] profession in [[Canada]]. The current examinations are known as the ''National Dental Specialty Examination'' (NDSE). Successful completion may lead to ''Fellowship'' in the College (FRCD(C)) and may be used for provincial registration purposes.

Canada has a reciprocal accreditation agreement with Australia, Ireland, and the United States which recognizes the dental training of graduates of Canadian dental schools. Obtaining licensure to work in any of the 3 other countries will often require additional steps, such as successfully completing national board exams and fulfilling requirements of local governing bodies.

==Finland==
In Finland, education in dentistry is through a 5.5-year ''Licenciate of Dental Medicine'' (DMD or DDS) course, which is offered after high school graduation. Application is by a national combined dental and medical school entry examination. As of 2011, dentistry is provided by Faculties of Medicine in 4 universities:

*[[University of Helsinki]]
*[[University of Turku]]
*[[University of Oulu]]
*[[University of Eastern Finland]], Kuopio Campus

1st phase of training begins with a unified 2-year pre-clinical training for dentists and physicians. Problem-based learning (PBL) is employed depending on university. 3rd year autumn consists of clinico-theoretical phase in pathology, genetics, radiology and public health and is partially combined with physicians' 2nd phase. 3rd phase clinical training lasts for the remaining 3 years and includes periods of being on call at University Central Hospital Trauma Centre, Clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial Diseases and at the Children's clinic. Candidates who successfully complete the 4th year of training qualify for a paid summer rotation in a [[Community health center]] of their choice. Annual intake of dentists into Faculties of Medicine is a national total 160 students.

[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] research is strongly encouraged alongside post graduate training. Post graduate training is available in all 4 universities and lasts an additional 3–6 years.Starting in 2014, the University of Helsinki introduced a new doctoral training system. In this new system all doctoral candidates belong to a doctoral programme within a doctoral school. FINDOS Helsinki - Doctoral Programme in Oral Sciences - is a programme in the Doctoral School in Health Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helsinki.fi/findos/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
    
There are 11 post graduate programs:

Clinical dentistry:
*Periodontology
*Pedodontology and Preventive Dentistry
*Cariology and Endodontology
*Prosthodontology and Stomatognathic physiology
    
Diagnostic dentistry:
*Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology
*Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology
*Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine
*Oral Clinical Microbiology (Program starts in 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.helsinki.fi/ammatillinen_jatkokoulutus/docs/erikoistumiskoulutus/ehml/opas/2013-2015/Erikoishammasl%C3%A4%C3%A4k%C3%A4rikoulutuksen%20opinto-opas%202013-2015.pdf |format=PDF |title=Erikoishammaslääkärikoulutuksen opinto-opas 2013 – 2015 |website=Med.helsinki.fi |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other:
*Orthodontics
*Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery
*Oral Public Health

==India==
In India, training in dentistry is through a 5 -year BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) course, which includes 4 years of study followed by one year of internship. As of 2010, there were a total of 291 colleges (39 run by the government and 252 in the private sector) offering dental education. This amounts to an annual intake of 23,690 graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mohfw.nic.in/Adental.html|title=Statistics from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India|website=Mohfw.nic.in|date=|accessdate=2010-10-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024180842/http://mohfw.nic.in/Adental.html|archivedate=24 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post graduate training is for three years in the concerned speciality. Master of Dental Surgery (MDS) is offered in the following subjects -
*Prosthodontics
*Periodontics
*Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery
*Conservative Dentistry &amp; Endodontics
*Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopaedics
*Oral Pathology &amp; Microbiology
*Community Dentistry
*Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry
*Oral Medicine Diagnosis and Radiology.

Dental education in India is regulated by the [[Dental Council of India]].

==Israel==
In [[Israel]] there are two [[dental school]]s, The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]]-[[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah]] School of Dental Medicine in [[Jerusalem]], founded by the [[Alpha Omega Fraternity]] and The [[Tel Aviv University]] School of Dental Medicine in [[Tel Aviv]]. The two schools have 6-year program and provide Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) degrees. In last decades, the [[student]]s eligible to [[Bachelor of Medical Sciences]] (BMedSc) degree after the first three years of training.

== United States ==
{{Main|Dentistry in the United States}}
In the United States, at least three years of undergraduate education are required in order to be admitted to a dental school; however, most dental schools require at least a [[bachelor's degree]]. There is no mandatory course of study as an undergraduate other than completing the requisite "pre-dental" courses, which generally includes one year of general [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physics]], [[English studies|English]], and higher level mathematics such as [[statistics]] and [[calculus]]. Some dental schools have requirements that go beyond the basic requirements such as [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[biochemistry]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]] etc. The majority of pre-dental students major in a [[science]] but this is not required as some students elect to major in a non-science related field.

In addition to core prerequisites, the [[Dental Admission Test]], a [[multiple choice]] [[standardized exam]], is also required for potential dental students. The DAT is usually taken during the spring semester of one's junior year. The vast majority of dental schools require an interview before admissions can be granted. The interview is designed to evaluate the motivation, character, and personality of the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asdanet.org/predental/interview-tips.aspx|title=ASDAnet.org|publisher=[[American Student Dental Association]]|date=March 2013|accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often a crucial step in the admissions process.{{Weasel inline|date=June 2010}}

For the 2009-2010 application cycle, 11,632 applicants applied for admission to dental schools in the United States. Just 4,067 were eventually accepted. The average dental school applicant entering the school year in 2009 had an overall GPA of 3.54 and a science GPA of 3.46.  Additionally, their mean DAT Academic Average (AA) was 19.00 while their DAT Perceptual Ability Test (PAT) score was 19.40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adea.org/publications/Documents/OG_2010/OG2010_ch3.pdf |format=PDF |title=CHAPTER 3 : DECIDING WHERE TO APPLY |website=Adea.org |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dental education and training===
{{Main|List of dental schools in the us|l1=List of Dental Schools in the US}}
Dental school is four academic years in duration and is similar in format to medical school: two years of basic medical and dental sciences, followed by two years of clinical training (with continued didactic coursework). Before graduating, every dental student must successfully complete the National Board Dental Examination Part I and II (commonly referred to as NBDE I &amp; II). The NBDE Part I is usually taken at the end of the second year after the majority of the didactic courses have been completed. The NBDE Part I covers [[Gross Anatomy]], [[biochemistry]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[pathology]], and [[dental anatomy]] and [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]]. The NBDE Part II is usually taken during winter of the last year of dental school and consists of operative dentistry, [[pharmacology]], [[endodontics]], [[periodontics]], [[oral surgery]], [[pain control]], [[prosthodontics]], [[orthodontics]], [[pedodontics]], [[oral pathology]], and [[radiology]]. NBDE Part I scores are Pass/Fail since 2012.

After graduating, the vast majority of new dentists go directly into practice while a small, yet increasing, percentage of dentists apply to a residency program.{{Weasel inline|date=June 2010}} Some residency programs train dentists in advanced general dentistry such as General Practice Residencies and Advanced Education in General Dentistry Residencies, commonly referred to as GPR and AEGD.  Most GPR and AEGD programs are one year in duration but several are two years long or provide an optional second year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/dental-student-resources/career-options-after-dental-school/understanding-advanced-dental-education/program-options-and-descriptions |title=Advance Education Program Options and Descriptions |publisher=Ada.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GPR programs are usually affiliated with a hospital and thus require the dentist to treat a wide variety of patients including trauma, critically ill, and medically compromised patients.  Additionally, GPR programs require residents to rotate through various departments within the hospital, such as anesthesia, internal medicine, and emergency medicine, to name a few.  AEGD programs are usually in a dental school setting where the focus is treating complex cases in a comprehensive manner.

====DDS vs DMD degree====
In the United States the Doctor of Dental Surgery and Doctor of Dental Medicine are terminal professional doctorates which qualify a professional for licensure. The DDS and DMD degrees are considered equivalent. The [[American Dental Association]] specifies:
{{quote|text=The DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery) and DMD (Doctor of Dental Medicine) are the same degrees. They are awarded upon graduation from dental school to become a General Dentist. The majority of dental schools award the DDS degree; however, some award a DMD degree. The education and degrees are, in substance, the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ada.org/3049.aspx?currentTab=1 "DDS/DMD"], American Dental Association&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Harvard School of Dental Medicine|Harvard University]] was the first dental school to award the DMD degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-dentistry/prospective-students/dmd-program/|title=DMD Program|website=Ohsu.edu|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard only grants degrees in Latin, and the Latin translation of Doctor of Dental Surgery, "Chirurgiae Dentium Doctoris", did not share the "DDS" initials of the English term.&lt;ref name="Koch_1910_p463"&gt;{{Citation |last=Koch |first=Charles R.E. |year=1910 |title=History of Dental Surgery: History of the development of dentistry, operative dentistry, prosthetic dentistry, orthodontia, oral surgery, dental literature, dental journalism, dental education and dental colleges |volume=1 |page=463 |publisher=National Art Publishing Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yE-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA463#v=onepage&amp;f=false |lccn=09017597 |postscript=.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The degree 'Scientiae Dentium Doctoris', which would leave the initials of DDS unchanged, was then considered, but was rejected on the ground that dentistry was not a science."&lt;ref name="Koch_1910_p463"/&gt; (The word order in Latin is not fixed, only the [[inflection]]s; "Scientiae Dentium Doctoris" = "Doctoris Dentium Scientiae".) A Latin scholar was consulted. It was finally decided that "Medicinae Doctoris" be modified with "Dentariae".&lt;ref name="Koch_1910_p463"/&gt; This is how the DMD, or "Doctor Medicinae Dentariae" degree, was started.&lt;ref name="Koch_1910_p463"/&gt; (The genitive inflection ''-is'' on "Doctoris" instead of the nominative "Doctor" simply reflects that the syntax on the diploma was "the degree of Doctor of Dental Medicine"; they are both correct.) The assertion that "dentistry was not a science"&lt;ref name="Koch_1910_p463"/&gt; reflected the view that dental surgery was an art informed by science, not a science ''per se''—notwithstanding that the scientific component of dentistry is today recognized in the Doctor of Dental Science (DDSc) degree.

Other dental schools made the switch to this notation, and in 1989, 23 of the 66 North American dental schools awarded the DMD. There is no meaningful difference between the DMD and DDS degrees, and all dentists must meet the same national and regional certification standards in order to practice.&lt;ref&gt;"Public perception of DDS versus DMD degrees." ''Journal of the American College of Dentists''. 1999. Fall; 66(3):29-37. Lalumandier, JA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other prominent dental schools which award the DMD degree are the Medical University of South Carolina, Augusta University (formerly Medical College of Georgia), University of Connecticut, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Louisville, University of Puerto Rico, Rutgers University, Tufts University, Oregon Health and Sciences University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Illinois at Chicago, Boston University, Temple University, Western University of Health Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, and University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

The United States Department of Education and the [[National Science Foundation]] do not include the DDS and DMD among the degrees that are equivalent to research doctorates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |format=DOC |title=Structure of the U.S. Education System : Research Doctorate Degrees |website=2.ed.gov |accessdate=2017-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127015732/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arlingtontexasdentist.net/phd-and-equivalent-doctoral-degrees-the-erc-policy/ |title=PhD and Equivalent Doctoral Degrees: The ERC Policy &amp;#124; Mark C.

===Licensing examinations===
To practice, a dentist must pass a licensing examination administered by an individual state or more commonly a region.  There are a handful of states that maintain independent dental licensing examinations while the majority accept a regional board examination.  The [[Northeast Regional Board of Dental Examiners|Northeast Regional Board]] (NERB), [[Western Regional Examining Board|Western Regional Board]] (WREB), [[Central Regional Dental Testing Service]] (CRDTS), and [[Southern Regional Testing Agency]] (SRTA), [[Council of Interstate Testing Agencies]] (CITA)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citaexam.com : Council of Interstate Testing Agencies&lt;/ref&gt; are the five regional testing agencies that administer licensing examinations.  Once the examination is passed, the dentist may then apply to individual states that accept the regional board test passed.  Each state requires prospective practitioners to pass an ethics/jurisprudence examination as well before a license is granted.  To maintain one's dental license the doctor must complete Continuing Dental Education (CDE) courses periodically (usually annually).  This promotes the continued exploration of knowledge.  The amount of CE required varies from state to state but is generally 10-25 CE hours a year.

The completion of a dental degree can be followed by either an entrance into private practice, further postgraduate study and training, or research and academics.

==China==
China has many universities teaching dental degree both in undergraduate and postgraduate level. Though the Chinese system of education is not open and clear to outside world, universities have adapted the programes of American and European degrees. Under-graduate degree is Bachelor of Stomatology (口腔医学本科） and post graduate degree is Master of Stomatology (口腔医学硕士). There is variation in degree such as BDS, DDS, DMD for bachelor level. Recently, China has new name for its master degree as Master of Stomatological medicine. There are other branches of dentistry remaining the same as American universities.

== South Africa ==
:''Related: [[Medical education in South Africa]].''
Training in South Africa generally comprises a 5-year degree, with 1 year compulsory medical service / internship.  The country has 5 universities with dental faculties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dentaljuce.com/fruit/docs/World_Dental_schools.htm |title=World Dental Schools List |publisher=Dentaljuce.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bangladesh==
The graduation in Dentistry is named here as Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS). At present there are three universities that have medical faculty that offer dental degree: The University of Dhaka, The University of Chittagong and the University of Rajshahi. These public universities have dental colleges and hospitals that may be publicly or privately funded, that offer education for the degree. The [[List of dental schools in Bangladesh|list of dentals school]] providing graduate education in Dentistry includes the following colleges:

At present post graduation in specialized dentistry exist in main four clinical specialities:
*Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics
*Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery
*Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics
*Prosthodontics

The '''FCPS''' degree which require four years of residency training is awarded by Bangladesh College of Physician and Surgeons. It considered the most prestigious specialized Degree in Dentistry at present. There are also '''MS''' degree only in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery from [[University of Dhaka]]. Very recently '''MS''' in dentistry was also started in [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University]] (BSMMU), the first batch of which graduated in 2016.

== Definition ==
[[Australia]]'s [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] describes discretionary foods as ''“foods and drinks not necessary to provide the nutrients the body needs, but that may add variety. However, many of these are high in saturated fats, sugars, salt and/or alcohol, and are therefore described as energy dense. They can be included sometimes in small amounts by those who are physically active, but are not a necessary part of the diet.”''&lt;ref name="abs" /&gt;

'''Entoptic phenomena''' (from Greek ἐντός "within" and ὀπτικός "visual") are visual effects whose source is within the [[human eye|eye]] itself. (Occasionally, these are called '''entopic phenomena''', which is probably a typographical mistake.)

In [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]]'s words; "Under suitable conditions light falling on the eye may render visible certain objects within the eye itself. These perceptions are called ''entoptical''."

==Overview==
Entoptic images have a physical basis in the image cast upon the retina. Hence, they are different from [[optical illusions]], which are caused by the [[visual system]] and characterized by a visual [[percept]] that (loosely said) appears to differ from [[reality]]. Because entoptic images are caused by phenomena within the observer's own eye, they share one feature with optical illusions and hallucinations: the observer cannot share a direct and specific view of the phenomenon with others.

Helmholtz{{ref|helmholtz}} commented on entoptic phenomena which could be seen easily by some observers, but could not be seen at all by others. This variance is not surprising because the specific aspects of the eye that produce these images are unique to each individual. Because of the variation between individuals, and the inability for two observers to share a nearly identical stimulus, these phenomena are unlike most visual sensations. They are also unlike most optical illusions which are produced by viewing a common stimulus. Yet, there is enough commonality between the main entoptic phenomena that their physical origin is now well understood.

== Examples ==
Some examples of entoptical effects include:
[[Image:floaters2.png|thumb|alt=Floaters against a blue sky with cloud.|Floaters depiction]]
[[Image:Purkinje Tree BM.jpg|thumb|alt=First person view of a Purkinje Tree while sitting in a slit lamp/biomicroscope|Purkinje Tree depiction]]
* [[Floaters]] or ''muscae volitantes'' are slowly drifting blobs of varying size, shape, and transparency, which are particularly noticeable when viewing a bright, featureless background (such as the sky) or a point source of diffuse light very close to the eye.  They are all shadow images of objects suspended just above the retina. Some may be individual red blood cells swollen due to osmotic pressure. Others may be chains of red blood cells stuck together; diffraction patterns can be seen around these.{{ref|White}}  They may also be "coagula of the proteins of the vitreous gel, to embryonic remnants, or the condensation round the walls of [[Cloquet's canal]]".{{ref|Duke Elder}}  The first two sort of floaters do float in liquid between the vitreous and the retina, so they may collect over the fovea (the center of vision), and therefore be more visible, when a person is lying on his or her back looking upwards.
* [[Blue field entoptic phenomenon]] has the appearance of tiny bright dots moving rapidly along squiggly lines in the visual field. It is much more noticeable when viewed against a field of pure blue light and is caused by [[white blood cell]]s moving in the [[capillary|capillaries]] in front of the [[retina]].  The white cells are larger than the red cells and must deform to fit.  As they go through a capillary, a space opens up in front of them and red blood cells pile up behind.  This makes the dots of light appear slightly elongated with dark tails.{{ref|Snodderly}}{{ref|Sinclair}}
* [[Haidinger's brush]] is a very subtle bowtie or hourglass shaped pattern that is seen when viewing a field with a component of blue light that is [[Linear polarization|plane]] or [[Circular polarization|circularly]] polarized. It's easier to see if the polarisation is rotating with respect to the observer's eye, although some observers can see it in the natural polarisation of sky light.&lt;ref&gt;Minnaert, M. G. J. (1940). Light and colour in the open air  (H. M. Kremer-Priest, Trans.). London: G. Bell and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; If the light is all blue, it will appear as a dark shadow; if the light is full spectrum, it will appear yellow. It is due to the preferential absorption of blue polarized light by pigment molecules in the fovea.{{ref|Brindley}}{{ref|Reid}}
* [[Purkinje images]] are the reflections from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lens.  While these first four reflections are not entoptic, Becker{{ref|Becker}} described how light can reflect from the posterior surface of the lens and then again from the anterior surface of the cornea to focus a second image on the retina, this one much fainter and inverted. Tscherning{{ref|Tscherning}} referred to this as the sixth image (the fifth image being formed by reflections from the anterior surfaces of the lens and cornea to form an image too far in front of the retina to be visible) and noted it was much fainter and best seen with a relaxed emmetropic eye.  In a dark room, with one eye closed and looking ahead with the other eye, move a light back and forth under your gaze – you should see a dimmer image moving in the opposite direction.
* The [[Purkinje tree]] is an image of the retinal blood vessels in one's own eye, first described by [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně|Purkyně]] in 1823.{{ref|Purkinje}}  It can be seen by shining the beam of a small bright light through the pupil from the periphery of a subject's vision.  This results in an image of the light being focused on the periphery of the retina.  Light from this spot then casts shadows of the blood vessels (which lie on top of the retina) onto unadapted portions of the retina.  Normally the image of the retinal blood vessels is invisible because of [[Adaptation (eye)|adaptation]]. Unless the light moves, the image disappears within a second or so. If the light is moved at about 1 Hz, adaptation is defeated, and a clear image can be seen indefinitely. The vascular figure is often seen by patients during an ophthalmic examination when the doctor is using an [[ophthalmoscope]]. Another way in which the shadows of blood vessels may be seen is by holding a bright light against the eyelid at the corner of the eye.  The light penetrates the eye and casts a shadow on the blood vessels as described previously.  The light must be jiggled to defeat adaptation.  Viewing in both cases is improved in a dark room while looking at a featureless background.  This topic is discussed in more detail by Helmholtz.
* [[Purkinje's blue arcs]] are associated with the activity of the nerves sending signals from where a spot of light is focussed on the retina near the fovea to the optic disk.  Look at the right edge of a small red light in a dark room with your right eye (left eye closed) after dark-accommodating your eye for about 30 seconds and you should see two faint blue arcs starting at the light and heading towards the blind spot.  Look at the left edge and you will see a faint blue spike going from the light to the right.{{ref|Walker}}
* A [[phosphene]] is the perception of light without light actually entering the eye, for instance caused by pressure applied to the closed eyes.

A phenomenon that could be entoptical if the [[eyelash]]es are considered to be part of the eye is seeing light [[diffraction|diffracted]] through the eyelashes. The phenomenon appears as one or more light disks crossed by dark blurry lines (the shadows of the lashes), each having fringes of [[Visible spectrum|spectral]] colour. The disk shape is given by the circular [[aperture]] of the [[pupil]].

'''Evelina Betancourt-Anthony''' (born 1950) is an Aruban-born [[Bonaire|Bonairean]] health administrator and politician. From 1 December 2015 she has served as the served as the Deputy Lieutenant Governor of the island and in the absence of the [[Lieutenant governor|Island Governor]] fills the duties of that office.

==Early life==
Evelina Anthony was born in &lt;!-- 4 October 1950  --&gt;1950,{{sfn|Rijksdienst Caribisch Nederland|2015}} in Aruba, where her father was working in the oil industry. Both of her parents were originally from [[Bonaire]], as were her grandparents. When her father was laid off from the refinery, the entire family returned to Bonaire, where they still had a house. After her primary schooling, she attended [[Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs]] (MULO) for two years in Bonaire and in 1968 moved to the Netherlands to finished her secondary education. She attended [[Schoevers]], in [[Amsterdam]] studying management and organization, but didn't have the money to pay for further schooling. Instead, she entered nursing where she could train, room and board were provided, and she received a small monthly stipend. She began her training at the hospital in [[Amsterdam-Noord]], but stopped before she finished her training to take full time employment at the Argentinean State Shipping Company in Amsterdam to allow her fiancé to finish his education.{{sfn|van der Berg|2017}} 

==Career==
The couple married and upon her husband's graduation, Anthony moved with him to [[West Friesland (region)|West Friesland]]. She had two children and did volunteer work. When her mother-in-law became ill, they returned to Bonaire. While her husband worked in government service as the Head of Finance, Anthony returned to school, taking law courses at the [[University of Curaçao|University of the Netherlands Antilles]] in Curaçao. After two years, she was offered a position in the administrative department at a health clinic in [[Nort Saliña Kunuku Bieu|Nort Saliña]]. After two years, she took a government post in 1990 as a health project coordinator for the entire [[Netherlands Antilles]], which required a lot of travel to various islands. In 1996, Anthony also became involved with the Association for Nursing and Care for the Elderly ({{lang-nl|Stichting Ziekenverpleging &amp; Bejaardenzorg}}) being elected as chair of the Association a few months after her first meeting with the board. She and her first husband divorced, and Anthony remarried a Cuban name Betancourt.{{sfn|van der Berg|2017}} 

In 1999, Anthony decided to enter politics and when her party won the elections, she was appointed as Deputy over Health Care. It was a time of change in the island, as before the police had operated the ambulance service and most major care required that patients be sent via boat to Curaçao. A supervisory board was established to take over the ambulance service, home health care, and provide training for health workers. In 2000, Anthony was appointed as a Minister in the government at [[The Hague]] and returned to the Netherlands for two years. She returned to Bonaire and resumed the chair of the Association,{{sfn|van der Berg|2017}} which had been renamed as the Mariadal Foundation ({{lang-nl|Fundashon Mariadal}}.{{sfn|Fundashon Mariadal|2014}} Under the new system, the chair was a rotating position on the Board, and Anthony served at the facility until 2014.{{sfn|van der Berg|2017}}

On 1 December 2015, Anthony was appointed as the temporary acting [[Lieutenant governor|Island Governor]] for Bonaire and the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] representative for Bonaire, [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]] for a period of one year, serving in his stead when Lieutenant Governor, [[Edison Rijna]] is away from the island. After that timeframe, her title was changed to Deputy Lieutenant Governor.{{sfn|Rijksdienst Caribisch Nederland|2015}}{{sfn|''Amigoe''|2015}}{{sfn|Eilandsraad|2017}}

'''Familial cirrhosis''' is a form of liver disease that is inherited and the liver scarring is not caused by any obvious disease process. This type of [[cirrhosis]] is a [[keratin disease]]. Damage progresses until function becomes impaired.

Current cirrhosis treatment is aimed at managing complications as well as chronic poor health related to liver damage. Treatments include abstinence from alcohol, nutritional supplement, identification of any identifiable disease process, management of portal hypertension, and liver transplantation.

It is associated with [[KRT8]] and [[KRT18]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|215600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food''' is any substance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/food|title=food|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727134023/https://www.britannica.com/topic/food|archivedate=2017-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. It is usually of [[plant]] or [[animal]] origin, and contains essential [[nutrient]]s, such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|proteins]], [[vitamin]]s, or [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. The substance is [[Ingestion|ingested]] by an [[organism]] and assimilated by the organism's [[Cell (biology)|cells]] to provide [[energy]], maintain life, or stimulate growth.

Historically, [[human]]s secured food through two methods: [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] and [[agriculture]]. Today, the majority of the [[food energy]] required by the ever [[Population growth|increasing]] [[world population|population of the world]] is supplied by the [[food industry]].

[[Food safety]] and [[food security]] are monitored by agencies like the [[International Association for Food Protection]], [[World Resources Institute]], [[World Food Programme]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], and [[International Food Information Council]]. They address issues such as [[sustainability]], [[biological diversity]], [[climate change]], [[nutritional economics]], [[population growth]], [[water supply]], and [[Food security|access to food]].

The [[right to food]] is a [[human right]] derived from the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[ICESCR]]), recognizing the "[[right to an adequate standard of living]], including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from [[hunger]]".
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Food sources==
Most food has its origin in plants. Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. [[Cereal]] grain is a [[staple food]] that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/food/|title=food|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-03-01|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322145917/http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/food/|archivedate=2017-03-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maize|Corn (maize)]], [[wheat]], and [[rice]] – in all of their varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide.&lt;ref name="prodstat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx |title=ProdSTAT |work=FAOSTAT |accessdate=2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65Ju02KCI?url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Favour|first=Eboh|title=DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A MILL PULVERIZER|url=https://www.academia.edu/27186173/DESIGN_AND_FABRICATION_OF_A_MILL_PULVERIZER|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226191619/http://www.academia.edu/27186173/DESIGN_AND_FABRICATION_OF_A_MILL_PULVERIZER|archivedate=2017-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=039ZCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA846#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Book on Spices &amp; Condiments (with Cultivation, Processing &amp; Uses) 2nd Revised Edition: With Cultivation, Processing &amp; Uses|last=Engineers|first=NIIR Board of Consultants &amp;|date=2006-04-01|publisher=ASIA PACIFIC BUSINESS PRESS Inc.|isbn=9788178330389|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226191618/https://books.google.com/books?id=039ZCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA846#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock.

Some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible [[fungi]], especially [[mushroom]]s. Fungi and ambient [[bacteria]] are used in the preparation of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] and [[pickled]] foods like [[Baker's yeast|leavened]] [[bread]], [[alcoholic drinks]], [[cheese]], [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[kombucha]], and [[yogurt]]. Another example is [[blue-green algae]] such as [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]].&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 333–334.&lt;/ref&gt; Inorganic substances such as [[salt]], [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] and [[potassium hydrogen tartrate|cream of tartar]] are used to preserve or chemically alter an ingredient.

===Plants===

{{see also|Herb|spice}}

Many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant species are cultivated for food. Many of these plant species have several distinct [[cultivar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seed]]s of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as [[Omega-3|omega fats]]. In fact, the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods. Edible seeds include cereals ([[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[et cetera]]), [[legume]]s ([[bean]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, et cetera), and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. [[Oilseed]]s are often pressed to produce rich oils - [[sunflower]], [[flaxseed]], [[rapeseed]] (including [[canola oil]]), [[sesame]], [[et cetera]].&lt;ref name=McGee9&gt;McGee, Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeds are typically high in [[unsaturated fat]]s and, in moderation, are considered a [[health food]]. However, not all seeds are edible. Large seeds, such as those from a [[lemon]], pose a choking hazard, while seeds from [[cherries]] and [[apple]]s  contain [[cyanide]] which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/2737/|title=Are apple cores poisonous?|publisher=The Naked Scientists, University of Cambridge|date=26 Sep 2010|accessdate=12 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506191326/http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/2737/|archivedate=6 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fruit]]s are the ripened ovaries of plants, including the seeds within. Many plants and animals have [[coevolution|coevolved]] such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may [[Excretion|excrete]] the seeds some distance away. Fruits, therefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. Some botanical fruits, such as [[tomato]]es, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[eggplant]]s, are eaten as vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; (For more information, see [[list of fruits]].)

[[Vegetable]]s are a second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food. These include [[root vegetable]]s ([[potato]]es and [[carrot]]s), bulbs ([[onion]] family), [[leaf vegetable]]s ([[spinach]] and [[lettuce]]), [[:Category:Stem vegetables|stem vegetables]] ([[bamboo]] shoots and [[asparagus]]), and [[:Category:Inflorescence vegetables|inflorescence vegetables]] ([[globe artichoke]]s and [[broccoli]] and other vegetables such as [[cabbage]] or [[cauliflower]]).&lt;ref&gt;McGee, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals===
{{Main|Animal source foods|Food chain}}
[[File:Meatfoodgroup.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Various raw [[meat]]s]]
Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly by the products they produce. [[Meat]] is an example of a direct product taken from an animal, which comes from [[muscle]] systems or from [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].

Food products produced by animals include [[milk]] produced by [[mammary glands]], which in many cultures is drunk or processed into [[dairy product]]s (cheese, butter, etc.). In addition, birds and other animals lay [[Egg (food)|eggs]], which are often eaten, and [[bee]]s produce [[honey]], a reduced [[nectar]] from flowers, which is a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures [[blood as food|consume blood]], sometimes in the form of [[blood sausage]], as a thickener for sauces, or in a [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]], [[Salting (food)|salted]] form for times of food scarcity, and others use [[blood]] in stews such as [[jugging|jugged hare]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures and people do not consume meat or animal food products for cultural, dietary, health, ethical, or ideological reasons. [[Vegetarian]]s choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. [[Vegan]]s do not consume any foods that are or contain [[ingredients]] from an animal source.

=== Adulterated food ===
{{Main|Adulterated food}}

[[Adulteration]] is a legal term meaning that a food product fails to meet the legal standards. One form of adulteration is an addition of another substance to a food item in order to increase the quantity of the food item in raw form or prepared form, which may result in the loss of actual quality of food item. These substances may be either available food items or non-food items. Among meat and meat products some of the items used to adulterate are water or ice, carcasses, or carcasses of animals other than the animal meant to be consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements For Temporary Food Service Establishments|url=http://www.farmersbranch.info/DocumentCenter/View/2586|publisher=Farmers Branch|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Camping food ===

[[File:MRE contents.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Contents of a [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]] package]]
{{Main|Camping food}}

[[Camping food]] includes ingredients used to prepare food suitable for backcountry [[camping]] and [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]]. The foods differ substantially from the ingredients found in a typical home kitchen. The primary differences relate to campers' and backpackers' special needs for foods that have appropriate cooking time, perishability, weight, and nutritional content.

To address these needs, camping food is often made up of either [[freeze-dried]], [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|precooked]] or [[dehydrated]] ingredients. Many campers use a combination of these foods.

[[Freeze-drying]] requires the use of heavy machinery and is not something that most campers are able to do on their own. Freeze-dried ingredients are often considered superior to dehydrated ingredients however, because they rehydrate at camp faster and retain more flavor than their dehydrated counterparts. Freeze-dried ingredients take so little time to rehydrate that they can often be eaten without cooking them first and have a texture similar to a crunchy chip.

[[food dehydration|Dehydration]] can reduce the weight of the food by sixty to ninety percent by removing water through evaporation. Some foods dehydrate well, such as onions, peppers, and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildernessdining.com/campingfood.html |title=Camping Food FAQs |work= |accessdate=2009-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402225612/http://www.wildernessdining.com/campingfood.html |archive-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlCamping Food Tips: Backpacking, Hiking &amp; Camping Meals Get Easy."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiking-gear-and-equipment-used-for-camping.com/camping-food.html |title=Camping Food Tips: Backpacking, Hiking &amp; Camping Meals Get Easy. |work= |accessdate=2009-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422213307/http://www.hiking-gear-and-equipment-used-for-camping.com/camping-food.html# |archive-date=2009-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehydration often produces a more compact, albeit slightly heavier, end result than freeze-drying.

Surplus precooked military Meals, [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|Meals, Ready-to-Eat]] (MREs) are sometimes used by campers. These meals contain precooked foods in [[retort pouch]]es. A retort pouch is a plastic and metal foil laminate pouch that is used as an alternative to traditional industrial [[canning]] methods.

=== Diet food ===
[[File:New KM.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A "low fat" child's meal from [[Burger King]], with "apple fries" replacing fried potato chips, and a serving of [[macaroni and cheese]] as its main dish]]
{{Main|Diet food}}

[[Diet food]] (or "dietetic food") refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat, carbohydrates, abhor/adhore sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or [[Dieting|diet.]] Such foods are usually intended to assist in weight loss or a change in body type, although [[bodybuilding supplements]] are designed to aid in gaining weight or muscle.

The process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low-food-energy substitute for some high-food-energy ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NCCdphp/dnpa/nutrition/pdf/r2p_energy_density.pdf|title=Low-Energy-Dense Foods|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's [[sugar]] with a [[sugar substitute]] as is common with diet soft drinks such as [[Coca-Cola]] (for example [[Diet Coke]]). In some snacks, the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. In other cases, low-fat ingredients may be used as replacements.

In [[whole grain]] foods, the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch component of the flour. Since certain fibers have no food energy, this results in a modest energy reduction. Another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as [[resistant starch]] or [[dietary fiber]], to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction.

=== Finger food ===
[[File:AfternoonTea.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Tea (meal)#Afternoon tea|Afternoon tea]] finger foods]]
{{Main|Finger food}}

[[Finger food]] is [[food]] meant to be eaten directly using the [[hand]]s, in contrast to food eaten with a [[knife]] and [[fork]], [[spoon]], [[chopsticks]], or other [[cutlery|utensil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Finger Food |author=Kay Halsey|year= 1999|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=962-593-444-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cultures, food is almost always eaten with the hands; for example, [[Ethiopian cuisine]] is eaten by rolling various dishes up in ''[[injera]]'' [[bread]].&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Arrowsmith-Brown (trans.), ''Prutky's Travels in Ethiopia and other Countries'' with notes by Richard Pankhurst (London: Hakluyt Society, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;  Foods considered [[street food]]s are frequently, though not exclusively, finger foods.

In the [[Western Hemisphere|western]] world, finger foods are often either [[appetizers]] ([[hors d'œuvre]]s) or [[entree]]/[[main course]] items. Examples of these are miniature meat pies, [[sausage roll]]s, sausages on sticks, cheese and olives on sticks, chicken drumsticks or [[Buffalo wing|wings]], [[spring roll]]s, miniature [[quiche]]s, [[samosa]]s, [[sandwich]]es, Merenda or other such based foods, such as [[pita]]s or items in [[buns]], [[bhajji]]s, [[potato wedges]], [[vol au vent]]s, several other such small items and [[risotto]] balls ([[arancini]]). Other well-known foods that are generally eaten with the hands include [[Hamburger|hamburgers]], [[pizza]], [[Chips (hot food)|Chips]], [[hot dog]]s, [[fruit]] and [[bread]].

In East Asia, foods like pancakes or flatbreads (''bing'' 饼) and street foods such as [[chuanr|chuan]] (串, also pronounced ''chuan'') are often eaten with the hands.

{{clear}}

=== Fresh food ===
[[File:Culinary fruits front view.jpg|thumb|150px|Fresh fruits.]]
{{Main|Fresh food}}

[[Fresh food]] is [[food]] which has not been [[food preservation|preserved]] and has not [[food spoilage|spoiled]] yet. For [[vegetables]] and [[fruits]], this means that they have been recently harvested and treated properly [[postharvest]]; for [[meat]], it has recently been [[animal slaughter|slaughtered]] and [[butcher]]ed; for [[fish as food|fish]], it has been recently caught or harvested and kept cold.

[[Dairy products]] are fresh and will spoil quickly. Thus, [[fresh cheese]] is cheese which has not been dried or salted for aging. [[Soured cream]] may be considered "fresh" ([[crème fraîche]]). 

Fresh food has not been [[food drying|dried]], [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]], [[salting (food)|salted]], [[frozen food|frozen]], [[canning|canned]], [[pickling|pickled]], or otherwise preserved.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/74535 ''s.v.'' 'fresh']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frozen food ===
[[File:Tsukiji.CuttingFrozenTuna.jpg|thumb|150px|Cutting frozen [[tuna]] using a [[bandsaw]] in the [[Tsukiji fish market]] in Tokyo, Japan (2002)]]
{{Main|Frozen food}}

[[Freezing]] food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten. Since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season.&lt;ref&gt;Tressler, Evers.  ''The Freezing Preservation of Foods'' pp. 213-217&lt;/ref&gt; Freezing food slows down decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species. In the [[food industry|food commodity industry]], there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or [[flash freezing]]). The freezing kinetics is important to preserve the food quality and texture. Quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure. [[Cryogenic freezing]] is the quickest freezing technology available due to the ultra low liquid nitrogen temperature {{convert|-196|C|F|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Da-Wen (2001). [http://www.worldcat.org/title/advances-in-food-refrigeration/oclc/48154735 ''Advances in food refrigeration'']. Leatherhead Food Research Association Publishing. p.318. (Cryogenic refrigeration)&lt;/ref&gt;

Preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household [[freezer]]s. Accepted advice to householders was to freeze food on the day of purchase. An initiative by a supermarket group in 2012 (backed by the UK's [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]]) promotes the freezing of food "as soon as possible up to the product's 'use by' date". The [[Food Standards Agency]] was reported as supporting the change, providing the food had been stored correctly up to that time.&lt;ref name="guardian changes food freezing advice"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/10/sainsbury-food-freezing-advice-waste | title=Sainsbury's changes food freezing advice in bid to cut food waste | work=''[[The Guardian]]'' | date=February 10, 2012 | accessdate=February 10, 2012 | author=Smithers, Rebecca | quote=Long-standing advice to consumers to freeze food on the day of purchase is to be changed by a leading supermarket chain, as part of a national initiative to further reduce food waste.

The initiative is backed by the government's waste advisory body, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) [...] Bob Martin, food safety expert at the Food Standards Agency, said: "Freezing after the day of purchase shouldn't pose a food safety risk as long as food has been stored in accordance with any instructions provided.

=== Functional food ===
{{Main|Functional food}}

A [[functional food]] is a [[food]] given an additional [[wikt:function|function]] (often one related to health-promotion or disease prevention) by adding new ingredients or more of existing ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1171305207040&amp;lang=e What are Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals?

=== Health food ===
{{Main|Health food}}

[[Health food]] is food marketed to provide [[human health]] effects beyond a normal [[healthy diet]] required for [[human nutrition]]. Foods marketed as health foods may be part of one or more categories, such as [[natural foods]], [[organic food]]s, [[whole food]]s,  [[Vegetarian food|vegetarian foods]] or [[dietary supplement]]s. These products may be sold in [[health food store]]s or in the health food or organic sections of [[grocery store]]s.

=== Healthy food ===
[[File:Marketvegetables.jpg|thumb|150px|Leafy green, [[allium]], and [[cruciferous vegetables]] are key components of a healthy diet]]

A [[healthy diet]] is a [[dieting|diet]] that helps to maintain or improve overall [[health]]. A healthy diet provides the body with essential [[Human nutrition|nutrition]]: fluid, [[macronutrient]]s, [[micronutrient]]s, and adequate [[calorie]]s.&lt;ref name="lean"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Principles of Human Nutrition|last = Lean|first = Michael E.J.|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |issue = 2|pages = 61–65|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=World Health Organization, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|title=Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition|date=2004|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-9241546126|edition=2.|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42716/9241546123.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For people who are healthy, a healthy diet is not complicated and contains mostly fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and includes little to no [[processed food]] and [[sweetened beverage]]s.  The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-animal source of [[vitamin B12]] is needed for those following a [[vegan diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melina|first1=Vesanto|last2=Craig|first2=Winston|last3=Levin|first3=Susan|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|date=December 2016|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1970–1980|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2016.09.025|pmid=27886704}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various [[List of nutrition guides|nutrition guides]] are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy.

[[Kosher foods]] are those that conform to the [[Jewish]] dietary regulations of ''[[kashrut]]'' ([[dietary law]]), primarily derived from [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]]. Food that may be consumed according to ''[[halakha]]'' (law) is termed ''kosher'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|ʃ|ər}}) in English, from the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''kashér'' ({{Hebrew|כָּשֵׁר}}), meaning "fit" (in this context, fit for consumption). Food that is not in accordance with  law is called ''[[treif]]'' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|eɪ|f}}; {{lang-yi|טרײף}}, derived from {{lang-he|טְרֵפָה}} ''trāfáh'') meaning "torn."

[[Live food]] is [[life|living]] [[food]] for [[carnivore|carnivorous]] or [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[animal]]s kept in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]]; in other words, small animals such as [[insect]]s or [[mouse|mice]] fed to larger carnivorous or omnivorous species kept in either in a [[zoo]] or as [[pet]]. 

Live food is commonly used as feed for a variety of species of exotic pets and zoo animals, ranging from [[alligator]]s to various [[snake]]s, [[frog]]s and [[lizard]]s, but also including other, non-[[reptile]], non-[[amphibian]] carnivores and omnivores (for instance, [[pet skunk|skunks]], which are omnivorous [[mammal]]s, can be technically be fed a limited amount of live food, though this is not known to be a common practice). Common live food ranges from [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s (used as an inexpensive form of feed for carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles such as [[bearded dragon]]s and commonly available in [[pet store]]s for this reason), [[waxworm]]s, [[mealworms]] and to a lesser extent [[cockroach]]es and [[locust]]s, to small [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s such as mice or [[chicken]]s.

[[Medical foods]] are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. In the United States they were defined in the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments&lt;ref name="CFR21.109"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/CFR101-9.HTML|title=CFR 21 Part 101 Subpart A|author=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are subject to the general food and safety labeling requirements of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. In Europe the [[European Food Safety Authority]] established definitions for "foods for special medical purposes" (FSMPs) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outcome of a public consultation on the Draft Scientific and Technical Guidance of the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on foods for special medical purposes in the context of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 609/2013|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/sp.efsa.2015.EN-904/pdf|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural foods ===
[[Image:Foods.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The term “natural” is applied to many foods, but does not have a consistent meaning.]]
{{Main|Natural foods}}

[[Natural foods]] and "all natural foods" are widely used terms in [[food labeling]] and marketing with a variety of definitions, most of which are vague. The term is often assumed to imply foods that are not processed and whose ingredients are all [[natural product]]s (in the chemist's sense of that term), thus conveying an [[appeal to nature]]. But the lack of standards in most jurisdictions means that the term assures nothing. In some countries, the term "natural" is defined and enforced. In others, such as the [[United States]], it is not enforced.

“Natural foods” are often assumed to be foods that are not [[Food processing|processed]], or do not contain any [[food additive]]s, or do not contain particular additives such as [[hormone]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, [[sweeteners]], [[food colors]], or [[Flavouring|flavorings]] that were not originally in the food.&lt;ref&gt;Ikerd, John. [http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-New%20Food%20Movement.htm The New American Food Economy.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, many people (63%) when surveyed showed a preference for products labeled "natural" compared to the unmarked counterparts, based on the common belief (86% of polled consumers) that the term "natural" indicated that the food does not contain any artificial ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, A. (2014). "Natural" Foods: Inherently Confusing. Journal of Corporation Law, 39(3), 657-674. http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/99055404/natural-foods-inherently-confusing&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are variously used and misused on labels and in advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch4ae.shtml|title=Guide to Food Labeling and Advertising, Chapter 4|publisher=[[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]’s ''[[Codex Alimentarius]]'' does not recognize the term “natural” but does have a standard for [[organic food]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/web/standard_list.do?lang=en|title=List of standards|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative-calorie food ===
{{Main|Negative-calorie food}}

A [[negative-calorie food]] is food that supposedly requires more [[food energy]] to be [[digestion|digested]] than the food provides. Its thermic effect or [[specific dynamic action]]—the caloric "cost" of digesting the food—would be greater than its food energy content. Despite its recurring popularity in [[weight loss|dieting]] guides, there is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that any food is calorically negative. While some chilled beverages are calorically negative, the effect is minimal&lt;ref name=chow /&gt; and drinking large amounts of water [[water intoxication|can be dangerous]].

=== Organic food ===
[[File:pepperseggplants.jpg|thumb|150px|Organic fruits and vegetables at a [[farmers' market]] in Argentina]]
{{Main|Organic food}}

[[Organic food]] is [[food]] produced by methods that comply with the standards of [[organic farming]]. Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming in general features practices that strive to cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve [[biodiversity]]. Organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s in farming. In general, organic foods are also usually not processed using [[Food irradiation|irradiation]], industrial solvents or synthetic [[food additives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lhom/organictext.html |title=Pesticides in Organic Farming |quote=Organic foods are not necessarily pesticide-free. Organic foods are produced using only certain pesticides with specific ingredients. Organic pesticides tend to have substances like soaps, lime sulfur and [[hydrogen peroxide]] as ingredients. Not all natural substances are allowed in organic agriculture; some chemicals like arsenic, strychnine, and tobacco dust (nicotine sulfate) are prohibited.|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain [[Organic certification|special certification]] in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these [[regulations]], organic food is produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by regional organizations, national governments and international organizations. Although the produce of [[kitchen garden]]s may be organic, selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities, such as the [[National Organic Program|US Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) or [[European Commission]] (EC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/organic-farming/what-is-organic-farming/organic-certification/index_en.htm|title=Organic certification|publisher=European Commission: Agriculture and Rural Development|date=2014|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fertilizing and the use of pesticides in conventional farming has caused, and is causing, enormous damage worldwide to local [[ecosystem]]s, biodiversity, [[groundwater]] and [[drinking water]] supplies, and sometimes farmer health and [[fertility]]. These environmental, economic and health issues are intended to be minimized or avoided in organic farming. From a consumers perspective, there is not sufficient evidence in scientific and [[medical literature]] to support claims that organic food is [[Food safety|safer]] or healthier to eat than conventionally grown food. While there may be some differences in the nutrient and [[antinutrient]] contents of organically- and conventionally-produced food, the variable nature of [[food production]] and handling makes it difficult to generalize results.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blair1"&gt;Blair, Robert.

[[Peasant foods]] are dishes specific to a particular culture, made from accessible and inexpensive ingredients, and usually prepared and seasoned to make them more palatable. They often form a significant part of the [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]] of people who live in [[poverty]], or have a lower income compared to the average for their society or country.

Peasant foods have been described as being the diet of [[peasant]]s, that is, [[tenant farmer|tenant]] or poorer farmers and their [[Farmworker|farm workers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=coTiVJiWS00C&amp;pg=PA190 | title=Eating Right in the Renaissance | publisher=University of California Press | author=Albala, Ken | year=2002 | pages=190 | isbn=0520927281}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension, of other cash-poor people. They may use ingredients, such as [[offal]] and less-tender cuts of meat, which are not as marketable as a [[cash crop]]. Characteristic recipes often consist of hearty one-dish meals, in which chunks of meat and various vegetables are eaten in a savory broth, with bread or other [[staple food]]. [[Sausage]]s are also amenable to varied readily available ingredients, and they themselves tend to contain offal and grains.

Peasant foods often involve skilled preparation by knowledgeable cooks using inventiveness and skills passed down from earlier generations. Such dishes are often prized as ethnic foods by other cultures and by descendants of the native culture who still desire these traditional dishes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

"Seasonal" here refers to the times of year when the harvest or the flavour of a given type food is at its peak. This is usually the time when the item is harvested, with some exceptions; an example being [[sweet potatoes]] which are best eaten quite a while after harvest. It also appeals to people who prefer a [[low carbon diet]] that reduces the [[greenhouse gas emissions]] resulting from food consumption ([[Food miles]]).

{{Main|Shelf-stable food}}

[[Shelf-stable food]] (sometimes ]]ambient food]]) is [[food]] of a type that can be safely stored at room temperature in a sealed container. This includes foods that would normally be stored refrigerated but which have been [[food processing|processed]] so that they can be safely stored at room or [[ambient temperature]] for a usefully long [[shelf life]]. 

Various [[food preservation]] and [[packaging]] techniques are used to extend a food's shelf life.  Decreasing the amount of [[water activity|available water]] in a product, increasing its acidity, or [[Food irradiation|irradiating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Gardiner|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/health/policy/22spinach.html|title=Irradiation: A safe measure for safer iceberg lettuce and spinach|work=The New York Times|date=August 21, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise sterilizing the food and then sealing it in an air-tight container are all ways of depriving [[bacteria]] of suitable conditions in which to thrive. All of these approaches can all extend a food's shelf life without unacceptably changing its taste or texture.

For some foods alternative ingredients can be used. Common [[oil]]s and [[fat]]s become [[rancidification|rancid]] relatively quickly if not refrigerated; replacing them with [[hydrogenated oil]]s delays the onset of rancidity, increasing shelf life. This is a common approach in industrial food production, but recent concerns about health hazards associated with [[trans fat]]s have led to their strict control in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leth|first=Torben|website=tfX: The campaign against trans fat in foods|url=http://www.tfx.org.uk/page116.html|title=Denmark's trans fat law|date=2012|accessdate=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even where trans fats are not prohibited, in many places there are new labeling laws (or rules), which require information to be printed on packages, or to be published elsewhere, about the amount of trans fat contained in certain products.

[[Space food]] is a type of food product created and [[Food processing|processed]] for consumption by [[astronaut]]s in [[outer space]]. The food has specific requirements of providing balanced nutrition for individuals working in space, while being easy and safe to store, prepare and consume in the machinery-filled [[Weightlessness|weightless]] environments of manned [[spacecraft]]. 

In recent years, space food has been used by various nations engaging on space programs as a way to share and show off their [[cultural identity]] and facilitate [[intercultural communication]]. Although astronauts consume a wide variety of foods and beverages in space, the initial idea from The Man in Space Committee of the Space Science Board in 1963 was to supply astronauts with a formula diet that would supply all the needed vitamins and nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12419/working-group-on-nutrition-and-feeding-problems |title=Working Group on Nutrition and Feeding Problems |publisher=The National Academies Press |date=April 1963 |doi=10.17226/12419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some confusion over the usage of the term surrounding the inclusion of certain foods, in particular animal foods. The modern usage of the term whole foods diet is now widely synonymous with "whole foods [[Plant-based diet|plant-based diet]]" with animal products, oil and salt no longer constituting whole foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=S2cCyLkw2J0C&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=wfpb|title=Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition (chapter 1)|last=Campbell|first=T.

The earliest use of the term in the post-industrial age appears to be in 1946 in The Farmer, a quarterly magazine published and edited from his farm by [[Frank Newman Turner|F.

Most food has always been obtained through [[agriculture]]. With increasing concern over both the methods and products of modern [[industrial agriculture]], there has been a growing trend toward [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable agricultural]] practices. This approach, partly fueled by consumer demand, encourages [[biodiversity]], local self-reliance and [[organic farming]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;Mason&lt;/ref&gt; Major influences on food production include international organizations (e.g. the [[World Trade Organization]] and [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), national government policy (or law), and war.&lt;ref name="Messer"&gt;Messer, 53–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular culture, the mass production of food, specifically meats such as [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] and [[beef]], has come under fire from various [[Documentary film|documentaries]], most recently [[Food, Inc]], documenting the mass slaughter and poor treatment of animals, often for easier revenues from [[corporate farming|large corporations]]. Along with a current trend towards [[environmentalism]], people in [[Western culture]] have had an increasing trend towards the use of [[Herbalism|herbal supplements]], foods for a specific group of people (such as dieters, women, or athletes), [[functional food]]s (fortified foods, such as omega-3 eggs), and a more ethnically diverse diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/nutrition/Ome-Pop/Popular-Culture-Food-and.html|title=Popular Culture, Food and|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529201955/http://www.faqs.org/nutrition/Ome-Pop/Popular-Culture-Food-and.html|archivedate=29 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several organisations have begun calling for a new kind of agriculture in which [[agroecosystem]]s provide food but also support vital [[ecosystem]] services so that [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]] and [[biodiversity]] are maintained rather than compromised. According to the [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[UNEP]], well-managed agroecosystems not only provide food, fiber and animal products, they also provide services such as [[flood mitigation]], [[groundwater recharge]], [[erosion control]] and habitats for plants, birds, fish and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Boelee, E.

As animals have [[Evolution|evolved]], the tastes that provide the most energy ([[sugar]] and [[fat]]s) are the most pleasant to eat while others, such as [[bitter (taste)|bitter]], are not enjoyable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/28063.php|title=Evolution of taste receptor may have shaped human sensitivity to toxic compounds|work=Medical News Today|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927120914/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/28063.php|archivedate=27 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water, while important for survival, has no taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/598799.cms |work=The Times Of India |title=Why does pure water have no taste or colour? |date=2004-04-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230042140/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/598799.cms |archivedate=2015-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fats, on the other hand, especially [[saturated fat]]s, are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.

===Sweet===

[[File:Saccharose2.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Structure of sucrose]]
Generally regarded as the most pleasant taste, [[sweetness]] is almost always caused by a type of simple [[sugar]] such as [[glucose]] or [[fructose]], or [[disaccharides]] such as [[sucrose]], a molecule combining glucose and fructose.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. Artificial sweeteners such as [[sucralose]] are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. Other types of sugar include [[raw sugar]], which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.

The [[stevia]] plant contains a compound known as [[steviol]] which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--note--&gt;The [[sweetness]] multiplier "300 times" comes from [http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=67&amp;type=6&amp;root=3&amp;parent=3&amp;cat=30 subjective evaluations by a panel of test subjects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123124043/http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=67&amp;type=6&amp;root=3&amp;parent=3&amp;cat=30 |date=January 23, 2009 }} tasting various dilutions compared to a standard dilution of [[sucrose]]. Sources referenced in this article say steviosides have up to 250 times the sweetness of sucrose, but others, including stevioside brands such as SweetLeaf, claim 300 times. 1/3 to 1/2 teaspoon (1.6–2.5 ml) of stevioside powder is claimed to have equivalent sweetening power to 1 cup (237 ml) of sugar.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sour===

Sourness is caused by the taste of [[acid]]s, such as [[vinegar]] in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include [[citrus]], specifically [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], and to a lesser degree [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]]. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone [[rancidity|rancid]] due to bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;States "having an acid taste like lemon or vinegar: she sampled the wine and found it was sour. (of food, esp. milk) spoiled because of fermentation." New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.

===Salty===
[[File:Piles of Salt Salar de Uyuni Bolivia Luca Galuzzi 2006 a.jpg|thumb|Salt mounds in [[Bolivia]]]]

[[Saltiness]] is the taste of [[alkali metal]] [[ions]] such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]. It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including [[sea salt]], [[fleur de sel]], [[kosher salt]], mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate [[electrolyte]] balance, which is the [[kidney]]'s function. Salt may be iodized, meaning [[iodine]] has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes [[thyroid]] function. Some canned foods, notably [[soup]]s or packaged [[broth]]s, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Fe-Ge/Food-Preservatives.html|title=Food Preservatives|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513045432/http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Fe-Ge/Food-Preservatives.html|archivedate=13 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bitter===

[[Bitter (taste)|Bitterness]] is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste. Unsweetened dark [[chocolate]], [[caffeine]], lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter.

===Umami===

[[Umami]], the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for delicious, is the least known in Western popular culture but has a long tradition in Asian cuisine. Umami is the taste of [[glutamate]]s, especially [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG).&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; It is characterized as savory, meaty, and rich in flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oKHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=umami+is+characterized+as+savory,+meaty,+and+rich+in+flavor#v=onepage&amp;q=umami%20is%20characterized%20as%20savory,%20meaty,%20and%20rich%20in%20flavor&amp;f=false|title=Healing Herbal Teas: Learn to Blend 101 Specially Formulated Teas for Stress Management, Common Ailments, Seasonal Health, and Immune Support|last=Farr|first=Sarah|date=2016|publisher=Storey Publishing|isbn=9781612125749|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salmon]] and [[mushrooms]] are foods high in umami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=njypDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT86&amp;dq=%C2%A0+%22Salmon%22,+mushrooms+are+foods+high+in+umami.#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0%20%22Salmon%22,%20mushrooms%20are%20foods%20high%20in%20umami.&amp;f=false|title=Wine: The Essential Guide to Tasting, History, Culture and More|last=Feely|first=Caro|date=2015-11-12|publisher=Summersdale Publishers LTD|isbn=9781783726837|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Cuisine|Regional cuisine|Global cuisines}}
[[File:Bali cuisine.jpg|thumb|right|Typical [[Balinese cuisine]] in [[Indonesia]]]]
Many scholars claim that the rhetorical function of food is to represent the culture of a country, and that it can be used as a form of communication. According to Goode, Curtis and Theophano, food "is the last aspect of an ethnic culture to be lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shugart|first=Helene A.|year=2008|title=Sumptuous Texts: Consuming "Otherness" in the Food Film Genre|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|volume=25 |issue=1|pages=68–90|doi=10.1080/15295030701849928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cultures have a recognizable cuisine, a specific set of [[cooking]] traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture, which evolves over time. Other differences include preferences (hot or cold, spicy, etc.) and practices, the study of which is known as [[gastronomy]]. Many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. This also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption.

Some popular types of ethnic foods include [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[French cuisine|French]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[African cuisine|African]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese]]. Various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food [[Habit (psychology)|habits]]. While [[evolution]]arily speaking, as opposed to culturally, humans are [[omnivore]]s, religion and social constructs such as [[morality]], [[activism]], or [[environmentalism]] will often affect which foods they will consume. Food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of [[taste]], the perception of flavor from eating and drinking. Certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.

===Presentation===
[[File:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|thumb|left|A [[France|French]] basil salmon [[terrine (food)|terrine]], with eye-appealing [[Garnish (food)|garnishes]]]]
{{Main|Food presentation}}
Aesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods. A common saying is that people "eat with their eyes". Food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor, even if unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brain-food.org/blog/you-first-eat-with-your-eyes |title=You first eat with your eyes |publisher= |accessdate=29 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529203250/http://www.brain-food.org/blog/you-first-eat-with-your-eyes |archivedate=29 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Food Texture, Andrew J. Rosenthal"&gt;Food Texture, Andrew J. Rosenthal&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contrast in texture===
[[Texture (food)|Texture]] plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods. Contrasts in textures, such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish, may increase the appeal of eating it. Common examples include adding [[granola]] to [[yogurt]], adding [[crouton]]s to a [[salad]] or [[soup]], and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping, such as jam or butter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=aJBIbvClWfcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Food+texture#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title = Food Texture: Measurement and Perception | isbn = 978-0-8342-1238-1 | author1 = Rosenthal | first1 = Andrew J | date = 1999-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contrast in taste===
Another universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation. For example, such opposite flavors as [[sweetness]] and [[saltiness]] tend to go well together, as in [[kettle corn]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]].

===Food preparation===
{{Main|Outline of food preparation}}
While many foods can be eaten raw, many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety, [[palatability]], [[Mouthfeel|texture]], or [[flavor]]. At the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices. It may also involve mixing, heating or cooling, [[pressure cooking]], fermentation, or combination with other food. In a home, most food preparation takes place in a [[kitchen]]. Some preparation is done to enhance the [[taste]] or aesthetic appeal; other preparation may help to [[Food preservation|preserve]] the food; others may be involved in cultural identity. A [[meal]] is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, 11–19&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LG refrigerator interior.jpg|thumb|A refrigerator helps to keep foods fresh.]]

====Animal preparation====
The preparation of animal-based food usually involves [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughter]], [[evisceration (organ removal)|evisceration]], hanging, portioning, and [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering]]. In developed countries, this is usually done outside the home in [[slaughterhouses]], which are used to process animals en masse for meat production. Many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law. For example, the [[United States]] has established the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] of 1958, which requires that an animal be stunned before killing. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as [[kosher]], [[shechita]], and [[dhabīḥah]] halal. Strict interpretations of [[kashrut]] require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the local level, a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts, and pre-wrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper. In addition, fish and [[seafood]] may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fish monger. However, fish butchery may be done on board a fishing vessel and quick-frozen for preservation of quality.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 202–206&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cooking====
[[File:Wok cooking and the heat source by The Pocket in Nanjing.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Cooking with a [[wok]] in [[China]]]]
{{Main|Cooking}}

The term "cooking" encompasses a vast range of methods, tools, and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food. Cooking technique, known as [[culinary art]], generally requires the selection, measurement, and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result. Constraints on success include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual cook.&lt;ref&gt;McGee Chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, and religious considerations that affect it.&lt;ref name="silhnc"&gt;Mead, 11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooking requires applying heat to a food which usually, though not always, chemically changes the molecules, thus changing its flavor, [[Mouthfeel|texture]], appearance, and nutritional properties.&lt;ref&gt;McGee&lt;/ref&gt; Cooking certain proteins, such as egg whites, meats, and fish, denatures the protein, causing it to firm. There is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at ''[[Homo erectus]]'' campsites dating from 420,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Boiling as a means of cooking requires a container, and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium BC with the introduction of [[pottery]].&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 784.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cooking equipment=====
[[File:Pfanne (Edelstahl).jpg|thumb|A [[stainless steel]] [[frying pan]]]]
[[File:TraditionalAsado.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[asado]] (barbecue)]]
{{Main|Cookware and bakeware}}

There are many different types of equipment used for cooking.

[[Oven]]s are mostly hollow devices that get very hot (up to {{convert|500|°F|°C}}) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens. For example, Indian culture uses a [[tandoor]] oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 782–783&lt;/ref&gt; Western kitchens use variable temperature [[convection oven]]s, conventional ovens, [[toaster oven]]s, or non-radiant heat ovens like the [[microwave oven]]. Classic Italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, [[natural gas|gas]], electric, or oil-fired.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 539,784.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of cook-tops are used as well. They carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. Cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source, such as a [[sauté pan]], sauce pot, [[frying pan]], or [[pressure cooker]]. These pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as [[steam]]ing, [[simmer]]ing, [[boiling]], and [[Poaching (cooking)|poaching]] for moist methods, while the dry methods include [[sauté]]ing, [[pan fry]]ing, and [[deep-fry]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, 771–791&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. A [[Grill (cooking)|grill]] operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. An open pit barbecue in the American south is one example along with the American style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 356.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] style of barbecue is called [[barbacoa]], which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire. In [[Argentina]], an [[asado]] (Spanish for "grilled") is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground, on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled.&lt;ref&gt;Asado Argentina&lt;/ref&gt;

====Raw food preparation{{anchor|Raw Food Preparation}}====
[[File:2007feb-sushi-odaiba-manytypes.jpg|thumb|left|Many types of [[fish]] ready to be eaten, including [[salmon]] and [[tuna]]]]

Certain cultures highlight animal and vegetable foods in a [[Raw foodism|raw state]]. [[Salad]]s consisting of raw vegetables or fruits are common in many cuisines. [[Sashimi]] in [[Japanese cuisine]] consists of raw sliced [[fish]] or other meat, and [[sushi]] often incorporates raw fish or seafood. [[Steak tartare]] and salmon tartare are dishes made from diced or ground raw beef or salmon, mixed with various ingredients and served with [[baguette]]s, [[brioche]], or [[frites]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 786–787.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, [[carpaccio]] is a dish of very thinly sliced raw [[beef]], drizzled with a [[vinaigrette]] made with olive oil.&lt;ref&gt;Robuchon, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The health food movement known as [[raw foodism]] promotes a mostly [[vegan]] diet of raw fruits, vegetables, and grains prepared in various ways, including juicing, food dehydration, sprouting, and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above {{convert|118|°F|°C|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 656&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a raw meat dish is [[ceviche]], a Latin American dish made with raw meat that is "cooked" from the highly acidic citric juice from lemons and limes along with other aromatics such as garlic.

===Restaurants===
[[File:Inside_Le_Procope.jpg|thumb|right|[[Café Procope]] in Paris was founded in 1686]]
[[File:Allyn House restaurant menu (March 5, 1859).jpg|thumb|The Allyn House restaurant menu (March 5, 1859)]]
{{Main|Restaurant}}

Restaurants employ [[chef]]s to prepare the food, and [[waiting staff|waiters]] to serve customers at the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/restaurant|work=collinsdictionary.com|title=Definition of 'restaurant'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term restaurant comes from an old term for a restorative [[broth|meat broth]]; this broth (or bouillon) was served in elegant outlets in Paris from the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/restaurant|work=etymonline.com|title=restaurant (n.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history/&gt; These refined "restaurants" were a marked change from the usual basic eateries such as inns and taverns,&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/menus/history-restaurant|work=digital.library.unlv.edu|title=The History of the Restaurant}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some had developed from early [[Parisian café]]s, such as [[Café Procope]], by first serving bouillon, then adding other cooked food to their menus.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 660–661.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Commercial eateries existed during the [[Roman period]], with evidence of 150 "thermopolia", a form of fast food restaurant, found in [[Pompeii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/pompeii/9850077/Pompeii-exhibition-the-food-and-drink-of-the-ancient-Roman-cities.html|work=telegraph.co.uk|title=Pompeii exhibition: the food and drink of the ancient Roman cities|author=Bee Wilson|date=3 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in [[China]] during the [[Song dynasty]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

In 2005, the population of the United States spent $496 billion on out-of-home [[dining]]. Expenditures by type of out-of-home dining were as follows: 40% in full-service restaurants, 37.2% in limited service restaurants ([[fast food]]), 6.6% in schools or colleges, 5.4% in bars and [[vending machine]]s, 4.7% in hotels and motels, 4.0% in recreational places, and 2.2% in others, which includes military bases.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source example|date=October 2018}}{{Relevance inline|date=October 2018}}

===Food manufacturing===
[[File:Food packages (1).jpg|thumb|Packaged household food items]]
{{Main|Food manufacture}}
Packaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase. This can be as simple as a [[butcher]] preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international [[food industry]]. Early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation, packaging, and transportation. This mainly involved [[salting (food)|salting]], [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], curdling, [[drying (food)|drying]], [[pickling]], [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]], and [[smoking (food)|smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;Aguilera, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Food manufacturing arose during the [[industrial revolution]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This development took advantage of new [[Mass-marketing|mass markets]] and emerging technology, such as [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], preservation, [[packaging]] and [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]], and transportation. It brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants.&lt;ref name=Jango&gt;Jango-Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 21st century, a two-tier structure has arisen, with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of well-known food [[brand]]s. There also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies.&lt;ref&gt;Hannaford&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture. Computer-based control systems, sophisticated [[Food processing|processing]] and packaging methods, and [[logistics]] and [[food distribution|distribution]] advances can enhance product quality, improve [[food safety]], and reduce costs.&lt;ref name=Jango/&gt;

[[File:Population density countries 2017 world map, people per sq km.svg|thumb|[[Population density]] by country]]

===International food imports and exports===
{{see also|Population density}}
The [[World Bank]] reported that the European Union was the top food importer in 2005, followed at a distance by the USA and Japan. [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s need for food was especially well illustrated in [[World War II]].  Despite the implementation of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], Britain remained dependent on food imports and the result was a long term engagement in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].

Food is traded and marketed on a global basis. The variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season.&lt;ref&gt;The Economic Research Service of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1961 and 1999, there was a 400% increase in worldwide food exports.&lt;ref&gt;Regmi&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries are now economically dependent on food exports, which in some cases account for over 80% of all exports.&lt;ref&gt;[[CIA World Factbook]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, over 100 countries became signatories to the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] in a dramatic increase in [[trade liberalization]]. This included an agreement to reduce subsidies paid to farmers, underpinned by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] enforcement of [[Agricultural policy|agricultural subsidy]], [[Tax, tariff and trade|tariffs]], import [[Quota Share|quotas]], and settlement of trade disputes that cannot be bilaterally resolved.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, The Uruguay Round&lt;/ref&gt; Where trade barriers are raised on the disputed grounds of public health and safety, the WTO refer the dispute to the [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission, which was founded in 1962 by the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and the World Health Organization. Trade liberalization has greatly affected world food trade.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Bossche&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing and retailing===
[[File:Fredmeyer edit 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Packaged food aisles of supermarket in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[United States|United States of America]]]]
{{main|Food marketing}}
[[Food marketing]] brings together the producer and the consumer. The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. For example, fifty-six companies are involved in making one [[canning|can]] of chicken noodle soup. These businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 501–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the United States.

In the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace. Here food was sold to [[grocer]]s for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers.&lt;ref name="silhnc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jango/&gt; With the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them.&lt;ref name="silhnc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, [[supermarket]]s were born. Supermarkets brought with them a [[self service]] approach to shopping using [[shopping cart]]s, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through [[economies of scale]] and reduced staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Humphery&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large [[Corporation|companies]] control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers. Nevertheless, less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to [[advertising]], transportation, and intermediate corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff, Fred (Ed.) "[T]he farmer's share of the food dollar (after paying for input costs) has steadily declined from about 40 percent in 1910 to less than 10 percent in 1990."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prices===

It is rare for price spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once, but [[food prices]] suffered all-time peaks in 2008 and 2011, posting a 15% and 12% deflated increase year-over-year, representing prices higher than any data collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAO food prices index|url=http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/|website=FAO.org|accessdate=25 Feb 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224070948/http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/|archivedate=25 Feb 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. In China, the price of [[pork]] jumped 58% in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses, which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. However, new trade policies had made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983.&lt;ref name="cnn24march2008"&gt;"Food prices rising across the world", CNN. 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising food prices in those years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Mexico]],&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; and the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Food Prices Spur the Arab Spring?|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/world-july-dec11-food_09-07/|website=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=25 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429115550/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/world-july-dec11-food_09-07/|archivedate=29 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One cause of rising food prices is wealthier Asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. The past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of Asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry, which in 2008 accounted for more than 30% of production, while China alone accounts for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibisworld.com/media/2014/07/02/serving-diversity-major-trends-food-services-sector/ May 2008, Global Trends: – Food Production and Consumption: The China Effect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231060513/http://www.ibisworld.com/media/2014/07/02/serving-diversity-major-trends-food-services-sector/ |date=2014-12-31 }}, ''IBISWorld''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[Overseas Development Institute]] researchers showed that [[rice]] has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. This was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. More fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser, diesel and labour. Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities. The researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. The research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for Western African farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7687-end-cheap-rice-prices-rural-labour-wages Steve Wiggins and Sharada Keats, August 2013,  The end of cheap rice: a cause for celebration?

Most recently, global food prices have been more stable and relatively low, after a sizable increase in late 2017, they are back under 75% of the nominal value seen during the all-time high in the [[2010–12 world food price crisis|2011 food crisis]].

===As investment===
Institutions such as [[hedge fund]]s, [[pension fund]]s and [[investment bank]]s like [[Barclays Capital]], [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]]&lt;ref name="Ind"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-real-hunger-games-how-banks-gamble-on-food-prices--and-the-poor-lose-out-7606263.html | title=The real hunger games: How banks gamble on food prices – and the poor lose out | publisher=The Independent | accessdate=April 1, 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403171521/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-real-hunger-games-how-banks-gamble-on-food-prices--and-the-poor-lose-out-7606263.html | archivedate=April 3, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been instrumental in pushing up prices in the last five years, with investment in food [[commodity|commodities]] rising from $65bn to $126bn (£41bn to £79bn) between 2007 and 2012, contributing to 30-year highs. This has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food, according to the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; Financial institutions now make up 61% of all investment in [[wheat]] futures. According to [[Olivier De Schutter]], the UN special rapporteur on food, there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following [[George W Bush]]'s [[Commodities Futures Modernization Act]] of 2000.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; De Schutter told the Independent in March 2012: "What we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors, who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing – they never actually buy the ton of wheat or [[maize]]; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell. The result of this financialisation of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely speculative logic. This explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or bubbles exploding, because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand."&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; In 2011, 450 economists from around the world called on the [[G20]] to regulate the commodities market more.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt;

Some experts have said that speculation has merely aggravated other factors, such as [[climate change]], competition with [[bio-fuels]] and overall rising demand.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; However, some such as [[Jayati Ghosh]], professor of economics at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in [[New Delhi]], have pointed out that prices have increased irrespective of supply and demand issues: Ghosh points to world wheat prices, which doubled in the period from June to December 2010, despite there being no fall in global supply.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt;

==Famine and hunger==
Food deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately [[starvation]]. This is often connected with [[famine]], which involves the absence of food in entire communities. This can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality. [[Rationing]] is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage, most notably during times of war.&lt;ref name="Messer"/&gt;

Starvation is a significant international problem. Approximately 815 million people are undernourished, and over 16,000 children die per day from hunger-related causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; Food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] and is measured using [[famine scales]].&lt;ref&gt;Howe, 353–372&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food aid===
{{main|Food aid}}
[[Food aid]] can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food. It can be used to improve peoples' lives in the short term, so that a society can increase its standard of living to the point that food aid is no longer required.&lt;ref&gt;World Food Programme&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, badly managed food aid can create problems by disrupting local markets, depressing crop prices, and discouraging food production. Sometimes a cycle of food aid dependence can develop.&lt;ref&gt;Shah&lt;/ref&gt; Its provision, or threatened withdrawal, is sometimes used as a political tool to influence the policies of the destination country, a strategy known as [[food politics]]. Sometimes, food aid provisions will require certain types of food be purchased from certain sellers, and food aid can be misused to enhance the markets of donor countries.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke&lt;/ref&gt; International efforts to distribute food to the neediest countries are often coordinated by the [[World Food Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations World Food program&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
{{Main|Food safety}}
[[File:SalmonellaNIAID.jpg|thumb|left|[[Salmonella]] bacteria is a common cause of foodborne illness, particularly in undercooked [[chicken]] and [[chicken egg]]s.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HACCP Seven Principles.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ([[HACCP]]) Flowchart]] --&gt;

[[Foodborne illness]], commonly called "food poisoning", is caused by [[bacteria]], [[toxin]]s, [[virus]]es, [[parasite]]s, and [[prion]]s. Roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus&gt;[[National Institute of Health]], MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as "foreign bodies") during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlus/&gt;

[[Food poisoning]] has been recognized as a disease since as early as Hippocrates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hippocrates]], [[s:On acute diseases|On Acute Diseases]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of [[Rancidity|rancid]], contaminated, or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of [[hygiene]], refrigeration, and vermin controls in the 19th century. Discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat, and other [[microbiological]] studies by scientists such as [[Louis Pasteur]], contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today. This was further underpinned by the work of [[Justus von Liebig]], which led to the development of modern [[food storage]] and [[food preservation]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;Magner, 243–498&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the [[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]] ([[HACCP]]), which can identify and eliminate many risks.&lt;ref&gt;USDA&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate, ensuring an adequate cooking temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/index.html|title=Check Your Steps|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521002552/http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/index.html|archivedate=21 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foods that spoil easily, such as [[meats]], [[dairy]], and [[seafood]], must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared. As such, the rule of thumb is that cold foods (such as dairy products) should be kept cold and hot foods (such as soup) should be kept hot until storage. Cold meats, such as chicken, that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing, at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' or ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Chicken_Food_Safety_Focus/index.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040519004032/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Chicken_Food_Safety_Focus/index.asp|archivedate=2004-05-19|title=Fact sheets - Poultry Preparation - Focus on Chicken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allergies===
{{Main|Food allergy}}
Some people have [[allergies]] or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people. This occurs when a person's [[immune system]] mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. About 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy.&lt;ref name=allergy&gt;[[National Institute of Health]]&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. In some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. Common food allergens are [[gluten]], [[maize|corn]], [[shellfish]] (mollusks), [[peanut]]s, and [[soy]].&lt;ref name=allergy/&gt; Allergens frequently produce symptoms such as [[diarrhea]], [[rash]]es, bloating, [[vomiting]], and [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]. The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the [[allergen]].&lt;ref name=allergy/&gt;

Rarely, food allergies can lead to a [[medical emergency]], such as [[anaphylactic shock]], [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), and loss of consciousness. An allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut, although [[latex]] products can induce similar reactions.&lt;ref name=allergy/&gt; Initial treatment is with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), often carried by known patients in the form of an [[Epi-pen]] or [[Twinject]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epipen.com/epipen_main.aspx About Epipen], Epipen.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106164129/http://www.epipen.com/epipen_main.aspx |date=January 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twinject.com/ About Twinject], Twinject.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other health issues===
Human diet was estimated to cause perhaps around 35% of [[Diet and cancer|cancers]] in a human epidemiological analysis by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Richard Peto]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Doll | first1 = R. | last2 = Peto | first2 = R. | title = The causes of cancer: Quantitative estimates of avoidable risks of cancer in the United States today | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 1191–1308 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7017215 | doi=10.1093/jnci/66.6.1192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cancer may be caused by [[carcinogen]]s that are present in food naturally or as contaminants. Food contaminated with fungal growth may contain [[mycotoxin]]s such as [[aflatoxins]] which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts.  Other carcinogens identified in food include [[heterocyclic amine]]s generated in meat when cooked at high temperature, [[polyaromatic hydrocarbon]]s in charred meat and smoked fish, and [[nitrosamine]]s generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in [[cured meat]] such as [[bacon]].&lt;ref name="carcinogens and anticarcinogens"/&gt;

[[Anticarcinogen]]s that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruit and vegetables. [[Antioxidant]]s are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals. It is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens.&lt;ref name="carcinogens and anticarcinogens"&gt;{{cite book |title=Carcinogens and Anticarcinogens in the Human Diet |publisher=National Academy Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-309-05391-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many international certifications in cooking field, such as [[Monde Selection]]、A.A.Certification、iTQi. They use the high quality evaluation methods to make the food become more safe.

{{Main|Diet (nutrition)}}

===Cultural and religious diets===
Many cultures hold some food preferences and some food [[taboo]]s. Dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion. For example, only [[Kosher|kosher foods]] are permitted by [[Judaism]], [[halal]] foods by [[Islam]], and in [[Hinduism]] [[beef]] is restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Simoons&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics. This is highly related to a culture's [[cuisine]].

===Diet deficiencies===
{{Main|Avitaminosis}}
Dietary habits play a significant role in the health and mortality of all humans. Imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of [[adipose]] tissue, known as body fat.&lt;ref&gt;Nicklas&lt;/ref&gt; Poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have far-reaching effects on health. For instance, 30% of the world's population either has, or is at risk for developing, [[iodine deficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Merson, 245&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that at least 3 million children are blind due to [[vitamin A]] deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Merson, 231.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vitamin C]] deficiency results in [[scurvy]].&lt;ref&gt;Merson, 464.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calcium]], [[Vitamin D]], and [[phosphorus]] are inter-related; the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others. [[Kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]] are childhood disorders caused by lack of dietary protein.&lt;ref&gt;Merson, 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral, ethical, and health-conscious diets===
Many individuals limit what foods they eat for reasons of morality, or other habit. For instance, [[vegetarian]]s choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Others choose a [[Healthy diet|healthier diet]], avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of dietary fiber and [[antioxidant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter&lt;/ref&gt; [[Obesity]], a serious problem in the western world, leads to higher chances of developing [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], cancer and many other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Merson, 266–268.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from [[genetically modified food]].&lt;ref&gt;Parekh, 187–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Further concerns about the impact of industrial farming ([[Cereal|grains]]) on [[animal welfare]], human health, and the [[Ecology|environment]] are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits. This has led to the emergence of a movement with a preference for [[organic food|organic]] and [[local food]].&lt;ref&gt;Schor&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition and dietary problems==
[[File:USDA MyPlate green.svg|thumb|[[MyPlate]] replaced [[MyPyramid]] as the [[USDA]] nutrition guide.]]
Between the extremes of optimal health and death from [[starvation]] or [[malnutrition]], there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as [[scurvy]], [[obesity]], or [[osteoporosis]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular diseases]] as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Nutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are the [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] and [[vitamins]]. Additionally, food contains water and [[dietary fiber]].

As previously discussed, the body is designed by [[natural selection]] to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]]. Thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. In modern times, with [[biotechnology|advanced technology]], enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. Unfortunately, this promotes [[obesity]] in adults and children alike.

==Legal definition==
Some countries list a legal definition of food, often referring them with the word ''foodstuff''. These countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. The listing of items included as food include any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by [[human]]s. In addition to these foodstuffs, drink, [[chewing gum]], water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. Items not included in the legal definition of food include [[Pet food|animal feed]], live animals (unless being prepared for sale in a market), plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, [[cosmetics]], [[tobacco]] and tobacco products, [[narcotic]] or [[psychotropic substance]]s, and residues and contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Kingdom]] [[Office of Public Sector Information]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
A '''gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist''' ('''GnRH agonist''') is a type of medication which affects [[gonadotropin]]s and [[sex hormone]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid22028996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Magon N | title = Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists: Expanding vistas | journal = Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–7 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22028996 | pmc = 3193774 | doi = 10.4103/2230-8210.85575 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used for a variety of indications including in [[fertility medicine]] and to lower sex hormone levels in the treatment of [[hormone-sensitive cancer]]s such as [[prostate cancer]] and [[breast cancer]], certain [[gynecological disorder]]s like [[menorrhagia|heavy period]]s and [[endometriosis]], [[hyperandrogenism|high testosterone level]]s in women, [[precocious puberty|early puberty]] in children, as a part of [[transgender hormone therapy]], and to delay puberty in [[transgender youth]] among other uses. GnRH agonists are given by [[subcutaneous injection|injections into fat]], as [[subcutaneous implant|implants placed into fat]], and as [[nasal spray]]s.

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt;
[[Side effect]]s of GnRH agonists are related to [[sex hormone]] [[hypogonadism|deficiency]] and include [[symptom]]s of [[hypoandrogenism|low testosterone levels]] and [[hypoestrogenism|low estrogen levels]] such as [[hot flash]]es, [[sexual dysfunction]], [[vaginal atrophy]], [[osteoporosis]], [[infertility]], and diminished [[secondary sexual characteristic|sex-specific physical characteristic]]s. They are [[agonist]]s of the [[GnRH receptor]] and work by increasing or decreasing the [[secretion|release]] of gonadotropins and the [[biosynthesis|production]] of sex hormones by the [[gonad]]s. When used to suppress gonadotropin release, GnRH agonists can lower sex hormone levels by 95% in both sexes.&lt;ref name="Hemat2003"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Hemat RA |title=Andropathy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hfwlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120|date=2 March 2003|publisher=Urotext|isbn=978-1-903737-08-8|pages=120–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker2001"&gt;{{cite book | first = Kenneth L. | last = Becker | name-list-format = vanc | title = Principles and Practice of Endocrinology and Metabolism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVfzRvaucq8C&amp;pg=PA973|year=2001|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-1750-2|pages=973–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CorsonDerman1995"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Corson SL, Derman RJ |title=Fertility Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30EzZPp1ypYC&amp;pg=PA249|date=15 December 1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-9697978-0-7|pages=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19440008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Novara G, Galfano A, Secco S, Ficarra V, Artibani W | title = Impact of surgical and medical castration on serum testosterone level in prostate cancer patients | journal = Urologia Internationalis | volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–55 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19440008 | doi = 10.1159/000209352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- History, society, and culture --&gt;
GnRH was discovered in 1971 and GnRH analogues were introduced for medical use in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="GardnerSimón2017"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = David K. | last1 = Gardner | first2 = Carlos | last2 = Simón | name-list-format = vanc |title=Handbook of In Vitro Fertilization | edition = Fourth | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UgsqDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131 |date=26 June 2017|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4987-2947-5|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JamesonGroot2015"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = J.

GnRH analogues are available as [[generic drug|generic medication]]s. Despite this however, they continue to be very expensive.

==Medical uses==
GnRH agonists are useful in:

* [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation#Ovulation suppression|Suppression of spontaneous ovulation]] as part of [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation]], which is an essential component in [[in vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]] (IVF). Typically, after GnRH agonists have induced a state of hypoestrogenism, exogenous FSH is given to stimulate ovarian follicle, followed by [[human chorionic gonadotropin]]s (hCG) to [[oocyte release triggering|trigger oocyte release]]. GnRH agonists routinely used for this purpose are: buserelin, leuprorelin, nafarelin, and triptorelin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Loenen AC, Huirne JA, Schats R, Hompes PG, Lambalk CB | title = GnRH agonists, antagonists, and assisted conception | journal = Seminars in Reproductive Medicine | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 349–64 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12536358 | doi = 10.1055/s-2002-36713 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/447779_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Final maturation induction]] after having performed controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Usage of GnRH agonist for this purpose necessitates using a [[GnRH antagonist]] instead of a GnRH agonist for [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation#Ovulation suppression|suppression of spontaneous ovulation]], because using GnRH agonist for that purpose as well inactivates the axis for which it is intended to work for final maturation induction.
* Treatment of [[cancer]]s that are hormonally sensitive and where a hypogonadal state decreases the chances of a recurrence. Thus they are commonly employed in the medical management of [[prostate cancer]] and have been used in patients with [[breast cancer]].
* Treatment of delaying puberty in individuals with [[precocious puberty]].
* Delaying puberty pending treatment decisions in children with [[gender dysphoria]].
* Management of female disorders that are dependent on [[estrogen]] productions. Women with [[menorrhagia]], [[endometriosis]], [[adenomyosis]], or [[uterine fibroid]]s may receive GnRH agonists to suppress ovarian activity and induce a hypoestrogenic state.
* Suppressing sex hormone levels in [[transgender people]], especially [[transgender women]].
* Severe cases of [[hyperandrogenism]], such as in [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].
* As part of the pharmacologic treatment of [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] disorders in sexual offenders or men with a high risk of sexual offending.&lt;ref name="pmid29289377"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner D, Briken P | title = Treatment of Paraphilic Disorders in Sexual Offenders or Men With a Risk of Sexual Offending With Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Agonists: An Updated Systematic Review | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–93 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29289377 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsxm.2017.11.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of reproductive age who undergo cytotoxic [[chemotherapy]] have been pretreated with GnRH agonists to reduce the risk of oocyte loss during such therapy and preserve ovarian function. Further studies are necessary to prove that this approach is useful.

===Available forms===
GnRH agonists that have been marketed and are available for medical use include [[buserelin]], [[gonadorelin]], [[goserelin]], [[histrelin]], [[leuprorelin]], [[nafarelin]], and [[triptorelin]]. GnRH agonists that are used mostly or exclusively in [[veterinary medicine]] include [[deslorelin]] and [[fertirelin]]. GnRH agonists can be administered by [[injection (medicine)|injection]], by [[subcutaneous implant|implant]], or [[intranasally]] as a [[nasal spray]]. Injectables have been formulated for daily, monthly, and quarterly use, and implants are available that can last from one month to a year. With the exception of gonadorelin, which is used as a [[progonadotropin]], all approved GnRH agonists are used as [[antigonadotropin]]s.

The clinically used desensitizing GnRH agonists are available in the following [[pharmaceutical formulation]]s:&lt;ref name="LehneRosenthal2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard A.

{{GnRH agonists marketed for clinical or veterinary use}}

==Contraindications==
GnRH agonists are [[pregnancy category]] X drugs.

==Side effects==
Side effects of the GnRH agonists are signs and symptoms of [[hypoestrogenism]], including [[hot flash]]es, headaches, and osteoporosis. In patients under long-term therapy, small amounts of estrogens could be given back (“add-back regimen”) to combat such side effects and to prevent bone wastage. Generally, long-term patients, both male and female, tend to undergo annual [[Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry|DEXA]] scans to appraise bone density.

There is also a report that GnRH agonists used in the treatment of advanced [[prostate cancer]] may increase the risk of heart problems by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=63455946&amp;source=genwire | title = Researchers Suggest Hormone Therapy for Prostate Cancer Can Cause Serious Heart Problems and Death | website = Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News | date = 22 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
GnRH agonists acts as [[agonist]]s of the [[GnRH receptor]], the [[biological target]] of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH). These drugs can be both [[peptide]]s and [[small-molecule]]s. They are modeled after the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] [[neurohormone]] GnRH, which interacts with the GnRH receptor to elicit its biologic response, the release of the [[pituitary]] [[hormone]]s [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH). However, after the initial "flare" response, continued stimulation with GnRH agonists desensitizes the pituitary gland (by causing GnRH receptor downregulation) to GnRH. Pituitary desensitization reduces the secretion of LH and FSH and thus induces a state of hypogonadotropic hypogonadal anovulation, sometimes referred to as “pseudomenopause” or “medical oophorectomy.”&lt;ref name="pmid22028996" /&gt; GnRH agonists are able to completely shutdown gonadal testosterone production and thereby suppress circulating testosterone levels by 95% or into the castrate/female range in men.&lt;ref name="pmid19440008" /&gt;

Agonists do not quickly dissociate from the GnRH receptor. As a result, initially there is an increase in FSH and LH secretion (so-called "flare effect"). Levels of LH may increase by up to 10-fold,&lt;ref name="WeinKavoussi2011"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Wein AJ, Kavoussi LR, Novick AC, Partin AW, Peters CA|title=Campbell-Walsh Urology: Expert Consult Premium Edition: Enhanced Online Features and Print, 4-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fu3BBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2939|date=25 August 2011|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4160-6911-9|pages=2939–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16986003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson IM | title = Flare Associated with LHRH-Agonist Therapy | journal = Rev Urol | volume = 3 Suppl 3 | issue = | pages = S10–4 | date = 2001 | pmid = 16986003 | pmc = 1476081 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while levels of testosterone generally increase to 140 to 200% of baseline values.&lt;ref name="pmid28753828"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krakowsky Y, Morgentaler A | title = Risk of Testosterone Flare in the Era of the Saturation Model: One More Historical Myth | journal = Eur Urol Focus | volume = | issue = | pages = | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28753828 | doi = 10.1016/j.euf.2017.06.008 | url = | quote = Initial administration of LHRH agonists reliably causes a transient rise in serum T, with peak T values observed at 2–4 d followed by a reduction to baseline values by 7–8 d, and achievement of castrate levels by 2–4 wk [10]. Most studies demonstrate an increase in peak serum T concentrations by 40–100% above baseline during T flare.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after continuous administration, a profound hypogonadal effect (i.e. decrease in FSH and LH) is achieved through receptor [[downregulation]] by internalization of receptors.&lt;ref name="WeinKavoussi2011" /&gt; Generally this induced and reversible [[hypogonadism]] is the therapeutic goal. During the flare, peak levels of testosterone occur after 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;days, baseline testosterone levels are returned to by 7 to 8&amp;nbsp;days, and castrate levels of testosterone are achieved by 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref name="pmid28753828" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WeinKavoussi2011" /&gt; Following cessation of exogenous GnRH agonist it takes 5 to 8 days before normal gonadotropin secretion is completely restored.&lt;ref name="Cedrin-Durnerin2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cedrin-Durnerin I, Bidart JM, Robert P, Wolf JP, Uzan M, Hugues JN | title = Consequences on gonadotrophin secretion of an early discontinuation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist administration in short-term protocol for in-vitro fertilization | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 1009–14 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10783343 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/15.5.1009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{See also|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor#Agonists}}

GnRH agonists are synthetically modeled after the natural GnRH decapeptide with specific modifications, usually double and single substitutions and typically in position 6 (amino acid substitution), 9 (alkylation) and 10 (deletion). These substitutions inhibit rapid degradation. Agonists with two substitutions include: [[leuprorelin]], [[buserelin]], [[histrelin]], [[goserelin]], and [[deslorelin]]. The agents [[nafarelin]] and [[triptorelin]] are agonists with single substitutions at position 6.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="863">In [[medicine]], '''Goodell sign''' is an indication of [[pregnancy]]. It is a significant softening of the [[vagina]]l portion of the [[cervix]] from increased vascularization. This vascularization is a result of hypertrophy and engorgement of the vessels below the growing uterus. This sign occurs at approximately four weeks' gestation. 

The sign is named after [[William Goodell (gynecologist)|William Goodell]].

'''Haplarithmisis''' (Greek for [[haplotype]] numbering) is a conceptual process in [[Genetics]] that enables simultaneous haplotyping and [[Copy-number variation|copy-number]] profiling of DNA samples derived from cells. Haplarithmisis also reveals parental, segregation, and mechanistic origins of genomic anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;Zamani Esteki et al., Concurrent Whole-Genome Haplotyping and Copy-Number Profiling of Single Cells, The American Journal of Human Genetics (2015), https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.04.011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zamani Esteki M et al., HAPLOTYPING AND COPY NUMBER TYPING USING POLYMORPHIC VARIANT ALLELIC FREQUENCIES (2015), https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2015028576&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting profiles of haplarithmisis are called parental [[haplarithm]]s (i.e. paternal [[haplarithm]] and maternal [[haplarithm]]).

==Clinical Applications==
Haplarithmisis enabled a new form of [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], such that not only segmental and full chromosome anomalies could be detected but also it allowed tracing back of these anomalies to [[meiosis]] and [[mitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Zamani Esteki et al., Concurrent Whole-Genome Haplotyping and Copy-Number Profiling of Single Cells, The American Journal of Human Genetics (2015), https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.04.011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flanderstoday.eu/innovation/ku-leuven-team-develops-test-range-genetic-disorders&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Applications==
In its first application in basic genome research, haplarithmisis led to discovery of parental genome segregation, a phenomenon that causes the segregation of entire parental genomes in distinct blastomere lineages causing cleavage-stage chimerism and mixoploidy. &lt;ref&gt;Destouni A, Zamani Esteki M et al., Zygotes segregate entire parental genomes in distinct blastomere lineages causing cleavage-stage chimerism and mixoploidy (2016), http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.200527.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cow embryos reveal new type of chromosome chimera"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kassabian|first1=Sara|title=Cow embryos reveal new type of chromosome chimera|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-05-cow-embryos-reveal-chromosome-chimera.html|website=[[Phys.org]]|publisher=[[PLoS]]|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Health&amp;Help logo.svg|thumb|right|250px]]
'''Health&amp;Help''' is a non-profit humanitarian aid organization with a clinic in rural [[Guatemala]] and plans to expand to other areas in South and Central America. The project was founded in 2015 by Viktoria Valikova, MD, an infectious disease specialist from [[Ufa]], Russia, who has been working in Central America since 2014, and Karina Basharova, the CEO of the project. Construction for the first clinic began in 2016 and its doors opened in early 2017. Health&amp;Help staff includes volunteer physicians and other medical professionals, as well as locally hired staff in an effort to create jobs and empower local community members.

== Location ==
The first clinic was built in the village of Chuinajtayub (municipio de [[Momostenango]], Totonicapan, Guatemala). Health&amp;Help clinic is the only health center in this area; the nearest ambulatory clinic is in Momostenango, and hospitals of [[Quetzaltenango]] and [[Huehuetenango]] are several hours away and not accessible due to the time, distance and cost of travel. Health&amp;Help clinic provides health services to a population 20,000 of people, including the surrounding villages. Construction began in 2016 and the clinic’s doors opened on February 24, 2017. This site maintains multiple permanent staff positions and is open year-round. Health&amp;Help has plans to expand in the near future to other areas in Central and South America using a similar service model.

== Project history ==
In 2014 Victoria Valikova, MD, the founder of the project, graduated from the [[Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp]], Belgium, majoring in "Tropical Medicine and Health Organization in countries with limited resources". In connection with the specifics of the profession, a large part of her training was devoted to the problems of developing nations, non-governmental organizations and the development of medical infrastructure in those countries. Out of the list of places where doctors and nurses were needed most, Valikova chose Guatemala due to the overwhelming poverty and lack of health services. There are no clinics or ambulances in rural areas and they are far from big cities. Additionally there is no municipal transport to get people to the cities to seek medical treatment. Traditional medicine in Guatemala is generally at the most basic level; typically only healers and a local midwives.

After returning to Russia, Valikova commenced work on the project. In Ufa, Russia, she met Karina Basharova, who became a CEO and the driving force of the project. Together they developed the idea to build a clinic, found volunteers through social networks, and raised money on the [[crowdfunding]] platforms Boomstarter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boomstarter.ru/projects/463373/stroitelstvo_kliniki_na_krayu_zemli|title=First fundraiser|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Generosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.generosity.com/medical-fundraising/let-s-build-a-clinic-for-locals-in-guatemala|title=Second fundraiser|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon they found the architects Mikhail and Elizaveta Shishin, who previously built a school in Nepal, and who developed the Health&amp;Help clinic's layout.

In June 2016 the construction process was started, and over 35 volunteers from all over the world came to help. Local people participated in the construction of the clinic as well. During the construction the doctors were seeing the patients in a small room at the local school, and the patient care was provided consistently despite the lack of space and shortage of resources. The construction was finished on February 24, 2017, and the clinic opened its doors for patients immediately. Today Health&amp;Help is opened 24/7 for emergencies, and 8 hours a day/6 days a week as an ambulatory center for non-emergencies. The staff of the clinic sees from 40 to 70 patients a day, providing preventive care, delivering babies, doing ambulatory surgery, distributing medications and contraception, and educating local people about diabetes, hypertension management, child malnutrition, infectious diseases, and many other topics.

== The principles of the work ==
The medical staff of the clinic and the volunteers, who help the project remotely, work salary free. Physician and non-physician volunteers come from all over the world. The assignments last between a few weeks to eighteen months, and provide volunteers with a breadth of experiences, including direct hands on medical help, medical education, helping with the operations of the clinic, and immersion into local culture. Specialists and non-specialist volunteers who are able to commit to a long stay are invited free of charge, and provided housing, transportation, and three hot meals a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://he-he.org/en|title=Health&amp;Help website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a modest fee for short term visitors and students to put a limit on the number of temporary volunteers. The goal of the project is to create and maintain an ongoing relationship between the staff and the local people, and foster development of jobs occupied by locals.

[[File:Tidens naturlære fig40.png|thumb|Schematic diagram of the human ear]]
'''Hearing''', or '''auditory perception''', is the ability to perceive [[Sound|sounds]] by detecting [[Vibration|vibrations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plack|first1=C. J.|title=The Sense of Hearing|date=2014|publisher=Psychology Press Ltd|isbn=978-1848725157}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes in the pressure of the surrounding medium through time, through an organ such as the [[ear]]. The academic field concerned with hearing is [[auditory science]].

==Background==

Sound may be heard through [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]]eous matter.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Auditory Neuroscience
 |author1=Jan Schnupp |author2=Israel Nelken |author3=Andrew King | publisher = MIT Press

 | url = https://mustelid.physiol.ox.ac.uk/drupal
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the traditional five [[sense]]s; partial or total inability to hear is called [[hearing loss]].

In humans and other vertebrates, hearing is performed primarily by the [[auditory system]]: [[mechanical wave]]s, known as vibrations are detected by the [[ear]] and [[transduction (physiology)|transduced]] into nerve impulses that are perceived by the [[brain]] (primarily in the [[temporal lobe]]). Like [[touch]], audition requires sensitivity to the movement of molecules in the world outside the organism. Both hearing and touch are types of [[mechanosensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kung C. | title = A possible unifying principle for mechanosensation | journal = Nature | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v436/n7051/full/nature03896.html | volume = 436 | issue = 7051 | pages = 647–654 | date = 2005-08-04 | doi = 10.1038/nature03896 | pmid = 16079835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peng 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Peng | first1 = AW. | last2 = Salles | first2 = FT. | last3 = Pan | first3 = B. | last4 = Ricci | first4 = AJ. | title = Integrating the biophysical and molecular mechanisms of auditory hair cell mechanotransduction. | journal = Nat Commun | volume = 2 | issue =  | pages = 523 | month =  | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1533 | PMID = 22045002 | pmc=3418221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hearing mechanism==
[[File:Gray919.png|right|thumb|The middle ear uses three tiny bones, the malleus, the incus, and the stapes, to convey vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.]]
There are three main components of the human ear: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear.

===Outer ear===
{{main|Outer ear}}
The outer ear includes the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]], the visible part of the ear, as well as the [[ear canal]] which terminates at the [[eardrum]], also called the tympanic membrane. The pinna serves to focus sound waves through the ear canal toward the eardrum. Because of the asymmetrical character of the outer ear of most mammals, sound is [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]] differently on its way into the ear depending on what vertical location it is coming from. This gives these animals the ability to localize sound [[Vertical sound localization|vertically]]. The eardrum is an airtight membrane, and when sound waves arrive there, they cause it to vibrate following the [[waveform]] of the sound.

===Middle ear===
{{main|Middle ear}}
The middle ear consists of a small air-filled chamber that is located medial to the eardrum. Within this chamber are the three smallest bones in the body, known collectively as the [[ossicles]] which include the malleus, incus, and stapes (also known as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, respectively). They aid in the transmission of the vibrations from the eardrum into the inner ear, the [[cochlea]]. The purpose of the middle ear ossicles is to overcome the [[Acoustic impedance|impedance]] mismatch between air waves and cochlear waves, by providing [[impedance matching]].

Also located in the middle ear are the [[stapedius muscle]] and [[tensor tympani muscle]], which protect the hearing mechanism through a stiffening reflex. The stapes transmits sound waves to the inner ear through the [[oval window]], a flexible membrane separating the air-filled middle ear from the fluid-filled inner ear. The [[round window]], another flexible membrane, allows for the smooth displacement of the inner ear fluid caused by the entering sound waves.

===Inner ear===
[[File:Gray920.png|right|thumb|The inner ear is a small but very complex organ.]]
{{main|Inner ear}}
The inner ear consists of the [[cochlea]], which is a spiral-shaped, fluid-filled tube. It is divided lengthwise by the [[organ of Corti]], which is the main organ of [[Neuronal encoding of sound|mechanical to neural transduction]]. Inside the organ of Corti is the [[basilar membrane]], a structure that vibrates when waves from the middle ear propagate through the cochlear fluid – [[endolymph]]. The basilar membrane is [[Tonotopy|tonotopic]], so that each frequency has a characteristic place of resonance along it. Characteristic frequencies are high at the basal entrance to the cochlea, and low at the apex. Basilar membrane motion causes [[depolarization]] of the [[hair cells]], specialized auditory receptors located within the organ of Corti.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the hair cells do not produce [[action potential]]s themselves, they release neurotransmitter at synapses with the fibers of the [[auditory nerve]], which does produce action potentials. In this way, the patterns of oscillations on the basilar membrane are converted to [[spatiotemporal pattern]]s of firings which transmit information about the sound to the [[brainstem]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Neuronal===
[[File:Lateral lemniscus.PNG|right|thumb|The [[lateral lemnisci]] (red) connects lower brainstem auditory nuclei to the [[inferior colliculus]] in the midbrain.]]
{{main|Neuronal encoding of sound}}
The sound information from the cochlea travels via the [[auditory nerve]] to the [[cochlear nucleus]] in the [[brainstem]]. From there, the signals are projected to the [[inferior colliculus]] in the [[midbrain]] [[tectum]]. The [[inferior colliculus]] integrates auditory input with limited input from other parts of the brain and is involved in subconscious reflexes such as the auditory [[startle response]].

The inferior colliculus in turn projects to the [[medial geniculate nucleus]], a part of the [[thalamus]] where sound information is relayed to the [[primary auditory cortex]] in the [[temporal lobe]]. Sound is believed to first become consciously experienced at the [[primary auditory cortex]]. Around the [[primary auditory cortex]] lies [[Wernickes area]], a cortical area involved in interpreting sounds that is necessary to understand spoken words.

Disturbances (such as [[stroke]] or [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]]) at any of these levels can cause hearing problems, especially if the disturbance is [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]]. In some instances it can also lead to [[auditory hallucinations]] or more complex difficulties in perceiving sound.

== Hearing tests ==
{{Main|Hearing test|Audiometry}}
Hearing can be measured by behavioral tests using an [[audiometer]]. Electrophysiological tests of hearing can provide accurate measurements of hearing thresholds even in unconscious subjects. Such tests include [[auditory brainstem response|auditory brainstem evoked potentials]] (ABR), [[otoacoustic emissions]] (OAE) and [[electrocochleography]] (ECochG). Technical advances in these tests have allowed hearing screening for infants to become widespread.

== Defense mechanism ==
The hearing structures of many species have defense mechanisms against injury. For example, the muscles of the middle ear (e.g. the [[stapedius muscle]]) in many mammals contract reflexively in reaction to loud sounds which may otherwise injure the hearing ability of the organism.

== Hearing loss ==
{{main|Hearing loss}}
There are several different types of hearing loss: [[Conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]] and mixed types.
*Conductive hearing loss
*Sensorineural hearing loss
*Mixed hearing loss

There are defined degrees of hearing loss:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hear-it.org/Defining-hearing-loss |title=Definition of hearing loss - hearing loss classification  |format= |work=hear-it.org |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martini A, Mazzoli M, Kimberling W |title=An introduction to the genetics of normal and defective hearing |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=830 |issue= |pages=361–74 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9616696 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb51908.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Mild hearing loss''' - People with mild hearing loss have difficulties keeping up with conversations, especially in noisy surroundings. The most quiet sounds that people with mild hearing loss can hear with their better ear are between 25 and 40&amp;nbsp;dB HL.
* '''Moderate hearing loss''' - People with moderate hearing loss have difficulty keeping up with conversations when they are not using a hearing aid. On average, the most quiet sounds heard by people with moderate hearing loss with their better ear are between 40 and  70&amp;nbsp;dB HL.
* '''Severe hearing loss''' - People with severe hearing loss depend on powerful hearing aid. However, they often rely on lip-reading even when they are using hearing aids. The most quiet sounds heard by people with severe hearing loss with their better ear are between 70 and 95&amp;nbsp;dB HL.
* '''Profound hearing loss''' - People with profound hearing loss are very hard of hearing and they mostly rely on lip-reading and sign language. The most quiet sounds heard by people with profound hearing loss with their better ear are from 95&amp;nbsp;dB HL or more.

=== Causes ===
*Heredity
*Congenital conditions
*Presbycusis
*Acquired
**Noise-induced hearing loss
**Ototoxic drugs and chemicals
**Infection

=== Prevention ===
Hearing protection is the use of devices designed to prevent [[Hearing impairment#Long term exposure to environmental noise|Noise-Induced Hearing Loss]] (NIHL), a type of [[post-lingual hearing impairment]]. The various means used to prevent hearing loss generally focus on reducing the levels of noise to which people are exposed. One way this is done is through environmental modifications such as [[acoustic quieting]], which may be achieved with as basic a measure as lining a room with [[curtain]]s, or as complex a measure as employing an [[anechoic chamber]], which absorbs nearly all sound. Another means is the use of devices such as [[earplug]]s, which are inserted into the ear canal to block noise, or [[earmuffs]], objects designed to cover a person's ears entirely.

=== Management ===

*[[Hearing aid]]s are electronic devices that enable a person with hearing loss to receive sounds at certain amplitudes. This technological development has led to the benefit of improving the sense of hearing of a person, but the usage of these devices is significantly low. Psychologically, the first time that a person realizes that he/she needs help from a professional such as an [[audiologist]] is when they feel that their hearing is severely poor. Initially, people don't like to believe that they are becoming deaf; hence it negatively affects their approach towards the use of hearing aids. Familiarity with the devices and consultation with professionals do help people feel good about using the hearing aids.&lt;ref name="Vestergaard KnudsenOberg 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vestergaard Knudsen|first1=L.| last2=Oberg|first2=M.| last3=Nielsen| first3=C.| last4=Naylor|first4=G.|last5=Kramer|first5=S.

== Hearing underwater ==
Hearing threshold and the ability to localize sound sources are reduced underwater in humans but not in aquatic animals, including whales, seals, and fishes which have ears adapted to process water borne sound.&lt;ref name="DOSITS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dosits.org/|title=Discovery of Sound in the Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=W.L|title=Hearing by Whales and Dolphins|date=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-94906-2|pages=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Michael|title=Sense of Hearing in Fishes|journal=Nature|year=1941|volume=147|pages=779|doi=10.1038/147779b0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v147/n3738/abs/147779b0.html|issue=3738}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some research suggests underwater hearing in humans may occur through [[bone conduction]] but with poor localization.  This is related to differences of the speed of sound in water vs air and the blocking of normal air conducted sound paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shupak A. Sharoni Z. Yanir Y. Keynan Y. Alfie Y. Halpern P. | title = Underwater Hearing and Sound Localization with and without an Air Interface | url = http://otology-neurotology.com/pt/re/otoneuroto/abstract.00129492-200501000-00023.htm;jsessionid=Hn3GlTRJcB530CTrCxLlgrJLhv6WyCvpgcBmC0FLJCLWgY5yckpm!1138671057!181195629!8091!-1?index=1&amp;database=ppvovft&amp;results=1&amp;count=10&amp;searchid=1&amp;nav=search | journal = Otology &amp; Neurotology | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 127–130 |date=January 2005 | doi = 10.1097/00129492-200501000-00023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In vertebrates ==
[[File:Cat III.JPG|thumb|A cat can hear high-frequency sounds up to two octaves higher than a human.]]
Not all sounds are normally audible to all animals. Each species has a range of normal hearing for both amplitude and [[frequency]]. Many animals use sound to communicate with each other, and hearing in these species is particularly important for survival and reproduction. In species that use sound as a primary means of communication, hearing is typically most acute for the range of pitches produced in calls and speech.

===Frequency range===

Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called [[Audio frequency|audio]] or sonic.  The range is typically considered to be between 20&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml | title = Frequency Range of Human Hearing | work = The Physics Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]], while frequencies below audio are referred to as [[infrasound|infrasonic]]. Some [[microbat|bats]] use ultrasound for [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] while in flight. [[Dog]]s are able to hear ultrasound, which is the principle of 'silent' [[dog whistle]]s. [[Snake]]s sense infrasound through their jaws, and baleen [[whale]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[elephant]]s use it for communication. Some [[fish]] have the ability to hear more sensitively due to a well-developed, bony connection between the ear and their swim bladder. The "aid to the deaf" of fishes appears in some species such as [[carp]] and [[herring]].&lt;ref name="Williams 1941"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=C. B.|title=Sense of Hearing in Fishes| journal=Nature| volume=147|issue=3731|year=1941|pages=543–543|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/147543b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In invertebrates ==
Vertebrates aren't the only group of animals that have hearing. Some insects have hearing organs as well (e.g. the [[long-horned grasshopper]], [[Lubber Grasshopper|lubber grasshopper]] and the [[cicada]]); they use sound as a form of communication.

Something widely spread among insects is body hair, that can be made to swing by sonar waves. Due to the resonance phenomenon certain hairs swing stronger when exposed to a specific sonar-frequency. This specificity depends on the stiffness and the length of the hairs. That is why certain caterpillar species have evolved hair that would resonate with the sound of buzzing wasps, thus warning them of the presence of natural enemies. Moreover, mosquitoes have hair on their antennae that resonate with the flying sound of homogeneous females, enabling the males the ability to detect potential sexual partners.

Some insects possess a tympanal organ. These are "eardrums", that cover air filled chambers on the legs. Similar to the hearing process with vertebrates, the eardrums react to sonar waves. Receptors that are placed on the inside translate the oscillation into electric signals and send them to the brain.  Several groups of flying insects that are preyed upon by [[Animal echolocation|echolocating]] [[bat]]s  can perceive the ultrasound emissions this way and reflexively practice [[ultrasound avoidance]].

== Mathematics ==&lt;!--[[Dither]] uses this as a reference--&gt;

The basilar membrane of the inner ear spreads out different frequencies: high frequencies produce a large vibration at the end near the middle ear (the "base"), and low frequencies a large vibration at the distant end (the "apex"). Thus the ear performs a sort of frequency analysis, roughly similar to a [[Fourier transform]].&lt;ref name="Deutsch1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Diana|title=The psychology of music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3jkobk4yMMC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=24 May 2011|year=1999|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=978-0-12-213565-1|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hauser|first=Marc D.|title=The evolution of communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QbunyscCJBoC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=24 May 2011|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-58155-4|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nerve pulses delivered to the brain contain both rate-versus-place and fine temporal structure information, so the similarity is not strong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">A '''hospital network''' is a [[hospital system|network]] or group of [[hospital]]s that work together to coordinate and deliver a broad spectrum of services to their community.  A '''hospital system''' or '''[[health care system]]''' is 2 or more hospitals owned, sponsored, or contract managed by a central organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aha.org/aha/resource-center/Statistics-and-Studies/fast-facts.html Fast Facts on US Hospitals]. [[American Hospital Association]]. Accessed September 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Catholic Church established a hospital system in Medieval Europe that vastly improves from the merely reciprocal hospitality of the Greeks and family-based obligations of the Romans. These hospitals were established to cater to "particular social groups marginalized by poverty, sickness, and age," according to historian of hospitals, Guenter Risse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mending Bodies, Saving Souls: A History of Hospitals |last=Risse |first=Guenter B |date=April 1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=59 |isbn=0-19-505523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and controversies==
To avoid financial losses due to shrinking reimbursements and rising costs as well as improving quality of care and avoid duplication of services, hospitals may consolidate certain services at one hospital.  However, patients may need to travel farther if those services are no longer offered at their local hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgov.org/board/district5/news/2001/summit.htm Summit's maternity facility to be folded into Alta Bates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201003/http://www.acgov.org/board/district5/news/2001/summit.htm |date=2007-09-27 }} September 16, 2001 ANG News Online.

Integrated care may be seen as a response to the fragmented delivery of health and social services being an acknowledged problem in many health systems.&lt;ref name="Kodner"&gt;Kodner, DL &amp; Spreeuwenberg, C (2002): Integrated care: meaning, logic, applications, and implications – a discussion paper. [http://www.ijic.org/index.php/ijic/index/ International Journal of Integrated Care], Vol. 2, 14.

Integrated care covers a complex and comprehensive field, and there are many different approaches to and definitions of the concept.&lt;ref name="Kodner"/&gt; WHO gives the following definition: "Integrated care is a concept bringing together inputs, delivery, management and organization of services related to diagnosis, treatment, care, rehabilitation and health promotion. Integration is a means to improve services in relation to access, quality, user satisfaction and efficiency."&lt;ref name="Grone"&gt;Gröne, O &amp; Garcia-Barbero, M (2002): Trends in Integrated Care – Reflections on Conceptual Issues. World Health Organization, Copenhagen, 2002, EUR/02/5037864&lt;/ref&gt;

== Central concepts ==

The integrated care literature distinguishes between different ways and degrees of working together and three central terms in this respect are autonomy, co-ordination, and integration. While autonomy refers to the one end of a continuum with least co-operation, integration (the combination of parts into a working whole by overlapping services) refers to the end with most co-operation and co-ordination (the relation of parts) to a point in between.&lt;ref name="Grone"/&gt;

Distinction is also made between [[horizontal integration]] (linking similar levels of care like multiprofessional teams) and [[vertical integration]] (linking different levels of care like primary, secondary, and tertiary care).&lt;ref name="Grone"/&gt;

Continuity of care is closely related to integrated care and emphasizes the patient's perspective through the system of health and social services, providing valuable lessons for the integration of systems. Continuity of care is often subdivided into three components: continuity of information (by shared records), continuity across the secondary-primary care interface (discharge planning from specialist to generalist care), and provider continuity (seeing the same professional each time, with value added if there is a therapeutic, trusting relationship).&lt;ref name="Grone"/&gt;

Integrated care seems particularly important to service provision to the elderly, as elderly patients often become chronically ill and subject to co-morbidities and so have a special need of continuous care.&lt;ref name="Leichsenring"/&gt;

==Collaborative care==
Collaborative care is a related [[healthcare]] philosophy and movement that has many names, models, and definitions that often includes the provision of mental-health, behavioral-health and substance-use services in primary care. Common [[derivative]]s of the name collaborative care include integrated care, primary care behavioral health, integrated primary care, and shared care. 

The [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) published an overview of many different models as well as [[research]] that supports them.&lt;ref&gt;Butler M, Kane RL, McAlpine D, Kathol, RG, Fu SS, Hagedorn H, Wilt TJ. Integration of Mental Health/Substance Abuse and Primary Care No. 173 (Prepared by the Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center under Contract No. 290-02-0009.) AHRQ Publication No. 09-E003. Rockville, MD. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the key features of collaborative care models:

*Integration of [[mental health professional]]s in [[primary care]] medical settings
*Close collaboration between [[mental health]] and medical/[[nursing]] providers
*Focus on treating the whole person and whole family.

There are various national associations committed to collaborative care such as the [http://www.cfha.net Collaborative Family Healthcare Association].

=== Contrast to merging roles ===
The proper integrating of care does not mean the merging of roles. It remains uneconomical to make a physician serve as a nurse. Besides, the opposite approach is strictly prohibited by accreditation and certification schemes. The mix of staff for the various roles is maintained to enable a profitable integration in caring.

== Examples ==
*The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] is the largest integrated care delivery system in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Grebla]] | title = Quality and equity of care in the Veterans Affairs health-care system and in Medicare Advantage health plans |journal = [[Medical Care (journal)|Medical Care]] | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 560–568 |date=June 2011 | doi = 10.1097/MLR.0b013e31820fb0f6 | pmid = 21422951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Essential for the implementation of the integrated care programme is a framework that guides the process. In Ireland, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is implementing an integrated care programme according to a [https://www.icpop.org/integrated-care-framework 10-Step Framework]. This Framework is created along the recommendation of the [http://www.who.int/servicedeliverysafety/areas/people-centred-care/framework/en/ WHO].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Health Service Executive paid consulting firm €2.2m in 2016 |last=Edwards |first=Elaine |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2017 |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/health-service-executive-paid-consulting-firm-2-2m-in-2016-1.2937723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Katowice - Graffiti Jerzy Kukuczka.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Kukuczka on graffiti in Katowice]]
'''Jerzy Kukuczka''' (24 March 1948 in [[Katowice]], Poland&amp;nbsp;– 24 October 1989 [[Lhotse]], [[Nepal]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] alpine and high-altitude climber. Born in Katowice, his family origin is [[Gorals|Goral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerzykukuczka.pl/download/sample/66|title=Challenge the Vertical|last=Kukuczka|first=Jerry|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 1987, he became the second man (after [[Reinhold Messner]]), to climb all fourteen [[eight-thousander]]s in the world, it took him less than 8 years. He is the only person in the world who has climbed two eight-thousanders in one [[winter]]. Altogether, he ascended four eight-thousanders in winter, including three as first ascents. Along with [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (mountaineer)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]], Kukuczka established a new route on [[K2]] in [[alpine style]] (the so-called "Polish Line"), which no one has repeated.

==Eight-thousanders==
Kukuczka is widely considered among the climbing community to be one of the best high-altitude climbers in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doubrawa-Cochlin|first=Ingeborga|title=A Tribute to Jerzy Kukuczka (1948- 1989)|journal=The Alpine Journal|pages=32–34|issn=0065-6569}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ascended all fourteen [[eight-thousander]]s in just seven years, 11 months and 14 days - He held the world record for shortest time span to summit the eight-thousanders for nearly 27 years until May 2014 when [[Kim Chang-Ho (climber)|Kim Chang-ho]] beat his mark by one month and eight days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thebmc.co.uk/korean-everest-sea-to-summit-marred-by-tragedy Korean Everest Sea to Summit marred by tragedy]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many prominent high-altitude climbers of his time, the routes Kukuczka chose on the Himalayan giants were usually original, many of them first ascents and often done in the grip of winter wind and cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruggera, M.D.|first=Gary||date=1993|title=Book Reviews: My Vertical World. Jerzy Kukuczka|journal=American Alpine Journal||volume=50|pages=300–301|}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, Kukuczka established ten new routes (still unbeaten record) and climbed four summits in winter. He was one of an elite group of Polish Himalayan [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] who specialized in winter ascents (called ''Ice Warriors''). 

In an era in Poland where even the most basic foods were scarce, Kukuczka was able successfully to mount and equip numerous ventures to the far-flung reaches of the world. Usually pressed for cash and equipment, he painted factory chimneys to earn precious złotys to finance his mountaineering dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruggera, M.D.|first=Gary||date=1993|title=Book Reviews: My Vertical World.

He climbed all summits, except for Mount Everest, without the use of supplemental oxygen.

==Death==
Kukuczka died attempting to climb the unclimbed South Face of [[Lhotse]] in [[Nepal]] on 24 October 1989. He was leading a pitch at an altitude of about 8,200 meters on a 6&amp;nbsp;mm secondhand rope he had picked up in a market in [[Kathmandu]] (according to [[Ryszard Pawłowski]], Kukuczka's climbing partner on the tragic day, the main single rope used by the team was too jammed to be used and the climbers decided to use transport rope instead). When he lost his footing and fell, the cord was either cut or snapped from the fall, plunging Kukuczka ~2000 meters to his death. Kukuczka's body was never found, but the official version was that he was buried in an icy [[crevasse]] near the place of fall.{{fact|date=March 2018}} Such a step was dictated by the need to find the body to pay compensation to the deceased's family.

'''John Belisario''' (1820-1900) was an Australian dental surgeon who was a pioneer in the use of [[anaesthesia]] in dentistry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/belisario-john-2967|title=Belisario, John (1820–1900)|last=Belisario|first=John C.|date=|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in [[England]] of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry to a slaveholding family, Belisario was a frail child who was sent to his uncle's plantation in the [[West Indies]] to improve his health.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandes, C. ''Island Off the Coast of Asia: Instruments of statecraft in Australian foreign policy'' (Melbourne: Monash University Publishing, 2018), 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to England and served an [[apprenticeship]] at St Thomas's Hospital in [[London]] but, having developed a preference for warmer climes, he decided to move to [[Sydney, Australia]] in 1841.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
In June 1847 Belisario used [[ether]] to anaesthetise a patient; he is believed to be the first person in Australia to do so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An account of Belisario's use of ether was reported in [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] on 16 June 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12897244 |title=The Sydney Morning Herald. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXII, |issue=3144 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 June 1847 |accessdate=1 July 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an advertisement in the same year, Belisario announced that he was able, with the use of "ethereal inhalation, to perform the most difficult operations in dental surgery, with perfect freedom from pain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12894055 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXII, |issue=3153 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=26 June 1847 |accessdate=1 July 2016 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a pioneer in the use of anaesthesia in dentistry brought him substantial fame. In 1854 he was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[Baltimore College of Dental Surgery]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He was a corresponding member of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia]], the Odontological Society of London, and the American Academy of Dental Surgery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Belisario met Mary Longfield of Cork on the voyage to Australia in 1841. They were married on 2 January 1843 at St Peter's Church of England, [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mary died, aged 24, on 31 May 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28646470 |title=DIED, |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXV, |issue=3756 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=1 June 1849 |accessdate=1 July 2016 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then married Isabella Helen, daughter of Dr Ramsay of Dobroyd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12961956 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=XXXV, |issue=5404 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 October 1854 |accessdate=7 July 2016 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belisario died on 17 June 1900.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2705">The '''John G. Rangos School of Health Sciences''' ('''RSHS''') is one of the ten constituent colleges that comprise [[Duquesne University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

==History==
On January 29, 1990, [[John E. Murray, Jr.|Dr. John E. Murray, Jr.]], then President of Duquesne University, announced the creation of a School of Health Sciences in order to "graduate professionals who will provide assistance to people in maintaining their physical well-being. It will make them more self-sufficient physically and provide great hope for their futures. It meets an overwhelming societal need, and it enlarges opportunities for students at Duquesne. In serving the citizens of Western Pennsylvania, and our students, this initiative is precisely in accordance with the purposes of Duquesne University." On March 18, 1991, Mr. John G. Rangos, Sr. made a major gift to Duquesne University in support of the school, and so it was announced that the school would be named after him.&lt;ref name="catalog"&gt;{{cite book | title =Undergraduate Catalog 2007-2008 | publisher =[[Duquesne University]] | location =[[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] | page =227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Rangos School houses such programs as Athletic Training ([[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]]), Health Management Systems (B.S., M.H.M.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[wiktionary:nota bene|N.B.]]: "Minimum Health Management Standard."&lt;/ref&gt;), Occupational Therapy ([[Master of Science|M.S.]]), Physical Therapy ([[D.P.T.]]), Physician Assistant ([[Master of Physician Assistant Studies|M.P.A.]]), Speech-Language Pathology (M.S.), and the [[Ph.D.]] in Rehabilitation Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Rangos School of Health Sciences | publisher =Duquesne University | url =http://www.duq.edu/academics/schools/health-sciences | accessdate =2007-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the school offers a variety of bachelor's degree programs, entry-level master's degree programs, master's degree programs, a doctor of [[physical therapy]] program, joint and second degree opportunities, and inter-school majors and minors.&lt;ref name="catalog"/&gt;

==Administration==
The [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school is Gregory H. Frazer, [[Ph.D]].

In [[psychophysics]], '''Korte's law''', also known more completely as '''Korte's third law of apparent motion''',&lt;ref name="gepshtein"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gepshtein | first1 = S. | last2 = Kubovy | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1167/7.8.9 | title = The lawful perception of apparent motion | journal = Journal of Vision | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 9 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17685816| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an observation relating the phenomenon of apparent motion to the distance and duration between two successively presented stimuli.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = G.

Typically, the relationship between distance and minimal SOA is linear.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;

Arguably, Korte's law is counterintuitive. One might expect that successive stimuli are ''less'' likely to be perceived as a single object as both distance and SOA increase, and therefore, a negative relationship should be observed instead. In fact, such a negative relationship can be observed as well as Korte's law. Which relationship holds depends on speed.&lt;ref name="gepshtein"/&gt;

Different types of cancer can vary wildly in their prognosis. While the stage of cancer at diagnosis is most relevant to the survival of an individual patient, the type of cancer suggests an overall survival rate of the population.

The figures below are an overall reflection of mortality rates throughout the U.S. population. For example, those diagnosed with [[breast cancer|breast]] or [[prostate cancer]] have a much better outcome than those diagnosed with [[lung cancer|lung]] or [[stomach cancer]]. In most statistical records, cancers are grouped by location, although some cancers of the same location can have extremely variable survival rates depending on the type of cancer. For example, stage 1 [[pancreatic adenocarcinoma]] has a 5-year survival rate of 12%, while stage 1 [[pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]]s have a 5-year survival rate of 61%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Between 2007 and 2013, the percentage of cancer patients alive within five years after cancer diagnosis are displayed in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;https://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2014/browse_csr.php?sectionSEL=1&amp;pageSEL=sect_01_table.05.html&lt;/ref&gt; These figures represent all deaths, whether due to the cancer itself, or death from another cause in a person with cancer.

'''Note:''' ''This is not a complete list of cancer mortality rates as published by the [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]].  These figures are at least five years old and do not reflect recent advances in medicine that have improved the detection and treatments of cancer and their outcomes. Again, these are average death rates that should not be assumed to apply to individuals, whose [[prognosis|prognoses]] will vary depending on age, sex, race, general health, swiftness of detection, type of treatment, progression of disease, and complicating factors.''

{{note label|breast_cancer_in_situ|A|A}} While ''breast cancer in situ'' is not a true cancer (lacking the invasive nature of cancer), physicians often present the diagnosis of cancer to patients. In recent years, this has been controversial, as it artificially inflates the rates of breast cancer.

'''MDsave''' is an online platform. Founded in 2011 in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; officially launched in 2013,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the company connects uninsured patients, [[health savings account]] holders, and high deductible health [[Health insurance|insurance]] patients with medical providers who offer pre-negotiated savings on [[medical services]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=172546636|title=MDSave Incorporated: Private Company Information - Businessweek|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
MDsave was founded in 2011 in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by Paul Ketchel, the current CEO,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; to meet growing demand for accessible pricing, communication and upfront costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/29/the-transition-from-sick-care-to-well-care-and-the-rise-of-the-patient-consumer/|title=The Transition From Sick Care To Well Care And The Rise Of The Patient-Consumer|last=Cable|first=Kevin|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Ketchel was formerly [[chief operating officer]] of Diagnostics Network Alliance and a director for American Capitol Group.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The company officially launched in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They had raised more than $14 million from investors and earned $5 million in 2015, with investors including MTS Health Partners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By 2015, it was in place in 24 states.&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;http://fortune.com/2015/09/28/medical-startup-plans/&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, MDSave secured a $5 million investment from [[Cambia Health Solutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/cambia-invests-5m-price-transparency-company-mdsave|title=Cambia invests $5M in price transparency company MDSave|date=2016-08-11|work=MobiHealthNews|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the company was doing around 2,000 transactions per month.&lt;ref name="Tennessean"&gt;https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2016/09/07/mdsave-marketplace-lets-people-shop-for-medical-service-online/89714258/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, MDsave began working with St. Cloud Regional Medical Center.&lt;ref name="Cloud"&gt;https://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/os-stcloud-regional-mdsave-20180629-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model and services ==
MDsave offers medical providers a way to package their services into a single bundled procedure online,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160402/MAGAZINE/304029977|title=MDSave prices care by the bundle for self-pay patients|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers consumers paying out of pocket a way to comparison shop different providers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/09/28/medical-startup-plans/|title=How this U.S. startup plans to save lives, lower medical bills|date=2015-09-28|website=Fortune|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world’s first transactional healthcare marketplace.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/patient-guide-high-deductible-health-care-plans-article-1.2561857|title=A patient's guide to high-deductible health care plans|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patient searches for a treatment or procedure in a location, and MDsave returns a list of providers in that area with price, location and doctor’s ratings. A patient purchases the bundled procedure, which includes all associated fees and services, using [[PayPal]], a credit card or a financing plan online. The patient receives a  voucher to present to the doctor’s office at their first appointment. The providers get paid within six days, versus the average 60–90 days through insurance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

MDsave uses a patented technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ketchel|first=I. I. I.|title=United States Patent: 9123072 - Network-based marketplace service for facilitating purchases of services and products|date=September 1, 2015|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=9123072&amp;OS=9123072&amp;RS=9123072|accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=III|first=Paul John Ketchel|title=Network-based marketplace service for facilitating purchases of services and products|date=Sep 1, 2015|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US9123072|accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; that cross-references [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] billing codes, procedural codes, and diagnosis codes to create an upfront price for the bundled services involved in a single treatment or procedure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== MDsave Plus ===
MDsave Plus is geared toward employers as a supplement to employee health benefits. MDsave negotiates prices with providers and then passes the savings along to employees, who can save up to 60% on their medical costs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Providers ==
MDsave works with hospital groups and ambulatory surgical centers. In 2016 it had a presence in 24 states and 120 markets, and was growing at a rate of 20% month over month.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Providers in 2015 included [[Dignity Health]], [[Catholic Health Initiatives]], [[Community Health Systems]], [[Tenet Healthcare]] and others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Board of directors==
Board members include former Senate Majority Leader Dr. [[Bill Frist]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Menzies Institute for Medical Research''' is an Australian [[medical research]] [[research institute|institute]] of the [[University of Tasmania]] based in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]]. Formerly known as the Menzies Centre for Population Health Research, the institute was established in 1988 and conducts innovative, world-class medical research to improve human health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.menzies.utas.edu.au/index.php?Doo=ContentView&amp;id=2 |title=Menzies Research Institute Tasmania - Home |publisher=Menzies.utas.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110052738/http://www.menzies.utas.edu.au/index.php?Doo=ContentView&amp;id=2 |archivedate=10 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==


In the late 1980s, the Menzies Foundation supported the establishment of an epidemiology research centre at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, to be named the Menzies Centre for Population Health Research. The Foundation provided annual funding to the Institute and was successful in obtaining matching funds from the Tasmanian Government. The Menzies Centre for Population Health Research was formed in 1988 and became the Menzies Research Institute in 2004.

From modest beginnings, the Menzies Research Institute quickly gained a reputation for its ground-breaking work into the link between babies’ sleeping position and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Menzies developed into an established centre for population health research, with a global reputation in epidemiology. Some notable successes included highlighting the importance of vitamin D in the development of bones in children and adults;{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  showing evidence of the link between early life sun exposure and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis;{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  discovering the link between babies' sleeping position and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS);{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} and  discovering platelets found in the blood kill the malaria parasite during the early stages of a malarial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/service_information/services_files/menzies_research_institute |title=Menzies Research Institute Tasmania |work=Department of Health and Human Services |publisher=[[Government of Tasmania]] |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

The '''Neurological Society of India''' (NSI) is the apex body representing neuroscientists of the country. It was founded in 1951 by [[Jacob Chandy]], [[Balasubramaniam Ramamurthi]], [[S. T. Narasimhan]], and [[Baldev Singh (neurologist)|Baldev Singh]], who together have been credited to be pioneers in development of [[epilepsy]] surgery in India.&lt;ref name="surgery"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7brLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134|encyclopedia=Textbook of Epilepsy Surgery|title=Epilepsy surgery in India|publisher=CRS Press|editor-last=Luders|editor-first=Hans O.|last1=Lachhwani|first1=D.K.|last2=Radhakrishnan|first2=K|year=2008|pages=1616|isbn=978-0-203-09170-8}}{{rp|134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The society appointed Jacob Chandy as its first President. The society publishes the bi-monthly journal ''[[Neurology India]]''.

== History and works ==
Neurosurgeon Jacob Chandy and neurologist Baldev Singh were associated with [[Christian Medical College &amp; Hospital]], [[Vellore]] and physician{{mdash}}electrophysiologist S. T. Narasimhan and neurosurgeon Balasubramaniam Ramamurthi were from [[Madras Medical College|Madras Medical College &amp; Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Aarli2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johan A.

There being another journal by the same name, the society decided to rename their journal to ''[[Neurology India]]'' in 1953.&lt;ref name="Aarli2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Since its inception, the society held its annual meetings with the [[Association of Physicians of India]] but starting next year, it established its own annual conference and created its sub-sections of Neurology, Neurosurgery, Neuropathology and Neuroradiology in the Society. On 25 October 1969, the society registered itself with the Charity Commissioner, Public Trusts Registration Office, Greater Bombay Region (No. F-1819 (B)).&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurosocietyindia.com/NewLaunch/History.html|title=Neurological Society of India: History|publisher=Neurological Society of India|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the society formed a sub-committee for standardization of Postgraduate Education.&lt;ref name="Aarli2014"/&gt; In 1977, the society became the first medical professional society in the country to conduct the [[continuing medical education]] by providing "updates on selected topics and encouraging interdisciplinary interaction among trainees in the various branches of the Neurological Sciences".&lt;ref name="Aarli2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thieme.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=853:thieme-named-official-publisher-for-neurological-society-of-india&amp;catid=82:2015&amp;Itemid=91|title=Thieme named official publisher for Neurological Society of India|location=New York/Stuttgart|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers|accessdate=9 January 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, NSI founded a new association, the Satellite Conference of Neuro-nurses of India, as its branch held with the main objective to "set high standards of neuro-nursing in the country". The conferences of the association are conducted annually along with the annual conference of NSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New Textbook for Nurses in India vol1.,5/e|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwSvARy_ducC&amp;pg=PA81|publisher=BI Publications|isbn=978-81-7225-372-1|pages=429}}{{rp|81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the society formed four Working Groups to deal with Medical Education and Training, Research priorities, Manpower requirements and development of Services, Community Programme, and Instrumentation along with two new sub-sections, Neurophysiology and Electroencephalography. In 1979, the Association of Neurological Nurses as another sub-section was formed and named as "Society of Indian Neurosciences Nurses (SINN)". The society formed a sub-section of Neurophysiological Technologists in 1988 and named as "Association of Neurophysiological Technologists of India (ANTI)".&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The society instituted the "Dr. Jacob Chandy Oration" in 1969 and the "Dr. B. Ramamurthi Oration" in 1974, both to be held every two years along with the "Dr. R.G. Ginde Oration" in 1988, the "Dr. Baldev Singh Oration" in 1994, and the "Dr. Tandon Oration" in 1998 which are to be held every three years.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurosocietyindia.com/NewLaunch/History_Orators.html|title=Orators At Annual Conferences: List of Orators at Annual Conferences of the NSI|publisher=Neurological Society of India|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two orations are organized during the annual conference each year and the orators are selected by the incumbent and immediate two past Presidents of the society.&lt;ref name=Constitution/&gt; The society has five subspeciality societies associated with it which includes the Indian Society for Paediatric Neurosurgery, the Indian Society for Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery, the Skull Base Surgery Society, the Neurotraumatology Society of India, and the Cerebrovascular Society of India.&lt;ref name=Affiliations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurosocietyindia.com/NewLaunch/Affiliations.html|title=Neurological Society of India: Affiliations|publisher=Neurological Society of India|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neurological Society of India is affiliated to the [[World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies]], the World Federation of Neurology, the International Society of Neuropathology, the International Federation of Societies for Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology and there are two associations affiliated to the NSI, the Association of Neurological Nurses and the Association of Neurophysiological Technologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurosocietyindia.com/NewLaunch/Societies.html|title=Neurological Society of India: Subspeciality Societies|publisher=Neurological Society of India|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Affiliations/&gt; The society has over 2000 members and has been involved in organising seminars and conferences to initiate interaction among practicing neurologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurologyindia.com/aboutus.asp|title=Neurology India|publisher=Neurology India|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the society launched an awareness campaign called "Heads.. We Win" to encourage wearing of [[helmet]]s, the lack of which causes major head injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/India-is-head-injury-capital-of-the-world/articleshow/27152899.cms |title='India is head-injury capital of the world' |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Douglas Sarvela''' (August 7, 1959 – November 9, 2014) was Professor of [[health education]] and Dean of the College of Applied Sciences and Arts at [[Southern Illinois University]] Carbondale (SIUC). The college is unique in being the only comprehensive, technically oriented college that is part of a major research university. Following the departure of Rita Cheng to become president of [[Northern Arizona University]], Sarvela was named as interim chancellor July 8, 2014, and was confirmed July 24, 2014. Born in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meredithfh.com/webcast/25810&lt;/ref&gt; he died on November 9, 2014 in Carbondale, Illinois while undergoing treatment for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-siu-chancellor-dies-met-20141110-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He is author or coauthor of more than 60 publications in peer-reviewed journals, as well as several textbooks, monographs, and technical reports. With more than 130 conference papers to his credit, his work has been presented nationwide in the United States, as well as in parts of Europe, where he has been a visiting professor at the [[University of Cologne]] ([[Germany]]) and lectured in [[Finland]].

Sarvela earned a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1981, a master's degree in educational psychology in 1983 and a doctorate in health education in 1984, all from the [[University of Michigan]]. He began his professional career as a program evaluator for [[Ford Aerospace]] and Communications Corporation (1984–86), primarily doing classified work for the [[National Security Agency]].

In 1986 he joined the faculty of SIUC’s highly regarded Department of Health Education, where he was widely regarded as the replacement for recently departed [[Robert S. Gold]]. Many saw him as being potentially a “young Bob Gold”. He was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 1989 and to full professor in 1992.

Collaborating with [[Elena Sliepcevich]] and [[David F. Duncan|David Duncan]], his publications from the early 1980s largely focused on the study of risk taking and risk reduction related to alcohol and other drug use in youth. Many of the studies during this early stage of his career were conducted in rural settings, thus providing a catalyst for his later work in the SIU-C Center for Rural Health and Social Service Development. Throughout his career many of his publications have been concerned with instrument development, needs assessment, program evaluation, and the creation of responsive interventions and curricula. His current research blends the rural setting; the multiple health-related problems of that setting; and the challenging issues of measurement and evaluation.

During the 1996-1997 academic year, Dr Sarvela was an [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) Fellow at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. This experience afforded him an opportunity to enhance his skills in educational leadership, strategic planning, and systems operations.  Aspects of this experience became two chapters ("Needs Assessment and Strategic Planning"; "Assessing Program Costs and Effects") in the book Health Education Evaluation and Measurement - A Practitioner's Perspective, 2nd edition, which he coauthored with Dr [[Robert J McDermott]] in 1999. This fellowship also contributed to his movement into administration first as Director of the Center for Rural Health and Social Service Development. He became chairman of the Department of Health Care Professions in 1999. In 2002, he was appointed to his present position as Dean of the College of Applied Sciences and Arts.

{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
A '''personal injury lawyer''' is a [[lawyer]] who provides legal services to those who claim to have been injured, physically or psychologically, as a result of the [[negligence]] of another person, company, government agency or any entity. Personal injury lawyers tend to practice primarily in the area of [[law]] known as [[tort law]]. Examples of common personal injury claims include injuries from [[slip and fall]] accidents, [[traffic collision]]s, defective products, workplace injuries and professional [[malpractice]].

The term "trial lawyers" is sometimes used to refer to personal injury lawyers, even though many other types of lawyers, including defense lawyers and criminal [[prosecutor]]s also appear in trials and even though most personal injury claims are settled without going to trial.

==Qualification==
A personal injury lawyer must [[Admission to practice law|qualify to practice law]] in the [[jurisdiction]] in which the lawyer practices. In many states, they must also pass a written ethics examination.

Lawyers may take [[continuing legal education]] (CLE) classes in order to learn about developments in the law or to learn about new practice areas. In states that require lawyers to attend CLE, personal injury lawyers may take CLE courses relevant to personal injury law, but are not required to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowenthal|first1=Werner|title=Continuing Education for Professionals: Voluntary or Mandatory?|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|date=1981|volume=52|issue=5|pages=519–538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Some [[bar association]]s and attorney organizations offer certifications, including certification of lawyers in the field of personal injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Concise Guide  to  Lawyer Specialty Certification|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/2011_build/specialization/june2007_concise_guide_final.authcheckdam.pdf|website=ABA Standing Committee on Specialization|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=3 December 2017|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certification is not required to practice personal injury law, but may help a lawyer demonstrate knowledge in the field to potential clients. Within the U.S., not all state bars offer certification for personal injury law. Some states, such as New Jersey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board on Attorney Certification|url=http://www.njcourts.gov/attorneys/attcert.html|website=New Jersey Courts|publisher=New Jersey Judiciary|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow lawyers to become Certified Trial Attorneys, a credential that is available to both plaintiff and defense attorneys. Some states, such as Arizona,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certified Specialists|url=http://www.azbar.org/workingwithlawyers/certifiedspecialists/|website=State Bar of Arizona|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; restrict the use of the words "specialist" or "specialize" to lawyers who have obtained a certification from the State Bar Board of Legal Specialization in a specific field of law, with one such certification being in the area of personal injury law.

==Practice==
Lawyers may concentrate their practice to specific areas of law, including personal injury law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Robert L.|title=Partners with Power: The Social Transformation of the Large Law Firm|date=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520058445|pages=174–175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9imOv1GkQIcC|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lawyers may further specialize to a specific area of personal injury, such as [[medical malpractice]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Catastrophic Personal Injury|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/personal_injury2.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=3 December 2017|date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By limiting the range of cases they handle, personal injury lawyers are able to acquire specialized knowledge and experience.

===Client relations===
Before accepting a new case, a personal injury lawyer will normally interview a prospective client and evaluate the client's case to determine the basic facts and potential legal claims that might be made, identify possible defendants, and evaluate the strength of the case.&lt;ref name="goodman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Peggy|title=Initial Interview with a Potential Client|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/lexis-hub/b/how-to-build-your-professional-skills/archive/2008/01/31/initial-interview-with-a-potential-client.aspx?Redirected=true|website=LexisNexis|publisher=Relx Group|accessdate=21 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawyer may decline to accept a case if the lawyer believes that the legal claims will not succeed in court, if the cost of litigation is expected to exceed the amount that can reasonably be recovered from the defendants as compensation for the client's injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coffee|first1=John C.|title=Understanding the Plaintiff's Attorney: The Implications of Economic Theory for Private Enforcement of Law through Class and Derivative Actions|date=May 1986|volume=86|issue=4|pages=669–727|jstor=1122577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation===
Lawyer fees may be charged in a number of ways, including [[contingency fee]]s, hourly rates, and flat fees. In many countries, personal injury lawyers work primarily on a contingency fee basis, sometimes called an ''if-come'' fee, through which the lawyer receives a percentage of a client's recovery as a fee, but does not recover a fee if the claim is not successful.&lt;ref name="goodman"/&gt;

In some jurisdictions, or by virtue of the retainer agreement between an attorney and client, the amount of the legal fee may vary depending upon whether a case settles before a lawsuit is filed, after a lawsuit is filed but before trial, or if the case goes to trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danzon|first1=Patricia M.|title=Contingent Fees for Personal Injury Litigation|journal=The Bell Journal of Economics|date=1983|volume=14|issue=1|pages=213–224|jstor=3003548}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a retainer agreement might provide that a lawyer will receive a 33 and 1/3% contingency fee if a case settles before a lawsuit is filed, and a 40% contingency fee if the case settles after the lawsuit is filed.

Due to the high cost of litigation, personal injury lawyers are rarely retained to work based on an hourly fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danzon|first1=Patricia M.|title=Contingent Fees for Personal Injury Litigation|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2008/R2458.pdf|website=Rand|accessdate=3 December 2017|date=June 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, defense attorneys who are hired to contest personal injury claims are often paid on an hourly basis.

===Ethics===
An attorney should provide diligent representation to clients, and the ultimate professional responsibility of a personal injury lawyer is to help plaintiffs obtain just compensation for their losses. As with all lawyers, the attorney-client relationship is governed by [[Ethical code|rules of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weissman|first1=Herbert N.|last2=Debow|first2=Deborah M.|title=Ethical Principles and Professional Competencies. Handbook of Psychology|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|isbn=047138321X|pages=3:33–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmN_hz83VxQC|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, lawyers are regulated by codes of conduct established by state bar associations, which have the power to take disciplinary action against lawyers who violate professional or ethical regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=David Cameron|title=Attorney Fees: Five Keys to Ethical Compliance|journal=GPSolo|date=2010|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/solo_lawyer_ethics_fee_client_relationship.html|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; States normally require all contingency agreements between lawyers and their clients to be in writing, and may limit the amount that may be charged as a contingency fee to a specific maximum percentage of the recovery.

==Organizations==
Although membership is not required for personal injury practice, many personal injury lawyers join professional associations. For example:

*[[American Bar Association]] – a professional association dedicated to improving the legal system and providing accreditation for law schools and continuing legal education programs
*[[Association of Personal Injury Lawyers]] – an association based in Nottingham, England; founded in 1990 by personal injury lawyers on behalf of accident victims
*[[American Association for Justice]] – An association of trial lawyers that was founded in 1946 by a group of plaintiff’s attorneys committed to safeguarding victims’ rights.  Prior to 2007, this organization was called the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, or ATLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.org/ |title=American Association for Justice |publisher=justice.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of personal injury lawyers claim that litigation increases the cost of products and services, and the cost of doing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hiltzig|first1=Michael|title=New study shows that the savings from 'tort reform' are mythical|url=http://beta.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-another-study-shows-why-tort-reform--20140919-column.html|accessdate=3 December 2017|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, critics of medical malpractice lawyers argue that lawsuits increase the cost of healthcare, and that lawsuits may inspire doctors to leave medical practice or create doctor shortages. These concerns have not been well substantiated. A publication by the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] found little evidence that traditional tort reforms affect medical liability costs or defensive medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Malpractice: April 2011 Update|url=http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2011/04/medical-malpractice-2011-update.html|website=The Synthesis Project|publisher=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|accessdate=2 July 2017|date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted on a bi-partisan basis in Texas has found that tort reform, once enacted had no impact on reducing the cost of medical care, tending to throw doubt on claims made by tort reform advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roser|first1=Mary Ann|title=New study: Tort reform has not reduced health care costs in Texas|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/local/new-study-tort-reform-has-not-reduced-health-care-costs-texas/XJHJL3GWWdJtVa35WvZCCL/|accessdate=2 July 2017|agency=American Statesman|publisher=Statesman Media|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15626">'''Population viability analysis''' ('''PVA''') is a [[species]]-specific method of [[risk assessment]] frequently used in [[conservation biology]].
It is traditionally defined as the process that determines the probability that a population will go extinct within a given number of years.
More recently, PVA has been described as a marriage of [[ecology]] and [[statistics]] that brings together species characteristics and environmental variability to forecast population health and extinction risk.  Each PVA is individually developed for a target population or species, and consequently, each PVA is unique. The larger goal in mind when conducting a PVA is to ensure that the population of a species is self-sustaining over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, E.W. (2006) How many animals do we want to save? The many ways of setting population target levels for conservation. ''BioScience'' 56: 911-922, (p. 913).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Population viability analysis (PVA) is used to estimate the likelihood of a population’s extinction and indicate the urgency of recovery efforts, and identify key life stages or processes that should be the focus of recovery efforts.  PVA is also used to compare proposed management options and assess existing recovery efforts.  PVA is frequently used in [[endangered species]] management to develop a plan of action, rank the pros and cons of different management scenarios, and assess the potential impacts of habitat loss.&lt;ref name="Beissenger and McCullough"&gt;{{cite book|title=Population Viability Analysis|editor1=Beissenger S.R. |editor2=McCullough D.R. |year=2002|isbn=0-226-04178-6|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
In the 1970s, [[Yellowstone National Park]] was the centre of a heated debate over different proposals to manage the park’s problem [[grizzly bears]] (''Ursus arctos'').  In 1978, Mark Shaffer proposed a model for the grizzlies that incorporated random variability, and calculated extinction probabilities and [[minimum viable population]] size.  The first PVA is credited to Shaffer.

PVA gained popularity in the United States as federal agencies and ecologists required methods to evaluate the risk of extinction and possible outcomes of management decisions, particularly in accordance with the [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1973, and the [[National Forest Management Act]] of 1976.

In 1986, Gilpin and Soulé broadened the PVA definition to include the interactive forces that affect the viability of a population, including genetics.
The use of PVA increased dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990s following advances in personal computers and software packages.

==Examples==
A PVA for the endangered [[Fender's blue butterfly]] (''Icaricia icarioides'') was recently performed with a goal of providing additional information to the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], which was developing a recovery plan for the species.  The PVA concluded that the species was more at risk of extinction than previously thought and identified key sites where recovery efforts should be focused.  The PVA also indicated that because the butterfly populations fluctuate widely from year to year, to prevent the populations from going extinct the minimum annual population growth rate must be kept much higher than at levels typically considered acceptable for other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Cheryl B.|author2=Hammond, Paul C.|title=Using Population Viability Analysis to Develop Recovery Criteria for Endangered Insects: Case Study of the Fender's Blue Butterfly|journal=Conservation Biology|date=October 2003|volume=17|issue=5|pages=1372–1385|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.02141.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a recent outbreak of canine distemper virus, a PVA was performed for the critically endangered [[island fox]] (''Urocyon littoralis'') of [[Santa Catalina Island, California]].  The Santa Catalina island fox population is uniquely composed of two subpopulations that are separated by an [[isthmus]], with the eastern subpopulation at greater risk of extinction than the western subpopulation.  PVA was conducted with the goals of 1) evaluating the island fox’s extinction risk, 2) estimating the island fox’s sensitivity to catastrophic events, and 3) evaluating recent recovery efforts which include release of captive-bred foxes and transport of wild juvenile foxes from the west to the east side.  Results of the PVA concluded that the island fox is still at significant risk of extinction, and is highly susceptible to catastrophes that occur more than once every 20 years.  Furthermore, extinction risks and future population sizes on both sides of the island were significantly dependent on the number of foxes released and transported each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlmann|first=Stephan G.|author2=Schmidt, Gregory A. |author3=Garcelon, David K. |title=A population viability analysis for the Island Fox on Santa Catalina Island, California|journal=Ecological Modelling|date=April 2005|volume=183|issue=1|pages=77–94|doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.07.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PVAs in combination with [[sensitivity analysis]] can also be used to identify which vital rates has the relative greatest effect on population growth and other measures of population viability. For example, a study by Manlik ''et al.'' (2016) forecast the viability of two [[bottlenose dolphin]] populations in Western Australia and identified reproduction as having the greatest influence on the forecast of these populations. One of the two populations was forecast to be stable, whereas the other population was forecast to decline, if it isolated from other populations and low reproductive rates persist. The difference in viability between the two studies was primarily due to differences in reproduction and not survival. The study also showed that temporal variation in reproduction had a greater effect on population growth than temporal variation in survival.&lt;ref name="Manlik et al. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Manlik O. |author2=McDonald J.A. |author3=Mann J. |author4=Raudino H.C. |author5=Bejder L. |author6=Kruetzen M. |author7=Connor R.C. |author8=Heithaus M.R. |author9=Lacy R.C. |author10=Sherwin W.B. | title=The relative importance of reproduction and survival for the conservation of two dolphin populations| journal=Ecology and Evolution | year=2016 | URL=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2130/full| doi=10.1002/ece3.2130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Debates exist and remain unresolved over the appropriate uses of PVA in conservation biology and PVA’s ability to accurately assess extinction risks.

A large quantity of field data is desirable for PVA; some conservatively estimate that for a precise extinction probability assessment extending ''T'' years into the future, five-to-ten times ''T'' years of data are needed.  Datasets of such magnitude are typically unavailable for rare species; it has been estimated that suitable data for PVA is available for only 2% of threatened bird species.  PVA for threatened and endangered species is particularly a problem as the predictive power of PVA plummets dramatically with minimal datasets.  Ellner et al. (2002) argued that PVA has little value in such circumstances and is best replaced by other methods.  Others argue that PVA remains the best tool available for estimations of extinction risk, especially with the use of sensitivity model runs.

Even with an adequate dataset, it is possible that a PVA can still have large errors in extinction rate predictions.  It is impossible to incorporate all future possibilities into a PVA: habitats may change, catastrophes may occur, new diseases may be introduced.  PVA utility can be enhanced by multiple model runs with varying sets of assumptions including the forecast future date.  Some prefer to use PVA always in a relative analysis of benefits of alternative management schemes, such as comparing proposed resource management plans.

Accuracy of PVAs has been tested in a few retrospective studies. For example, a study comparing PVA model forecasts with the actual fate of 21 well-studied taxa, showed that growth rate projections are accurate, if input variables are based on sound data, but highlighted the importance of understanding density-dependence (Brook ''et al.'' 2000).&lt;ref name="Brook et al. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brook B.W. |author2=O'Grady J.J. |author3=Chapman A.P. |author4=Burgman H.R. |author5=Akçakaya H.R. |author6=Frankham R. | title=Predictive accuracy of population viability analysis in conservation biology| journal=Nature | year=2000 |volume=329| pages=512–519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, McCarthey ''et al.'' (2003)&lt;ref name="McCarthy et al. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCarthy M.A. |author2=Andelman S.J. |author3=Possingham H.P. | title=Reliability of relative predictions in population viability analysis| journal=Conservation Biology | year=2003 | volume=17|pages=982–989 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.01570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that PVA predictions are relatively accurate, when they are based on long-term data. Still, the usefulness of PVA lies more in its capacity to identify and assess potential threats, than in making long-term, categorical predictions (Akçakaya &amp; Sjögren-Gulve 2000).&lt;ref name="Akçakaya &amp; Sjögren-Gulve 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Akçakaya H.R. |author2=Sjörgren-Gulve P. | title=Population viability analysis in conservation planning: an overview| journal=Ecological Bulletins | year=2000 |volume=48|pages=9–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
Improvements to PVA likely to occur in the near future include: 1) creating a fixed definition of PVA and scientific standards of quality by which all PVA are judged and 2) incorporating recent genetic advances into PVA.

'''Poulaphouca''', officially '''Pollaphuca''' ({{irish place name|Poll an Phúca|the [[Púca]]'s hole}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logainm.ie/113024.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,700174,709645,3 Ordnance Survey Ireland - Online map viewer]&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of a waterfall and bridge on the River Liffey between [[County Wicklow]] and [[County Kildare]]. It is primarily known for its [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] generating station and artificial lake, known as [[Poulaphouca Reservoir]], Poulaphouca Lake, or [[Blessington]] Lake. The once famous Poulaphouca Waterfall has little water running over it any longer because of the hydroelectric project.

== Poulaphouca Waterfall and Bridge ==
&lt;nowiki&gt;A waterfall immediately west of the bridge, renowned as a beauty spot from at least the 18th century, was lost with the construction of the Poulaphouca Reservoir. The waterfall, marked as '&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;Poolapooka - a remarkable cataract'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' on Noble &amp; Keenan's map of 1752,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logainm.ie/en/res/67 Noble J. &amp; Keenan J. 1752. ''Map of county Kildare.'' D.Pomarede, Dublin.]&lt;/ref&gt; is depicted and described in the ''Post-Chaise Companion'' of 1786, when Ballymore parish was still within Dublin: {{cquote|''Poll-A-Phuca or the Daemon's Hole, being a grand waterfall formed from the head of the Liffey, that rises from the Wicklow Mountains, and here divides the counties of Wicklow and Dublin.

Both Pollaphuca and a second bridge crossing a dry gorge 150m to the southwest, were designed by [[Alexander Nimmo]] in Gothic style and built between 1822 and 1827 for a total cost of £4,704.

Here the whole body of water composing the stream of the Liffey, rushes down with the utmost impetuosity into a circular basin of stone, worn perfectly smooth, the form of which imparts to the water a rotatory motion...across this chasm a bridge has been thrown, to continue the new line of road to New Ross, the span of the arch is 65 feet, the altitude of the chord above the upper fall is 47, and the height of the keystone of the arch above the river's bed 150 feet; from the battlements there is a direct perpendicular view into the whirlpool just now described, and which gives name to the waterfall. This beautiful object and bold conception, the bridge of Pol-a-Phuca, is built from the design of Alexander Nimmo, Esq.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/guidetocountyofw00wrig#page/162/mode/2up Wright, G. N. 1827. ''A Guide to the County of Wicklow''. Dublin. pp. 162-164.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

1,134 men had responded by 2010. 499 had a completed diagnosis, and 255 had been offered a place in therapy. More than half had previously attempted to find therapy without success. The therapy offered has three main components. Patients are encouraged to accept their sexual inclinations, integrate it into their [[self-concept]], and involve relatives or partners in the therapeutic process. [[Cognitive behaviour therapy]] is used to improve coping skills, stress management, and sexual attitudes.

'''The Medical institution "Children's Hospice"''' (Russian: ''Медицинское учреждение «Детский хоспис»'') - is a [[non-profit]] institution of [[pediatric]] [[palliative care]] for [[minor (law)|minor]]s under 18 years. The first children's [[hospice]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rcmm.ru/news/2167.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190631/http://rcmm.ru/news/2167.html |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itar-tass.com/c344/728602.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fontanka.ru/2013/03/25/133/&lt;/ref&gt;

The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice has two facilities: one in the city park “Kurakina Dacha” near the St. Petersburg River Station and another one in the village of Ol'gino. The Children's Hospice provides physical, psychological, emotional, social and spiritual care. The basic idea of the hospice care is to enable children with severe and [[incurable disease]]s and all members of the child's family to live a full life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pharmika.flexum.ru/blog.html?comments=3711 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dd7Kh9C9?url=http://pharmika.flexum.ru/blog.html?comments=3711 |archivedate=2013-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Childhospisstazkruglpreb.jpg|thumb|One of the wards of the round-the-clock care station]]
The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice started its work in 2003&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fontanka.ru/2009/12/18/154/&lt;/ref&gt; under the guidance of Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko. In 2010, the Children's Hospice became the first governmental institution providing pediatric palliative care in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itar-tass.com/c344/728602.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first inpatient facility was opened in the “Kurakina Dacha” building – the former “Nikolayevsky” orphanage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rcmm.ru/news/2167.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190631/http://rcmm.ru/news/2167.html |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second facility for children of the [[Leningrad Oblast]] (and other regions of Russia) was opened in the village of Ol'gino situated in the Resort District of St. Petersburg.

In its early years, the Children’s Hospice was a home-based service consisting of [[Physician|doctor]]s, social workers, [[nurse]]s and [[psychologist]]s. The aim was to provide hospice outpatient care to terminally ill children and their families.

The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice has become a model for the establishment of such institutions in the city of [[Moscow]], the [[Moscow Oblast]] and other regions of Russia
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv100.ru/news/peterburgskiy-detskiy-hospis-stal-primerom-dlya-vsey-strany-70762/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081608/http://www.tv100.ru/news/peterburgskiy-detskiy-hospis-stal-primerom-dlya-vsey-strany-70762/ |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of the inpatient facility in St. Petersburg was preceded by 7 years of work by hospice employees. On June 1, 2010, on its seventh birthday, the St. Petersburg Children's Hospice opened the doors of the inpatient facility "Magic House" for seriously ill children.
When visiting the Children's Hospice on November 20, 2010, [[Kirill I of Moscow|Kirill]], the [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'|Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church]], said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Today, on such a personal day for myself, I am happy to visit the hospice, and believe me that perhaps the most beautiful gifts that I have been presented today are faces of doctors, attendants, and parents testifying to their courage and faith, and of course, the children who are going through this suffering for reasons unknown to our human mind”.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On November 21, 2011, Federal Law No 323 "On the Fundamentals of Health Protection in the Russian Federation" was passed, in which Article 36 "Palliative medical care" was added at the initiative of the St. Petersburg Children’s Hospice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pravmir.ru/posle-smerti-zhizn-ne-zakanchivaetsya-direktor-detskogo-xospisa-protoierej-aleksandr-tkachenko-video/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opvspb.ru/library/ofitsialnye_dokumenty/zakon_ob_ohrane_zdorovya_grazhdan_rf/&lt;/ref&gt; The Children's Hospice staff participated in the development of methodical guidelines for professionals and parents.

In 2012-2013, under the auspices of the hospice, several palliative medical care services were opened in Leningrad and Moscow regions. In 2015, it is planned to complete the construction of a second inpatient facility of the St. Petersburg State Autonomous Healthcare Institution (SAHI) “Children’s Hospice”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rcmm.ru/news/2167.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190631/http://rcmm.ru/news/2167.html |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Children's Hospice founder, Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko, received St Andrew the First-Called Foundation Award "For Faith and Loyalty". In March 2013, Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko and the Children’s Hospice executive director Pavel Krupnik were awarded the Certificates of Honor by the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]], the [[upper house]] of the [[Federal Assembly of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fontanka.ru/2013/03/25/133/&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 2014, in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], [[Russian President]] Vladimir Putin awarded Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko the governmental mark of distinction "For Beneficence".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fontanka.ru/2014/08/04/043/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure of the Children's Hospice ==

The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice is structured as follows:

=== Home-Based Service===

The St. Petersburg Children’s Hospice has run the home-based service since its very inception. The physicians, nurses, psychologists and social workers of the service regularly visit families in the care of the hospice and provide them with counseling, medical and psychological assistance. The service oversees about 300 children living in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region.

=== Round-the-clock Care Station===
[[File:Childhospisstazkruglpreb2.jpg|thumb]]
The station is designed for round-the-clock care for 20 patients and, in addition, for 10 patients from the daycare station. The length of stay depends on individual needs of a child and his family. The purpose of the care station is to stabilize and possibly improve the child’s state of health, as well as to provide respite care for the family. The care station provides the children with all necessary medical and psychological rehabilitation opportunities. The interior of the entire inpatient facility is different from public children’s hospitals. There are no wards with white walls. Instead, there are rooms decorated with drawings for children living together with their mothers. All the [[furnishing]]s inside the hospice facility are designed to improve the child's emotional state.

===Intensive Care Unit===
[[File:Childhospisintensetherapy.jpg|thumb]]
The [[Intensive Care]] Unit consists of wards with modern equipment and is designed for round-the-clock observation of children who have reached a terminal state.

=== Daycare Station ===

At the daycare station the children enjoy the same range of services as in the round-the-clock station, but they do not stay overnight.

== Management  ==

The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice Director is Russian Orthodox Church archpriest Alexander Tkachenko. He is also considered the main inspirer of establishing children's palliative care as a separate branch of the Russian healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1379521&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financing==

According to data from 2013, the St. Petersburg city budget allocates to the St. Petersburg State Autonomous Healthcare Institution “Children’s Hospice” about 50 million [[ruble]]s a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2228731&lt;/ref&gt; The non-profit Medical Institution “Children’s Hospice” finances itself solely by [[donation]]s.

{{Distinguish|Sanitation engineering}}
'''Sanitary engineering''', also known as '''public health engineering''', is the application of engineering methods to improve [[sanitation]] of human communities, primarily by providing the removal and disposal of human waste, and in addition to the supply of safe [[potable water]]. Traditionally a branch of civil engineering, in the mid-19th century, the discipline concentrated on the reduction of disease, then thought to be caused by [[Miasma theory|miasma]]. This was accomplished mainly by the collection and segregation of sewerage flow in [[London]] specifically, and Great Britain generally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/ablit/britlit/sanitary.html Sanitary Reform of London], The Working Collection of [[Sir Joseph Bazalgette]], British and Commonwealth Literary Studies, [[Green Library]], [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These and later regulatory improvements were reported in the United States as early as 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/31/news/european-sanitary-reform-the-british-sanitary-legislation.html EUROPEAN SANITARY REFORM.; The British Sanitary Legislation], [[The New York Times]], July 31, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not concerned with environmental factors that do not have an immediate and clearly understood effect on public health.  Areas outside the purview of sanitary engineering include [[traffic]] management, concerns about [[noise pollution]] or [[light pollution]], aesthetic concerns such as [[landscaping]], and [[environmental conservation]] as it pertains to [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.

Skills within this field are usually employed for the primary goal of [[disease]] prevention within [[human beings]] by assuring a supply of healthy [[drinking water]], treatment of waste water, removing [[Waste|garbage]] from inhabited areas, and so on.

Compared to (for example) [[electrical engineering]] or [[mechanical engineering]] which are concerned primarily with [[closed system]]s, sanitary engineering is a very [[interdisciplinary]] field which may involve such elements as [[hydraulics]], constructive modelling, [[information technology]], project design, [[microbiology]], [[pathology]] and the many divisions within [[environmental science]] and [[environmental technology]].  In some cases, considerations that fall within the field of [[social sciences]] and urban planning must be factored in as well.

Although sanitary engineering may be most associated with the design of [[sanitary sewer|sewers]], [[sewage treatment]] and [[waste water treatment]] facilities, [[recycling]] centers, [[landfill|public landfills]] and other things which are constructed, the term applies equally to (for example) a plan of action to reverse the effects of [[water pollution]] or [[soil contamination]] in a specific area.

==History==
{{Further information|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Irrigation systems were invented five to seven thousand years ago as a means of supplying water to agriculture-based societies. Aqueducts and irrigation systems were among the first forms of wastewater engineering.  As population centers became more dense, they were used to remove sewage from settlements. The Romans were among the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aqueduct.  The Dark Ages marked a period where progress in water management came to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steinbeck|first1=SG|title=An Abridged History of  Onsite Wastewater: Early Years to Present|url=http://ehs.ncpublichealth.com/oet/docs/cit/oswpmod/HistoryOfOSWW.pdf|website=REHS Onsite Water Protection Branch|publisher=Environmental Health Section, Division of Public Health, NC Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As populations grew, the management of human waste became a growing concern and a public health threat.  By the 1850s in London more than 400,000 tons of sewage were flushed into the Thames River each day - around 150 million tons a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London's Victorian sewer system|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/10092.htm|website=Thames Water|publisher=Tames Water|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, typhus, cholera and typhoid  were spread via the contaminated water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardy|first1=Anne|title=Water and the Search for Public Health in London in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|journal=Medical History|date=1984|volume=28|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139446/pdf/medhist00078-0028.pdf|pmc=1139446|pmid=6390024|pages=250–82|doi=10.1017/s0025727300035936}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century major cities started building sewage systems to remove human waste out of cities and into rivers.

During the 1900s the activated sludge process was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matsuo|first1=Tomonori|title=Civil Engineering Vol. I|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c05/E6-37-01-03.pdf|website=Wastewater Management Engineering|publisher=Encyclodedia of Life Support Systems|accessdate=April 3, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The activated sludge process is a form of water purification that uses bacteria to consume human feces.  Chlorine is used to kill off the bacteria.

Over the centuries much has changed in the field of wastewater engineering. Advancements in microbiology, chemistry, and engineering have drastically changed the field. Today wastewater engineers work on the collection of clean water for drinking, chemically treating it, and using UV light to kill off micro-organisms. They also treat [[Water Pollution]] in wastewater (blackwater and greywater) so that this water may be made safe for use without endangering the population and environment around it.

==Municipalities==
Generally, sanitary engineers work for municipalities and are highly trained professionals with a diverse range of engineering skills.  Some are involved with a specific area of concern such as [[waste collection]] or the maintenance of [[waste water]] facilities and  [[storm water]] [[drainage]] systems within a district.

Others cover a broader scope of activities that might include the two just listed as well as such maintenance of the public [[water supply]], collection of residential yard waste program, disposal of  [[hazardous waste]], recycling strategies and even community programs where individuals or businesses "adopt" an area and either maintain it themselves or donate funds for doing so.

==Wastewater==
'''Wastewater engineering''' is not usually its own degree course but a specialization from degrees such as [[civil engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], Bio-chemical engineering or [[chemical engineering]]. Wastewater engineering deals with the transportation and cleaning of [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], [[greywater]], and irrigation water. [[Wastewater treatment]] and [[water reclamation]] are areas of concern in this field.

Wastewater engineers map out topographical and geographical features of Earth to determine the best means of collection, design pipe and pumped collection systems, and design treatment processes for collected wastewater.

===Job description and typical tasks===
Wastewater engineers use a variety of skills and must have knowledge of  mechanical and environmental engineering. They are required to perform tasks and demonstrate knowledge in design, mathematics, English, construction, physics, chemistry, biology, management, and personnel. Wastewater engineers must have skills in complex problem solving, critical thinking, mathematics, active listening, judgement, reading comprehension, speaking, writing, science, and system analysis.&lt;ref name=Onet&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Report for: 17-2081.01 - Water/Wastewater Engineers|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01|website=O*net Online|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical work activities include problem solving, communication with management and staff, gathering information, analyzing data, evaluating standards and complying with them, and communicating with others in the field.

Wastewater engineers perform these activities by combining their knowledge and skills to perform tasks. These tasks are to understand computer-aided design programs, and to conduct studies for the  construction of facilities, water supply systems and collection systems.  They may design systems for wastewater collection machinery, as well as system components.  They may perform water flow analysis, then select designs and equipment based on government and industry standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fairfax County Department of Human Resources|title=Wastewater Plant Operations Manager Classification Specification|url=http://agency.governmentjobs.com/fairfaxcounty/default.cfm?action=viewclassspec&amp;classSpecID=969985&amp;viewOnly=yes|website=Fairfax County Classifications|publisher=Fairfax County, VA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical employers===
Wastewater engineers work for private companies, state and local governments, and special districts. As of 2012 there were 53,000 wastewater engineers employed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant and System Operators|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/production/water-and-wastewater-treatment-plant-and-system-operators.htm|website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern challenges: climate change===
Today the wastewater managers confront new challenges and the need for new technology as water levels decrease due to increasingly frequent and extended droughts. Technologies such as sonar mapping are being used in wells to determine the volume of water that they can hold. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the State of New York worked together to map underground aquifers since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground Water Resource Mapping|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/36118.html|website=New York State Department of Resource Conservation|publisher=State of New York|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they have thorough maps of these aquifers to assist in water management.

Wastewater treatment contributes to global warming in many ways. One of the factors that contributes to global warming is wastewater treatment facilities and their emissions of greenhouse gases. Some of those gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases occur because of the decomposition of organic material from the anaerobic bacteria. These bacteria clean the leftover waste. Even if the anaerobic bacteria decomposition produces these gases, the percentage of greenhouse gases that other equipment produce is still greater than the contribution of the anaerobic bacteria. Also, the power usage from those machinery is very high. That is why many facilities are undergoing renovation to use higher levels of anaerobic bacteria compared to other types of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cakir|first1=FY|title=Greenhouse gas production: A comparison between aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment technology|journal=Water Research|date=September 26, 2005|volume=39|issue=17|pages=4197–4203|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2005.07.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[effects of global warming]] on waste water treatment facilities vary from location to location. In the Northeast there has been increased rainfall causing treatment plants to be too small relative to the amount coming in. In the West there is a lack of rainfall and water sources are being depleted. This means the facilities will need to be updated to meet modern and future environmental changes such as the increased use of recycled and [[reclaimed water]] Climate change also affects piping and increases the rate of corrosion, adding to facility cost.

Desalination plants may be required in the future for those regions hardest hit by [[water scarcity]]. Desalination is a process of cleaning water by means of evaporation. Water is evaporated and it passes through membranes. The water is then cooled and condenses allowing it to flow either back into the main water line or out to sea. Desalination is not completely "green" since the plants require energy to run and due to the fact that the brine waste must managed to avoid ecological damage to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lattemann|first1=Sabine|title=Environmental impact and impact assessment of seawater desalination|journal=Desalination|date=2008|volume=220|issue=1|pages=1–15|accessdate=April 20, 2015

===Education necessary for the job===
Formal education for wastewater engineers begins in high school with students taking classes such as chemistry, biology, physics, and higher mathematics including calculus. After high school most jobs require certification from a state agency. Those wanting to advance in the industry should pursue a civil engineering, [[mechanical engineering]], environmental engineering, or a [[facilities engineering]] degree. Gaining experience through internships and working while in college is a common pathway toward advancement.

Education about waste treatment requires course work in systems design, machinery design principles, water chemistry, and similar coursework. Other classes may include Chemistry of Plant Processes, and various plant operations courses.

Initial employment in wastewater engineering can be obtained by those with and without advanced formal education. The California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), for example, shows how individuals can advance through a progression of certifications as Waste Water Treatment Operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=California Environmental Protection Agency|title=Operator Certification Requirements TABLE|url=http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_table.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board uses a five level classification system to classify
water treatment facilities into categories I-V according to the population served
and the complexity of the treatment system.

The Operator Certification requirements for water treatment operators and waste water treatment operators are described in detail by State law. To meet certification requirements, operators must submit an application to SWRCB, have the necessary work experience, meet the educational requirements, and pass an examination based on the knowledge, skill,and abilities described in the regulations. Operators are required to renew their certificates every three years.  To be elibible for renewal, certified operators must complete a specified number of continuing education hours after the previous issuance of a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wastewater Treatment Plant Classification, Operator Certification, and Contract Operator Registration |url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_clean.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wastewater engineers may advance in their careers through additional education and experience. With additional knowledge and experience one can become the manager of an entire plant. The accreditation body certifying the education for the degree and license is the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET).  Over time some companies may require the wastewater engineer to continue their education to keep up with any changes in technology.

Obtaining one’s master's degree is encouraged since many companies list it as a preference in selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-engineering-careers/engineering/environmental-engineer#education|website=Science Buddies|publisher=Science Buddies, Inc.|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer: Career Profile|url=http://study.com/articles/Environmental_Engineer_Career_Profile.html|website=Study.com|publisher=Study.com, Mountain View, CA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field 76 percent of those employed have a bachelor's degree, 17 percent have a master's degree and three percent have a post-doctoral degree as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Onet"/&gt;  The average annual salary is approximately $83,360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wages and Employment Trends|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01#WagesEmployment|website=Onetonline.org|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hostelling Scotland''' (SYHA; [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]: ''Comann Osdailean Òigridh na h-Alba''), founded in 1931, is part of [[Hostelling International]] and provides [[youth hostel]] accommodation in Scotland.&lt;ref name="SYHA about 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=About SYHA | website=SYHA Hostelling Scotland | url=https://www.syha.org.uk/about-syha/about-syha.aspx | accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2013, around 60% of its guests come from outwith Scotland.&lt;ref name="syha" /&gt;

As of 2016, the hostel guide and website lists over 60 [[hostel]]s,&lt;ref name="SYHA about 2016" /&gt; 28 of which are independently owned affiliate hostels such as those of the [[Gatliff Hebridean Hostel Trust]] and various local communities and authorities. Hostels vary from modern purpose-built premises to historic buildings and country cottages, sited in major towns and cities and in rural locations, including remote islands.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.syha.org.uk/media/3639/hostel-guide-2018-web_100.pdf Hostel Guide 2018], Retrieved 19th March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lodging|Accommodation]] is generally [[dormitory]]-style but increasingly this is being subdivided into smaller units. For example, the most modern hostel, Edinburgh Central, has many single and twin-bedded rooms with ensuite facilities. All have a lounge/sitting room, shared bathrooms and self-catering kitchens. Many hostels provide meals at request.

Hostelling Scotland is a self-funding charitable organisation, and as a not-for-profit business invests all surplus back into the organisation, both to develop the network and to improve older hostels.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Today it faces competition from the more numerous independent hostels, and from rural hotels which provide bunkhouse accommodation.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

It has been claimed that it has left its roots as a [[working class]] movement to "provide accommodation to people of limited means" behind, and become too expensive. The SYHA's defenders, including [[Allan Wilson (Scottish politician)|Allan Wilson]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]], point out that hostellers today require higher levels of comfort than when the hostelling movement began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=4304&amp;i=29363 |title=motion S1M-1829 Official report 9 May 2001 |publisher= Scottish Parliament |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hostels: past and present==
In 1938, there were more than 60 hostels and membership was approaching 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3UVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xIQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4662%2C2603867 |title=Youth Hostels in Scotland |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |page=10 |date=16 June 1938 |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At their highest point, the SHYA had 99 hostels, by 1995 this had reduced to 85.&lt;ref name="Herald 22Jul1995"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12096160.Youth_hostels_pack_up_their_troubles/ |title=Youth hostels pack up their troubles |first=George |last=Hume |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=22 July 1995 |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Branding==

As of 2018, The Scottish Youth Hostels Association rebranded as Hostelling Scotland, dropping the SYHA from their name. The new logo reflects the internationally recognised symbol for youth hostelling and the house, with its characteristic gable-end chimney, gives the pictorial a subtle hint of Scotland whilst the colour mirrors that of the Saltire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.syha.org.uk/news-events/news/2018/february/welcome-to-our-new-brand-identity/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Religious Sisters of Mercy''' (R.S.M.) are members of a [[religious institute]] of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[women]] founded in 1831 in Dublin, Ireland by [[Catherine McAuley]] (1778–1841). In 2018 the institute has about 6200 [[Religious sister|sisters]] worldwide, organized into a number of independent [[congregation (Catholic)|congregations]]. They also started many education and health care facilities around the globe.

==History==
{{Main|Catherine McAuley}}

===Founding===
The Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy began when Catherine McAuley used an inheritance to build a large house on Baggot Street, Dublin, as a school for poor girls and a shelter for homeless servant girls and women.  She was assisted in the works of the house by local women. As the number of lay co-workers at Baggot Street increased, so did severe lay and clerical criticism of the House: Why did these women look like a religious order, yet not abide by the normal regulations of religious orders? Who was this "upstart" Miss McAuley? Why was the "unlearned sex" doing the work of the clergy?

By 1830 Catherine and her co-workers realized that the stability of the works of mercy they performed, including visiting the sick poor in their homes and in hospitals, and their continued appeal to co-workers, called for revision of their lay community. So, on 8 September, Catherine McAuley, Anna Maria Doyle, and Elizabeth Harley entered the Presentation Convent in Dublin to begin formal preparation for founding the Sisters of Mercy.

On 12 December 1831, Catherine McAuley, Mary Ann Doyle, and Mary Elizabeth Harley professed their religious vows as the first Sisters of Mercy, thereby founding the congregation. The rule and constitutions of the congregation were not completed until 1834, nor approved until 1835, yet they contained in substance only that which had been observed from the year 1827.

===Expansion===
The rapid expansion of the Sisters of Mercy in the six years 1835-1841 flowed from Catherine McAuley's ever generous response to human need.
She founded nine additional autonomous Convents of Mercy in Tullamore (1836), Charleville (1836), Carlow (1837), Cork (1837), Limerick (1838), Bermondsey, London (1839), Galway (1840), Birr (1840), and Birmingham (1841), and branch houses of the Dublin community in Kingstown (1835) and Booterstown (1838).

Catherine McAuley died on 11 November 1841.

In May 1842, at the request of [[Michael Anthony Fleming|Bishop Fleming]], a small colony of Sisters of Mercy crossed the Atlantic to found the congregation at [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]]. In December 1843 Sr Frances Warde led the first group of Sisters to The United States, beginning in Pittsburgh.  The sisters arrived in [[Perth]], Australia in 1846, and in 1850, a band from [[Carlow]] arrived in [[New Zealand]]. Sisters from Limerick opened a house in [[Glasgow]] in 1849, and in 1868 the English community established a house in [[Guernsey]].&lt;ref name=Austin&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10199a.htm Austin, Mary Stanislas. "Sisters of Mercy." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 2 Oct. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the leaders of the various congregations created the '''Mercy International Association''' to foster collaboration and cooperation. The purpose of the association is to provide support and foster collaboration, organisation and inspiration for the ministries of the Sisters of Mercy and their associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercyworld.org/|title=Mercy World|website=www.mercyworld.org|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical events===
The sisters were the first nurses to respond to the British Government request for nurses in the [[Crimea]] in 1853. They ran several hospitals during the war and provided nurses who were not under the control of [[Florence Nightingale]]. However their involvement was overshadowed by hers for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchinhistory.org/pages/nursing-crimean-war/nursing-crimean-war.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vows and activities==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2018}}
Sisters of Mercy is an international community of Roman Catholic women religious vowed to serve people who suffer from poverty, sickness and lack of education with a special concern for women and children. Members take vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]], the evangelical counsels commonly vowed in religious life, and, in addition, vows of service.  They continue to participate in the life of the surrounding community. In keeping with their mission of serving the poor and needy, many sisters engage in teaching, medical care, and community programs. The organization is active in [[lobbying]] and politics.

==Constitution==
The Sisters of Mercy are constituted as religious and charitable organizations in a number of countries. Mercy International Association is a registered charity in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Registered Charity no. CHY 10078.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Main|Abuse scandal in the Sisters of Mercy|Magdalene Laundries in Ireland}}

On 20 May 2009, the institute was condemned in an Irish government report known as the Ryan Report, the work of
the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. The Sisters of Mercy were named as the chief among the institutes under whose care girls "endured frequent assaults and humiliation designed to make them feel worthless ... personal and family denigration was widespread".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/irish-catholic-schools-child-abuse-claims|title='Endemic' rape and abuse of Irish children in Catholic care, inquiry finds|first1=Henry|last1=McDonald|first2=Ireland|last2=correspondent|date=20 May 2009|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a monument was erected in [[Ennis]] at the site of the former industrial school 'in appreciation' of the Sisters of Mercy.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Specified risk material''' ('''SRM''') is the general term designated for tissues of [[ruminant]] animals that cannot be inspected and passed for human food because scientists have determined that [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]-causing [[prions]] concentrate there. The term was referred to in the United Kingdom's ''Specified Risk Material Order 1997'' ([[List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, 1997|S.I. 1997/2964]]), in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s, and in the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]'s regulatory response to the first confirmed U.S. BSE case in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.procbio.2013.04.015| title = Recovery and characterization of proteinacious material recovered from thermal and alkaline hydrolyzed specified risk materials| journal = Process Biochemistry| volume = 48| issue = 5–6| pages = 885| year = 2013| last1 = Mekonnen | first1 = T.

These can include brains, eyes, spinal cord, and other organs; the exact definition varies by jurisdiction.  Under the new regulations (69 FR 1862, January 12, 2004), SRMs are:  the brain, skull, eyes, [[Trigeminal ganglion|trigeminal ganglia]], spinal cord, vertebral column (with some exclusions), [[Dorsal root ganglion|dorsal root ganglia]] (DRG) of cattle 30 months of age and older, and the tonsils and distal [[ileum]] of the small intestine of all cattle.

==BSE==

The BSE infective agent has been found to concentrate in specific tissues of BSE-infected cattle and these tissues are all part of the [[central nervous system]], as BSE has not been shown to infect muscle.

===BSE SRMs===
{{BSE SRMs}}
In both the [[United States]] (U.S.) and [[Canada]], considered as controlled risk countries, SRMs are defined as: [[skull]], [[brain]], [[trigeminal ganglia]] (nerves attached to brain and close to the skull exterior), [[eye]]s, [[spinal cord]], distal ileum (a part of the [[small intestine]]), and the [[dorsal root ganglia]] (nerves attached to the spinal cord and close to the [[vertebral column]]) of cattle aged 30 months or older. On January 12, 2004, the Food Safety and Inspection Service &lt;!-- (FSIS) --&gt; of the [[USDA]] published new rules banning such materials from the human food supply.

In countries classified as undetermined risk, the OIE code recommends SRM removal as follows: tonsils and intestines in cattle at all ages; brains, eyes, spinal cord, skull and vertebral column from animals over twelve months of age.

In the [[European Union]] (E.U.), SRMs are excluded by law from the human and animal food chain.

===Removal of BSE SRMs===

The [[World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE) has established recommendations and guidelines for SRM removal based on the level of risk.  In the U.S., [[tonsils]] are removed from cattle of all ages. SRMs must be removed at slaughter and disposed as inedible material. The dorsal root ganglia must be removed during the deboning process and in animals older than 30 months, the vertebral column (excluding the vertebrae of the tail, the transverse processes of the [[lumbar]] and [[thoracic vertebrae]], and the wings of the [[sacrum]]) is removed to be certain the dorsal root ganglia is extracted in its entirety.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''spinal cord injury''' ('''SCI''') is damage to the [[spinal cord]] that causes temporary or permanent changes in its function. Symptoms may include loss of muscle function, [[sensory system|sensation]], or [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] function in the parts of the body served by the spinal cord below the level of the injury. Injury can occur at any level of the spinal cord and can be ''complete injury'', with a total loss of sensation and muscle function, or ''incomplete'', meaning some nervous signals are able to travel past the injured area of the cord. Depending on the location and severity of damage, the symptoms vary, from numbness to [[paralysis]] to [[bladder incontinence|incontinence]]. Long term outcomes also ranges widely, from full recovery to permanent [[tetraplegia]] (also called quadriplegia) or [[paraplegia]]. Complications can include [[muscle atrophy]], [[pressure sore]]s, infections, and breathing problems.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
In the majority of cases the damage results from [[physical trauma]] such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Just over half of injuries affect the [[cervical spine]], while 15% occur in each of the [[thoracic spine]], border between the thoracic and [[lumbar spine]], and lumbar spine.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018&gt;{{cite book|title=ATLS - Advanced Trauma Life Support - Student Course Manual|date=2018|publisher=American College of Surgeons|isbn=78-0-9968262-3-5|pages=129–144|edition=  10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and [[medical imaging]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Treatment starts with [[spinal motion restriction|restricting further motion of the spine]] and maintaining adequate [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; [[Corticosteroids]] have not been found to be useful.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Other interventions vary depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require long-term [[physical therapy|physical]] and [[occupational therapy]], especially if it interferes with [[activities of daily living]].

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, history, and culture --&gt;
In the United States, about 12,000 people a year survive with a spinal cord injury.&lt;ref name=NS2012/&gt; The most commonly affected group are young adult males.&lt;ref name=NS2012/&gt; SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Research into potential treatments includes [[stem cell]] implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, epidural spinal stimulation, and wearable [[powered exoskeleton|robotic exoskeleton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krucoff|first=Max O.|last2=Rahimpour|first2=Shervin|last3=Slutzky|first3=Marc W.|last4=Edgerton|first4=V.

Spinal cord injury can be [[major trauma|traumatic]] or nontraumatic,&lt;ref name="Sabapathy15"/&gt; and can be classified into three types based on cause: mechanical forces, toxic, and [[ischemia|ischemic]] (from lack of blood flow).{{sfn|Newman|Fleisher|Fink|2008|p=348}}  The damage can also be divided into [[primary and secondary injury]]: the cell death that occurs immediately in the original injury, and [[biochemical cascade]]s that are initiated by the original insult and cause further tissue damage.{{sfn|Newman|Fleisher|Fink|2008|p=335}}  These secondary injury pathways include the [[ischemic cascade]], [[inflammation]], [[edema|swelling]], [[apoptosis|cell suicide]], and [[neurotransmitter]] imbalances.{{sfn|Newman|Fleisher|Fink|2008|p=335}}  They can take place for minutes or weeks following the injury.&lt;ref name="Yu15"/&gt;

At each level of the spinal column, [[spinal nerve]]s branch off from either side of the spinal cord and exit between a pair of [[vertebra]]e, to innervate a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]], and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a [[myotome]]. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5),{{sfn|Cifu|Lew|2013|p=197}} or sacral (S1–S5).&lt;ref name="NINDS13"/&gt; A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function.{{sfn|Miller|Marini|2012|p=138}} Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=5}}

SCI is also classified by the degree of impairment.  The ''International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury'' (ISNCSCI), published by the [[American Spinal Injury Association]] (ASIA), is widely used to document sensory and motor impairments following SCI.&lt;ref name=Marino/&gt; It is based on neurological responses, touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome, and strength of the muscles that control key motions on both sides of the body.&lt;ref name="ISCOS"/&gt;  Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0–5 according to the table on the right, and sensation is graded on a scale of 0–2: 0 is no sensation, 1 is altered or decreased sensation, and 2 is full sensation.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|p=307}}  Each side of the body is graded independently.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|p=307}}

In a "complete" spinal injury, all functions below the injured area are lost, whether or not the spinal cord is severed.&lt;ref name="NINDS13"/&gt;  An "incomplete" spinal cord injury involves preservation of motor or sensory function below the level of injury in the spinal cord.&lt;ref name="SCI Medicine"/&gt;  To be classed as incomplete, there must be some preservation of sensation or motion in the areas innervated by S4 to S5,{{sfn|Sabharwal|2014|p=840}} e.g. voluntary [[external anal sphincter]] contraction.&lt;ref name="SCI Medicine"/&gt; The nerves in this area are connected to the very lowest region of the spinal cord, and retaining sensation and function in these parts of the body indicates that the spinal cord is only partially damaged.  Incomplete injury by definition includes a phenomenon known as sacral sparing: some degree of sensation is preserved in the sacral dermatomes, even though sensation may be more impaired in other, higher dermatomes below the level of the lesion.&lt;ref name="Lafuente85"/&gt; Sacral sparing has been attributed to the fact that the sacral spinal pathways are not as likely as the other spinal pathways to become compressed after injury due to the lamination of fibers within the spinal cord.&lt;ref name="Lafuente85" /&gt;

===Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality===
[[Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality]] exists when SCI is present but there is no evidence of spinal column injury on [[radiograph]]s.{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=288}} [[Vertebral column|Spinal column injury]] is trauma that causes [[bone fracture|fracture]] of the bone or instability of the [[denticulate ligaments|ligaments]] in the [[spinal column|spine]]; this can coexist with or cause injury to the spinal cord, but each injury can occur without the other.{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|pp=288–89}} Abnormalities might show up on [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), but the term was coined before MRI was in common use.{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=289}}

===Central cord syndrome===
[[File:Cord s.svg|thumb|right|Incomplete lesions of the spinal cord: Central cord syndrome&amp;nbsp;(top), Anterior cord syndrome&amp;nbsp;(middle), and Brown-Séquard syndrome&amp;nbsp;(bottom).]]
[[Central cord syndrome]], almost always resulting from damage to the cervical spinal cord, is characterized by weakness in the arms with relative sparing of the legs, and spared sensation in regions served by the sacral segments.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2014|p=839}} There is loss of sensation of pain, temperature, light touch, and pressure below the level of injury.{{sfn|Snell|2010|p=170}}  The spinal tracts that serve the arms are more affected due to their central location in the spinal cord, while the corticospinal fibers destined for the legs are spared due to their more external location.{{sfn|Snell|2010|p=170}} The most common of the incomplete SCI syndromes, central cord syndrome usually results from neck [[hyperextension]] in older people with spinal [[stenosis]].  In younger people, it most commonly results from neck flexion.{{sfn|Namdari|Pill|Mehta|2014|p=297}}  The most common causes are falls and vehicle accidents; however other possible causes include [[spinal stenosis]] and impingement on the spinal cord by a tumor or vertebral disk.{{sfn|Marx|Walls|Hockberger|2013|p=1420}}

===Anterior cord syndrome===
[[Anterior cord syndrome]], due to damage to the front portion of the spinal cord or reduction in the blood supply from the [[anterior spinal artery]], can be caused by fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks.{{sfn|Snell|2010|p=170}} Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and [[proprioception]] (sense of position in space) remain intact.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=9}}{{sfn|Namdari|Pill|Mehta|2014|p=297}} These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.{{sfn|Snell|2010|p=170}}

===Brown-Séquard syndrome===
[[Brown-Séquard syndrome]] occurs when the spinal cord is injured on one side much more than the other.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=10}} It is rare for the spinal cord to be truly hemisected (severed on one side), but partial lesions due to penetrating wounds (such as gunshot or knife wounds) or fractured vertebrae or tumors are  common.{{sfn|Snell|2010|p=171}} On the ipsilateral side of the injury (same side), the body loses motor function, [[proprioception]], and senses of vibration and touch.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=10}} On the contralateral (opposite side) of the injury, there is a loss of pain and temperature sensations.{{sfn|Marx|Walls|Hockberger|2013|p=1420}}{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=10}}

===Posterior cord syndrome===
[[Posterior cord syndrome]], in which just the [[dorsal column]]s of the spinal cord are affected, is usually seen in cases of chronic [[myelopathy]] but can also occur with infarction of the [[posterior spinal artery]].{{sfn|Roos|2012|pp=249–50}}  This rare syndrome causes the loss of proprioception and sense of vibration below the level of injury{{sfn|Namdari|Pill|Mehta|2014|p=297}} while motor function and sensation of pain, temperature, and touch remain intact.{{sfn|Ilyas|Rehman|2013|p=389}}  Usually posterior cord injuries result from insults like disease or vitamin deficiency rather than trauma.{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=294}} [[Tabes dorsalis]], due to injury to the posterior part of the spinal cord caused by syphilis, results in loss of touch and proprioceptive sensation.{{sfn|Snell|2010|p=167}}

===Conus medullaris and cauda equina syndromes===
[[Conus medullaris]] syndrome is an injury to the end of the spinal cord, located at about the T12–L2 vertebrae in adults.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=10}} This region contains the S4–S5 spinal segments, responsible for bowel, bladder, and some [[sexual function]]s, so these can be disrupted in this type of injury.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=10}}  In addition, sensation and the [[Achilles reflex]] can be disrupted.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=10}} Causes include [[neoplasm|tumors]], physical trauma, and [[ischemia]].{{sfn|Marx|Walls|Hockberger|2013|p=1422}}

[[Cauda equina syndrome]] (CES) results from a lesion below the level at which the spinal cord splits into the [[cauda equina]],{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=294}} at levels L2–S5 below the conus medullaris.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=11}} Thus it is not a true spinal cord syndrome since it is nerve roots that are damaged and not the cord itself; however it is common for several of these nerves to be damaged at the same time due to their proximity.{{sfn|Marx|Walls|Hockberger|2013|p=1422}} CES can occur by itself or alongside conus medullaris syndrome.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=11}} It can cause low back pain, weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs, loss of sensation, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and loss of reflexes.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=11}} Unlike in conus medullaris syndrome, symptoms often occur on only one side of the body.{{sfn|Marx|Walls|Hockberger|2013|p=1422}} The cause is often compression, e.g. by a ruptured intervertebral disk or tumor.{{sfn|Marx|Walls|Hockberger|2013|p=1422}}  Since the nerves damaged in CES are actually [[peripheral nerve]]s because they have already branched off from the spinal cord, the injury has better prognosis for recovery of function: the [[peripheral nervous system]] has a greater capacity for healing than the [[central nervous system]].{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=11}}

{{Further|Dermatome (anatomy)}}
[[Medical sign|Signs]] (observed by a clinician) and [[symptom]]s (experienced by a patient) vary depending on where the spine is injured and the extent of the injury. 
&lt;!--SENSATION--&gt;
A section of skin [[nerve|innervated]] through a specific part of the spine is called a [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]], and injury to that part of the spine can cause pain, numbness, or a loss of sensation in the related areas. [[Paraesthesia]], a tingling or burning sensation in affected areas of the skin, is another symptom.{{sfn|Augustine|2011|p=199}} A person with a lowered [[level of consciousness]] may show a response to a painful stimulus above a certain point but not below it.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=39}} 
&lt;!--MUSCLE FUNCTION--&gt;
A group of muscles innervated through a specific part of the spine is called a [[myotome]], and injury to that part of the spinal cord can cause problems with movements that involve those muscles.  The muscles may contract uncontrollably ([[spasticity]]), become [[paresis|weak]], or be completely [[paralysis|paralysed]]. [[Spinal shock]], loss of neural activity including reflexes below the level of injury, occurs shortly after the injury and usually goes away within a day.{{sfn|Snell|2010|p=169}}

The specific parts of the body affected by loss of function are determined by the level of injury.

===Lumbosacral===
The effects of injuries at or above the [[lumbar]] or [[sacrum|sacral]] regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the [[human leg|legs]] and [[hip]]s, [[genitourinary system]], and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|p=313}} [[intestine|Bowel]] and [[urinary bladder|bladder]] function are regulated by the [[sacrum|sacral]] region. It is common to experience [[sexuality after spinal cord injury|sexual dysfunction after injury]], as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including [[fecal incontinence|fecal]] and [[urinary incontinence]].&lt;ref name="NINDS13"/&gt; It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty,{{sfn|Fulk|Behrman|Schmitz|2013|p=898}} leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|p=314}} One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is [[priapism]], an [[erection]] of the penis.{{sfn|Augustine|2011|p=200}}

===Thoracic===
In addition to the problems found in lower-level injuries, thoracic (chest height) spinal lesions can affect the muscles in the trunk. Injuries at the level of T1 to T8 result in inability to control the abdominal muscles. Trunk stability may be affected; even more so in higher level injuries.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|pp=311, 313}} The lower the level of injury, the less extensive its effects.  Injuries from T9 to T12 result in partial loss of trunk and abdominal muscle control.  Thoracic spinal injuries result in [[paraplegia]], but function of the hands, arms, and neck are not affected.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|p=311}}

&lt;!--AUTONOMIC DYSREFLEXIA--&gt;
One condition that occurs typically in lesions above the T6 level is [[autonomic dysreflexia]] (AD), in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels, high enough to cause potentially deadly [[stroke]].{{sfn|Cifu|Lew|2013|p=197}}&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10"/&gt; It results from an overreaction of the system to a stimulus such as pain below the level of injury, because inhibitory signals from the brain cannot pass the lesion to dampen the excitatory [[sympathetic nervous system]] response.{{sfn|Newman|Fleisher|Fink|2008|p=348}}  Signs and symptoms of AD include anxiety, [[headache]], [[nausea]], [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]], blurred vision, flushed skin, and [[nasal congestion]].{{sfn|Newman|Fleisher|Fink|2008|p=348}}  It can occur shortly after the injury or not until years later.{{sfn|Newman|Fleisher|Fink|2008|p=348}}

Other autonomic functions may also be disrupted. For example, problems with body temperature regulation mostly occur in injuries at T8 and above.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|p=313}}
&lt;!--NEUROGENIC SHOCK--&gt;
Another serious complication that can result from lesions above T6 is [[neurogenic shock]], which results from an interruption in output from the [[sympathetic nervous system]] responsible for maintaining [[muscle tone]] in the blood vessels.{{sfn|Newman|Fleisher|Fink|2008|p=348}}&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10"/&gt; Without the sympathetic input, the vessels relax and dilate.{{sfn|Newman|Fleisher|Fink|2008|p=348}}&lt;ref name="Dimitriadis10"/&gt;  Neurogenic shock presents with dangerously low blood pressure, [[bradycardia|low heart rate]], and blood pooling in the limbs—which results in insufficient blood flow to the spinal cord and potentially further damage to it.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=63}}

===Cervical===
Spinal cord injuries at the cervical (neck) level&lt;!--, which account for almost 57% of spinal cord injuries, --&gt; result in full or partial [[tetraplegia]] (also called quadriplegia).{{sfn|Sabharwal|2014|p=839}} Depending on the specific location and severity of trauma, limited function may be retained.

Additional signs and symptoms of cervical injuries include low [[heart rate]], low [[blood pressure]], problems regulating [[body temperature]], and breathing dysfunction.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|pp=53–54}} If the injury is high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing, the person may not be able to breathe without the help of an [[endotracheal tube]] and mechanical ventilator.&lt;ref name="NINDS13"/&gt;

===Complications===

Complications of spinal cord injuries include [[pulmonary edema]], [[respiratory failure]], [[neurogenic shock]], and [[paralysis]] below the injury site.

&lt;!--MUSCULOSKELETAL--&gt;
In the long term, the loss of muscle function can have additional effects from disuse, including [[atrophy]] of the muscle.  Immobility can lead to [[pressure sore]]s,  particularly in bony areas, requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours (in the acute setting) to relieve pressure.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=70}} In the long term, people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|p=314–15}}  Another complication is pain, including [[nociceptive pain]] (indication of potential or actual tissue damage) and [[neuropathic pain]], when  nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals in the absence of noxious stimuli.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=17}} [[Spasticity]], the uncontrollable tensing of muscles below the level of injury, occurs in 65–78% of chronic SCI.&lt;ref name="Hesse12"/&gt; It results from lack of input from the brain that quells muscle responses to stretch reflexes.&lt;ref name="Selzer2010"/&gt;  It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy.&lt;ref name="Selzer2010" /&gt; Spasticity increases the risk of [[contracture]]s ([[Muscle contracture|shortening of muscles]], tendons, or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb); this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full [[range of motion]] multiple times a day.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|p=315}}  Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure.{{sfn|Frontera|Silver|Rizzo|2014|p=407}}&lt;ref name="Qin2010"/&gt; Loss of bone density ([[Mineralization (biology)|bone demineralization]]), thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles, can increase the risk of fractures.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=16}} Conversely, a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas,  called [[heterotopic ossification]].{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=15}}  It occurs below the level of injury, possibly as a result of inflammation, and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27% of people.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=15}}

[[Image:1025 Atrophy.png|thumb|left|Muscle mass is reduced as muscles atrophy with disuse.]]
&lt;!--CARDIO &amp; RESPIRATORY --&gt;
People with SCI are at especially high risk for respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them.&lt;ref name="Fehlings11"/&gt; Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are the leading cause of death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, [[urinary tract infection]]s and [[respiratory infection]]s.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=26}} [[Pneumonia]] can be accompanied by [[shortness of breath]], fever, and anxiety.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2014|p=839}}

&lt;!--DVT--&gt;
Another potentially deadly threat to respiration is [[deep venous thrombosis]] (DVT), in which blood forms a clot in immobile limbs; the clot can break off and form a  [[pulmonary embolism]], lodging in the lung and cutting off blood supply to it.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=13}} DVT  is an especially high risk in SCI, particularly within 10 days of injury, occurring in over 13% in the acute care setting.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=69}}  Preventative measures include [[anticoagulant]]s, [[pressure hose]], and moving the patient's limbs.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=69}} The usual signs and symptoms of DVT and pulmonary embolism may be masked in SCI cases due to effects such as alterations in pain perception and nervous system functioning.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=69}}

&lt;!--INFECTION--&gt;
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is another risk that may not display the usual symptoms (pain, urgency and frequency); it may instead be associated with worsened spasticity.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2014|p=839}} The risk of UTI, likely the most common complication in the long term, is heightened by use of indwelling [[urinary catheter]]s.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=70}} Catheterization may be necessary because SCI interferes with the bladder's ability to empty when it gets too full, which could trigger autonomic dysreflexia or damage the bladder permanently.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=70}}  The use of [[intermittent catheterization]] to empty the bladder at regular intervals throughout the day has decreased the mortality due to kidney failure from UTI in the first world, but it is still a serious problem in developing countries.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=16}}

&lt;!--DEPRESSION--&gt;
An estimated 24–45% of people with SCI suffer disorders of [[major depression|depression]], and the suicide rate is as much as six times that of the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="BurnsMahalik2008"/&gt; The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=27}} In young people with SCI, suicide is the leading cause of death.&lt;ref name="Pollard07"/&gt; Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.&lt;ref name="Pollard07"/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Man falling of horse.jpg|thumb|Falling as a part of recreational activities can cause spinal cord injuries.]]

Spinal cord injuries are most often caused by [[physical trauma]].{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=288}} Forces involved can be [[hyperflexion]] (forward movement of the head); [[hyperextension]] (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); [[rotational force|rotation]] (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or [[distraction injury|distraction]] (pulling apart of the vertebrae).{{sfn|Augustine|2011|p=198}} Traumatic SCI can result in [[contusion]], [[spinal cord compression|compression]], or stretch injury.&lt;ref name="Sabapathy15"/&gt; It is a major risk of many types of [[spinal fracture|vertebral fracture]].&lt;ref name=radiologyassistant&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p54885e620ee46/spine-injury-tlics-classification.html|title=Spine injury - TLICS Classification|author=Clark West, Stefan Roosendaal, Joost Bot and Frank Smithuis|website=Radiology Assistant|accessdate=2017-10-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027025120/http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p54885e620ee46/spine-injury-tlics-classification.html|archivedate=2017-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as [[hemiparesis]], to result from otherwise minor trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuchner|first=E.

M.|date=1985-04-01|title=Cervical diastematomyelia: a case report with operative management|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=16|issue=4|pages=538–542|issn=0148-396X|pmid=3990933|doi=10.1097/00006123-198504000-00016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[Motor vehicle accident]]s are the most common cause of SCIs; second are [[Falling (accident)|falls]], then violence such as gunshot wounds, then [[sports injury|sports injuries]].{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|pp=24–25}} In some countries falls are more common, even surpassing vehicle crashes as the leading cause of SCI.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=10}} The rates of violence-related SCI depend heavily on place and time.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=10}} Of all sports-related SCIs, shallow water dives are the most common cause; [[winter sport]]s and [[water sport]]s have been increasing as causes while [[association football]] and [[trampoline]] injuries have been declining.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=34}}  [[Hanging]] can cause injury to the cervical spine, as may occur in attempted [[suicide]].{{sfn|Brown|Wyatt|Illingworth|Clancy|2008|p=1132}} Military conflicts are another cause, and when they occur they are associated with increased rates of SCI.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt; Another potential cause of SCI is [[iatrogenic]] injury, caused by an improperly done medical procedure such as an injection into the spinal column.{{sfn|Frontera|Silver|Rizzo|2014|p=39}}

SCI can also be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause anywhere from 30 to 80% of all SCI;&lt;ref name="Scivoletto14"/&gt; the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma.&lt;ref name="Celani01"/&gt; Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries.&lt;ref name="New14"/&gt;  In developed countries, the most common cause of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as [[HIV]] and tuberculosis.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=24}} SCI may occur in intervertebral disc disease, and spinal cord vascular disease.&lt;ref name="Van Den Berg10"/&gt; Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and [[intervertebral disk]]s can herniate.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=5}} Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in [[arteriovenous malformation]], or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord.{{sfn|Fulk|Behrman|Schmitz|2013|p=890}} When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord.{{sfn|Moore|2006|pp=530–31}} Congenital conditions and [[tumor]]s that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral [[spondylosis]] and [[ischemia]].&lt;ref name="Sabapathy15"/&gt; [[Multiple sclerosis]] is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as [[tuberculosis]], [[herpes zoster]] or [[herpes simplex]], [[meningitis]], [[myelitis]], and [[syphilis]].{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=5}}

==Prevention==
Vehicle-related SCI is prevented with measures including societal and individual efforts to reduce [[driving under the influence]] of drugs or alcohol, [[distracted driving]], and [[drowsy driving]].{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=31}}  Other efforts include increasing [[road safety]] (such as marking hazards and adding lighting) and vehicle safety, both to prevent accidents (such as routine maintenance and [[antilock brakes]]) and to mitigate the damage of crashes (such as  head restraints, air bags, seat belts, and child safety seats).{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=31}}  Falls can be prevented by making changes to the environment, such as nonslip materials and grab bars in bathtubs and showers, railings for stairs, child and safety gates for windows.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=32}} Gun-related injuries can be prevented with [[conflict resolution]] training, [[gun safety]] education campaigns, and changes to the technology of guns (such as [[trigger lock]]s) to improve their safety.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=32}}  Sports injuries can be prevented with changes to sports rules and equipment to increase safety, and education campaigns to reduce risky practices such as diving into water of unknown depth or [[Spearing (gridiron football)|head-first tackling]] in association football.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=33}}

}}
A person's presentation in context of trauma or non-traumatic background determines suspicion for a spinal cord injury. The features are namely paralysis, sensory loss, or both at any level. Other symptoms may include incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/spinalinjury/conditioninfo/diagnosed|title=How is SCI diagnosed?|website=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/|language=en|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A radiographic evaluation using an [[X-ray]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] scan, or [[MRI]] can determine if there is damage to the spinal column and where it is located.&lt;ref name="NINDS13" /&gt; X-rays are commonly available{{sfn|Wyatt|Illingworth|Graham|Hogg|2012|p=384}} and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of [[denticulate ligaments|ligaments]] or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage.&lt;ref name="NINDS13" /&gt; Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used.{{sfn|Wyatt|Illingworth|Graham|Hogg|2012|p=384}} CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more [[radiation]],{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=78}} and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail.&lt;ref name="NINDS13" /&gt; Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.{{sfn|DeKoning|2014|p=389}}

Neurological evaluations to help determine the degree of impairment are performed initially and repeatedly in the early stages of treatment; this determines the rate of improvement or deterioration and informs treatment and prognosis.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|pp=64–65}}{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=55}} The ASIA Impairment Scale outlined above is used to determine the level and severity of injury.&lt;ref name="NINDS13"/&gt;

==Management==

===Prehospital treatment===
[[Image:Immobilisation plan dur.png|thumb|Spine motion restriction with a long spine board]]
The first stage in the management of a suspected spinal cord injury is geared toward [[basic life support]] and preventing further injury: maintaining airway, breathing, and circulation and restricting further motion of the spine.{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=289}}
&lt;!--IMMOBILIZATION--&gt;
&lt;!--MOI--&gt;
In the emergency setting, most people who has been subjected to forces strong enough to cause SCI are treated as though they have instability in the spinal column and have [[spinal motion restriction|spinal motion restricted]] to prevent damage to the spinal cord.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=38}} Injuries or fractures in the head, neck, or pelvis as well as penetrating trauma near the spine and falls from heights are assumed to be associated with an unstable spinal column until it is ruled out in the hospital.&lt;ref name="NINDS13"/&gt; High-speed vehicle crashes, sports injuries involving the head or neck, and diving injuries are other mechanisms that indicate a high SCI risk.{{sfn|Augustine|2011|p=207}} Since head and spinal trauma frequently coexist, anyone who is unconscious or has a lowered [[level of consciousness]] as a result of a head injury is spinal motion restricted.{{sfn|Cameron|Jelinek|Kelly|Brown|2014}}
 
&lt;!--DEVICES--&gt;
A rigid [[cervical collar]] is applied to the neck, and the head is held with blocks on either side and the person is strapped to a [[Long spine board|backboard]].{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=38}} [[Kendrick Extrication Device|Extrication device]]s are used to move people without excessively moving the spine{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=37}} if they are still inside a vehicle or other confined space. The use of a cervical collar has been shown to increase mortality in people with penetrating trauma and is thus not routinely recommended in this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=EMS spinal precautions and the use of the long backboard.|journal=Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors|date=2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=392–3|doi=10.3109/10903127.2013.773115|pmid=23458580|url=http://www.naemsp.org/Documents/Position%20Papers/POSITION%20EMS%20Spinal%20Precautions%20and%20the%20Use%20of%20the%20Long%20Backboard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern trauma care includes a step called [[clearing the cervical spine]], ruling out spinal cord injury if the patient is fully conscious and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, displays no neurological deficits, has no pain in the middle of the neck and no other painful injuries that could distract from neck pain.{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=294}} If these are all absent, no spinal motion restriction is necessary.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=37}}

&lt;!--DETERIORATION--&gt;
If an unstable spinal column injury is moved, damage may occur to the spinal cord.&lt;ref name="ahn11"/&gt; Between 3 and 25% of SCIs occur not at the time of the initial trauma but later during treatment or transport.{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=289}} While some of this is due to the nature of the injury itself, particularly in the case of [[multiple trauma|multiple]] or massive trauma, some of it reflects the failure to adequately restrict motion of the spine. SCI can impair the body's ability to keep warm, so warming blankets may be needed.{{sfn|Cameron|Jelinek|2014}}

===Early hospital treatment===
Initial care in the hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims to ensure adequate airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and spinal motion restriction.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=53}} Imaging of the spine to determine the presence of a SCI may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize other life-threatening injuries.{{sfn|Bigelow|Medzon|2011|p=173}} [[Acute (medicine)|Acute]] SCI merits treatment in an [[intensive care unit]], especially injuries to the cervical spinal cord.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=53}} People with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.{{sfn|DeKoning|2014|p=373}} People should be removed from the [[spine board]] as rapidly as possible to prevent complications from its use.&lt;ref name=ITLS2018/&gt;

&lt;!--BLOOD PRESSURE--&gt;
If the [[systolic]] blood pressure falls below 90 [[mmHg]] within days of the injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=63}} Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure which may be done using [[intravenous fluids]] and [[vasopressor]]s.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|pp=63–64}} Vasopressors used include [[phenylephrine]], [[dopamine]], or [[norepinephrine]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Mean [[arterial blood pressure]] is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury.&lt;ref name="Witiw15"/&gt; The treatment for [[hemorrhagic shock|shock from blood loss]] is different from that for [[neurogenic shock]], and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|pp=63–64}} However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Another important aspect of care is prevention of [[hypoxia (medical)|insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream]], which could deprive the spinal cord of oxygen.{{sfn|Bigelow|Medzon|2011|pp=167, 176}} People with cervical or high thoracic injuries may experience a dangerously [[bradycardia|slowed heart rate]]; treatment to speed it may include [[atropine]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt;

&lt;!--STEROIDS--&gt;
The [[corticosteroid]] medication [[methylprednisolone]] has been studied for use in SCI with the hope of limiting swelling and [[primary and secondary injury|secondary injury]].&lt;ref name=Rou2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rouanet|first1=C|last2=Reges|first2=D|last3=Rocha|first3=E|last4=Gagliardi|first4=V|last5=Silva|first5=GS|title=Traumatic spinal cord injury: current concepts and treatment update.|journal=Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria|date=June 2017|volume=75|issue=6|pages=387–393|doi=10.1590/0004-282X20170048|pmid=28658409}}&lt;/ref&gt; As there does not appear to be long term benefits and the medication is associated with risks such as [[gastrointestinal bleeding]] and infection its use is not recommended as of 2018.&lt;ref name=Rou2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Its use in [[traumatic brain injury]] is also not recommended.&lt;ref name=ITLS2018&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=John|title=International Trauma Life Support for Emergency Care Providers|date=2018|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292170848|edition= 8th Global |pages=221–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--SURGERY--&gt;
Surgery may be necessary, e.g. to relieve excess pressure on the cord, to stabilize the spine, or to put vertebrae back in their proper place.&lt;ref name="Witiw15"/&gt;  In cases involving instability or compression, failing to operate can lead to worsening of the condition.&lt;ref name="Witiw15"/&gt; Surgery is also necessary when something is pressing on the cord, such as bone fragments, blood, material from ligaments or [[intervertebral disc]]s,{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=65}} or a lodged object from a [[penetrating trauma|penetrating injury]].{{sfn|Wyatt|Illingworth|Graham|Hogg|2012|p=384}} Although the ideal timing of surgery is still debated, studies have found that earlier surgical intervention (within 24 hours of injury) is associated with better outcomes.&lt;ref name="Witiw15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu15"/&gt;  Sometimes a patient has too many other injuries to be a surgical candidate this early.&lt;ref name="Witiw15"/&gt; Surgery is controversial because it has potential complications (such as infection), so in cases where it is not clearly needed (e.g. the cord is being compressed), doctors must decide whether to perform surgery based on aspects of the patient's condition and their own beliefs about its risks and benefits.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|pp=65–69}}
{{anchor|traction}}
In cases where a more conservative approach is chosen, [[bed rest]], cervical collars, motion restriction devices, and optionally [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] are used.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=67}}  Surgeons may opt to put traction on the spine to remove pressure from the spinal cord by putting dislocated vertebrae back into alignment, but herniation of intervertebral disks may prevent this technique from relieving pressure.{{sfn|Bigelow|Medzon|2011|p=177}}  ''Gardner-Wells tongs'' are one tool used to exert spinal traction to reduce a fracture or [[joint dislocation|dislocation]] and to reduce motion to the affected areas.&lt;ref name="Krag89"/&gt;

===Rehabilitation===
{{Main|Rehabilitation in spinal cord injury}}
&lt;!--REHAB TEAM--&gt;
SCI patients often require extended treatment in specialized spinal unit or an [[intensive care unit]].&lt;ref name=review02/&gt;  The rehabilitation process typically begins in the acute care setting. Usually the inpatient phase lasts 8–12 weeks and then the outpatient rehabilitation phase lasts 3–12 months after that, followed by yearly medical and functional evaluation.{{sfn|Cifu|Lew|2013|p=197}} [[Physical therapist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[recreational therapist]]s, nurses, social workers, psychologists and other health care professionals work as a team under the coordination of a physiatrist&lt;ref name="NINDS13"/&gt; to decide on goals with the patient and develop a plan of discharge that is appropriate for the person’s condition.

[[File:Evo.JPG|thumb|left|Orthopedic devices such as [[ankle-foot orthosis|ankle-foot orthoses]] can aid in walking.]]
In the acute phase physical therapists focus on the patient’s respiratory status, prevention of indirect complications (such as [[pressure ulcer]]s), maintaining [[range of motion]], and keeping available musculature active.&lt;ref name="Fulk, G. 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fulk G |author2=Schmitz T |author3=Behrman A |year=2007 |contribution=Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury |editor=O'Sullivan S |editor2=Schmitz T |title=Physical Rehabilitation |edition=  5th  |pages=937–96 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=F.A. Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--RESPIRATORY--&gt;
For people whose injuries are high enough to interfere with breathing, there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery.&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt; Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability to cough effectively, allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;  As SCI patients suffer from reduced [[total lung capacity]] and [[tidal volume]],&lt;ref name="Winslow C"/&gt; physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, [[glossopharyngeal breathing]]) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals.  Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations, [[postural drainage]],&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt; respiratory muscle training, and assisted cough techniques.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; Patients are taught to increase their intra-abdominal pressure by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in the rhythm of the cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt; Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction  include respiratory muscle pacing, use of a constricting abdominal binder, ventilator-assisted speech, and [[mechanical ventilation]].&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

The amount of functional recovery and independence achieved in terms of activities of daily living, recreational activities, and employment is affected by the level and severity of injury.{{sfn|Weiss|2010|p=306}} The [[Functional Independence Measure]] (FIM) is an assessment tool that aims to evaluate the function of patients throughout the rehabilitation process following a  spinal cord injury or other serious illness or injury.&lt;ref name=Chumney/&gt;  It can track a patient's progress and degree of independence during rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=Chumney/&gt;  People with SCI may need to use specialized devices and to make modifications to their environment in order to handle [[activities of daily living]] and to function independently.  Weak joints can be stabilized with devices such as [[ankle-foot orthosis|ankle-foot orthoses]] (AFOs) and knee-AFOs, but walking may still require a lot of effort.&lt;ref name="del-Ama12"/&gt; Increasing activity will increase chances of recovery.&lt;ref name="Frood, R. 2010"/&gt;

==Prognosis==
[[File:Holly Koester, 2007 Chevron Houston Marathon (357322273).jpg|thumb|Holly Koester incurred a spinal injury as a result of a motor vehicle collision and is now a [[wheelchair racer]].]]

Spinal cord injuries generally result in at least some [[incurable]] impairment even with the best possible treatment. The best predictor of prognosis is the level and completeness of injury, as measured by the ASIA impairment scale.{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=293}} The neurological score at the initial evaluation done 72 hours after injury is the best predictor of how much function will return.&lt;ref name="Scivoletto14"/&gt; Most people with ASIA scores of A (complete injuries) do not have functional motor recovery, but improvement can occur.{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=293}}&lt;ref name="Waters91"/&gt; Most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function.&lt;ref name="Waters91" /&gt; Chances of recovering the ability to walk improve with each AIS grade found at the initial examination; e.g. an ASIA D score confers a better chance of walking than a score of C.&lt;ref name="Scivoletto14"/&gt; The symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary and it is difficult to make an accurate prediction of the outcome.  A person with a mild, incomplete injury at the T5 vertebra will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe, complete injury at exactly the same place. Of the incomplete SCI syndromes, Brown-Séquard and central cord syndromes have the best prognosis for recovery and anterior cord syndrome has the worst.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=9}} 
&lt;!-- NTSCI --&gt;
People with nontraumatic causes of SCI have been found to be less likely to suffer complete injuries and some complications such as pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis, and to have shorter hospital stays.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=5}} Their scores on functional tests were better than those of people with traumatic SCI upon hospital admission, but when they were tested upon discharge, those with traumatic SCI had improved such that both groups' results were the same.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=5}} In addition to the completeness and level of the injury, age and concurrent health problems affect the extent to which a person with SCI will be able to live independently and to walk.{{sfn|Cifu|Lew|2013|p=197}}  However, in general people with injuries to L3 or below will likely be able to walk functionally, T10 and below to walk around the house with bracing, and C7 and below to live independently.{{sfn|Cifu|Lew|2013|p=197}}

&lt;!--RATE OF RECOVERY--&gt;
One important predictor of motor recovery in an area is presence of sensation there, particularly pain perception.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=11}} Most motor recovery occurs in the first year post-injury, but modest improvements can continue for years; sensory recovery is more limited.{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=8}}  Recovery is typically quickest during the first six months.&lt;ref name="Recovery"/&gt; [[Spinal shock]], in which reflexes are suppressed, occurs immediately after the injury and resolves largely within three months but continues resolving gradually for another 15.{{sfn|Cortois|Charvier|2015|p=236}}

&lt;!--SEXUALITY--&gt;
[[Sexuality after spinal cord injury|Sexual dysfunction after spinal injury]] is common.  Problems that can occur include [[erectile dysfunction]], [[anejaculation|loss of ability to ejaculate]], insufficient lubrication of the vagina, and reduced sensation and impaired ability to [[orgasm]].&lt;ref name="Hesse12"/&gt;  Despite this, many people learn ways to adapt their sexual practices so they can lead satisfying sex lives.{{sfn|Elliott|2010}}

&lt;!--MORTALITY--&gt;
Although life expectancy has improved with better care options, it is still not as good as the uninjured population.  The higher the level of injury, and the more complete the injury, the greater the reduction in life expectancy.{{sfn|Fulk|Behrman|Schmitz|2013|p=890}} Mortality is very elevated within a year of injury.{{sfn|Fulk|Behrman|Schmitz|2013|p=890}}

&lt;!--INCIDENCE --&gt;
Worldwide, the [[incidence (epidemiology)|number of new cases]] since 1995 of SCI ranges from 10.4 to 83 people per million per year.&lt;ref name="Witiw15"/&gt; This wide range of numbers is probably partly due to differences among regions in whether and how injuries are reported.&lt;ref name="Witiw15"/&gt; In North America, about 39 people per every million incur SCI traumatically each year, and in Western Europe the incidence is 16 per million.&lt;ref name="Liu15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clement13/&gt;  In the United States, the incidence of spinal cord injury has been estimated to be about 40 cases per 1 million people per year or around 12,000 cases per year.&lt;ref name=FSCIP/&gt; In China, the incidence is approximately 60,000 per year.&lt;ref name="Qiu09"/&gt;
&lt;!--PREVALENCE--&gt;
The estimated [[prevalence (epidemiology)|number of people living with SCI]] in the world ranges from 236 to 4187 per million.&lt;ref name="Witiw15"/&gt; Estimates vary widely due to differences in how data are collected and what techniques are used to extrapolate the figures.&lt;ref name="Singh14"/&gt; Little information is available from Asia, and even less from Africa and South America.&lt;ref name="Witiw15"/&gt; In  Western Europe the estimated prevalence is 300 per million people and in North America it is 853 per million.&lt;ref name=Clement13/&gt; It is estimated at 440 per million in Iran, 526 per million in Iceland, and 681 per million in Australia.&lt;ref name="Singh14"/&gt; In the United States there are between 225,000 and 296,000 individuals living with spinal cord injuries,{{sfn|Field-Fote|2009|p=3}} and different studies have estimated prevalences from 525 to 906 per million.&lt;ref name="Singh14"/&gt;

&lt;!--ASSOCIATED TRAUMA--&gt;
SCI is present in about 2% of all cases of blunt force trauma.&lt;ref name="ahn11"/&gt; Anyone who has undergone force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal injury is at high risk for other injuries also.{{sfn|Bigelow|Medzon|2011|p=173}} In 44% of SCI cases, [[multitrauma|other serious injuries]] are sustained at the same time; 14% of SCI patients also suffer [[head trauma]] or [[facial trauma]].{{sfn|Peitzman|Fabian|Rhodes|2012|p=288}} Other commonly associated injuries include [[chest trauma]], [[abdominal trauma]], [[pelvic fracture]]s, and long [[bone fracture]]s.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=55}}

&lt;!--AGE &amp; SEX--&gt;
Males account for four out of five traumatic spinal cord injuries.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2014|p=839}} Most of these injuries occur in men under 30 years of age.&lt;ref name="NINDS13"/&gt;  The average age at the time of injury has slowly increased from about 29 years in the 1970s to 41.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2014|p=839}}  Rates of injury are at their lowest in children, at their highest in the late teens to early twenties, then get progressively lower in older age groups; however rates may rise in the elderly.&lt;ref name="DeVivo2012"/&gt; In Sweden between 50 and 70% of all cases of SCI occur in people under 30, and 25% occur in those over 50.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=10}} While SCI rates are highest among people age 15–20,{{sfn|Pellock|Myer|2013|p=124}} fewer than 3% of SCIs occur in people under 15.{{sfn|Hammell|2013|p=274}}  Neonatal SCI occurs in one in 60,000 births, e.g. from breech births or injuries by forceps.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=388}} The difference in rates between the sexes diminishes in injuries at age 3 and younger; the same number of girls are injured as boys, or possibly more.&lt;ref name="SchottlerVogel2012"/&gt; Another cause of pediatric injury is  [[child abuse]] such as [[shaken baby syndrome]].{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=388}} For children, the most common cause of SCI (56%) is vehicle crashes.{{sfn|Augustine|2011|p=197}} High numbers of adolescent injuries are attributable in a large part to traffic accidents and sports injuries.&lt;ref name="Aghayan14"/&gt; For people over 65, falls are the most common cause of traumatic SCI.&lt;ref name="Sabapathy15"/&gt; The elderly and people with severe [[arthritis]] are at high risk for SCI because of defects in the spinal column.{{sfn|Augustine|2011|pp=197–98}} In nontraumatic SCI, the gender difference is smaller, the average age of occurrence is greater, and incomplete lesions are more common.&lt;ref name="Scivoletto14"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|right|The ancient Egyptian Edwin Smith Papyrus is the earliest known description of SCI.&lt;ref name="Lifshutz04"/&gt;]]
SCI has been known to be devastating for millennia; the ancient Egyptian [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] from 2500 BC, the first known description of the injury, says it is "not to be treated".&lt;ref name="Lifshutz04"/&gt;  Hindu texts dating back to 1800 BC also mention SCI and describe traction techniques to straighten the spine.&lt;ref name="Lifshutz04"/&gt;  The  Greek physician [[Hippocrates]], born in the fifth century BC, described SCI in his [[Hippocratic Corpus]] and invented traction devices to straighten dislocated vertebrae.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|pp=3–4}} But it was not until [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]], born 30 BC, noted that a cervical injury resulted in rapid death that the spinal cord itself was implicated in the condition.&lt;ref name="Lifshutz04"/&gt; In the second century AD the Greek physician Galen experimented on monkeys and reported that a horizontal cut through the spinal cord caused them to lose all sensation and motion below the level of the cut.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=5}} The seventh-century Greek physician [[Paul of Aegina]] described surgical techniques for treatment of broken vertebrae by removing bone fragments, as well as surgery to relieve pressure on the spine.&lt;ref name="Lifshutz04"/&gt;  Little medical progress was made during the [[Middle Ages|Middle Ages in Europe]]; it was not until the [[Renaissance]] that the spine and nerves were accurately depicted in human anatomy drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Andreas Vesalius]].{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=5}}

In 1762 a surgeon named [[Andre Louis]] removed a bullet from the lumbar spine of a patient, who regained motion in the legs.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=5}} In 1829 the surgeon [[Gilpin Smith]] performed a successful [[laminectomy]] that improved the patient's sensation.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=6}}  However, the idea that SCI was untreatable remained predominant until the early 20th century.{{sfn|Morganti-Kossmann|Raghupathi|Maas|2012|p=229}}  In 1934, the [[mortality rate]] in the first two years after injury was over 80%, mostly due to infections of the urinary tract and pressure sores.{{sfn|Fallah|Dance|Burns|2012|p=235}} It was not until the latter half of the century that breakthroughs in imaging, surgery, medical care, and rehabilitation medicine contributed to a substantial improvement in SCI care.{{sfn|Morganti-Kossmann|Raghupathi|Maas|2012|p=229}}  The relative incidence of incomplete compared to complete injuries has improved since the mid-20th century, due mainly to the emphasis on faster and better initial care and stabilization of spinal cord injury patients.&lt;ref name="Sekhon01"/&gt;  The creation of [[emergency medical services]] to professionally transport people to the hospital is given partial credit for an improvement in outcomes since the 1970s.{{sfn|Sabharwal|2013|p=35}}  Improvements in care have been accompanied by increased life expectancy of people with SCI; survival times have improved by about 2000% since 1940.{{sfn|Holtz|Levi|2010|p=7}} IN 2015/2016 23% of people in nine spinal injury centres in England had their discharge delayed because of disputes about who should pay for the equipment they needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revealed: Patients stranded in hospital for months as officials 'squabble' over equipment|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/service-design/revealed-patients-stranded-in-hospital-for-months-as-officials-squabble-over-equipment/7021420.article|accessdate=15 February 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research directions==
{{main|Spinal cord injury research}}

Scientists are investigating various avenues for treatment of spinal cord injury. Therapeutic research is focused on two main areas: [[neuroprotection]] and [[neuroregeneration]].&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt; The former seeks to prevent the harm that occurs from secondary injury in the minutes to weeks following the insult, and the latter aims to reconnect the broken circuits in the spinal cord to allow function to return.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt;  Neuroprotective drugs target secondary injury effects including inflammation, damage by [[free radical]]s, [[excitotoxicity]] (neuronal damage by excessive [[glutamate]] signaling), and [[apoptosis]] (cell suicide).&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt; Several potentially neuroprotective agents that target pathways like these are under investigation in human [[clinical trial]]s.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt;

[[File:Human bone marrow derived MSCs.jpg|thumb|left|Human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells seen under phase contrast microscope (63 x magnification)]]
[[Stem cell transplantation]] is an important avenue for SCI research: the goal is to replace lost spinal cord cells, allow reconnection in broken neural circuits by regrowing axons, and to create an environment in the tissues that is favorable to growth.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt; A key avenue of SCI research is research on [[stem cells]], which can [[cell differentiation|differentiate]] into other types of cells—including those lost after SCI.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt; Types of cells being researched for use in SCI include [[embryonic stem cell]]s, [[neural stem cell]]s, [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s,  [[olfactory ensheathing cell]]s, [[Schwann cell]]s, activated [[macrophage]]s, and [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s.&lt;ref name="Silva14"/&gt; Hundreds of [[stem cell research|stem cell studies]] have been done in humans, with promising but inconclusive results.&lt;ref name="Aghayan14"/&gt;  An ongoing [[Phases of clinical research|Phase 2]] trial in 2016 presented data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asteriasbiotherapeutics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wirth-ISCoS-14SEP2016-talk-FINAL.pdf|title=Initial Clinical Trials of hESC-Derived Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells in Subacute Spinal Cord Injury|last=Wirth|first=Edward|date=September 14, 2016|website=ISCoS Meeting presentation|publisher=Asterias Biotherapeutics|access-date=September 14, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921035451/http://asteriasbiotherapeutics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wirth-ISCoS-14SEP2016-talk-FINAL.pdf|archivedate=September 21, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that after 90 days, 2 out of 4 subjects had already improved two motor levels and had thus already achieved its [[Clinical endpoint|endpoint]] of 2/5 patients improving two levels within 6–12 months.  Six-month data is expected in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asteriasbiotherapeutics.com/asterias-biotherapeutics-announces-positive-efficacy-data-in-patients-with-complete-cervical-spinal-cord-injuries-treated-with-ast-opc1/|title=Asterias Biotherapeutics Announces Positive Efficacy Data in Patients with Complete Cervical Spinal Cord Injuries Treated with AST-OPC1|website=asteriasbiotherapeutics.com|access-date=2016-09-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920155522/http://asteriasbiotherapeutics.com/asterias-biotherapeutics-announces-positive-efficacy-data-in-patients-with-complete-cervical-spinal-cord-injuries-treated-with-ast-opc1|archivedate=2016-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of approach is tissue engineering, using [[biomaterial]]s to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt; [[Biomaterials]] being investigated include natural substances such as [[collagen]] or [[agarose]] and synthetic ones like [[polymer]]s and [[nitrocellulose]].&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt; They fall into two categories: [[hydrogel]]s and [[nanofiber]]s.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt; These materials can also be used as a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"/&gt;

One avenue being explored to allow paralyzed people to walk and to aid in rehabilitation of those with some walking ability is the use of wearable [[powered exoskeleton|powered robotic exoskeletons]].&lt;ref name="Louie15"/&gt; The devices, which have motorized joints, are put on over the legs and supply a source of power to move and walk.&lt;ref name="Louie15"/&gt;  Several such devices are already available for sale, but investigation is still underway as to how they can be made more useful.&lt;ref name="Louie15"/&gt;

Preliminary studies of [[Spinal cord stimulator|epidural spinal cord stimulators]] for motor complete injuries have demonstrated some improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=W|title=Electrical stimulation and motor recovery.|journal=Cell transplantation|date=2015|volume=24|issue=3|pages=429–46|doi=10.3727/096368915X686904|pmid=25646771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12000">The '''Stateville Penitentiary malaria study''' was a controlled study of the effects of [[malaria]] on the prisoners of [[Stateville Correctional Center|Stateville Penitentiary]] near [[Joliet, Illinois]] in the 1940s. The study was conducted by the Department of Medicine at the [[University of Chicago]] in conjunction with the [[United States Army]] and the State Department. The study is notable for its impacts on the [[Doctors' Trial|Nuremberg Medical Trial]] and subsequent [[medical experimentation on prisoners]].

==Historical context==

=== Demand for malaria research ===

The circumstances of [[World War II]] resulted in an urgent need for the development of new malaria treatments. First, U.S. soldiers were deployed to areas of the Pacific with extremely high rates of malaria infection.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Franklin G.|date=2013-01-01|title=The Stateville penitentiary malaria experiments: a case study in retrospective ethical assessment|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=56|issue=4|pages=548–567|doi=10.1353/pbm.2013.0035|issn=1529-8795|pmid=24769747}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Army estimated millions of man-hours lost due to malaria throughout the war; thus it was critical important to mitigate the effects of the disease in the interest of the military. Second, the conventional treatment for malaria, [[quinine]], was largely unavailable throughout the war. Japanese control of the Philippines and Indonesia cut off the supply of quinine to the United States, adding to the need for alternate treatments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The new risks of malaria posed by World War II called for experimentation at an unprecedented scale, with a particular focus on human subjects.

=== Prison as a research center ===

The prison offered an environment conducive to controlled scientific experimentation on human subjects. The malaria experiments at Stateville Penitentiary are noteworthy for their utilization of this prison environment across all aspects of the experiments. A prison population allowed for researchers to limit extraneous variables across the subjects. Participants of the studies were exclusively white men, of similar age and health, which was the primary demographic of Stateville Penitentiary. The population of prisoners was also inherently homogenous in terms of behavior, due to the restrictions imposed by the maximum-security prison.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alving|first=A.

Offers of parole reevaluation, as well as financial incentives (typically $25–$100 for an experimental trial), yielded an exceptionally high availability of subjects willing to participate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comfort|first=Nathaniel|date=2009-09-01|title=The prisoner as model organism: malaria research at Stateville Penitentiary|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|volume=40|issue=3|pages=190–203|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2009.06.007|issn=1879-2499|pmc=2789481|pmid=19720327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaria Research Project==
In 1944, the U.S. Committee on Medical Research, formed a contract with the University of Chicago to test novel malaria treatments at the Stateville Penitentiary. Alf Alving, a nephrologist from the University of Chicago, directed the research, and oversaw the formation of a clinical research division of the prison hospital. Alving worked with Ray Dern and Ernest Beutler, two physicians also from the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lichtman|first=M. A.|date=2001-04-01|title=Introduction of Ernest Beutler, MD|journal=Leukemia|volume=15|issue=4|pages=656–657|issn=0887-6924|pmid=11368370|doi=10.1038/sj.leu.2402054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malaria Research Project was primarily conducted on a floor of the prison hospital in the Stateville Penitentiary. The study aimed to understand the effect of various antimalarial drugs on relapses of malaria, primarily from the [[8-aminoquinoline]] group of compounds. The study marked the first human test of the [[antimalarial drug]] [[primaquine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/KOREA/recad2/ch5-2.htm Clinical Treatment of Malaria, Alf S. Alving, M.D.]&lt;/ref&gt; For the experiment, doctors from the University of Chicago bred [[Anopheles quadrimaculatus]] [[mosquito]]es. The mosquitoes were infected with a [[plasmodium vivax]] malaria strain that was isolated from a military patient.

=== Experiments performed ===

The study considered the Chesson strain of ''P. vivax'', sourced from a military patient infected in the Pacific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''P. vivax'', the predominant form of malaria in the Pacific, is associated with milder symptoms and unlike ''P. falciparum'', it typically is not deadly. This strain was known for its resistance to the standard treatment of quinine, with frequent occurrences of relapse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Subjects at the prison maintained the strain via blood inoculations. For the both control and test subjects, a constant number of mosquito bites from infected insects were administered; then, researchers dissected the mosquitoes to determine the intensity of the resultant infection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The researchers tested patient responses to various potential treatments. The majority of these treatments had not yet been evaluated on humans, and their toxicity and potency was thus unknown. Most were 8-aminoquinoline compounds, analogs of pamaquine, an existing alternative to quinine that was unfavorable due to its higher toxicity. The researchers tested a wide range of doses, including some exceptionally high doses of treatments known to be toxic. The purpose of this was to establish a maximum margin of safety, and to observe the manifestation of side effects. Thus, adverse side effects were intentionally caused to subjects, to demonstrate the possible worst-case reaction to extremely high-potency treatments. In one case, a subject died several days after he was injected with a high dosage of SN-8233, a potential treatment considered in the study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Prisoner roles ===

The prison of the environment of the study created a unique and complex social dynamic, with prisoners involved in many aspects of the study, not only as subjects. A well-known participant of the study was [[Nathan Leopold]], who (together with [[Richard Loeb]], who was killed after being sentenced) kidnapped and murdered a teenager, while they were students at the University of Chicago. Serving his sentence at Stateville Penitentiary, Leopold took interest in the malaria studies, first enrolling as a subject. Throughout the experiment he assumed many other roles, recruiting subjects, observing experiments, serving as an X-ray technician, and dissecting mosquitoes. As a technician, he was assigned roles critical to the success of the research, and the flow of knowledge, communication and resources critically depended on him at times. These accounts of his participation largely come from his autobiography ''Life Plus 99 Years'', the factual accuracy of which is verified through reputable accounts of the study.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Leopold’s range of roles was exceptional, numerous other prisoners assumed similar responsibilities in the experiments.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/69410176|title=Nazi medicine and the Nuremberg Trials : from medical war crimes to informed consent|last=Weindling|first=Paul|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780230506053|location=|pages=|oclc=69410176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy of the study ==
The experiments were widely publicized, though in a controlled manner. In 1944, ''Life Magazine'' documented the experiments with a photo series. Accounts of prisoner subjects were included, though these were allegedly scripted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While a series of research publications came out of the Stateville Penitentiary experiments, the results had minimal long-term impact on malaria treatment methods. The main legacy of the study is instead the ethical contention raised by prisoner experimentation, manifesting in the trials of Nazi Germany for its experiments on human subjects.

=== Nuremberg medical trial ===

In the 1946 Nuremberg trials in Germany, the [[International Military Tribunal]] prosecuted leaders of former [[Nazi Germany]] for war crimes and events of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], in particular, experimentation on human subjects. The Stateville malaria experiments were used as a critical point of defense for the Nazis, who argued similarities between their prisoner experimentation and the United States’ at Stateville Penitentiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shuster|first=E.|date=1997-11-13|title=Fifty years later: the significance of the Nuremberg Code|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=337|issue=20|pages=1436–1440|doi=10.1056/NEJM199711133372006|issn=0028-4793|pmid=9358142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ivy, a physician from Chicago, testified as an expert witness in the trials. He was asked to differentiate Nazi malaria experiments at the Dachau concentration camp and the Stateville Penitentiary malaria experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/468014255|title=Experimentation with human beings : the authority of the investigator, subject, professions, and state in the human experimentation process|last=Morgan.|first=Capron, Alexander|last2=Swift.|first2=Glass, Eleanor|date=1973-01-01|publisher=Russell Sage foundation|isbn=9780871544384|oclc=468014255}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were key distinctions, such as a higher rate of subject fatalities and lack of voluntary consent in the Nazi experiments. However, the procedures, motives and premise of the studies were arguably similar. The U.S. supported Ivy’s claims of fundamental differences, and publicized them as a justification for continuing the Stateville experiments. The international [[Nuremberg Code]] of human experimentation ethics, which resulted from the trials, contained clauses directly violated by the Stateville experiments. The U.S. never formally ratified the code, however, calling into question the ethics of prison experimentation and the Stateville Penitentiary malaria experiments in particular.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Effect on prisoner experimentation===
Public opposition to  medical experimentation on prisoners was scant during the war. The [[Green report|Green Report]] was published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' and opened the door for legal, ethical experimentation on prisoners in the United States. Until later in the Century, the medical community in the United States largely regarded the Nuremberg Code to be applicable to war criminals and not to the practices of U.S. researchers.

'''''Tapestries of Hope''''' is a feature-length [[documentary]] that exposes the [[virgin cleansing myth]] that if a man rapes a virgin he will be cured of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. The film focuses on the work human rights activist [[Betty Makoni]] has done to protect and re-empower girls who have been victimized through sexual abuse. ''Tapestries of Hope'' aims to bring awareness to the widespread abuse of women and girls as well as the efforts of the Girl Child Network and its founder, Betty Makoni.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/21/tapestries-of-hope-michealene-risley-documents-betty-makonis-fight-against-rape-in-zimbabwe_n_721616.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i8ee6fde4efa3c4bfc6358b982ec06d12&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film is directed by [[Michealene Cristini Risley]], written by Susan Black and Michealene Cristini Risley, and produced by Michealene Cristini Risley, Susan Black, Christopher Bankston, [[Anand Chandrasekaran]], and [[Ray Arthur Wang]]. "Tapestries of Hope" was theatrically released September 28, 2010 in over 100 theaters across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagoreader.com/TheBlog/archives/2010/09/27/tapestries-of-hope&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://womenandhollywood.com/2010/09/27/tapestries-of-hope-in-theatres-for-one-night-only/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Director Michealene Cristini Risley traveled to Zimbabwe to explore the rape and AIDS crisis in the country.  She had previously befriended Betty Makoni, a born and raised Zimbabwean, and got to know about Makoni's organization, The Girl Child Network, which aims to empower the girls in Zimbabwe to stand up for their rights and also to provide a network as protection for these girls.

The stories were told by the girls of Zimbabwe and Makoni was the main cast for this film. Throughout the film, it was shown how Makoni has helped the girls in finding their voice and speaks out on the atrocities they have experienced. Risley and her crew were arrested and incarcerated shortly after shooting 22 hours of footage in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;http://savehope.blogspot.com/2007/08/this-past-week.html&lt;/ref&gt; The film was also seized by the Zimbabwean Intelligence Office at one time. However, the team managed to retrieve the footage and left Zimbabwe shortly after.

(Betty Makoni has since been named one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/06/04/cnnheroes.betty.makoni/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;)

Based in Los Angeles, the company serves over 1,900 hospitals and outpatient practices globally, though most are located in the US. As of 2012, Zynx Health products and services impact over 50% of hospital discharges in the US.&lt;ref&gt;The Company, Zynx Health {{cite web|url=http://www.zynxhealth.com/about/company.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719163951/http://www.zynxhealth.com/About/Company.aspx |archivedate=July 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the company’s impact on care delivery proportional to its size, ''Healthcare Informatics'' named it one of the “Most Interesting Vendors” in 2011 and included it on its HCI 100 list.&lt;ref&gt;“HCI 100, Most Interesting Vendors, Rethinking Vendor Relationships, MU and Public Health.” (June 2011).

''Modern Healthcare''. http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20111019/INFO/310199973#&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the company’s Chief Technology Officer, Mark Long, was awarded CIO of the Year by the ''Los Angeles Business Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Business Journal'', 06/18/2012 Digital Edition http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?referral=other&amp;pnum=36&amp;refresh=w15H02PpcY04&amp;EID=0d56d95d-9b41-4d50-bbd2-0a6b34f02c5f&amp;skip=&amp;p=36&lt;/ref&gt; The company is generally perceived to be the first mover in evidence-based clinical decision support solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, D. (June 27, 2008). “Information Solutions for the Clinical Workflow”. Outsell, Inc. http://www.outsellinc.com/store/products/739?refid=prz&lt;/ref&gt;

Zynx Health was formed in 1996 by thought leaders in evidence-based healthcare and healthcare quality improvement. As of 2004 it is a subsidiary of [[Hearst Corporation]].

== History ==
In 1996 a group of clinicians at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] founded Zynx Health as a wholly owned subsidiary of the hospital. An earlier pilot project had demonstrated the value of evidence-based guidelines in hospitals, suggesting a clear opportunity to improve patient care. The company’s first significant advancements were in 2002 and 2003, when healthcare providers realized the merit in outsourcing clinical decision support.&lt;ref&gt;Hagland, Mark. (June 2011). “Showing Them the Evidence.” ''Healthcare Informatics''. http://www.healthcare-informatics.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=19215ECF63D44080B3B5647ADD59B3F5{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2002, Zynx Health was acquired by [[Cerner]]. Less than two years later the company was acquired by Hearst Corporation. In 2004, Zynx Health moved its offices from its original Beverly Hills, CA, location to its current location in Los Angeles, CA.

On March 30, 2017, Zynx Health partnered with Healthwise, a health education, technology, and services company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/sidekick-health-teams-jenny-craig-and-six-more-digital-health-deals|title=Sidekick Health teams up with Jenny Craig and six more digital health deals|date=2017-03-30|work=MobiHealthNews|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
