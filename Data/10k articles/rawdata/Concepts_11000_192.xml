{{Mindfulness}}
'''Acceptance and commitment therapy''' ('''ACT''', typically pronounced as the word "act") is a form of counseling and a branch of [[clinical behavior analysis]].&lt;ref name="Plumb"&gt;{{cite journal | title=In Search of Meaning: Values in Modern Clinical Behavior Analysis |author1=Jennifer C Plumb |author2=Ian Stewart |author3=Galway JoAnne Dahl |author4=Tobias Lundgren | journal=Behav Anal. |date=Spring 2009 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=85–103 | pmc=2686995 | pmid=22478515 | doi=10.1007/bf03392177}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[empirical]]ly-based [[psychological]] [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] that uses [[acceptance]] and [[mindfulness]] strategies mixed in different ways&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hayes |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven C. Hayes |title=Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT) |publisher=ContextualPsychology.org |url= http://www.contextualpsychology.org/act}}&lt;/ref&gt; with commitment and behavior-change strategies, to increase [[psychological flexibility]]. The approach was originally called ''comprehensive distancing''.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zettle |first1=Robert D. |year=2005 |title=The Evolution of a Contextual Approach to Therapy: From Comprehensive Distancing to ACT |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=77–89 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ844315&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ844315}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven C. Hayes]] developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in 1982 in order to create a mixed approach which integrates both cognitive and behavioral therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive and Behavioral Theories in Clinical Practice|last=Freeman|first=Arthur|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60623-342-9|location=Newyork, NY|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of protocols for ACT, depending on the target behavior or setting. For example, in behavioral health areas a [[Brief psychotherapy|brief]] version of ACT is called ''focused acceptance and commitment therapy'' (FACT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Focused Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (FACT): Mastering The Basics |url=https://contextualscience.org/wc12_strosahl_robinson_gustavsson |publisher=[[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] |website=contextualscience.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407201937/https://contextualscience.org/wc12_strosahl_robinson_gustavsson |archivedate=2016-04-07 |accessdate=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of ACT is not elimination of difficult feelings; rather, it is to be present with what life brings us and to "move toward valued behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hayes, Steven C. |author2=Strosahl, Kirk D. |author3=Wilson, Kelly G.|title=Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: The Process and Practice of Mindful Change|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|year=2012|isbn=978-1-60918-962-4|edition=2|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance and commitment therapy invites people to open up to unpleasant feelings, and learn not to overreact to them, and not avoid situations where they are invoked. Its therapeutic effect is a positive spiral where feeling better leads to a better understanding of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shpancer |first= Noam |date= September 8, 2010 |title= Emotional Acceptance: Why Feeling Bad is Good |journal=Psychology Today |URL= http://m.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-therapy/201009/emotional-acceptance-why-feeling-bad-is-good}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ACT, 'truth' is measured through the concept of 'workability', or what works to take another step toward what matters (e.g. values, meaning).

==Technique==
===Basics===
ACT is developed within a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosophy called [[functional contextualism]]. ACT is based on [[relational frame theory]] (RFT), a comprehensive theory of language and cognition that is an offshoot of [[behavior analysis]]. Both ACT and RFT are based on [[B. F. Skinner|B. F. Skinner's]] philosophy of [[Radical behaviorism|Radical Behaviorism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohlenberg|first=Robert|last2=Hayes|first2=Steven|last3=Tsai|first3=Mavis|year=1993|title=Radical Behavioral Psychotherapy: Two Contemporary Examples|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.542.4819&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=13|pages=579–592|via=|doi=10.1016/0272-7358(93)90047-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACT differs from traditional [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) in that rather than trying to teach people to better control their thoughts, feelings, sensations, memories and other private events, ACT teaches them to "just notice," accept, and embrace their private events, especially previously unwanted ones. ACT helps the individual get in contact with a [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] sense of self known as "self-as-context"—the you who is always there observing and experiencing and yet distinct from one's thoughts, feelings, sensations, and memories. ACT aims to help the individual clarify their personal values and to take action on them, bringing more vitality and meaning to their life in the process, increasing their [[psychological flexibility]].&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;

While Western psychology has typically operated under the "healthy normality" assumption which states that by their nature, humans are psychologically healthy, ACT assumes, rather, that psychological processes of a normal human mind are often destructive.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; The core conception of ACT is that psychological suffering is usually caused by [[experiential avoidance]], cognitive entanglement, and resulting psychological rigidity that leads to a failure to take needed behavioral steps in accord with core values. As a simple way to summarize the model, ACT views the core of many problems to be due to the concepts represented in the acronym, '''FEAR''':{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}[[File:Cards used as a therapeutic activity in ACT treatment.jpg|thumb|Cards used as a therapeutic activity in ACT treatment.]]
* '''F'''usion with your thoughts
* '''E'''valuation of experience
* '''A'''voidance of your experience
* '''R'''eason-giving for your behavior

And the healthy alternative is to '''ACT''':
* '''A'''ccept your reactions and be present
* '''C'''hoose a valued direction
* '''T'''ake action

===Core principles===
ACT commonly employs six core principles to help clients develop [[psychological flexibility]]:&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Russ |date=August 2006 |title=Embracing your demons: an overview of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy |journal=Psychotherapy in Australia |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=2–8 |url=http://actmindfully.com.au/upimages/Dr_Russ_Harris_-_A_Non-technical_Overview_of_ACT.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cognitive defusion: Learning methods to reduce the tendency to [[Reification (fallacy)|reify]] thoughts, images, emotions, and memories.
# Acceptance: Allowing unwanted private experiences (thoughts, feelings and urges) to come and go without struggling with them.
# Contact with the present moment: Awareness of the here and now, experienced with openness, interest, and receptiveness. (e.g., mindfulness)
# The observing self: Accessing a transcendent sense of self, a continuity of consciousness which is unchanging.
# Values: Discovering what is most important to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hank |last1=Robb |year=2007 |title=Values as Leading Principles in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=118–23 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ801192&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ801192 |doi=10.1037/h0100170}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Committed action: Setting goals according to values and carrying them out responsibly, in the service of a meaningful life.

Correlational evidence has found that absence of psychological flexibility predicts many forms of psychopathology. A 2005 [[meta-analysis]] showed that the six ACT principles, on average, account for 16–29% of the variance in psychopathology (general mental health, depression, anxiety) at baseline, depending on the measure, using correlational methods.&lt;ref name=hayes06 /&gt;{{rp|12–13}} A 2012 meta-analysis of 68 laboratory-based studies on ACT components has also provided support for the link between psychological flexibility concepts and specific components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.beth.2012.05.003 |title=The Impact of Treatment Components Suggested by the Psychological Flexibility Model: A Meta-Analysis of Laboratory-Based Component Studies |year=2012 |last1=Levin |first1=Michael E. |last2=Hildebrandt |first2=Mikaela J. |last3=Lillis |first3=Jason |last4=Hayes |first4=Steven C. |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=741–56 |pmid=23046777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A 2008 meta-analysis concluded that the evidence was still too limited for ACT to be considered a supported treatment, and raised methodological concerns about the research base.&lt;ref name="Ost2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2007.12.005 |title=Efficacy of the third wave of behavioral therapies: A systematic review and meta-analysis |year=2008 |last=Öst |first=Lars-Göran |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=296–321 |pmid=18258216}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 meta-analysis found that ACT was more effective than placebo and "treatment as usual" for most problems (with the exception of anxiety and depression), but not more effective than CBT and other traditional therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Powers MB, Zum Vörde Sive Vörding MB, Emmelkamp PM | year = 2009 | title = Acceptance and commitment therapy: A meta-analytic review. | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 78 | pages = 73–80 | doi=10.1159/000190790}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 meta-analysis was more positive and reported that ACT outperformed CBT, except for treating depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruiz, F. J. | year = 2012 | title = Acceptance and commitment therapy versus traditional cognitive behavioral therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of current empirical evidence | journal = International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 333–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 review found that ACT was better than placebo and typical treatment for [[anxiety disorders]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="davis2015"/&gt; Its effectiveness was similar to traditional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).&lt;ref name="davis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A-Tjak|first1=JG|last2=Davis|first2=ML|last3=Morina|first3=N|last4=Powers|first4=MB|last5=Smits|first5=JA|last6=Emmelkamp|first6=PM|title=A meta-analysis of the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for clinically relevant mental and physical health problems.|journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics|date=2015|volume=84|issue=1|pages=30–6|pmid=25547522|doi=10.1159/000365764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggested that the CBT comparison of the previous 2012 meta-analysis may have been compromised by the inclusion of [[Randomized controlled trial|nonrandomized trials]] with small sample sizes. They also noted that research methodologies had improved since the studies described in the 2008 meta-analysis.&lt;ref name="davis2015" /&gt;

The number of [[randomized clinical trial]]s and controlled time series evaluating ACT for a variety of problems is growing. In 2006, only about 30 such studies were known,&lt;ref name=hayes06&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2005.06.006 |title=Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: Model, processes and outcomes |year=2006 |last1=Hayes |first1=Steven C. |last2=Luoma |first2=Jason B. |last3=Bond |first3=Frank W. |last4=Masuda |first4=Akihiko |last5=Lillis |first5=Jason |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=44 |pages=1–25 |pmid=16300724 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2011 the number had approximately doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruiz |first=F. J. |year=2010 |title=A review of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) empirical evidence: Correlational, experimental psychopathology, component and outcome studies |journal=International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=125–62 |url=http://www.ijpsy.com/volumen10/num1/256.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website of the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] states that there were 171 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ACT published as of December 2016,&lt;ref name="ACBS evidence"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hayes |first=Steven C. |authorlink=Steven C. Hayes |url=https://contextualscience.org/state_of_the_act_evidence |title=State of the ACT Evidence |website=contextualscience.org |publisher=[[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] |accessdate=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 20 meta-analyses and 45 mediational studies of the ACT literature as of Spring 2016.&lt;ref name="ACBS evidence"/&gt; Most studies of ACT so far have been conducted on adults and therefore the knowledge of its effectiveness when applied to children and adolescents is limited.

==Similarities==
ACT, [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[functional analytic psychotherapy]] (FAP), [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT) and other acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches are commonly grouped under the name "the third wave of cognitive behavior therapy".&lt;ref name="Ost2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Christopher R. |last=Martell |author2=Michael E. Addis|author3=Neil S. Jacobson |year=2001 |title=Depression in Context: Strategies for Guided Action |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=0-393-70350-9 |location=New York |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave, [[behaviour therapy]], commenced in the 1920s based on Pavlov's [[Classical conditioning|classical (respondent) conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]] that was correlated to reinforcing consequences. The second wave emerged in the 1970s and included cognition in the form of irrational beliefs, dysfunctional attitudes or depressogenic attributions.&lt;ref name="Leahy, R. L. 2004"&gt;Leahy, R. L. (2004). Contemporary cognitive therapy: Theory, research, and practice. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s empirical limitations and philosophical misgivings of the second wave gave rise to Steven Hayes' ACT theory which modified the focus of abnormal behaviour away from the content or form towards the context in which it occurs.&lt;ref name="Leahy, R. L. 2004"/&gt; ACT research has suggested that many of the [[Defence mechanisms|emotional defenses]] individuals use with conviction to try to solve their problems actually entangle humans into greater suffering. Rigid ideas about themselves, lack of focus on what is important in their life and struggling to change sensations, feelings or thoughts that are troublesome only serve to create greater distress.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S. C., &amp; Smith, S. (2005). Get Out of Your Mind and into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Santa Rosa, CA: New Harbinger Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven C. Hayes]] described this group in his [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies|ABCT]] President Address as follows:

{{quote|Grounded in an empirical, principle-focused approach, the third wave of behavioral and cognitive therapy is particularly sensitive to the context and functions of psychological phenomena, not just their form, and thus tends to emphasize contextual and experiential change strategies in addition to more direct and didactic ones. These treatments tend to seek the construction of broad, flexible and effective repertoires over an eliminative approach to narrowly defined problems, and to emphasize the relevance of the issues they examine for clinicians as well as clients. The third wave reformulates and synthesizes previous generations of behavioral and cognitive therapy and carries them forward into questions, issues, and domains previously addressed primarily by other traditions, in hopes of improving both understanding and outcomes.}}

ACT has also been adapted to create a non-therapy version of the same processes called ''Acceptance and Commitment Training''. This training process, oriented towards the development of mindfulness, acceptance, and valued skills in non-clinical settings such as businesses or schools, has also been investigated in a handful of research studies with good preliminary results.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Bond, F.W.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Austin, J. (2007). Acceptance And Mindfulness at Work: Applying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy And Relational Frame Theory to Organizational Behavior Management. Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is somewhat similar to the awareness–management movement in business training programs, where [[mindfulness]] and [[cognitive-shifting]] techniques are employed.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The emphasis of ACT on ongoing present moment [[awareness]], valued directions and committed action is similar to other psycho-therapeutic approaches that, unlike ACT, are not as focused on outcome research or consciously linked to a basic behavioral science program, including approaches such as [[Gestalt therapy]], [[Morita therapy]] and Voice Dialogue, [[Internal Family Systems Model|IFS]] and others.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Wilson, Hayes &amp; Byrd explore at length the compatibilities between ACT and the [[12-step]] treatment of addictions and argue that, unlike most other psychotherapies, both approaches can be implicitly or explicitly integrated due to their broad commonalities. Both approaches endorse acceptance as an alternative to unproductive control. ACT emphasizes the hopelessness of relying on ineffectual strategies to control private experience, similarly the 12-step approach emphasizes the acceptance of powerlessness over addiction. Both approaches encourage a broad life-reorientation, rather than a narrow focus on the elimination of substance use, and both place great value on the long-term project of building of a meaningful life aligned with the clients' values. ACT and 12-step both encourage the pragmatic utility of cultivating a transcendent sense of self ([[higher power]]) within an unconventional, individualized spirituality. Finally they both openly accept the paradox that acceptance is a necessary condition for change and both encourage a playful awareness of the limitations of human thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exploring Compatibilities Between Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and 12-Step Treatment for Substance Abuse|doi=10.1023/A:1007835106007 |year=2000 |last1=Wilson |first1=Kelly G. |last2=Hayes |first2=Steven C. |last3=Byrd |first3=Michelle R. |journal=Journal of Rational-Emotive and Cognitive-Behavior Therapy |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=209–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
Some published empirical studies in clinical psychology have argued that ACT is not different from other interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.09.003 |title=Acceptance and mindfulness-based therapy: New wave or old hat? |year=2008 |last1=Hofmann |first1=Stefan G. |last2=Asmundson |first2=Gordon J.G. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=28 |pages=1–16 |pmid=17904260 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.2008.00137.x |title=Acceptance and commitment therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders: Different treatments, similar mechanisms? |year=2008 |last1=Arch |first1=Joanna J. |last2=Craske |first2=Michelle G. |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=263–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stefan Hofmann]] argued that ACT is similar to the much older [[Morita therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofmann |first=Stefan G. |date=December 2008 |title=Acceptance and commitment therapy: new wave or Morita therapy? |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=280–285 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.2008.00138.x |quote=the criticism offered by ACT against CBT is based on a misrepresentation of the empirical evidence. Moreover, the strategies of ACT are not specific to the theory and philosophy underlying ACT. There are considerable similarities between ACT and Eastern holistic approaches, such as Morita therapy, which was developed 80 years ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis by Öst in 2008 concluded that ACT did not yet qualify as an "empirically supported treatment", that the research methodology for ACT was less stringent than cognitive behavioral therapy, and that the mean effect size was moderate.&lt;ref name="Ost2008"/&gt; Supporters of ACT have challenged those conclusions by showing that the quality difference in Öst's review was accounted for by the larger number of funded trials in the CBT comparison group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2009.07.020 |title=Öst's (2008) methodological comparison of clinical trials of acceptance and commitment therapy versus cognitive behavior therapy: Matching apples with oranges? |year=2009 |last1=Gaudiano |first1=Brandon A. |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=47 |issue=12 |pages=1066–70 |pmid=19679300 |pmc=2786237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several concerns, both theoretical and empirical, have arisen in response to the ascendancy of ACT. One major theoretical concern is that the primary authors of ACT and of the corresponding theories of human behavior, relational frame theory (RFT) and functional contextualism (FC), recommend their approach as the proverbial holy grail of psychological therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Routier |first=Cédric P. |date=2007 |title=Relational frame theory (RFT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT): Emperor's tailors or knights of the holy grail? |journal=Acta Comportamentalia |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=45–69 |url=http://pepsic.bvsalud.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0188-81452007000400004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[James C. Coyne]], in a discussion of "disappointments and embarrassments in the branding of psychotherapies as evidence supported", said: "Whether or not ACT is more efficacious than other therapies, as its proponents sometimes claim, or whether it is efficacious for psychosis, is debatable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coyne |first=James C. |authorlink=James C.

Psychologist Jonathan W. Kanter said that Hayes and colleagues "argue that empirical clinical psychology is hampered in its efforts to alleviate human suffering and present ''contextual behavioral science'' (CBS) to address the basic philosophical, theoretical and methodological shortcomings of the field. CBS represents a host of good ideas but at times the promise of CBS is obscured by excessive promotion of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and demotion of earlier cognitive and behavior change techniques in the absence of clear logic and empirical support."&lt;ref name="Kanter"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kanter |first=Jonathan W. |date=June 2013 |title=The vision of a progressive clinical science to guide clinical practice |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=228–233 |doi=10.1016/j.beth.2010.07.006 |pmid=23611073 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Kanter2/publication/236275068_The_vision_of_a_progressive_clinical_science_to_guide_clinical_practice/links/00b7d5214dc7c2fe16000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Kanter concluded that "the ideas of CBS, RFT, and ACT deserve serious consideration by the mainstream community and have great potential to shape a truly progressive clinical science to guide clinical practice."&lt;ref name="Kanter"/&gt;

ACT currently appears to be about as effective as standard CBT, with some meta-analyses showing small differences in favor of ACT and others not. For example, a meta-analysis published by Francisco Ruiz in 2012 looked at 16 studies comparing ACT to standard CBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruiz Jiménez |first=Francisco José |date=2012 |title=Acceptance and commitment therapy versus traditional cognitive behavioral therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of current empirical evidence |journal=International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=333–358 |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4019738}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACT failed to separate from CBT on effect sizes for depression, anxiety or quality of life. The author did find separation between ACT and CBT on the "primary outcome"&amp;nbsp;– a heterogeneous class of 14 separate outcome measures that were aggregated into the effect size analysis. This analysis however is limited by the highly heterogeneous nature of the outcome variables used in the analysis, which has the tendency to increase the number needed to treat (NNT) to replicate the effect size reported. More limited measures, such as depression, anxiety and quality of life decrease the NNT, making the analysis more clinically relevant, and on these measures ACT did not outperform CBT.

A 2013 paper comparing ACT to [[cognitive therapy]] (CT) concluded that "like CT, ACT cannot yet make strong claims that its unique and theory-driven intervention components are active ingredients in its effects."&lt;ref name="HerbertForman2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herbert |first1=James D. |last2=Forman |first2=Evan M. |date=June 2013 |title=Caution: the differences between CT and ACT may be larger (and smaller) than they appear |journal=[[Behavior Therapy (journal)|Behavior Therapy]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=218–223 |doi=10.1016/j.beth.2009.09.005 |pmid=23611071}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the paper suggested that many of the assumptions of ACT and CT "are pre-analytical, and cannot be directly pitted against one another in experimental tests."&lt;ref name="HerbertForman2013"/&gt;

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] is committed to research and development in the area of ACT, RFT, and contextual behavioral science more generally. As of 2017 it had over 7,600 members worldwide, about half outside of the United States. It holds annual "world conference" meetings: The 16th will be held in Montreal, in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contextualscience.org/conferences|title=Conferences|publisher=[[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International (ABAI) has a special interest group for practitioner issues, behavioral counseling, and clinical behavior analysis ABA:I.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} ABAI has larger special interest groups for [[autism]] and [[behavioral medicine]]. ABAI serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twyman |first1=J.S. |year=2007 |title=A new era of science and practice in behavior analysis |journal=Association for Behavior Analysis International: Newsletter |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hassert |first1=Derrick L. |last2=Kelly |first2=Amanda N. |last3=Pritchard |first3=Joshua K. |last4=Cautilli |first4=Joseph D. |title=The Licensing of Behavior Analysts: Protecting the Profession and the Public |journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=8–19 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ829086&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ829086 |doi=10.1037/h0100415 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABAI sponsors three conferences/year—one multi-track in the U.S., one specific to Autism and one international.

The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (ABCT) also has an interest group in [[behavior analysis]], which focuses on clinical behavior analysis. ACT work is commonly presented at ABCT and other mainstream CBT organizations.

The [[British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies]] (BABCP) has a large special interest group in ACT, with over 1,200 members.

Doctoral-level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to the [[American Psychological Association]]'s (APA) Division 25—[[Behavior analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Behavior Analysis Division |url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-25/about/ |website=apadivisions.org |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACT has been called a "commonly used treatment with empirical support" within the APA-recognized specialty of behavioral and cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behavioral and Cognitive Psychology Public Description |url=https://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/behav.aspx |website=apa.org |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century a number of peace walks were organized involving the citizens of the United States and the [[USSR]].  These peace walks, or peace marches, represented [[citizen diplomacy]] initiatives promoting peace and [[Nuclear disarmament]] through direct person-to-person interaction among the citizens of the two [[Cold War]] opponent states.

==1960–1961 San Francisco to Moscow Walk==

A [[peace walk]] from San Francisco, US, to Moscow, USSR, took place from December 1960 to October 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers of the European Organiser of the American-European Peace March from San Francisco to Moscow|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/features/peacemarch.html|publisher=The Archives Hub|accessdate=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929001617/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/features/peacemarch.html|archive-date=2011-09-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The walk was organized by [[Committee for NonViolent Action|Committee for Nonviolent Action]] and promoted nonviolence and unilateral nuclear disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Non-Violent Action|url=http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Committee_for_Non-Violent_Action|publisher=dKosopedia|accessdate=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206103631/http://dkosopedia.com/wiki/Committee_for_Non-Violent_Action|archive-date=2010-02-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Nonviolent Action Records, 1958–1968 (DG 017)|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/DG001-025/dg017/dg017cnvamain.htm|work=Swarthmore College Peace Collection|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=2 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110414032457/http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/DG001-025/dg017/dg017cnvamain.htm| archivedate= 14 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1988 From Washington D.C. to Santa Monica and to the final events in SAN FRANCISCO CA USA Walk==

In June–July 1988, The American Soviet Peace Walk (ASPW) sponsored by the International Peace Walk, Inc. (IPW), organized and sponsored 230 Soviets citizens and 200 Americans from all walks of life. They started their travels from Washington, D.C. went on to Santa Monica, CA and continued on to San Francisco, to experience the America way of life.                                                                                                                                                      On July 16, 1988, the final concert was organized and produced by Summer of Love Productions Producers, Ron Frazier and Bill McCarthy, who had hosted the previous June concert event for the marchers in Los Angeles.                                                                                On July 16, 1988, the American Soviet Peace Walk concert finale event happened at the Band Shell in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park with an estimated public attendance of 25,000 plus. The Producers give many thanks to all participants, the volunteers, and performing friends of the Summer of Love 20th Anniversary 1987 series that benefited the San Francisco Food Bank and ran through to the Concert of July 16, 1988.                                                                              Congratulations are given to both the American and Soviet Performing Artists of the "American Soviet Peace Walk Concert". Participants and performances achieved the results as Change Makers that has advanced the cause for Peace and People-to-People Awareness. Artists' performances in concerts that achieve Global attention are needed as an ongoing effort to sustain awareness of and for Peace.                                                                                            Special Thanks go to; Susan Ramser, Producers Assistant who hosted the Soviet Artists on their arrival to San Francisco with the help of a Cadillac mini-fleet, Arthur Meyer, Artistic Director, and to Pete Sears of the original Jefferson Starship who assisted in the musical coordination and inviting cause-aware musician friends to participate. He organized the final musical portion of the show, as well as playing piano with each act.                                                                                                          The Crowd was pleased by Mr. Jerry Garcia helped to promote the event, Pete Sears was responsible for Jerry's appearance. The Recreation and Parks Department prohibited advertising because they  were concerned about fans camping and overcrowding, and so the concert happened without mainstream advertisement. But with the assisted word of mouth promotion, and one free newspaper paragraph event notice and the 1988 finale Poster presented 3 days out, all led to the success of the event.

'''Anti-union violence''' is physical force intended to harm [[trade union|union]] officials, union organizers, union members, union sympathizers, or their families. It is most commonly used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line.

Violence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, [[intimidation]], impersonation, [[disinformation]], and [[sabotage]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Violence in [[labor unrest|labor disputes]] may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may be purposeful and calculated,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 318&lt;/ref&gt; for example the hiring and deployment of [[goon squad]]s to assault strikers.

Incidents of violence during periods of labor unrest are sometimes perceived differently by different parties. It is sometimes a challenge to ascertain the truth about labor-related violence, and [[Union violence|incidents of violence committed by, or in the name of, unions or union workers have occurred]] as well.

== History ==

The practice of workers organizing, and meeting resistance for organizing, dates to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;John Romer, ''Ancient Lives; the story of the Pharaoh's Tombmakers. London'': Phoenix Press, 1984, pp. 116-123 See also E.F. Wente, "A letter of complaint to the Vizier To", in ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', 20, 1961 and W.F. Edgerton, "The strikes in Ramses III's Twenty-ninth year", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', 10, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first known individual killed by authorities for labor activities is likely Cinto Brandini, executed with nine others in 1345 Florence for attempting to organize woolcombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James C. Docherty|first1=Sjaak van der Velden|title=Historical Dictionary of Organized Labor|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=xxv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAdZaqTetVsC&amp;pg=PR25&amp;lpg=PR25|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent [[Labor history of the United States|labor history]] of any industrial nation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mass labor violence in the U.S. peaked in the early 20th century and has largely subsided since the 1940s.  But the deadly suppression of labor unions on a large scale persists into the new century, in the 2012 [[Marikana killings]] in South Africa, in the ongoing assassinations of [[Trade unions in Colombia|trade union members in Colombia]], and the South Korean government's response to [[Korean Confederation of Trade Unions]] protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Hyun|title=South Korea Labor Strikes Back|url=http://fpif.org/south-korean-labor-strikes-back/|accessdate=18 April 2016|publisher=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

Since unions are organized to achieve [[collective bargaining]] power to begin with, most union conflicts have been motivated primarily by economic issues (wages, working hours, safety conditions, work rules, etc.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lalor|first1=John Joseph|title=Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States, Volume 3|date=1890|publisher=C. E. Merrill &amp; Company|page=816|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6g9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA816|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have engaged antagonists (employers, hired strikebreakers, replacement workers, local law enforcement) with economic goals in mind.  In some instances, however, other causes emerge.

===Race===

[[File:Randrebellion.png|right|thumb|French cartoon of the [[Rand Rebellion]] in South Africa, 1922]]

The 1887 [[Thibodaux massacre]] in [[Louisiana]], the 1899 [[Pana riot]] in southern [[Illinois]], and the 1911 [[Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway#1911 strike|Queen &amp; Crescent killings]] in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] are three examples of deliberate campaigns of murder against organized black workers in the American south, the first committed by landowners, the other two by white competitors.

In South Africa the 1922 [[Rand Rebellion]] also had underlying racial causes, taking on the slogan "''Workers of the world, unite and fight for a white South Africa!''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workmall.com/wfb2001/south_africa/south_africa_history_conflict_in_the_1920s.html|title=South Africa  Conflict in the 1920s - Flags, Maps, Economy, Geography, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System|work=workmall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; before their strike grew to a small-scale rebellion at the cost of 200 lives.  The behavior of South African police in the [[1946 African Mine Workers' Union strike]] is said to have led to the formation of the [[Northern Rhodesian African Mineworkers' Union]] in 1949 as a cornerstone of the anti-apartheid movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The African Miners' Strike of 1946 |first=M. P. |last=Naicker |url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4727l |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505153758/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4727l |archivedate=2016-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political power===

As with race, for some incidents there is no clear distinction between anti-union violence and political suppression.  Polish labor unions were centrally involved in workers’ uprisings and/or general strikes that challenged the sitting governments in [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|1905]], [[1923 Kraków riot|1923]], and [[1937 peasant strike in Poland|1937]].  In a similar way the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|strike of Asturian miners in 1934]], put down by right-wing Spanish government forces with great loss of life, amounted to an insurrection through work stoppage, not an economic labor action.   Unions continued to play a political and military role in the subsequent [[Spanish Civil War]].

Along with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in Spain, other totalitarian regimes in Europe brought their labor unions under government control, violently when necessary.  After coming to power as chancellor in January 1933, Adolf Hitler declared May Day a national holiday, then on May 2, 1933 unexpectedly moved to outlaw labor unions as part of the Nazi "[[Gleichschaltung|synchronization]]" process.   Major unions such as the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]] were raided that day, their accounts seized, and their leaders (Gustav Schiefer, [[Wilhelm Leuschner]], Erich Luebbe) arrested and sent to concentration camps.  (The bodies of four murdered trade union officials in Duisburg were only found a year later, in April 1934.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregor|first1=Neil|title=Nazism|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9FFAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every worker in the nation was then compelled to join the single party-controlled union, the [[German Labour Front]].  Similar coercive violence was exercised against labor unions in conquered nations, as in the Netherlands in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warmbrunn|first1=Werner|title=The Dutch Under German Occupation, 1940-1945|date=1963|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykWfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of violence ==

Some anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an incident during the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], in which a police officer fired into a crowd of strikers, killing [[Anna LoPizzo]].&lt;ref&gt;William Dudley Haywood, Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate others, as in the [[Frank Little (unionist)|hanging of union organizer Frank Little]] from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]]. A note was pinned to his body which said, "Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the "L" for Frank Little circled.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the [[Anaconda Road Massacre]]. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Murphy, Mining cultures: men, women, and leisure in Butte, 1914-41, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. "The Ludlow Massacre", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346–349&lt;/ref&gt; During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death Special". At the Forbes tent colony,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes..."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by [[Victor G. Reuther|Victor Reuther]] and others in 1937, "[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other objects to throw at the cops, and police organized [[tear gas]] attacks and mounted charges."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Lichtenstein, Walter Reuther: the most dangerous man in Detroit, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been cases where violence has been perpetrated or encouraged by agents of management, intending it to be blamed on the union.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 317&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, violence against unions in the United States has included attacks by detective and guard agencies, such as the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]], [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency|Baldwin Felts]], [[William J. Burns International Detective Agency|Burns]], or [[Thiel Detective Service Company|Thiel]] detective agencies; citizens groups, such as the [[Citizens' Alliance]]; company guards; police; national guard; or even the military.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''From Blackjacks To Briefcases'', Robert Michael Smith states that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, anti-union agencies "spawned violence and wreaked havoc" on the labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Morris Friedman]], detective agencies were themselves for-profit companies, and a "bitter struggle" between capital and labor could be counted upon to create "satisfaction and immense profit" for agencies such as the Pinkerton company.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Morris Friedman, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Wellington Laidler wrote a book in 1913 detailing how one of the largest union busters in the United States, [[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], had a sales pitch offering the use of provocation and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Lattimer massacre]], nineteen unarmed immigrant coal miners were suddenly gunned down at the Lattimer mine near [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]], on September 10, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John W.

A study of industrial violence in 1969 concluded, "There is no episode in American labor history in which violence was as systematically used by employers as in the Colorado labor war of 1903 and 1904."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. "The Ludlow Massacre", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346–349&lt;/ref&gt; During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death Special". In 1917, [[Frank Little (unionist)|union organizer Frank Little]] was hanged from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]], with a note pinned to his body which carried a "warning" to other labor activists.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, during another coal strike in [[Colorado]], state police and mine guards fired pistols, rifles and a machine gun into a group of five hundred striking miners and their wives in what came to be called the [[Columbine Mine massacre|Columbine Mine Massacre]].

By the early 1900s, public tolerance for violence during labor disputes began to decrease. Yet violence involving strikebreaking troops and armed guards continued into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation related to employer strategies such as violent strike breaking would have to wait until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, employers began to embrace new methods of managing workers and unions which were still effective, but much more subtle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Canada
* With casualties as one indication of its national history, a union pamphlet published in 2006 counted a total of 24 "Canadian Labour Martyrs" since 1903, a number that includes Joseph Mairs of the Vancouver Island War of 1912-14, coal miner [[Albert Goodwin]] killed in 1918, miner [[William Davis (miner)|Bill Davis]] of Nova Scotia (namesake of the [[William Davis Miners' Memorial Day]]), and the 1929 case of [[Rosvall and Voutilainen]] in [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Pamphlet of Canadian Labour Martyrs|url=http://iww.ca/?p=225|website=International Workers of the World Canada|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Rosvall and Voutilainen were murdered for their pro-union efforts resulting in the authorities in Thunder Bay conducting a major cover up in an attempt to conceal the truth.  Thunder Bay remains a hot bed of anti-union violence against pro-union individuals resulting in Thunder Bay being labelled the Capital of Anti-union Violence of Canada.

;Mexico
* the [[Cananea strike]] of organized mine workers in June 1906, and the [[Río Blanco strike]] of unionized textile workers in January 1907, became two linked symbols of the corruption and civil repression of the administration of Mexican president [[Porfirio Díaz]].  They became "household words for hundreds of thousands of Mexicans".&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Latin America, by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press, 1986, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central and South America ===

;Argentina
* approximately 1,500 striking rural workers were shot and killed by the [[Argentine Army]] in the [[Patagonia Rebelde|Patagonia Uprising]] between 1920 and 1922

;Bolivia
* government forces killed at least 19 striking mine workers in the [[Catavi Massacre]] of December 1942; the workers themselves counted 400 dead
* popular protests against the November 1, 1979 ''coup d'état'' of [[Alberto Natusch Busch]], protests led by the [[Central Obrera Boliviana]] (COB) trade union confederation, were met with [[All Saints' massacre|violence from the military]].  Perhaps 100 were killed, but the new government was overthrown within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Asociación de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos y Mártires por la Liberación Nacional (Bolivia), Fundación Solón, and Capítulo Boliviano de Derechos Humanos, Democracia y Desarrollo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14097">'''Atomic units''' ('''au''' or '''a.u.''') form a [[systems of measurement|system]] of [[natural units]] which is especially convenient for [[atomic physics]] calculations. There are two different kinds of atomic units, '''[[Hartree]] atomic units'''&lt;ref name="Hartree28"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hartree|first=D. R.|title=The Wave Mechanics of an Atom with a Non-Coulomb Central Field. Part I.

This article deals with '''Hartree atomic units''', where the numerical values of the following four fundamental [[physical constants]] are all unity by definition:

* [[Electron mass]] &lt;math&gt;m_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt;;
* [[Elementary charge]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;;
* Reduced [[Planck's constant]] &lt;math&gt;\hbar = h/(2 \pi)&lt;/math&gt;;
* [[Coulomb's constant]] &lt;math&gt;k_\text{e} = 1/(4 \pi \epsilon_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

In Hartree units, the [[speed of light]] is approximately &lt;math&gt;137&lt;/math&gt;. Atomic units are often abbreviated "a.u." or "au", not to be confused with the same abbreviation used also for [[astronomical unit]]s, [[arbitrary unit]]s, and [[absorbance|absorbance units]] in different contexts.

== Use and notation ==
Atomic units, like [[SI units]], have a unit of mass, a unit of length, and so on. However, the use and notation is somewhat different from SI.

Suppose a particle with a mass of ''m'' has 3.4 times the mass of electron. The value of ''m'' can be written in three ways:

* "&lt;math&gt;m = 3.4~m_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt;". This is the clearest notation (but least common), where the atomic unit is included explicitly as a symbol.&lt;ref name=Pilar&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilar|first=Frank L.|title=Elementary Quantum Chemistry|year=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-41464-5|page=155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpGM7r69LdkC&amp;pg=PA155}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "&lt;math&gt;m = 3.4~\mathrm{a.u.}&lt;/math&gt;" ("a.u." means "expressed in atomic units"). This notation is ambiguous: Here, it means that the mass ''m'' is 3.4 times the atomic unit of mass. But if a length ''L'' were 3.4 times the atomic unit of length, the equation would look the same, "&lt;math&gt;L = 3.4~\text{a.u.}&lt;/math&gt;" The dimension needs to be inferred from context.&lt;ref name=Pilar /&gt;
* "&lt;math&gt;m = 3.4&lt;/math&gt;". This notation is similar to the previous one, and has the same dimensional ambiguity. It comes from formally setting the atomic units to 1, in this case &lt;math&gt;m_\text{e} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;3.4~m_\text{e} = 3.4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bishop|first=David M.|title=Group Theory and Chemistry|year=1993|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-67355-4|page=217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4zv4dukBT0C&amp;pg=PA217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake|first=Gordon W.

== Fundamental atomic units ==
These four fundamental constants form the basis of the atomic units (see above). Therefore, their numerical values in the atomic units are unity by definition.

== Related physical constants ==
[[Dimensionless physical constant]]s retain their values in any system of units. Of particular importance is the [[fine-structure constant]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{e^2}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0)\hbar c} \approx 1/137&lt;/math&gt;. This immediately gives the value of the [[speed of light]], expressed in atomic units.

== SI and Gaussian-CGS variants, and magnetism-related units ==
There are two common variants of atomic units, one where they are used in conjunction with [[SI units]] for [[electromagnetism]], and one where they are used with [[Gaussian units|Gaussian-CGS units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A note on Units|url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys7550/phys7550_sp07/extras/Appendix_1.pdf|work=Physics 7550 — Atomic and Molecular Spectra|publisher=University of Colorado lecture notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the units written above are the same either way (including the unit for electric field), the units related to magnetism are not. In the SI system, the atomic unit for magnetic field is
: 1 a.u. = &lt;math&gt;\frac{\hbar}{e a_0^2}&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|2.35|e=5}} [[Tesla (unit)|T]] = {{val|2.35|e=9}} [[gauss (unit)|G]],
and in the Gaussian-cgs unit system, the atomic unit for magnetic field is
: 1 a.u. = &lt;math&gt;\frac{e}{a_0^2 c} &lt;/math&gt; = {{val|1.72|e=3}} [[Tesla (unit)|T]] = {{val|1.72|e=7}} [[gauss (unit)|G]].
(These differ by a factor of [[fine structure constant|α]].)

Other magnetism-related quantities are also different in the two systems. An important example is the [[Bohr magneton]]: In SI-based atomic units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chis|first=Vasile|title=Atomic Units; Molecular Hamiltonian; Born-Oppenheimer Approximation|url=http://phys.ubbcluj.ro/~vchis/cursuri/cspm/course2.pdf|work=Molecular Structure and Properties Calculations|publisher=Babes-Bolyai University lecture notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{B} = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_\text{e}} = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; a.u.
and in Gaussian-based atomic units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Budker|first1=Dmitry|last2=Kimball|first2=Derek F.|last3=DeMille|first3=David P.|title=Atomic Physics: An Exploration through Problems and Solutions|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850950-9|page=380|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GW6pclAk-JcC&amp;pg=PA380}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{B} = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_\text{e} c}=\alpha/2\approx 3.6\times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; a.u.

== Bohr model in atomic units ==
Atomic units are chosen to reflect the properties of electrons in atoms. This is particularly clear from the classical [[Bohr model]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] in its [[ground state]]. The ground state electron orbiting the hydrogen nucleus has (in the classical Bohr model):

* Orbital velocity = 1
* Orbital radius = 1
* [[Angular momentum]] = 1
* Orbital period = 2π
* [[Ionization energy]] = {{frac|1|2}}
* Electric field (due to nucleus) = 1
* Electrical attractive force (due to nucleus) = 1

== Non-relativistic quantum mechanics in atomic units ==
The [[Schrödinger equation]] for an electron in SI units is
: &lt;math&gt;- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + V(\mathbf{r}) \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} (\mathbf{r}, t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The same equation in '''au''' is
: &lt;math&gt;- \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + V(\mathbf{r}) \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} (\mathbf{r}, t)&lt;/math&gt;.

For the special case of the electron around a hydrogen atom, the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] in SI units is:
: &lt;math&gt;\hat H = - {{{\hbar^2} \over {2 m_e}}\nabla^2} - {1 \over {4 \pi \epsilon_0}}{{e^2} \over {r}}&lt;/math&gt;,

while '''atomic units''' transform the preceding equation into
: &lt;math&gt;\hat H = - {{{1} \over {2}}\nabla^2} - {{1} \over {r}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Comparison with Planck units ==
Both [[Planck units]] and au are derived from certain fundamental properties of the physical world, and are free of [[anthropocentric]] considerations. It should be kept in mind that au were designed for atomic-scale calculations in the present-day universe, while Planck units are more suitable for [[quantum gravity]] and early-universe [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Both au and Planck units normalize the [[reduced Planck constant]]. Beyond this, Planck units normalize to 1 the two fundamental constants of [[general relativity]] and cosmology: the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' and the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, ''c''. Atomic units, by contrast, normalize to 1 the mass and charge of the electron, and, as a result, the speed of light in atomic units is a large value, &lt;math&gt;1/\alpha \approx 137&lt;/math&gt;. The orbital velocity of an electron around a small atom is of the order of 1 in atomic units, so the discrepancy between the velocity units in the two systems reflects the fact that electrons orbit small atoms much slower than the speed of light (around 2 orders of magnitude slower).

There are much larger discrepancies in some other units. For example, the unit of mass in atomic units is the mass of an electron, while the unit of mass in Planck units is the [[Planck mass]], a mass so large that if a single particle had that much mass it might collapse into a [[black hole]]. Indeed, the Planck unit of mass is 22 orders of magnitude larger than the au unit of mass. Similarly, there are many orders of magnitude separating the Planck units of energy and length from the corresponding atomic units.

'''Bamboo bicycles''' are [[Bicycle pedal|pedal-and-chain-driven]], [[Human-powered transport|human-powered]], [[single-track vehicle]]s that have two wheels attached to a bamboo frame. Because of its light weight, vibration damping, and sustainability, bamboo is slowly starting to be used in bicycle frame production, though the industry is still dominated by aluminium frames.

== History ==
Bamboo bikes were first patented in England by the Bamboo Cycle Company and introduced to the general public on 26 April 1894.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo Cycle Company|url = http://www.bikebamboo.com/bamboo_cycle_co.php|website = BikeBamboo.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A US patent was applied for in 1895, by August Oberg and Andrew Gustafson, and granted in 1896. However, with the development of tougher industrial metals, such as steel and aluminium, large-scale usage of bamboo to build bicycles never happened.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042715-212811/unrestricted/MG_Bamboo_Bike_Final_4.28.pdf|title = Management of the Design and Construction of the WPI Bamboo Bicycle|last = Aleles|first = Nicholas|date = 27 April 2015|journal = Worcester Polytechnic Institute Major Qualifying Project|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|last2 = Collins|first2 = Hayden|publisher = Worcester Polytechnic Institute|others = John Downey, Brodie Green, Amaia Gritsko, Angela Langford, Mitchell Lewis, Samuel Longwell, Lena Pafumi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Railway News ...|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GwY1AQAAIAAJ|date = 1895-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though bicycles are a staple of human transportation, in both rural and urbanised areas, bamboo bicycles are not widely used. However, with the advent of the [[Green politics|Green movement]], bamboo is being used again, primarily for high-end racing and [[Track bicycle|touring bicycles]]. Bamboo bikes are entering the market as low cost alternatives to relatively expensive and unsustainable aluminium and metal bikes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo Bikes Initiative in Ghana - UN and Climate Change|url = https://www.un.org/climatechange/blog/2014/08/bamboo-bikes-initiative-ghana/|website = UN and Climate Change|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical aspects ==
Several aspects of bamboo are extremely valuable to both cyclists and bicycle manufacturers: high strength-to-weight ratio, vibration control, and sustainable growth. Because of bamboo's tendency to grow straight, it does not exhibit "knots" and "turns" in its wood, unlike other types of wood. As a result, bamboo has a higher specific tensile strength than steel, as well as a higher specific compressive strength than concrete.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bamboo Solution {{!}} DiscoverMagazine.com|url = http://discovermagazine.com/1996/jun/thebamboosolutio784|work= Discover Magazine|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bambus.rwth-aachen.de/eng/PDF-Files/Mechanical%20properties%20of%20bamboo.pdf|title = Mechanical properties of bamboo|last = Rottke|first = Evelin|date = 27 October 2002|journal = RWTH Aachen University Publications|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency also allows for excellent vibration control, which, in turn, provides for a smoother ride and increased stability on rough terrain.

The bamboo poles can be joined in a number of different ways. The earliest models used metal joints which were then tightened around the bamboo. Another approach is to wrap the joints with resin saturated fibers to make composite lugs around the bamboo frame members. For modernised track bicycles, carbon fibre is used for the remainder of the parts that are not made of bamboo due to its light weight - for example, the fork, because it is difficult to find a perfect piece of bamboo that fits into the fork socket of the frame.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Projects ==
Bamboo could be used as an alternative to traditional steel and aluminium bikes in many rural areas because of its potential sustainability. 

A "Bamboo Bike Project", started by engineers at [[Columbia University]], created a small number of bamboo bikes from 2007 to 2011. This was done with the intention of providing low cost bikes for Africans in rural areas, and stimulating local bike building industries, without major assistance from outside sources.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bamboobike.org/Home.html|title = Bamboo Bike Project|date = 2011|accessdate = 4 November 2015|website = Bamboo Bike Project|publisher = The Earth Institute at Columbia University|last = Mutter|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations and the United States have invested in the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative, which was created by Bernice Dapaah. This business markets itself as addressing climate change, poverty, youth unemployment, rural-urban migration and by creating jobs for women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As of 2015 over 1000 of these bikes had been sold in Ghana, Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ghana’s bicycle which is creating jobs while it saves the soil|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/05/ghana-environment-bamboo-bicycles-seed-award|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Corinne|last = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 few bicycles have also been made in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://youth.newagebd.net/2187/made-in-bangladesh-3/|title=Made in Bangladesh - New Age Youth|date=2016-02-28|work=New Age Youth|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==
The most expensive bamboo bikes cost thousands of dollars. Conversely, the bikes sold in Ghana for the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative have been said to cost about $120, which is significantly more expensive than conventional bicycles.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo bikes have benefits|url = http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Bamboo-bikes-have-benefits-3278264.php|website = SFGate|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cheapest for adults retail at $350 as of 2018, thus the bikes are retailed specifically for the export market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Products – Ghana Bamboo Bikes |url=http://ghanabamboobikes.org/shop/ |accessdate=30 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This variation in cost has two main reasons: the relative wealth of the consumers to whom the bikes are marketed, and the difference in production quality. In the United States, all parts incorporated into the bike are high-end, similar to the parts used in expensive carbon fibre bikes. Modern machines are used to laminate, waterproof, and join the individual bamboo pieces. The Ghanaian bikes, on the other hand, source most parts (e.g. bamboo, chains, bolts, etc.) from low-cost sources.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Calendar reform''', properly '''calendrical reform''', is any significant revision of a [[calendar]] system. The term sometimes is used instead for a proposal to switch to a different calendar design.

== Principles ==

The prime objective of a calendar is to unambiguously identify any day throughout history by a specific date. 
Periods that contain multiple days, like weeks, months and even years, are secondary features of a calendar for convenience.
Most cultures adopt a primary dating system, but different cultures have always needed to align multiple calendars with each other, because they coexisted in the same space (e.g. secular and religious groups with different demands) or had established trading relations. 
Once specified, a ''calendar design'' cannot be altered without becoming a new one, but if a design is sufficiently close to the one used before in the local ''calendar system'', switching to it and hence a calendar reform is possible without disruption. 
Some design changes, however, will yield date identifiers different from the previous design for some days, often in the distant past or future. 
The calendar system must clarify whether dates are changed to the new design retroactively (using a ''proleptic calendar'') or whether the design in use then and there shall be respected. 
Calendar schisms happen if not all cultures that adopted a common calendar system before perform a calendar reform at the same time. 
If date identifiers are similar but different, confusion and mistakes are unavoidable. 


Most calendars have several rules which could be altered by reform:
* Whether and how days are grouped into subdivisions such as [[month]]s and [[week]]s, and days outside those subdivisions, if any.
* Which years are [[leap year]]s and [[common year]]s and how they differ.
* Numbering of years, selection of the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and the issue of [[0 (year)|year zero]].
* Start of the year (such as the [[December solstice]], 1 January, 1 March, [[March equinox]], [[Lady Day]]).
* If a week is retained, the start, length, and names of its days.
* Start of the day (midnight, sunrise, noon, or sunset).
* If months are retained, number, lengths, and names of months.
* Special days and periods (such as leap day or intercalary day).
* Alignment with social cycles.
* Alignment with astronomical cycles.
* Alignment with biological cycles.
* Literal notation of dates.

== Historical reforms ==
Historically, most calendar reforms have been made in order to synchronize the calendar with the astronomical year (either [[solar year|solar]] or [[sidereal year|sidereal]]) and/or the [[synodic month]] in [[lunar calendar|lunar]] or [[lunisolar calendar]]s. Most reforms for calendars have been to make them more accurate. This has happened to various lunar and lunisolar calendars, and also the Julian calendar when it was altered to the Gregorian calendar.

The fundamental problems of the calendar are that the astronomical year has neither a whole number of days nor a whole number of lunar months; neither does the lunar month have a whole number of days: in each case there are fractions "left over". (In some physical circumstances the rotations and revolutions of a planet and its satellite(s) can be phase-locked —for example the same side of the moon always faces us— but this has not operated to lock together the lengths of the Earth's year, day and month.) Such remainders could accumulate from one period to the next, thereby driving the cycles out of synch.

A typical solution to force synchronization is '[[intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]]'. This means occasionally adding an extra day (or month) into the cycle. An alternative approach is to ignore the mismatch and simply let the cycles continue to drift apart. The general approaches include:

* The lunar calendar, which fits days into the cycle of lunar months, adding an extra day when needed, while ignoring the annual solar cycle of the seasons.
* The solar calendar, which fits artificial months into the year, adding an extra day into one month when needed, while ignoring the lunar cycle of new/full moons.
* The lunisolar calendar, which keeps both the lunar and solar cycles, adding an extra month into the year when needed.

An obvious disadvantage of the lunisolar method of inserting a whole extra month is the large irregularity of the length of the year from one to the next. The simplicity of a lunar calendar has always been outweighed by its inability to track the seasons, and a solar calendar is used in conjunction to remedy this defect. Identifying the lunar cycle month requires straightforward observation of the Moon on a clear night. However, identifying seasonal cycles requires much more methodical observation of stars or a device to track solar day-to-day progression, such as that established at places like [[Stonehenge]]. After centuries of empirical observations, the theoretical aspects of calendar construction could become more refined, enabling predictions that identified the need for reform.

=== Reform of lunar and lunisolar calendars ===
There have been 50 to 100 reforms of the traditional [[Chinese calendar]] over 2500 years, most of which were intended to better fit the calendar months to astronomical lunations and to more accurately add the extra month so that the regular months maintain their proper seasonal positions, even though each seasonal marker can occur anywhere within its month.
There have been at least four similar reforms of the lunisolar version of the [[Hindu calendar]], all intended to make the month a better match to the lunation and to make the year a better fit to the ''sidereal'' year. There have been reforms of the ''solar'' version of the Hindu calendar which changed the distribution of the days in each month to better match the length of time that the Sun spends in each ''sidereal'' zodiacal sign. The same applies to the [[Buddhist calendar]]. The first millennium reform of the [[Hebrew calendar]] changed it from an observational calendar into a calculated calendar. The [[Islamic calendar]] was a reform of the preceding lunisolar calendar which completely divorced it from the solar year.

Another reform was performed in [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuk Persia]] by [[Omar Khayyam]] and others, developing the precisely computed [[Jalali calendar]].

=== Julian and Gregorian reforms ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
When [[Julius Caesar]] took power in Rome, the [[Roman calendar]] had ceased to reflect the year accurately.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The [[Julian calendar|Julian reform]] lengthened seven months and replaced the intercalary month with an intercalary day to be inserted within February every four years. This produced a noticeably more accurate calendar, but it had an average year length of 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 d). This had the effect of adding about three-quarters of an hour every four years. The effect accumulated from inception in 45 BC until by the 16th century the northward equinox was falling on March 10 or 11.

[[Image:William Hogarth 028.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[William Hogarth]]’s ''[[Humours of an Election|An Election Entertainment]]'' includes a banner with the protest slogan against the Gregorian calendar: "Give us our Eleven days" (on floor at lower right)]]

Under [[Pope Gregory XIII]], the leap year rule was altered: century years which are not divisible by 400 would be common years. So 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are not leap years. This rule makes the mean year 365.2425 days {{nowrap|(365&amp;nbsp;d, 5&amp;nbsp;h, 49&amp;nbsp;min, 12&amp;nbsp;s)}} long.  While this does not synchronize the years entirely, it would require a few thousand years to accumulate a day.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', corrected printing (Oxford University Press, 2013), 692.&lt;/ref&gt;

So that the northward equinox would have the same date in the new Gregorian calendar as it had when the Council of Nicaea made recommendations in AD 325 ({{nowrap|March 21}}), ten days were dropped so that {{nowrap|October 5}} became {{nowrap|October 15}} in 1582. This reform took a few centuries to spread through the nations that used the Julian calendar, although the Russian church year still uses the Julian calendar. Those nations that adopted this calendar on or after 1700 had to drop more than ten days: Great Britain, for instance, dropped eleven.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

In 1923, [[Milutin Milanković]] proposed to a [[synod]] of some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es at [[Constantinople]] that only those centennial years (those ending in 00) that leave a remainder of 200 or 600 upon division by 900 would be leap years, decreasing the average year length to 365.242222 days. These remainders were chosen to delay the first year (after 1923) that this calendar would disagree with the Gregorian calendar as much as possible, until 2800. It was adopted by some Eastern Orthodox Churches under the names [[Revised Julian calendar]] or New calendar, but was rejected by others.

== Proposals ==
The [[Gregorian calendar]] is currently used by most of the world. There is also an international standard describing the calendar, [[ISO 8601]], with some differences to traditional conceptions in many cultures.

Since the papal reform in 1582, several proposals have been offered to make the Gregorian calendar more useful or regular. Very few reforms have gained official acceptance. The rather different [[decimal calendar|decimal]] [[French Republican Calendar]] was one such official reform, but was abolished twelve years later by [[Napoleon]]. After [[World War II]], the newly formed United Nations continued efforts of its predecessor, the [[League of Nations]], to establish the proposed [[World Calendar]] but postponed the issue after a veto from the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], which was mainly based upon concerns of religious groups about the proposed days that would be outside the seven-day week cycle ("blank days") and thus disrupt having a sabbath every seven days.  Independently the [[World Council of Churches]] still tries to find a common rule for the date of Easter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/towards-a-common-date-for-easter/towards-a-common-date-for-easter.html|title=Towards a Common Date for Easter|author=World Council of Churches|date=1997-03-10|website=www.oikoumene.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might be eased by a new common calendar.

Reformers cite several problems with the Gregorian calendar:
* It is not [[Perennial Calendar|perennial]]. Each year starts on a different day of the week and calendars expire every year.
* It is difficult to determine the weekday of any given day of the year or month.
* Months are not equal in length, nor regularly distributed across the year, and so some people rely on [[mnemonic]]s (e.g., "[[Thirty days hath September]]" or [[Knuckle_mnemonic|knuckle counting]]) to remember the lengths of months.
* The year's four quarters (of three full months each) are not equal (being of 90/91, 91, 92 and 92 days respectively). [[Business quarter]]s that are equal would make accounting easier.
* Its epoch, i.e. start of the year count, is religious. The same applies to month and [[weekday]] names in many languages.
* Each month has no connection with the [[lunar phase]]s.
* Solstices and equinoxes do not coincide with either the beginning of the Gregorian months or the midpoint of the months.
* The calendar does not have a [[Year Zero|year zero]], the year after [[1 BC]] was [[1 AD]], with nothing in between them. 

It is hard or even impossible to solve all these issues in just one calendar.

Most plans evolve around the solar year of a little more than 365 days. This number does not divide well by seven or twelve, which are the traditional numbers of days per week and months per year respectively. The nearby numbers 360, 364 and 366 are divisible in better ways. There are also lunar-centric proposals.

=== Perennial calendars ===

{{see also|Perennial calendar}}
Many calendar reforms have offered solutions to make the Gregorian calendar perennial. These reforms would make it easy to work out the day of the week of a particular [[calendar date|date]], and would make changing calendars each year unnecessary. There are, roughly speaking, two options to achieve this goal: [[leap week calendar]]s and [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. Leap week calendars add a leap week of seven days to the calendar every five or six years to keep the calendar roughly in step with the tropical year. They have years of either 364 days (52 weeks) or 371 days (53 weeks), thus preserving the 7-day week.

Proposals mainly differ in their selection of a leap rule, placing of the leap item (usually middle or end of the year), in the start day of the week and year, in the number (12 or 13) and size of months and in connected naming; some are compatible to the [[week date]] of ISO 8601.

The [[World Calendar]], favored by the UN in the 1950s, and the [[International Fixed Calendar]], quite popular among economists between the World Wars, are proposals that start each year on a Sunday. The 364 days within the week system form 52 weeks of 7 days. The World Calendar has every quarter beginning on the same day of the week. In the World Calendar, the 365th and 366th day are considered holidays and named Worlds Day and Leap Year Day. These "off-calendar" days stand outside the seven-day week and caused some religious groups to strongly oppose adoption of the World Calendar. Such concerns helped prevent the World Calendar from being adopted. Supporters of the World Calendar, however, argue that the religious groups' opposition overlooked every individual's right to celebrate these holidays as extra days of worship, or [[Sabbath]]s. This option, they reason, maintained the seven-day worship cycle for those who share that concern, while allowing benefits of a perennial calendar to be shared by all.

Some calendar reform ideas, such as the [[Pax Calendar]], [[Symmetry454]] calendar and the [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]], were created to solve this problem by having years of either 364 days (52 weeks) or 371 days (53 weeks), thus preserving the 7-day week. The 53-week calendar, used in government and in business for [[fiscal year]]s, is a variant of this concept. Each year of this calendar can be up to 371 days long.

Some calendars have quarters of regularly patterned uneven months e.g., a 35-day (five-week) month and a pair of 28-day (four-week) months, with a leap week appended to the final month when needed. The Common Civil Calendar and Time calendar has months of 30 and 31 days, but inserts a leap week in the middle of the year, when needed, whereas its successor, the Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar, moves the extra week to the end of the year.

In the [[Isaac Asimov#Other writings|World Season Calendar]], months are discarded altogether; instead, the year is divided into four seasons of 13 weeks each.  An extra day (two days during leap year) is added to the calendar that is not assigned a day of the week in order to perennialize the calendar. The same calendar of 91 days is used for each season of every year.

Still other proposals, like the 30x11 Calendar, abandon attempts to make the calendar perennial, instead opting for eleven 30-day months and one long month at the end of 35 (or 36) days.

=== Systematic 12-month calendars ===
{{OR|date=June 2018}}

The lengths of the months inherited from the old [[Roman calendar]] as reformed by Julius Caesar do not follow any apparent logic systematically. Many reform proposals seek to make the pattern more uniform. 
When keeping the traditional dozen of months and the close approximation of a solar year, this usually yields four equal quarters of three months each where one month is longer than the other two. The most common approaches are 30∶30∶31, 30∶31∶30 and 31∶30∶30 days per month, but 4∶4∶5, 4∶5∶4 and 5∶4∶4 weeks per months have also been proposed or used. They all result in 364 systematically distributed days and hence have to add either one extra and one leap day or a leap week. 
Some calendar designs do not use the same pattern for all quarters but, for instance, flip it in the middle of the year. This is more common with 31∶30 and 30∶31 patterns, which lead to 366 days of which one needs to be dropped in common years, since that is basically what the Julian and Gregorian calendars do except that July also has 31 days and February never has 30.

Incidentally, the close correspondence to existing conventions is often considered an advantage, but even patterns that deviate more may have strong benefits. For instance, all quarterly patterns with 30 and 31 days per month result in a week distribution of 4∶5∶4 if a week is counted for the month most of its days belong to and the first day of the first month is also the first day of a week.

A change in month lengths will frequently also result in months starting at a different ordinal day of the year, especially since all regular designs lengthen February. For a non-leap year, all designs with 91-day quarters realign in October with the Julian pattern and some as early as June, while all designs that are alternating odd and even months completely mismatch after January even if the last day of February remained the leap day.

=== 13-month calendars ===
&lt;!-- perennialization and 13 months are not mutually exclusive --&gt;

Some calendar reformers seek to equalize the length of each month in the year. This is often accomplished by creating a calendar that has 13 months of 4 weeks (28 days) each, making 364 days. The earliest known proposal of this type was the Georgian Calendar (1745)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Georgian Calendar|url=http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/hirossa.html|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Hugh Jones (reverend)|Rev. Hugh Jones]].

The [[Positivist calendar]] (1849), created by [[Auguste Comte]], was based on a 364-day year which included one or two “blank” days. Each of the 13 months had 28 days and exactly four weeks, and each started on a Monday. The [[International Fixed Calendar]] is a more modern descendant of this calendar.

Some proposals&lt;!--, such as the [[Sol Calendar]],--&gt; add one or two days to the calendar each year to account for the annual solar cycle, while others keep these days off the calendar entirely, to make the calendar perennial.

Around 1930 Colligan invented the [[Pax Calendar]], which avoids off-calendar days by adding a 7-day [[leap week calendar|leap week]] to the 364-day common year for 71 out of 400 years. &lt;!-- The New Earth Calendar does likewise with a different leap rule. --&gt;

In 1993, Lloydine and [[José Argüelles]] founded the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightparty.com/Spirituality/World13MoonCalendar.html|title=The World 13 Moon Calendar Peace Movement
|author=The Light Party|date=|website=lightparty.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance inline}}

Dividing the years into 52 weeks creates 13 months of 28 days (4 weeks), and 4 quarters of 91 days (13 weeks). This creates months and quarters of fixed, even duration, but not quarters containing a whole number of months.

Instead of a leap week or an extra day and a leap day, such a calendar design could add a 14th ''leap month'' of 4 weeks about every 22 years.
While the Gregorian leap cycle of 400 years contains a whole number of 7-day weeks, this number is not divisible by 4, so this cycle would not be a good fit for a leap month calendar.

===19-month calendar===
The [[Bahá'í calendar]], established by the founders of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], does not seek to reform the Gregorian calendar, but establishes a purely solar calendar. As of 2015, the year always starts in spring on the sunset to sunset day of the vernal equinox (calculated in advance). This calendar has 19 months of 19 days, with an extra 4 or 5 intercalary days added so that the year ends on the day before the next vernal equinox.

=== Lunisolar calendars ===
{{See also|Lunisolar calendar}}

Lunisolar calendars usually have 12 or 13 months of 29 or 30 days.
&lt;!--
The [[Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar]] is a lunisolar calendar proposal which has 12 or 13 lunar months of 29 or 30 days a year, and begins each year near the [[vernal equinox]].
--&gt;&lt;!--
[[The Simple Lunisolar Calendar]] uses 12 or 13 lunar months of 30 or 29 days with fixed lengths, and begins each year between Gregorian December 3 and January 1.
--&gt;&lt;!--
The [[Meyer-Palmen Solilunar Calendar]] has 12 lunar months with 29 or 30 days plus a leap month called [[Meton]] every 3 or 2 years with 30 or 31 days. 60 years together are called a cycle. It uses a leap cycle which has equal number of days, weeks, months, years and cycles. 2498258 days, 356894 weeks, 84599 months, 6840 years and 114 cycles nearly all equal each other. It is called an era, although time isn't divided into it in this calendar.
--&gt;
Some propose to improve leap rules of existing calendars, such as the [[Hebrew calendar]]. The [[Rectified Hebrew calendar]] uses a more accurate leap cycle of 4366 months per 353-year cycle, with 130 leap years per cycle, and a progressively shorter ''[[molad]]'' interval, intended to replace the 19-year leap cycle and the constant ''molad'' interval of the traditional fixed arithmetic Hebrew calendar, respectively.

=== Naming ===
Calendar proposals that introduce a thirteenth month or change the Julian-Gregorian system of months often also propose new names for these months. New names have also been proposed for days out of the week cycle (e.g., 365th and leap) and weeks out of the month cycle.

Proposals to change the traditional month and weekday names are less frequent. The Gregorian calendar obtains its names mostly from gods of historical religions (e.g., Thursday from Nordic [[Thor]] or March from Roman [[Mars (god)|Mars]]) or leaders of vanished empires (July and August from the first Cæsars), or ordinals that got out of synchronization (September through December, originally seventh through tenth, now ninth through twelfth).

Calendar reformers, therefore, seek to correct what they see as deficiencies by focusing on more homogeneous sets of individuals, who usually share common traits.

==== Examples ====
Comte’s Positivist calendar, for example, proposed naming the 13 months in his calendar after figures from religion, literature, philosophy and science. Similarly, the [[Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar]] uses 12 or 13 lunar months named after 13 contributors to research on psychoactive plants and chemicals. The [[Simple Lunisolar Calendar]] names its months after the letters of the [[Greek alphabet]].

Some, such as Karl Palmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/palmen/playcard.htm|title=Playing Card Calendar|author=Karl Palmen|date=2001-01-15|website=www.hermetic.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested reusing an existing 13 × 4 naming system, the one found in [[playing cards]]. Thus either months are numbered Ace, Two through Ten, Jack, Queen and King with four weeks each, named after the four [[suit (cards)|suit]]s (♠♣♥♦); or the roles are reversed if the calendar has four quarters with thirteen weeks each. Leap days or weeks are assigned the Joker. This system has internationalisation problems, though, because even where the 52-card deck is known, the order of suits may vary.

The contemporary [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] has 26 letters, which could be used, together with a further binary indicator, as keys for 52 weeks.

== Specific proposals ==

There have been many specific calendar proposals to replace the Gregorian calendar:

The following count one or more days outside the standard seven-day week:
* [[Positivist calendar]]
* [[World Calendar|The World Calendar]]
* [[International Fixed Calendar]]
* [[Invariable Calendar]]
* [[World Season Calendar]]
* [[Tranquility Calendar]]

The following are leap week calendars:
* [[Pax Calendar]]
* [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]]
* [[Symmetry454]]

The following track the moon as well as the sun:
* Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar
* Rectified Hebrew calendar

There have also been proposals to revise the way years are numbered:
* [[Anno Lucis]]
* [[Holocene calendar]]
* [[Japanese era name|Jomon Era]]

Reform of the Islamic calendar:

Since the beginning of the 21st century, there is a trend within the Muslim communities of North America and Europe to substitute a lunar calendar based on calculations for the traditional Islamic method of monthly observation of the new moon to declare the beginning of the new month in each country separately. The details are in the following study:

{{Royal and noble ranks}}
A '''castellan''' was the [[governor]] or captain of a castellany and its [[castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Friar, Stephen (2003). ''The Sutton Companion to Castles'', Sutton Publishing, Stroud, 2003, p. 47. {{ISBN|978-0-7509-3994-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word stems from the Latin ''Castellanus'',&lt;ref&gt;Pirenne, Henri. "Medieval Cities". Princeton University Press, 1952. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; derived from ''castellum'' "castle". Sometimes also known as a '''constable''', '''governor''' of the castle district or '''captain''', the [[Constable of the Tower]] of [[Tower of London|London]] is, in fact, a form of castellan. A castellan was almost always male, but could occasionally be female, as when, in 1194, Beatrice inherited her father's castellany of [[Bourbourg]] upon the death of her brother, Roger.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Erin L. "Female Founders: Exercising authority in Thirteenth-century Flanders and Hainaut." ''Church History and Religious Culture'', Vol. 88, No. 4, Secular Women in the Documents for Late Medieval Religious Women (2008), pp. 546. Jordan, 559, later says, though, that women holding castellanies may be more prevalent in Flanders and Hainalt than in other parts of Western Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial power==
After [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] [[Roman Empire]], many tribes [[Migration Age|migrated into western Europe]], causing strife and war. The answer to recurrent invasion was to create fortified areas which evolved into [[castles]]. Some leaders gained control of several areas, each with a castle. The problem lay in exerting proper control and authority in each area when a leader could only be in one place at a time. To answer this, lords gave their trusted [[vassal]]s direct control of a castle, reporting to the lord only.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bosl, “Ruler and Ruled in the German Empire from the Tenth to the Twelfth Century,” in Lordship and Community in Medieval Europe, ed. Fredric Cheyette, (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc., 1968): 359=362.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ninth century, as fortifications improved and kings had difficulty making their subordinates pay their taxes or send the military aid the kings demanded, the castellans grew in power, holding their [[fief]] without much concern for their overlord's demands.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Markus. "Feudal Europe, 800-1300: Communal Discourse and Conflictual Practices." ''International Organization'', Vol. 46, No. 2 (Spring, 1992), pp. 438-9.&lt;/ref&gt; This changed as kings grew in power and as the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] emperors replaced recalcitrant [[vassals]] with [[ministerialis|ministerials]].

==Duties==
{{See also|Majordomo|Medieval warfare}}
Usually the duties of a castellan were combined with the duties of a [[majordomo (domestic staff)|majordomo]], making the castellan responsible for a castle's domestic staff and its [[garrison]], as well as a military administrator responsible for maintaining defenses and protecting the castle's lands. This was particularly the case if there was no lord resident at the castle, or if the resident lord was frequently absent.&lt;ref&gt;Pirenne, 73, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; A castellan may exercise the power of the "ban" - that is, to hear court cases and collect the fines, collect taxes from residents, and muster local men for the defense&lt;ref&gt;Rosenwein, Barbara. "A Short History of the Middle Ages: Volume II, from c.900 to c.1500" University of Toronto Press, 2009. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Castellans had both the power of low justice and high justice, which allowed them to implement up to and including the death penalty, as when, in 1111, the Salzburg castellan caught the [[ministerialis|ministerial]] who fomented armed rebellion, he had the offender blinded, as one would a serf.&lt;ref name="Arnold1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Arnold|title=German knighthood, 1050-1300|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UpQaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=arnold+German+Knighthood+1050-1300.&amp;q=blinded|year=1985|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=137}} (also available to subscribers at [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;idno=heb01508.0001.001;node=heb01508.0001.001%3A7;view=image;seq=149;size=100;page=root University of Michigan] {{subscription required|s}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821014318/http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;idno=heb01508.0001.001;node=heb01508.0001.001%3A7;view=image;seq=149;size=100;page=root |date=2016-08-21 }})&lt;/ref&gt; At times, the castellan served as the representative of the people of his castellany, as did the castellan of [[Bruges]], when the burghers stood up for more privileges and liberties from the counts of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, James Bruce. "Rise and Fall of a Twelfth-century Clan: The Erembalds and the Murder of Count Charles of Flanders, 1127-1128." ''Speculum'', Vol. 34, No. 3 (Jul., 1959), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castellans and Jews===
One unusual responsibility in western Europe concerned jurisdiction over the resident Jewish communities near the [[English Channel]]. The [[Constable of the Tower]] of London and those castellans subordinate to the dukes of [[Normandy]] were responsible for their administration. Vivian Lipman posits four reasons for this: the castles provided defense, they were centres of administration, they were potential prisons, and possibly, as the residence of a local magnate, they could be a valuable client.&lt;ref&gt;Lipman, Vivian. "Jews and castles in medieval England: Transactions &amp; Miscellanies" Jewish Historical Society of England, Vol. 28 (1981-1982), pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional differences==

===France===
{{Main|Châtelain}}
In France, castellans (known in [[French language|French]] as [[châtelain]]s) who governed castles without resident nobles acquired considerable powers, and the position actually became a hereditary [[fiefdom]]. By the tenth century, the fragmentation of power became so widespread in [[Mâcon]] that the castellany was considered the basic unit of governance, without effective levels above it - the counts of Mâcon were largely ignored by their castellans from about 980 to 1030. In the 12th century ''châtelains'' had become lords, they expanded their territories to include taking weaker castellanies under their control, as when then castellan of [[Beaujeu, Rhône|Beaujeu]] took over lands in [[Lyons]], or when [[Uxelles]] annexed [[Briançon]], then [[Sennecey-le-Grand]] and L'Épervieres.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p. 440-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, the castellans never managed to rise to the lordship and they remained a local officer of an overlord. During the Ancien Régime, castellans were heads of the local royal administration, but their power was delegated to their lieutenants.

All remaining lordships and royal local administration were suppressed during the [[French Revolution]]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, ''châtelain'' is used to describe the owner of a castle or manor house, in many cases a figure of authority in his parish, akin the English [[squire]].

===Germany===
{{main|Burgmann}}
[[File:Festung Hohensalzburg (2).jpg|thumb|right|The fortress of [[Hohensalzburg]], Austria, had a ministerial castellan]] In Germany the castellan was known as a ''[[Burgmann]]'', or sometimes ''Hauptmann'' ("captain"), who reported to the lord of the castle, or ''Burgherr'', also often known as the [[burgrave]] (''Burggraf''). The ''burgmann'' may have been either a free noble or a ''[[ministerialis]]'', but either way administered the castle as a [[vassal]]. A ''ministerialis'', being wholly indebted to a lord, was more easily controlled. ''Ministeriales'' replaced free nobles as castellans of [[Hohensalzburg]] under Conrad I of Abensberg’s tenure as Archbishop of Salzburg from 1106 to 1147, starting with Henry of Seekirchen in the 1130s.&lt;ref&gt;Freed, John B. "Noble Bondsmen: Ministerial Marriages in the Archdiocese of Salzburg,
1100-1343." Cornell University Press, 1995. pp. 39-40&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In the Medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] usually was called "várnagy", and in the Latin charts it appeared as "castellanus". The lord of the castle had very similar functions than the German ones. In Hungary first the King, later the most powerful noblemen designed the castellans between their followers for the administration of their castles and the states that belonged to the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varturak.hu/magyar/oldalak/varnagyok/|title=Várnagyok|author=|date=|website=www.varturak.hu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513205848/http://www.varturak.hu/magyar/oldalak/varnagyok/|archivedate=2016-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerusalem===
At times, there was a castellan among the [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem]], starting with Anselm (castellan, c. 1110).

===Malta===
{{see also|Castellania (Valletta)}}
*{{cite book|last=Micallef|first=Antonio|title=Lectures on the Statutes of the Sacred Order of St. John of Jerusalem: at the University (of Studies) of Malta 1792|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VhVTuRCiV3AC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=castellania+Valletta#v=onepage&amp;q=castellania%20Valletta&amp;f=false|publisher=KIT Scientific Publishing|date=2012|pages=130–134|isbn=978-3-86644-402-7}}

===Poland===
{{main|Castellans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
In the [[History of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and later the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the castellans ({{Lang-pl|Kasztelan}}) were in most cases lower in precedence to the [[voivode]]s (with the exception of the [[Burgrave]] of [[Kraków]] [Polish ''Burgrabia krakowski''] who had precedence before the [[Voivode]] of [[Kraków]]). Castellans were in charge of a part of a [[voivodeship]] called the castellany (Polish ''Kasztelania'') until the 15th-century and from that time on their domain was divided into [[province]]s for greater castellans, and [[powiat]]s for minor castellans. Castellans in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were of [[senator]] rank.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, a castellan was known as ''alcaide''. Later, the role of ''alcaide'' became an honorary title awarded by the [[King of Portugal]] to certain nobles. As the honorary holder of the office of ''alcaide'' did not often live near its castle, a delegate of him started to be appointed to effectively govern it. An honorary holder of the office became known as ''alcaide-mor'' (major ''alcaide'') and its delegate became known as ''alcaide pequeno'' (little ''alcaide'') or ''alcaide-menor'' (minor ''alcaide).

==Castellany==
[[File:BrugseVrije1664.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Brugse Vrije]], a castellany of the [[County of Flanders]]]]

A '''castellany''', or castellania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur|last=Enenkel|date=1908|origyear=1856 |url=https://archive.org/stream/newdictionaryofe00eneniala/newdictionaryofe00eneniala_djvu.txt|title=A new dictionary of the English and Italian languages, containing the whole vocabulary in general use with copious selections of scientific, technical and commercial terms and others lately brought into use with their pronunciation figured|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term denoting a [[district]] administered by a castellan. Castellanies appeared during the [[Middle Ages]] and in most current [[Sovereign state|states]] are now replaced by a more modern type of [[country subdivision]]. The word is derived from [[castle]] and literally means the extent of [[Real property|land]] and [[jurisdiction]] belonging to a given castle.

It also renders equivalent, often cognate, terms in other languages. Examples of French ''châtelainies'' include the castellanies of [[Ivry-la-Bataille]], [[Nonancourt]], [[Pacy]], [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]] and [[Gaillon]], all in Normandy, which under in the treaty of Issoudun (1195, after a war with king Richard of England) were acquired for the French crown by Philip Augustus. Examples from Poland include [[Leczyca]] and [[Sieradz]] (both once a duchy), [[Spycimierz]], [[Rozprza]], [[Wolbórz]] and [[Wojnicz]] (in Cracow diocese) and [[Otmuchow]] in Silesia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15854">'''Civic space''' is created by a set of universally-accepted rules, which allow people to organise, participate and communicate  with each other freely and without hindrance, and in doing so, influence the political and social structures around them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://monitor.civicus.org/whatiscivicspace/ CIVICUS Monitor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transparencyinitiative.theideabureau.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/TAI-Civic-Space-Study-v13-FINAL.pdf Transparency and Accountability Initiative, Improving the Measurement of Civic Space]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept central to any open and [[democracy|democratic]] society and means that states have a [[duty to protect]] people while respecting and facilitating&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/InternationalLaw.aspx State duty respect, protect and fulfil]&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[fundamental rights]] to [[Freedom of association|associate]], [[Freedom of assembly|assemble]] peacefully and [[Freedom of expression|express]] views and opinions.

== History ==
Although the term "civic space" has only been in common usage since after the turn of this millennium, the rights upon which the concept is based have been a necessary feature of every democratic society. Global civil society alliance [[CIVICUS]] began using the term regularly after the inception of the Civic Space Initiative in 2011, defining it as "the place, physical, virtual, and legal, where people exercise their rights to freedom of association, expression, and peaceful assembly. By forming associations, by speaking out on issues of public concern, by gathering together in online and offline fora, and by participating in public decision-making, individuals use civic space to solve problems and improve lives. A robust and protected civic space forms the cornerstone of accountable, responsive democratic governance and stable societies." Civic space is also closely connected to the development of post–World War II human rights norms, and particularly the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] in 1948 which established clear protections for the rights to freedom of association, peaceful assembly and expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights - United Nations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a concept, civic space is also closely related to the evolution of the concept of [[civil society]]. While the ideas embodied in civil society can be traced to many different civilisations, the term civil society has many different definitions but has its roots in ancient Greece and the early work of [[Aristotle]] on the concepts of "[[community]]" or "[[polity]]" characterised by a shared set of [[norm (social)|norm]]s or [[ethos]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Language here is adapted from the Wikipedia article on [[civil society]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists interpret civil society very closely to the modern understanding of civic space, taking it to mean "the elements such as freedom of speech, an [[independent judiciary]], etc, that make up a democratic society."&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the discussions among thinkers of Eastern and Central Europe, civil society is seen also as a concept of [[civic values]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Taken directly from the [[civil society]] article&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern-day definitions of civil society however view it more in terms of "the arena, outside of the family, the state and the market where people associate to advance common interests."&lt;ref&gt;This is the CIVICUS definition, as employed in the [http://www.civicus.org/media/CSI_Ghana_Country_Report.pdf CSI]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protection of rights ==
Core civic space rights – the rights to freedom of association, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression – are guaranteed by law. States that are signatories of [[international conventions]] (such as the United Nations [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]) and other regional treaties containing similar provisions, are obliged to respect and protect these rights. These states are also obligated to protect these rights in domestic law and many of the ratifying States have included protection of these rights in their constitutions as fundamental freedoms.  States are obliged not only to respect and promote these rights but also to protect them from infringement by both state and [[non-state actors]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;CIVICUS, [http://www.civicus.org/images/stories/Compendium_International_Legal%20Instruments_Et_Al_2014.pdf Compendium Of International Legal Instruments And Other Inter-Governmental Commitments Concerning Core Civil Society Rights], January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a progressive [[constitution]] supported by a sound legislative framework that is upheld by a responsive and independent law enforcement machinery is key to enabling and preserving civic space. Notably, Goal 16 of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] framework agreed to by all UN member states promises to 'promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/|title=Sustainable Development Goals: 17 Goals to Transform Our World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a starting point, while there have been a number of international initiatives launched over recent years to defend civic space, civil society actors were lacking a strong common definition of the terms and shape of the civic space to be defended. To fill this gap, an informal meeting of CSOs, which took place in Bangkok in November 2015, asked the [[Berlin Civil Society Center|International Civil Society Centre]] to facilitate the development of a Civic Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://disrupt-and-innovate.org/civil-society-lets-join-forces-to-defend-our-rights/|title=Civil Society - Let's Join Forces to Defend our Rights - Disrupt &amp; Innovate|date=2016-03-22|work=Disrupt &amp; Innovate|access-date=2017-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civic Charter provides a global framework for people’s participation in shaping their societies. The two-page document, which people and organisations can sign on to and use as a basis for joint action, articulates a common set of civic and political rights. Aimed at civil society activists and their organisations, the Civic Charter connects those engaged in the everyday struggle for civic space – on a local, national, regional or international level. Firstly, it draws together the most crucial terms for civic participation in an easily understandable way. Secondly, it serves as a global reference framework to civil society actors for their rights enshrined in international law. Thirdly, it reaffirms people’s rights to participate in shaping their societies. The Civic Charter can provide a more effective basis for campaigning and advocacy for civic participation, as well as for promoting international solidarity with CSOs and activists in a specific country or region.&lt;ref&gt;https://civiccharter.org/about-the-civic-charter-how-it-came-about/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of association ===
The right to freely associate includes the right of every person without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, sexual orientation or other status,&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Universal Declaration on Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt;  to “establish a civil society organisation and also to freely join one or choosing not to participate. Individuals may operate civil society organisations and participate in their activities without fear or unwarranted interference. Freedom of association also encompasses the right to establish branches, recruit staff, raise funds freely, to fair taxation levels and to affiliate and cooperate with other organisations locally, nationally or internationally.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  It also includes the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests.&lt;ref name="Article 22"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx Article 22, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[International law]] protects the freedom of association and obligates states not to interfere with this right and only in instances where intervention by the state is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety or public order; the protection of public health or morals; or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&lt;ref name="Article 22"/&gt; Like the freedom of expression, the margin for restricting this right is very limited. State actions must lean in favour of permitting civil society activities and creating an enabling environment for civil society to function and thrive.

=== Freedom of expression ===
The right to freedom of expression entails, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the "freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ Article 19, Universal Declaration of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The right is fundamental to the existence of civil society. It includes "the right to access information, critically evaluate and speak out against the policies and actions of state and non-state actors, as well as publicly draw attention to and carry out advocacy actions to promote shared concerns, without fear of retribution from any quarter. Civil society organisations are also assured the freedom to carry out investigations and document their findings under this right."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 
 
According to international law (for example see Article 20 of the ICCPR), freedom of expression can only be restricted in certain limited circumstances, provided by law and where it is necessary to protect the rights and reputations of others and to safeguard national security, public order, public health and morals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx Article 19, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.article19.org/pages/en/limitations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of assembly ===
The right to freely assemble "assures civil society the freedom to exercise legitimate dissent through peaceful forms of [[protest]] as well as organise meetings and hold [[demonstration (protest)|demonstration]]s to forward matters of common interest."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  International law places the same limitations on the restriction of this right as in the case of freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, [[international standards]] limit the use of force by the authorities in managing public assemblies.

=== Violations ===
At the international level, civic space violations are regularly documented and reported&lt;ref&gt;For details of the latest violations, visit the [https://monitor.civicus.org CIVICUS Monitor]&lt;/ref&gt; by international human rights organisations like [[CIVICUS]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], the International Centre for Not-for-profit Law (ICNL), [[Article 19]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], Frontline Defenders, the [[International Service for Human Rights]], the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (FIDH) and others. At the regional, national and sub-national levels there are innumerable [[human rights organisation]]s, [[development organisations]], [[think tank]]s and [[academic institution]]s devoted to researching and campaigning on civic space issues.

Violations of civic space take many forms and can be perpetrated by the state - either directly through officials, police officers or security personnel, or at arm's length through agents or third parties - or non-state actors including criminal gangs, [[terrorist organisations]], [[private corporations]], [[political parties]], [[religious organisations]] and [[civil society]] groups themselves.

==== Non-exhaustive list of examples of civic space violations ====

States can violate freedom of association by establishing restrictive laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icnl.org/research/monitor/index.html ICNL Civic Freedoms Monitor] tracks the proposal, enactment and implementation of such laws&lt;/ref&gt; that restrict people's ability to freely form and operate groups to advance their interests or even prevent them for doing so. For example, in some countries, legislation banned organisations that work in certain topics like human rights to form legally. Moreover,  these restrictive laws place broad oversight powers in the hands of government institutions with which civil society organisations must register and to whom they must account or report regularly. In some cases those governmental oversight bodies have a discretionary power to suspend or terminate an organisation's registration. In the most extreme cases, penalties for noncompliance with NGO laws can include fines and imprisonment. In more  recent years, and with a spike in concern about international terrorism, more and more states have begun to pass anti-terrorism laws which negatively impact upon civic space, and particularly the ability of organisations to operate free from state interference.&lt;ref&gt;The Civil Society Platform on the FATF has campaigned vigorously to oppose such moves in recent years and [http://fatfplatform.org/ their website] contains a wealth of information on this topic&lt;/ref&gt;  States can restrict freedom of association by targeting members of the organisations, [[human rights defenders]] and [[activists]] using intimidation tactics, [[harassment]], [[travel bans]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]], among others.

Curtailing the ability to protest can be done within the legislative framework, when the norms in placed unduly restricted the right to assembly by imposing prior authorisation requirements, time and place restrictions, among others. In practice, this right can be restricted when security forces use excessive force to disperse protesters, arbitrary arrest them and even charge protesters with  provisions of the criminal code and even anti terrorism legislation.

Targeting free speech can take various forms. As the media plays a crucial role in disseminating information, States often overregulated media in order to limit, control or prevent critical and dissenting voices to express. In some cases, the [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralistic]] views are also undermined by [[media concentration]] in just a few private corporations. [[Criminalisation]] of [[dissent]] by using [[defamation]] provisions is also commonly used to restrict freedom of expression. Acts of violence against journalists and media workers for reason related to their professional work often occurs and limits the right to freedom of expression and access to information as it also prevents the public from accessing that information.

The internet is a unique tool that allowed individuals to communicate instantly, with a positive impact on the way we currently share and access information.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. General Assembly. [http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?m=85 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression]. A/66/290. August 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  For that reason, it is particularly targeted by authorities to curtail dissent. Some governments restrict the [[dissemination]] of content on certain sensitive issues by blocking access to social media platforms, deleting certain pages or content and even arresting people for disseminating sensitive information.

'''Civility''' comes from the word ''civilis'', which in Latin means "[[citizen]]". Civility is caused by a person's emotions or lack thereof. If a person is emotionally affected by the negative feedback that they get from other people in a psychologically normal manner then they are defined as civil.

== Etymology ==

[[Late Middle English]]: from [[Old French]] ''civilite'', from [[Latin]] ''civilitas'', from civilis 'relating to citizens' (see civil). In early use, the term denoted the state of being a citizen and hence good citizenship or orderly behavior. The sense 'politeness' arose in the mid-16th century.

==Developmental model==

Adolf G. Gundersen and Suzanne Goodney Lea have developed a civility model grounded in empirical data that "stresses the notion that civility is a sequence, not a single thing or set of things". The model conceives of civility as a continuum or scale consisting of increasingly demanding traits ranging from "indifference" to "commentary", "conversation", "co-exploration" and, from there, to "habituation". According to the authors, such a developmental model has several distinct advantages, not least of which is that it allows civility to be viewed as something everyone can get better at.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Gundersen, Adolf G., PhD, and Suzanne Goodney Lea, PhD" |title=Let's Talk Politics: Restoring Civility through Exploratory Discussion.

==Worldwide civility==

[[File:International Day of Peace &amp; Society For Women &amp; Child Development.png|thumb|130px| International Day of Peace is observed around the world each year on 21st of September.]]

===Movement to foster worldwide civility===
The [[International Day of Peace]] ("Peace Day") is observed by many countries on September 21. Peace day was first started in 1981 by declaration of the United Nations General Assembly. The voting was overwhelmingly in favor of enacting Peace Day, and so the observance was thus born. The goal of Peace Day is to help bring the world together, and share a collective attitude of peace and harmony. Many countries around the world celebrate September 21 as a day of non-violence and cease-fires to emulate the mission of global peace. Since its beginnings the day has spread more throughout the world, with many countries annually participating in this observance.

Participation is open to all people of the world. People may choose to celebrate Peace Day in different ways, but the goal is to have peace at the heart of all the activity's intentions. Individuals, businesses and organizations are also welcome and encouraged to celebrate Peace Day. Spreading peace and good will towards all mankind is the great aim that's in view for raising awareness for Peace Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://internationaldayofpeace.org/ |title=International Day of Peace |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |access-date=September 17, 2015 |quote=International Day of Peace (Also referred to as "Peace Day") is observed around the world each year on 21st of September. Established in 1981 by resolution 36/37, the United Nations General Assembly declared this day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and peoples. Furthering the Day’s mission, the General Assembly voted unanimously in 2001 to adopt resolution 55/282 establishing 21 September as an annual day of non-violence and cease-fire.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the [[Global Peace Index]] (GPI) was launched in an attempt to measure the relative ranking of peacefulness around different countries around the world. Today, the Global Peace Index is maintained the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], and is conducted on an annual basis. The index primarily measures three different categories to determine the level of peace in the world. These levels look at the overall security, crime levels, and the build up of military forces. By measuring levels of peace, the hope is that a greater general awareness and attention is given towards making the world a more peaceful place.&lt;ref&gt;Information about indicators and methodology {{cite web | title =2014 Global Peace Index | publisher =Institute for Economics and Peace | url =http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/2014%20Global%20Peace%20Index%20REPORT.pdf | accessdate =2015-06-02 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150221185512/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/2014%20Global%20Peace%20Index%20REPORT.pdf | archivedate =2015-02-21 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==

===Opinion polls===

A 2010 Allegheny College poll found that nearly all Americans (95 percent) believe civility is important in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Peter|title=We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For: The Promise of Civic Renewal in America|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|asin=B00F51ZXII|edition=Kindle, first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 poll conducted by [[Weber Shandwick]], 65% of Americans reported an increase in incivility due to a weakened U.S. economy during the Great Recession. Almost 50% of those same Americans surveyed indicated they have removed themselves from participating in any politics because of fear of incivility or bullying. Of the 1000 people surveyed, a follow-up study revealed that 86% of those people reported being subjected to incivility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Ray Williams" |title=The Rise of Incivility and Bullying in America |publisher=Psychology Today |date=July 15, 2012 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201207/the-rise-incivility-and-bullying-in-america |accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this report, a part of an annual follow-up research report in January 2016 sharing findings on attitudes and sentiment about civility, 95% of Americans believe that incivility is a very visible issue, while 74% recognized that civility in general had declined during the past few years. Over 90% of voters claimed that the presidential candidates' attitudes and civil behavior would play a significant role in their voting decision in the upcoming 2016 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Ray Williams" |title=Nearly All Likely Voters Say Candidates’ Civility Will Affect Their Vote; New Poll Finds 93% Say Behavior Will Matter |publisher=Weber Shandwick |date=January 28, 2016 |url=http://www.webershandwick.com/news/article/nearly-all-likely-voters-say-candidates-civility-will-affect-their-vote |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement to foster civility in the U.S.===

====In government====
Many projects are led by State Supreme Courts to foster civility. One of these initiatives is led by the California Judicial Branch for their Civics Education Outreach program. The primary objective of this program is to teach young adults and students how democracy is supposed to function in the United States and other details about how legal processes work. The mission is to have students leave the program with a greater interest and understanding of U.S. courts, legal processes, and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Administrative Office of the Courts" |title=California Judicial Branch Outreach to Students:Highlights |publisher=California Judicial Branch |date=March 2011|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/factsheet-civics-outreach.pdf |accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the legal profession====
Penn State University conducted a study on perceptions of the legal professional and its relation to civility. They found that general opinion pointed to a drop or decline in civility with the legal profession. To counteract demeaning and unprofessional behavior, there has been several initiatives put in place by state bar associations. However, the legal profession is not the only industry that has adopted civility standards. Many other companies and organizations across several industries have adopted civility standards that have also help to increase workplace civility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="PennState University" |title=University Libraries Civility Statement and Guidelines |publisher=Penn State University Libraries |date=2017 |url=https://libraries.psu.edu/about/diversity/university-libraries-civility-statement-and-guidelines |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In schools====
Numerous universities in the U.S., such as the [[University of Colorado]], the [[University of Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="University of Missouri" |title=Civility, You, and Mizzou |publisher=University of Missouri |date=2015 |url=https://understand.missouri.edu/civility-you-mizzou/ |accessdate=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Civility Project|url=http://civilityproject.ucdavis.edu/|website=civilityproject.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johns Hopkins University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=User|first1=Administrative|title=JHU Dr. Forni's Civility Website|url=http://krieger.jhu.edu/civility|website=krieger.jhu.edu|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UW Oshkosh CivilityWorks|url=http://civilityworks.uwosh.edu/|website=CivilityWorks|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rutgers University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Relations|first1=Written by Sandra Lanman |title=Rutgers Project Advances Civility on Campus and Beyond|url=http://sas.rutgers.edu/news-events/student-news/1058-draft-2-rutgers-project-advances-civility-on-campus-and-beyond2nd-draft-for|website=Rutgers University, School of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Civility|url=https://www.american.edu/ocl/Civility.cfm|website=www.american.edu|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[California State University San Marcos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Student Life and Leadership California State University San Marcos" |title=The Civility Campaign |publisher=California State University San Marcos |date=2015 |url=http://www.csusm.edu/civility/ |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have created programs designed to foster and define what civility means on their campuses. Some colleges, such as the [[Arizona State University]], offer an undergraduate certificate in Civil Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Arizona State University" |title=Certificate in Civil Communication |publisher=Arizona State University |date=2017 |url=https://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/degrees/certificate-and-minor |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other universities, such as [[Kansas State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Kansas State University" |title= Institute for Civic Discourse and Democracy |publisher=Kansas State University |date=2017 |url=https://www.k-state.edu/icdd/ |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed programs in dialogue and deliberation which involve codes of behavior that foster constructive, civil discourse. Although many colleges have adopted programs to foster civility efforts, there are still many colleges and universities, including many of the [[Ivy League]] schools, that do not have or list no visible place online about any civility initiatives, codes or standards.

====In the community====
Numerous community groups have formed throughout the U.S. to restore constructive civility in the public space. The Civility Toolkit with approximately 300 civility tools aggregated by the Civility Center with a mission to help provide access to resources regarding civility and to help restore civility in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Civility Center" |title= The Civility Center Toolkit &amp; Resources |publisher=Civility Center 501(c)(3) |date=2015 |url=http://www.civilityresources.com/Civility-Resources.html |accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these groups are members of the National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation" |title= What We’re All About |publisher=NATIONAL COALITION FOR DIALOGUE &amp; DELIBERATION |date=2015 |url=http://icdd.k-state.edu/ |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs like iCivics, which was started by [[Sandra Day O'Conner]] U.S. Justice, provides educational tools for students that teach about the importance of actively taking part in democracy. Although some private schools offer courses geared to teach about the U.S. government and legal system, most public schools do not teach about the U.S. government until their junior or senior year in high school. To help bring these lessons into the classroom, O'Conner's program provides teachers with educational tools, such as printable goals, games, and various lesson plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="iCivics" |title= Our Story |publisher=iCivics |date=2015 |url=http://www.icivics.org/our-story|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnett and Arneson define civility "a metaphor that points to the importance of public respect in interpersonal interaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnett, Arneson |first=Ronald, Pat |date=September 30, 1999 |title=Dialogic Civility in a Cynical Age: Community, Hope, and Interpersonal Relationships |url= |location= |publisher=State University of New York Press |page=7 |isbn=978-0791443262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between tolerating someone, and respecting them are concerned with the outlook that toleration does not imply respect, but respect requires understanding of another person's perspective. Having [[social intelligence]] or "Social IQ" impacts our ability to empathize with people, and realize all people are human and that if respect or common ground cannot be met that we strive for at least toleration in order to be civil.

In ''Psychology Today'', Price-Mitchell describes civility as a personal attitude that acknowledges other humans' rights to live and coexist together in a manner that does not harm others. The Psychology of civility indicates awareness, ability to control oneself's passions, as well as have a deeper understanding of others are a part of civil obligation, which everyone should strive to participate. This may suggest that civility goes beyond mere toleration, but may inherently imply a mutual co-existence and respect for [[humankind]]. Some may relate this to the ideas expressed by singer [[John Lennon]] in the song "Imagine", with the words "Imagine all the people sharing all the world." Although the level of peace can be a subjective topic, many people would agree that it requires a certain degree of harmony and opposes violence in order to remain civil.

In the academic journal ''[[Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs]]'', Calhoun delineates civility as an element of dialogue that sheds light on "basic moral attitudes of respect, tolerance, and considerateness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Cheshire |last=Calhoun |title=The Virtue of Civility |journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs |location=251-275 |access-date=September 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic of civility is expansive, and can be viewed from many different perspectives. Calhoun considers civility to be a part of the moral virtues that can differ from what is socially acceptable, since what is socially acceptable is not always morally correct.

====Masons and Civility====
The Freemasons and members of the entire Masonic family, have had a long history of fostering civil dialogue and building civil societies. Masonic Lodges represent a peaceful assembly of people that are of different places of origin, languages, backgrounds, and beliefs. In particular, the principles and tenets of Freemasonry's values aim to promote and restore civility in the United States and around the globe. In 2015, Grand Master Charvonia of the Grand Lodge of California declared May 25, 2015 to be the "Champion Civility Month", which encouraged Freemasons throughout California to make an effort to bring more civility into their local lodges and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Freemason.org" |title= Champion Civility This May |publisher=Freemason.org |date= May 2015 |url=https://freemason.org/newsEvents/article.htm;jsessionid=4F774C610EC8EFC302FF60B9A7FFDE4B?id=10759 |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Freemasons from around the world have been working to repair civility through the Masonic Family Civility Project. This Civility Project was built to help raise awareness of Civility, and by providing social conversations, civility resources, multimedia education, and information for anyone to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Masonic Family Civility Project" |title= Using Masonic Values to Promote Civility|publisher=masoniccivility.org |date= December 2017 |url=http://www.masoniccivility.org/document-resources/ |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the workplace===

Recent studies and polls from 2014 indicate that Americans find [[workplace incivility]] to be a growing problem that has had a negative impact on them and their duties at work. One study's research suggests 60% of employees think that their co-workers' irritating habits to have negatively affected them at their job. In the same study, 40% reported that they are looking for another job opportunity because of another negative co-worker. These studies suggest that incivility in the workplace dampens productivity and an adverse effect on an organization's bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Barbara Richman" |title=  Ten Tips for Creating Respect and Civility in Your Workplace |publisher=Lorman |date=May 28, 2014 |url=http://www.lorman.com/resources/ten-tips-for-creating-respect-and-civility-in-your-workplace-15463 |accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this data is only looking to quantify how widespread workplace incivility is in the workplace, it does not account for how many people encounter workplace incivility and are not sure what they can do about it. Furthermore, it is not taking into consideration how many of these workplaces have civility tools or initiatives at the researched companies.

Numerous organizations, including the United States government, have actively attempted to put in place measures to prevent incivility in the workforce. One measure that was initiated to reduce workplace incivility, was processing cases of [[sexual harassment]] to be illegal, which is defined by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ([[EEOC]]) as being against the law in every state to harass any person during the employment or hiring process because of that person's [[gender]]. Harassment can include "sexual harassment", but is not limited to workplace bullying, cyber bullying, physical and verbal threats.&lt;ref name="eeoc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm | title = Sexual Harassment | publisher = U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many would agree that sexual harassment is an issue that should be illegal, it has really been in the spotlight of the attention in the U.S. since 1964. Because of the legal ramifications from poor prior classification of sexual harassment cases in the past, its boundaries were more loosely interpreted and more people were subject to unwanted contact or attention. Since this the term has been redefined, people are greater protected from a legal perspective in their place of work, but must actively participate in preventing these issues by speaking up and/or reporting issues. The definition for these laws are still being written today, as more people are speaking out against the abuse.

===Lack of civility===

[[Incivility]] is the polar opposite of civility, or in other words a lack or completely without civility. Verbal or physical attacks on others, [[cyber bullying]], [[rudeness]], [[religious intolerance]], [[discrimination]], and [[vandalism]] are just some of the acts that are generally considered acts of incivility. Incivility is a negative part of society that has impacted many people in the United States, but as the world is becoming increasingly more transparent in social interactions, it has become more increasingly apparent that incivility has become an issue on the global stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Incivility in Political Discourse (The Coming Apogee of the Moonbat Hordes) |work= InDC Journal |url= http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |accessdate= 2006-11-25 |date= 2004-10-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130103133948/http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |archivedate= 2013-01-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media and the web have given people the ability around the globe to freely exchange ideas, but it has not come without its consequences.

Politicians in the U.S. have frequently cited that they encounter a lack of civility in their workplace, and have disregarded it as unfortunate aspect of politics, but polls indicate that "going negative" can help candidates win elections. During the 2016 presidential campaign, candidate [[Donald Trump]] has regularly called his rivals "stupid, incompetent and losers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Bush Appeals for Civility in GOP Race |work=US News |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/ken-walshs-washington/2015/07/28/bush-appeals-for-civility-in-gop-race |accessdate=2015-08-16 |date= 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing that incivility online, more commonly referred to as cyber bullying, has become an increasing problem that takes away from a positive online experience. Recognizing that people harassing others online has become a problem and can have negative consequences for businesses, many companies have stepped up to create more awareness and initiatives to help. [[Intel]] in collaboration with organizations such as the [[Born This Way Foundation]] and [[Vox Media]] have made an initiative called "Hack Harassment" aimed to increase awareness of online harassment and anti-harassment technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Hack Harassment |work= Hack Harassment |url=http://www.hackharassment.com/ |accessdate=2016-01-17 |date= 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no claim of solution for what can be done to stop online harassment, but many studies suggest that a large number of people are harassed online.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Although there are many tactics to block cyber-bullying, such as censorship and banning users from accessing a site, it does not correct the underlying issues on what causes it in the first place. Although blocking people online from bullying others may solve some of the issues on the web, it may only manifest itself in other forms offline and in person where the possibility for violence and other physical harm could take place.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On April 22, 2016 The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the [[University of Chicago]] released a report citing that 74 percent of Americans think manners and behavior have declined in the United States. In this study they discovered that people in most cases can agree with what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. They found that 8 out of 10 Americans find jokes made based on race, gender, or sexuality are considered inappropriate, but only a small number of people owning up to actually making these types of jokes ever. Although there were some differences between age demographics on newer technologies, such as the use of cell phones. The report suggests that nearly half of all Americans 18-29 find it acceptable to use their cell phones in a restaurant, while less than 22 percent of people over the age of 60 years old agrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Americans believe civility is on the decline |work= The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Chicago |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422201040.htm |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date= 2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==

===Movement to foster civility in Canada===

In July 2012, the President of the [[Federation of Law Societies of Canada]] made a strong point on civility at the 5th Biennial International Legal Ethics Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wooley |first=Alice |year=2013 |title= 'Uncivil by Too Much Civility'? Critiquing Five More Years of Civility Regulation in Canada|journal=Dalhousie Law Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |page=239 |ssrn=2186930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation is often very open for interpretation, unless strictly and prohibitively defined by law, but in most cases where the law is yet to be defined many lawyers can see opportunity to act immorally to win their case. The "anything to get the job done" mentality can not only have negative consequences in the legal system, but it could possibly further spread the potential for laws and regulations to be exploited in immoral manner.

Additionally, during 2012, the Law Society of Upper Canada decided that Joe Groia was guilty of his incivility to opposing counsel during his successful defense of John Felderhof from [[Insider trading]] and securities charges. On the same case, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] confirmed the decision of [[Bar of Quebec]] that Giles Dore was guilty of professional misconduct because of an uncivil letter he wrote to a judge. This high-profile case brought a lot of attention to the legal definition of the word civility, and what it means to be civil in the legal profession. It has since defined a broader set of rules of what is legally considered civil in the court of law in Canada.

Since the case with Joe Groia, [[The Law Society of Upper Canada]] has launched several initiatives to guard against incivility in the Canadian legal profession. To enforce The Law Society's stance on the issues of civility in the Canadian legal system, they have issued verbal warnings to lawyers who are not civil with judges and other lawyers. The counter argument against civility measures in if the new guidelines inhibit their ability to defend their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Has the so-called civility movement already won? |work=National Magazine |url=http://www.nationalmagazine.ca/Articles/January-2015-Web/Out-of-order.aspx |accessdate=2015-09-17 |date= 2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since laws and rules are often open to interpretation, some lawyers consider it a [[conflict of interest]] to be civil with their opponents as they do not believe there is any way to accomplish their goals while remaining civil.

In January 2017, the BC &amp; Yukon Freemasons in Canada stated civility being like The [[Golden Rule]], defined as "treating others as you would want them to treat you". This statement was in part to a recent civility initiative grounded in respect and attitude of inclusiveness with family, community, and the society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=January 20, 2017 |title=Freemason’s Civility Initiative Outline by BC and Yukon Freemasons- 2017|publisher= Masonic Civility |quote= Civility can simply be defined as treating others as you would want them to treat you.  |url=http://www.masoniccivility.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/freemasons_civility_initiative_outline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In New Zealand==

===Movement to foster civility in New Zealand===

At a recent address with Gisborne's top businesswomen in early 2016, Lara Meyer an adviser to the Australian Government cited incivility in the workplace has cost New Zealand approximately $15 Million a year. Noting that Australia is also losing out about $26 Million a year due to a lack of workplace civility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Counting the cost of rudeness |work=The Gisborne Herald |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/2255300-135/counting-the-cost-of-rudeness |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date= 2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There could even potentially be more loss that is unaccounted for in New Zealand businesses, as the cost of rudeness could be holding them back from working together more politely and agreeably.

{{Redirect-distinguish2|Deontology|the opposite of [[Ontology]]}} 

In [[moral philosophy]], '''deontological ethics''' or '''deontology''' (from Greek [[:wikt:δέον|δέον]], ''deon'', "obligation, duty"&lt;ref&gt;from the verb [[:wikt:δέω|δέω]] "bind, tie, fetter", via the present participle stem ''deont-'' + the suffix ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;)
is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/deontology | title=Deontology dictionary definition &amp;#124; deontology defined}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes described as "[[duty]]-" or "obligation-" or "rule-" based ethics, because rules "bind one to one's duty".&lt;ref name="Waller, Bruce N 2005"&gt;Waller, Bruce N. 2005. ''Consider Ethics: Theory, Readings, and Contemporary Issues''. New York: Pearson Longman: 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted to [[consequentialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Antony. 1979. "Consequentialism". In ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd Ed.). New York: St Martins: 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[virtue ethics]], and [[pragmatic ethics]]. In this [[terminology]], action is more important than the consequences.

It is an ethical framework that depends on the predefined sets of rules and policies for the proper functioning of a system in the environment. The deontology is simply based on the checklist which includes certain rules to be followed while performing a particular task. According to this framework, the work is considered virtuous only if this checklist is completed.
This procedure is very simple to implement and understand. Minimum time is consumed to decide between right and wrong However, its simplicity ignores the consequences of the decision taken under this approach.

The term ''deontological'' was first used to describe the current, specialised definition by [[C. D. Broad]] in his book, ''Five Types of Ethical Theory'', which was published in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp, Tom L. 1991 ''Philosophical Ethics: An Introduction to Moral Philosophy'', 2nd Ed. New York: McGraw Hill: 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Older usage of the term goes back to [[Jeremy Bentham]], who coined it before 1816 as a synonym of ''Dicastic'' or ''Censorial Ethics'' (i.e. ethics based on judgement).&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham, ''Chrestomathia'' (1816), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rqIIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA213  p. 213]:
"For a synonym, ''Dicastic Ethics'' may have the single-worded appellative ''Deontology''. [''Deontology''.] From two Greek words, the first of which signifies ''fit, fitting, right, becoming, proper''. Deontology&amp;mdash;an account or indication of that which, on the occasion in question, whatsoever it be, is&amp;mdash;(i.e. by him who speaks or writes, is regarded as being)&amp;mdash;''fit, fitting, becoming, proper''. It is in  ''sound'' only, and not in ''signification'', that it has any connexion with the word ''ontology'',&lt;!--misprinted as outology  --&gt; employed above. Applied to every branch of Ethics, taken in the largest sense of the word ''Ethics'', the use of such a word as ''Deontology'' affords a promise of being attended with considerable convenience. It will accord equally well with every system which ever has been, or ever can be, devised, in relation to the foundation of moral obligation :&amp;mdash;in the use of it, no such incongruity and presumption is involved, as that which is called ''petitio principii''&amp;mdash;i.e. a begging of the question&amp;mdash;an assumption of the matter in dispute."

Also explained as "the knowledge of what is right and proper": 
"Deontology is derived from the Greek words, το  δεον  (that which is proper) and  Λογια, knowledge &amp;mdash; meaning the knowledge of what is right and proper; and it is here specially applied to the subject of morals, or that part of the field of action which is not the object of public legislation. As an art, it is the doing what is fit to be done; as a science, the knowing what is fit to be done on every occasion." 
''Deontology or, The science of morality : in which the harmony and co-incidence of duty and self-interest, virtue and felicity, prudence and benevolence, are explained and exemplified : from the MSS. of Jeremy Bentham'' ed. Bowring (1834), p. [https://archive.org/stream/deontologyorthes01bentuoft#page/21/mode/2up 21].&lt;/ref&gt;
The more general sense of the word is retained in French, especially in the term ''code de déontologie'' ([[ethical code]]), in the context of [[professional ethics]].

Depending on the system of deontological ethics under consideration, a '''moral obligation''' may arise from an [[Externality|external]] or internal source, such as a set of rules inherent to the universe ([[ethical naturalism]]), [[religious law]], or a set of personal or cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] (any of which may be in conflict with personal desires).
 
==Deontological philosophies==
There are numerous formulations of deontological ethics.

===Kantianism===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]|right]]
{{Main|Kantian ethics}}
[[Immanuel Kant]]'s theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Orend, Brian. 2000. ''War and International Justice: A Kantian Perspective''. West Waterloo, Ontario: [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]]: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Eugene. 2006. ''The Basics of Western Philosophy''. Greenwood Press: 160.&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (''Pflicht'').&lt;ref&gt;
Thomas Kingsmill Abbott (trans.), [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kant/immanuel/k16e/#nr1 Immanuel Kant, ''The Metaphysical Elements of Ethics''], 1889 [Preface and Introduction to  [http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Kant,+Immanuel/Die+Metaphysik+der+Sitten/Zweiter+Teil.+Metaphysische+Anfangsgr%C3%BCnde+der+Tugendlehre ''Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Tugendlehre''], 1797]. Abbott's ''deontology'' translates Kant's {{lang|de|Pflichtenlehre}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives of the person who carries out the action.

Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way one must act purely from duty begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself and good without qualification.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. "First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical", [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt; Something is "good in itself" when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and "good without qualification", when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], [[wikt:perseverance|perseverance]] and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:
{{quote|Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. "First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical", [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}Kant then argues that the consequences of an act of willing cannot be used to determine that the person has a good will; good consequences could arise by accident from an action that was motivated by a desire to cause harm to an innocent person, and bad consequences could arise from an action that was well-motivated. Instead, he claims, a person has a good will when he 'acts out of respect for the moral law'.&lt;ref name="transition" /&gt; People 'act out of respect for the moral law' when they act in some way ''because'' they have a duty to do so. So, the only thing that is truly good in itself is a good will, and a good will is only good when the willer chooses to do something because it is that person's duty, i.e. out of "respect" for the law. He defines respect as "the concept of a worth which thwarts my self-love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals|year=1785|publisher=Project Gutenberg|page=23|edition=10|editor=Thomas Kingsmill Abbott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's three significant formulations of the [[categorical imperative]] are:
* Act only according to that [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] by which you can also will that it would become a universal law.
* Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.
* Every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends.

Kant argued that the only [[moral absolutism|absolutely good]] thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. If they are acting on a bad maxim, e.g. "I will lie", then their action is wrong, even if some good consequences come of it.
In his essay, ''On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns'', arguing against the position of 
[[Benjamin Constant]], ''Des réactions politiques'', Kant states that "Hence a lie defined merely as an intentionally untruthful declaration to another man does not require the additional condition that it must do harm to another, as jurists require in their definition (''mendacium est falsiloquium in praeiudicium alterius''). For a lie always harms another; if not some human being, then it nevertheless does harm to humanity in general, inasmuch as it vitiates the very source of right [''Rechtsquelle''] ... All practical principles of right must contain rigorous truth ... This is because such exceptions would destroy the universality on account of which alone they bear the name of principles."&lt;ref&gt;"Über ein vermeintes Recht aus Menschenliebe zu lügen", ''Berlinische Blätter'' 1 (1797), 301-314; edited in: ''Werke in zwölf Bänden'', vol. 8, Frankfurt am Main (1977), [http://www.zeno.org/nid/20009192123 zeno.org/nid/20009192123]. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine command theory===
{{Main|Divine command theory}}
[[Right of revolution|Although]] not all deontologists are religious, some believe in the 'divine command theory', which is actually a cluster of related theories which essentially state that an action is right if God has decreed that it is right.&lt;ref&gt;Wierenga, Edward. 1983. "A Defensible Divine Command Theory". ''Noûs'', Vol. 17, No. 3: 387–407.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Ralph Cudworth]], an English philosopher, [[William of Ockham]], [[René Descartes]], and eighteenth-century [[Calvinists]] all accepted various versions of this moral theory, as they all held that moral obligations arise from God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, Ralph. 1731. ''A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality''. Reprinted in 1996. Sarah Hutton (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Divine Command Theory is a form of deontology because, according to it, the rightness of any action depends upon that action being performed because it is a duty, not because of any good consequences arising from that action. If God commands people not to work on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], then people act rightly if they do not work on Sabbath ''because God has commanded that they do not do so''. If they do not work on Sabbath because they are lazy, then their action is not truly speaking "right", even though the actual physical action performed is the same. If God commands not to covet a neighbour's goods, this theory holds that it would be immoral to do so, even if coveting provides the beneficial outcome of a drive to succeed or do well.

One thing that clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is that Kantianism maintains that man, as a rational being, makes the moral law universal, whereas divine command maintains that God makes the moral law universal.

===Contemporary deontology===
[[Contemporary philosophy|Contemporary]] deontologists (scholars born in the first half of the 20th century) include [[Józef Maria Bocheński]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[T. M. Scanlon|Thomas Scanlon]], and [[Roger Scruton]].

Bocheński (1965) makes a distinction between deontic and [[epistemology|epistemic]] authority.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Bocheński (1965), Analysis of authority, in ''The Logic of Religion,'' New York: New York University Press, {{ISBN|978-0814700501}}, pages 162–173&lt;/ref&gt; 
A typical example of epistemic authority in Bocheński's usage would be "the relation of a teacher to his students" or "the relation between an employer and his employee".&lt;ref name=annabrozek115/&gt; A teacher has epistemic authority when making declarative sentences that the student presumes is reliable knowledge and appropriate but feels no obligation to accept or obey; in contrast, an employer has deontic authority in the act of issuing an order that the employee is obliged to accept and obey regardless of its reliability or appropriateness.&lt;ref name=annabrozek115&gt;[[Anna Brożek]] (2013), [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11212-013-9175-9 Bocheński on authority], Studies in East European Thought, Volume 65, Issue 1, pages 115–133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deontology and consequentialism===
{{see|Trolley problem|Consequentialism|Utilitarianism|Effective altruism}}
[[Frances Kamm]]'s "Principle of Permissible Harm" (1996) is an effort to derive a deontological constraint which coheres with our considered case judgments while also relying heavily on Kant's [[categorical imperative]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamm, F. M. 1996. ''Morality, Mortality Vol. II: Rights, Duties, and Status''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Principle states that one may harm in order to save more if and only if the harm is an effect or an aspect of the greater good itself. This principle is meant to address what Kamm feels are most people's considered case judgments, many of which involve deontological intuitions. 
For instance, Kamm argues that we believe it would be impermissible to kill one person to harvest his organs in order to save the lives of five others. Yet, we think it is morally permissible to divert a [[trolley problem|runaway trolley]] that would otherwise kill five [[innocent]] and immobile [[people]] onto a side track where one innocent and immobile person will be killed. 
Kamm believes the Principle of Permissible Harm explains the moral difference between these and other cases, and more importantly expresses a constraint telling us exactly when we may not act to bring about good ends—such as in the organ harvesting case. 
In 2007, Kamm published a book that presents new theory that incorporates aspects of her "Principle of Permissible Harm", the "Doctrine of Productive Purity".&lt;ref&gt;Kamm, F. M. 2007. 'Chapter 5: Toward the Essence of Nonconsequentialist Constraints on Harming.'. In ''Intricate Ethics: Rights, Responsibilities, and Permissible Harm''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-518969-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the "Principle of Permissible Harm", the "Doctrine of Productive Purity" is an attempt to provide a deontological prescription for determining the circumstances in which people are permitted to act in a way that harms others.

Attempts have been made to reconcile deontology with virtue-based ethics and [[consequentialism]]. 
[[Iain King]]'s 2008 book ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'' uses [[quasi-realism]] and a modified form of [[utilitarianism]] to develop deontological principles which are compatible with ethics based on [[Virtue ethics|virtues]] and consequences. King develops a hierarchy of principles to link his meta-ethics, which are more inclined towards consequentialism, with the deontological conclusions he presents in his book.&lt;ref name="King2008"&gt;{{cite book| last = King| first = Iain| title = How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time| url = https://books.google.com/?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;pg=PA220| date = 2008| publisher = Continuum| isbn = 978-1-84706-347-2| page = 245 }} Page 220 of this book lists fourteen deontological principles, which it describes as "The first fourteen principles of right and wrong".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18858">In [[computer science]], '''divide and conquer''' is an [[algorithm design paradigm]] based on multi-branched [[recursion]]. A divide and conquer [[algorithm]] works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

This divide and conquer technique is the basis of efficient algorithms for all kinds of problems, such as [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] (e.g., [[quicksort]], [[merge sort]]), [[multiplication algorithm|multiplying large numbers]] (e.g. the [[Karatsuba algorithm]]), finding the [[Closest pair of points problem|closest pair of points]], [[syntactic analysis]] (e.g., [[top-down parser]]s), and computing the [[discrete Fourier transform]] ([[fast Fourier transform|FFT]]s) {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

Understanding and designing divide and conquer algorithms is a complex skill that requires a good understanding of the nature of the underlying problem to be solved. As when proving a [[theorem]] by [[Mathematical induction|induction]], it is often necessary to replace the original problem with a more general or complicated problem in order to initialize the recursion, and there is no systematic method for finding the proper generalization{{Clarify|date=October 2017}}. These divide and conquer complications are seen when optimizing the calculation of a [[Fibonacci_number#Matrix form|Fibonacci number with efficient double recursion]] {{Why|date=October 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

The correctness of a divide and conquer algorithm is usually proved by [[mathematical induction]], and its computational cost is often determined by solving [[recurrence relation]]s.

== Divide and conquer ==
[[File:Merge sort algorithm diagram.svg|thumb|Divide-and-conquer approach to sort the list (38,27,43,3,9,82,10) in increasing order. ''Upper half:'' splitting into sublists; ''mid:'' a one-element list is trivially sorted; ''lower half:'' composing sorted sublists.]] 
The divide and conquer paradigm is often used to find the optimal solution of a problem. Its basic idea is to decompose a given problem into two or more similar, but simpler, subproblems, to solve them in turn, and to compose their solutions to solve the given problem. Problems of sufficient simplicity are solved directly. 
For example, to sort a given list of ''n'' natural numbers, split it into two lists of about ''n''/2 numbers each, sort each of them in turn, and interleave both results appropriately to obtain the sorted version of the given list (cf. picture). This approach is known as the [[merge sort]] algorithm.

The name "divide and conquer" is sometimes applied to algorithms that reduce each problem to only one sub-problem, such as the [[binary search]] algorithm for finding a record in a sorted list (or its analog in [[numerical algorithm|numerical computing]], the [[bisection algorithm]] for [[root-finding algorithm|root finding]]).&lt;ref name=CLR&gt;Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, and Ronald L. Rivest, ''Introduction to Algorithms'' (MIT Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  These algorithms can be implemented more efficiently than general divide-and-conquer algorithms; in particular, if they use [[tail recursion]], they can be converted into simple [[loop (computing)|loop]]s.  Under this broad definition, however, every algorithm that uses recursion or loops could be regarded as a "divide and conquer algorithm".  Therefore, some authors consider that the name "divide and conquer" should be used only when each problem may generate two or more subproblems.&lt;ref&gt;Brassard, G. and Bratley, P. Fundamental of Algorithmics, Prentice-Hall, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The name '''decrease and conquer''' has been proposed instead for the single-subproblem class.&lt;ref&gt;Anany V. Levitin, ''Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms'' (Addison Wesley, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

An important application of divide and conquer is in optimization{{Examples|date=October 2017}}, where if the search space is reduced ("pruned") by a constant factor at each step, the overall algorithm has the same asymptotic complexity as the pruning step, with the constant depending on the pruning factor (by summing the [[geometric series]]); this is known as [[prune and search]].

== Early historical examples ==
Early examples of these algorithms are primarily decrease and conquer – the original problem is successively broken down into ''single'' subproblems, and indeed can be solved iteratively.

Binary search, a decrease and conquer algorithm where the subproblems are of roughly half the original size, has a long history. While a clear description of the algorithm on computers appeared in 1946 in an article by [[John Mauchly]], the idea of using a sorted list of items to facilitate searching dates back at least as far as [[Babylonia]] in 200&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Knuth3/&gt; Another ancient decrease and conquer algorithm is the [[Euclidean algorithm]] to compute the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers by reducing the numbers to smaller and smaller equivalent subproblems, which dates to several centuries BC.

An early example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm with multiple subproblems is [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]'s 1805 description of what is now called the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm|Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithm,&lt;ref name=Heideman84&gt;Heideman, M. T., D. H. Johnson, and C. S. Burrus, "Gauss and the history of the fast Fourier transform," IEEE ASSP Magazine, 1, (4), 14–21 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; although he did not [[analysis of algorithms|analyze its operation count]] quantitatively and FFTs did not become widespread until they were rediscovered over a century later.

An early two-subproblem D&amp;C algorithm that was specifically developed for computers and properly analyzed is the [[merge sort]] algorithm, invented by [[John von Neumann]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Knuth | first=Donald | authorlink=Donald Knuth | year=1998 | title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]]: Volume 3 Sorting and Searching | page=159 | isbn=0-201-89685-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable example is the [[Karatsuba algorithm|algorithm]] invented by [[Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba|Anatolii A. Karatsuba]] in 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Karatsuba | first=Anatolii A. | authorlink=Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba |author2=Yuri P. Ofman |authorlink2=Yuri Petrovich Ofman  | year=1962 | title=Умножение многозначных чисел на автоматах | journal=[[Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR]] | volume=146 | pages=293–294}} Translated in {{cite journal| title=Multiplication of Multidigit Numbers on Automata | journal=Physics-Doklady | volume=7 | year=1963 | pages=595–596 |url={{Google books|MrkOAAAAIAAJ|plainurl=true}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; that could multiply two ''n''-digit numbers in &lt;math&gt;O(n^{\log_2 3})&lt;/math&gt; operations (in [[Big O notation]]). This algorithm disproved [[Andrey Kolmogorov]]'s 1956 conjecture that &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; operations would be required for that task.

As another example of a divide and conquer algorithm that did not originally involve computers, [[Donald Knuth]] gives the method a [[post office]] typically uses to route mail: letters are sorted into separate bags for different geographical areas, each of these bags is itself sorted into batches for smaller sub-regions, and so on until they are delivered.&lt;ref name=Knuth3&gt;Donald E. Knuth, ''The Art of Computer Programming: Volume 3, Sorting and Searching'', second edition (Addison-Wesley, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to a [[radix sort]], described for [[IBM 80 series Card Sorters|punch-card sorting]] machines as early as 1929.&lt;ref name=Knuth3/&gt;

== Advantages ==

=== Solving difficult problems ===
Divide and conquer is a powerful tool for solving conceptually difficult problems: all it requires is a way of breaking the problem into sub-problems, of solving the trivial cases and of combining sub-problems to the original problem. Similarly, decrease and conquer only requires reducing the problem to a single smaller problem, such as the classic [[Tower of Hanoi]] puzzle, which reduces moving a tower of height ''n'' to moving a tower of height ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.

=== Algorithm efficiency ===
The divide-and-conquer paradigm often helps in the discovery of efficient algorithms.  It was the key, for example, to Karatsuba's fast multiplication method, the quicksort and mergesort algorithms, the [[Strassen algorithm]] for matrix multiplication, and fast Fourier transforms.

In all these examples, the D&amp;C approach led to an improvement in the [[asymptotic complexity|asymptotic cost]] of the solution.
For example, if (a) the [[Recursion (computer science)|base cases]] have constant-bounded size, the work of splitting the problem and combining the partial solutions is proportional to the problem's size ''n'', and (b) there is a bounded number ''p'' of subproblems of size ~ ''n''/''p'' at each stage, then the cost of the divide-and-conquer algorithm will be O(''n'' log&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''n'').

=== Parallelism ===
Divide and conquer algorithms are naturally adapted for execution in multi-processor machines, especially shared-memory systems where the communication of data between processors does not need to be planned in advance, because distinct sub-problems can be executed on different processors.

=== Memory access ===
Divide-and-conquer algorithms naturally tend to make efficient use of [[memory cache]]s. The reason is that once a sub-problem is small enough, it and all its sub-problems can, in principle, be solved within the cache, without accessing the slower main memory. An algorithm designed to exploit the cache in this way is called ''[[cache-oblivious algorithm|cache-oblivious]]'', because it does not contain the cache size as an explicit parameter.&lt;ref name="cahob"&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. Frigo |author2=C. E. Leiserson|author3=H. Prokop | title = Cache-oblivious algorithms | journal = Proc. 40th Symp. on the Foundations of Computer Science | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, D&amp;C algorithms can be designed for important algorithms (e.g., sorting, FFTs, and matrix multiplication) to be ''optimal'' cache-oblivious algorithms–they use the cache in a probably optimal way, in an asymptotic sense, regardless of the cache size. In contrast, the traditional approach to exploiting the cache is ''blocking'', as in [[loop nest optimization]], where the problem is explicitly divided into chunks of the appropriate size—this can also use the cache optimally, but only when the algorithm is tuned for the specific cache size(s) of a particular machine.

The same advantage exists with regards to other hierarchical storage systems, such as [[Non-Uniform Memory Access|NUMA]] or [[virtual memory]], as well as for multiple levels of cache: once a sub-problem is small enough, it can be solved within a given level of the hierarchy, without accessing the higher (slower) levels.

=== Roundoff control ===
In computations with rounded arithmetic, e.g. with [[floating point]] numbers, a divide-and-conquer algorithm may yield more accurate results than a superficially equivalent iterative method. For example, one can add ''N'' numbers either by a simple loop that adds each datum to a single variable, or by a D&amp;C algorithm called [[pairwise summation]] that breaks the data set into two halves, recursively computes the sum of each half, and then adds the two sums.  While the second method performs the same number of additions as the first, and pays the overhead of the recursive calls, it is usually more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Higham, "The accuracy of floating point summation", ''SIAM J. Scientific Computing'' '''14''' (4), 783–799 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation issues ==

=== Recursion ===
Divide-and-conquer algorithms are naturally implemented as [[Recursion_(computer_science)|recursive procedures]]. In that case, the partial sub-problems leading to the one currently being solved are automatically stored in the [[call stack|procedure call stack]]. A recursive function is a function that calls itself within its definition.

=== Explicit stack ===
Divide and conquer algorithms can also be implemented by a non-recursive program that stores the partial sub-problems in some explicit data structure, such as a [[stack (data structure)|stack]], [[queue (data structure)|queue]], or [[priority queue]].  This approach allows more freedom in the choice of the sub-problem that is to be solved next, a feature that is important in some applications — e.g. in [[breadth first recursion|breadth-first recursion]] and the [[branch and bound]] method for function optimization.  This approach is also the standard solution in programming languages that do not provide support for recursive procedures.

=== Stack size ===
In recursive implementations of D&amp;C algorithms, one must make sure that there is sufficient memory allocated for the recursion stack, otherwise the execution may fail because of [[stack overflow]].  D&amp;C algorithms that are time-efficient often have relatively small recursion depth.  For example, the quicksort algorithm can be implemented so that it never requires more than &lt;math&gt;\log_2 n&lt;/math&gt; nested recursive calls to  sort &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items.

Stack overflow may be difficult to avoid when using recursive procedures, since many compilers assume that the recursion stack is a contiguous area of memory, and some allocate a fixed amount of space for it.  Compilers may also save more information in the recursion stack than is strictly necessary, such as return address, unchanging parameters, and the internal variables of the procedure.  Thus, the risk of stack overflow can be reduced by minimizing the parameters and internal variables of the recursive procedure, or by using an explicit stack structure.

=== Choosing the base cases ===

In any recursive algorithm, there is considerable freedom in the choice of the ''base cases'', the small subproblems that are solved directly in order to terminate the recursion.

Choosing the smallest or simplest possible base cases is more elegant and usually leads to simpler programs, because there are fewer cases to consider and they are easier to solve.  For example, an FFT algorithm could stop the recursion when the input is a single sample, and the quicksort list-sorting algorithm could stop when the input is the empty list; in both examples there is only one base case to consider, and it requires no processing.

On the other hand, efficiency often improves if the recursion is stopped at relatively large base cases, and these are solved non-recursively, resulting in a [[hybrid algorithm]]. This strategy avoids the overhead of recursive calls that do little or no work, and may also allow the use of specialized non-recursive algorithms that, for those base cases, are more efficient than explicit recursion. A general procedure for a simple hybrid recursive algorithm is ''short-circuiting the base case,'' also known as ''[[arm's-length recursion]].'' In this case whether the next step will result in the base case is checked before the function call, avoiding an unnecessary function call. For example, in a tree, rather than recursing to a child node and then checking if it is null, checking null before recursing; this avoids half the function calls in some algorithms on binary trees. Since a D&amp;C algorithm eventually reduces each problem or sub-problem instance to a large number of base instances, these often dominate the overall cost of the algorithm, especially when the splitting/joining overhead is low. Note that these considerations do not depend on whether recursion is implemented by the compiler or by an explicit stack.

Thus, for example, many library implementations of quicksort will switch to a simple loop-based [[insertion sort]] (or similar) algorithm once the number of items to be sorted is sufficiently small.  Note that, if the empty list were the only base case, sorting a list with ''n'' entries would entail maximally ''n'' quicksort calls that would do nothing but return immediately.  Increasing the base cases to lists of size 2 or less will eliminate most of those do-nothing calls, and more generally a base case larger than 2 is typically used to reduce the fraction of time spent in function-call overhead or stack manipulation.

Alternatively, one can employ large base cases that still use a divide-and-conquer algorithm, but implement the algorithm for predetermined set of fixed sizes where the algorithm can be completely [[loop unwinding|unrolled]] into code that has no recursion, loops, or [[Conditional (programming)|conditionals]] (related to the technique of [[partial evaluation]]).  For example, this approach is used in some efficient FFT implementations, where the base cases are unrolled implementations of divide-and-conquer FFT algorithms for a set of fixed sizes.&lt;ref name="fftw"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frigo, M. |author2=Johnson, S. G. | url = http://www.fftw.org/fftw-paper-ieee.pdf | title = The design and implementation of FFTW3 | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 93 | issue = 2 |date=February 2005 | pages = 216–231 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2004.840301}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Source code generation]] methods may be used to produce the large number of separate base cases desirable to implement this strategy efficiently.&lt;ref name="fftw"/&gt;

The generalized version of this idea is known as recursion "unrolling" or "coarsening" and various techniques have been proposed for automating the procedure of enlarging the base case.&lt;ref&gt;Radu Rugina and Martin Rinard, "[http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/paper/lcpc00.pdf Recursion unrolling for divide and conquer programs]," in ''Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing'', chapter 3, pp. 34–48.  ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'' vol. 2017 (Berlin: Springer, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sharing repeated subproblems ===
For some problems,  the branched recursion may end up evaluating the same sub-problem many times over.  In such cases it may be worth identifying and saving the solutions to these overlapping subproblems, a technique commonly known as [[memoization]].  Followed to the limit, it leads to [[bottom-up design|bottom-up]] divide-and-conquer algorithms such as [[dynamic programming]] and [[chart parsing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9521">'''Electoral integrity''' refers to international standards and global norms governing the appropriate conduct of elections.&lt;ref&gt;Pippa Norris. 2014. Why electoral integrity matters. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

These standards have been endorsed in a series of authoritative conventions, treaties, protocols, and guidelines by agencies of the international community, notably by the decisions of the UN General Assembly, by regional bodies such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ([[OSCE]]), the Organization of American States ([[Organization of American States|OAS]]), and the African Union ([[African Union|AU]]), and by member states in the United Nations. Following endorsement, these standards apply universally to all countries throughout the electoral cycle, including during the pre-electoral period, the campaign, on polling day, and in its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;John Hardin Young. 2009. International Election Principles: Democracy and the Rule of Law. Chicago: American Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral malpractices==

[[File:William Hogarth 031.jpg|thumbnail|William Hogarth The Polling 1774-1775]]

The contrary notion of 'electoral malpractice' refers to contests violating international standards and global norms. Problems can arise at every stage of the process, from electoral and ballot access laws favoring incumbents to lack of a level playing field in money and media during campaigns to inaccurate voter registers, flawed counts and partial electoral management bodies.

There is nothing novel about problems of flawed or failed elections which suffer from fraud, corruption, or vote-rigging. Indeed, during the 18th and 19th Centuries, such practices were common in countries holding popular contests, including in [[rotten and pocket boroughs]] in Britain and [[machine politics]] in the United States. Concern about malpractices has grown in recent decades, however, along with the spread of elections to almost every state worldwide.

Contemporary campaigns attracting considerable international concern include allegations of irregularities occurring during the [[Russian presidential election, 2012]], problems of violence during and after the [[Kenyan general election, 2007]], and controversies in the [[Cambodian general election, 2013]].

==Origins in international law and human rights==

The foundation of these standards rests on Article 21(3) in the ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'' (1948). This specifies that "[t]he will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures."

These commitments were further developed in Article 25 of the UN International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR of 1966), namely the need for:

* periodic elections at regular intervals;
* universal suffrage that includes all sectors of society;
* equal suffrage, in the idea of one-person, one-vote;
* the right to stand for public office and contest elections;
* the rights of all eligible electors to vote;
* the use of a secret ballot process;
* genuine elections;
* elections that reflect the free expression of the will of the people.

The ''1990 Copenhagen Document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe'' (CSCE) made commitments that included free elections at regular intervals; the popular election of all seats in at least one chamber; universal and equal suffrage; the right to establish political parties and their clear separation from the state; campaigning in a free and fair atmosphere; unimpeded access to media; secret ballots, with counting and reporting conducted honestly and the results reported publicly; and the due winners being installed and allowed to serve their full terms.

The ''2002 Venice Commission’s Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters'' spells out in detail what is meant by principles such as the universal, equal, free, secret, and direct suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/CDL-AD(2002)023rev-e.aspx European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission). October 2002. Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters: Guidelines and Explanatory Report. Venice: Venice Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most detailed standards are contained in the practical guidelines for electoral observers published by regional intergovernmental organizations, exemplified by the ''OSCE Election Observation Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ([[OSCE]]). 2010. Election Observation Handbook, 6th edition. Warsaw: OSCE/ODIHR.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar principles have been adopted in the guidelines developed by the African Union, European Union, and Organization of American States.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;[http://www.cartercenter.org/des-search/des/Introduction.aspx Carter Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent statement of these norms in the ''UN General Assembly resolution 63/163'' (April 12, 2012): “Strengthening the role of the United Nations in enhancing periodic and genuine elections and the promotion of democratization.” The language in this document reflects and extends a series of similar statements of principle endorsed regularly by the United Nations since 1991. Resolution 63/163 reaffirms that “democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives.” Thus, democratic principles are explicitly endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly, along with a commitment to “the importance of fair, periodic and genuine elections” as the primary mechanism that allows citizens “to express their will.”

This does not imply, however, that the United Nations or the international community endorse any specific institutional design or constitutional mechanisms that can best achieve global norms, leaving this as a matter for national sovereignty. The UN resolution recognizes the responsibility of member states, “for ensuring free and fair elections, free of intimidation, coercion and tampering of vote counts, and that all such acts are sanctioned accordingly.” The United Nations’ role (especially through the Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of Political Affairs and the United Nations Development Programme) is seen as one of providing electoral assistance and support for the promotion of democratization, but only at the specific request of the member state.

==Evidence for electoral integrity and malpractices==

Attempts to document evidence of violations of international standards of electoral integrity can be found in the electoral observer monitoring reports published after each election by regional organizations.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt;

Comparative evidence is also available from the expert survey of Perceptions of Electoral Integrity conducted by the [[Electoral Integrity Project]]. This includes the report, part of an annual series, "The year in Elections, 2013" monitoring the quality of 73 presidential and parliamentary elections.  In 2016, Arizona scored the worst in the U.S., with a 53, and Vermont the best, with a 75, on a scale of 100, the [[Arizona Republic]] reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaila White|title=Arizona the worst for electoral integrity, experts say|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2016/12/28/election-electoral-integrity-arizona-rank-worst/95885790/|accessdate=30 December 2016|work=The Arizona Republic (USA Today)|quote=Those indicators were interpreted into a 100-point scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4077">'''Entitativity''' means the consideration of something as pure [[entity]], i.e., the mental [[abstraction]] from attendant circumstances.

In [[psychology]], it typically refers to ''the perception of a group as pure entity'' (an [[entitative]] group), abstracted from its attendant [[individual]]s. It is different{{how|date=May 2016}} from [[Holism|holistic]] [[perception]]. Operationally, entitativity can also be defined as ''perceiving a collection of social targets (e.g., individuals) as possessing unity and coherence (e.g., a group)''. Entitativity is highest for [[intimacy group]]s, such as the family, lower for [[action group (sociology)|task group]]s, lower yet for social categories (e.g., people of the same religion), and lowest for transitory groups, such as people waiting at the same bus stop (Lickel et al., 2000).

Campbell (1958) coined the term ''entitativity'' in order to explain why some groups are considered real groups while others are thought to be mere aggregates of individuals. He suggested that people rely on certain perceptual cues as they intuitively determine which aggregations of individuals are groups, and which are not (e.g. Spectators at a football game may seem like a disorganized collection of people, but when they shout the same cheers or express similar emotions, this gives them entitativity)(Forsyth, 2010). 

Additionally, Campbell (1958) emphasized three cues that individuals can use to make judgments regarding entitativity: ''common fate'' (the extent to which individuals in the aggregate seem to experience interrelated outcomes), ''similarity'' (the extent to which the individuals display the same behaviors or resemble one another), and ''proximity'' (the distance between individuals in the aggregate). To illustrate how we make those judgments, consider the example of people sharing a table at a library. They could be friends who are studying together, or they may also be strangers happening to share the same table. If you're wondering whether this is an actual group, you would examine their common fate, similarity, and proximity. Common fate may be something like the group all getting up and leaving together while talking or laughing amongst themselves. Similarity could be as simple as noticing that they are all using the same textbooks or notes, or that they happen to be wearing the same t-shirts to organizations (i.e., fraternity, university group). Finally, their physical proximity to one another (i.e., moving to sit closer) would be the final characteristic to judge that you are witnessing individuals with entitativity (Forsyth, 2010). 

There are two proposed antecedents for the entitativity perception ([https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=2006+Ip+Chiu+Wan&amp;btnG=Search Ip, Chiu, &amp; Wan, 2006]):
*physical similarity
*goal/behavior similarity.

'''Equinet''' is the '''European Network of Equality Bodies'''. It serves as a professional platform for cooperation, capacity building and peer support amongst equality bodies around the legal interpretation and implementation in practice of the EU equal treatment Directives and around the promotion of equality and the elimination of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Equinet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Equinet|title=Strategic Plan 2015-2018|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/spip.php?action=telecharger&amp;arg=1754&amp;type=application.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equinet currently consists of 46 Equality Bodies from 34 different European countries. Members of Equinet have been established on the basis of the [[List of European Union directives#Anti-discrimination measures|EU equal treatment Directives]] and they are empowered to counteract discrimination across the range of grounds including [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], [[gender]], [[Race (human classification)|race]] or [[ethnic origin]], [[religion]] or [[belief]], and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="age-platform"&gt;{{cite web|last=AGE|title=Factsheet on Equinet|url=http://www.age-platform.eu/images/stories/EN/pdf_AGE_Factsheet_on_Equinet-2.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Equinet builds upon the two-year project "''Strengthening the co-operation between specialised bodies for the implementation of equal treatment legislation''" (2002-2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gunda Werner Institute|title=Institutions Of The EU Commission And Parliament|url=http://www.gwi-boell.de/web/eu-gender-politics-institutions-eu-commission-3055.html|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The initiative to create a network of equality bodies was taken by the Migration Policy Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Migration Policy Group|title=Migration Policy Group|url=http://www.migpolgroup.com/|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also acted as Equinet's Secretariat until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Migration Policy Group|title=Project: Equality bodies|url=http://www.migpolgroup.com/projects_detail.php?id=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equinet was established as an independent structure in 2007 with the creation of the Equinet Secretariat in Brussels and its registration as a not-for-profit international association ([[AISBL]]) under [[Belgian law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=EU action against discrimination Activity report 2007-08|url=http://www.igfse.pt/upload/docs/gabdoc/2009/Novidades/07-Jul/EU%20action%20against%20discrimination_Activity%20report%202007-08.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Equinet is the European network of equality bodies. The network promotes equality in Europe through supporting and enabling the work of national equality bodies. It supports equality bodies to be independent and effective as valuable catalysts for more equal societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Equinet|title=Equinet at a Glance|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/-About-us-|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Apart from being a platform for exchange among member equality bodies, Equinet contributes to the wider European debate on matters of equal-treatment and non-discrimination by sharing the experience of equality bodies through so-called perspectives aimed at equality experts and policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SIPU International|title=Review of EU Networks for Civil Society Organizations|url=http://zaklada.civilnodrustvo.hr/upload/File/hr/izdavastvo/digitalna_zbirka/eu_networks.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Equinet attempts to strengthen the voice and contributions of national equality bodies to the wider European equality debate. Equinet's input in advancing equality is achieved by:&lt;ref name="Equinet Strategic Plan 2015-2018"&gt;{{cite web|last=Equinet Webpage|title=Strategic Plan 2015-2018|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/spip.php?action=telecharger&amp;arg=1754&amp;type=application.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Building capacity and peer support of equality bodies
*Contributing to the European equality agenda
*Serving as a knowledge and communication hub on equal treatment 
*Consolidating the network and the position of its members

Equinet is an umbrella organisation for European equality bodies and has no mandate to provide any kind of legal assistance to individual victims of discrimination. The organisation however provides contact details (see next section) for equality bodies based in all EU members states and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AGE|title=Factsheet on Equinet|url=http://www.age-platform.eu/images/stories/EN/pdf_AGE_Factsheet_on_Equinet-2.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   EU anti-discrimination legislation provides that each Member State shall have (at least) one such equality body with the power to, among other, give independent assistance to victims of discrimination. The equality bodies are specialised authorities whose staff are trained and experienced to handle cases of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ENAR - European Network Against Racism|title=What you can do if you are a victim of racial/ethnic discrimination|url=http://www.enar-eu.org/Page_Generale.asp?DocID=29966&amp;lb=3884|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Most Equinet members belong to the [[European Union]], while six equality bodies come from outside the European Union ([[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Norway]] and [[Serbia]]).

==Organizational Structure==

===Governance===

====General Assembly of Members====

The main decisions concerning the general direction of Equinet are taken by the [[Popular assembly|General Assembly]] of Members. This assembly is made up of all the members of the network and is convened at least once a year for an annual general meeting (AGM). The General Assembly has the power to approve new members and, following a nomination process by members, to vote for representatives on the Executive Board etc.&lt;ref&gt;Equinet ''Annual Report 2013''. 2014, p. 16.{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2013|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/spip.php?action=telecharger&amp;arg=1671&amp;type=application.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Executive Board====

Management and administration of the network is delegated to the [[Executive Board]]. The Board is also responsible for the preparation and implementation of the AGM’s decisions. Executive Board Members, the advisor to the Board and the treasurer receive no salary for their input.&lt;ref&gt;Equinet ''Annual Report 2013'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Working Groups====

[[Working groups]] are composed of staff from member organisations and led by a moderator. Working groups are the main medium for the sharing of expertise between different equality bodies. There were four Equinet Working Groups in 2015:&lt;ref&gt;Equinet ''Working Groups''.{{cite web|title=Equinet Working Groups|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/-Thematic-Working-Groups-|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Equality Law in Practice – supporting equality bodies in their legal work 
*Gender Equality – supporting the effective promotion of gender equality and the combat against gender discrimination by equality bodies
*Communication Strategies and Practices – supporting equality bodies in their communication work
*Policy Formation – supporting a dialogue on the learning from the work of equality bodies

====The Secretariat====

The [[Secretariat (administrative office)|Secretariat]] reports to the Executive Board and implements the annual work plan of the organisation. It is responsible for the daily activities of the network and assists individual members with their requests. It assists and coordinates the work of the Working Groups. There are 6 employees working at the Equinet secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;Equinet Secretariat. {{cite web|title=Equinet Secretariat|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/-Secretariat-|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
Equinet has two key sources of income:&lt;ref&gt;Equinet Webpage&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Grant of the [[European Commission]] under ''Rights, Equality and Citizenship
Programme of the European Union''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme of the European Union|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/rec/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Core topics}}

In [[classical mechanics]], '''Euler's laws of motion''' are [[equations of motion]] which extend [[Newton's laws of motion]] for [[point particle]] to [[rigid body]] motion.&lt;ref name="McGillKing"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Engineering Mechanics, An Introduction to Dynamics
| edition = 3rd
| last = McGill and King
| publisher = PWS Publishing Company
| year = 1995
| isbn = 0-534-93399-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were formulated by [[Leonhard Euler]] about 50 years after [[Isaac Newton]] formulated his laws.

==Overview==

===Euler's first law===
'''Euler's first law''' states that the [[Momentum#Linear momentum of a system of particles|linear momentum]] of a body, {{math|'''p'''}} (also denoted {{math|'''G'''}}) is equal to the product of the mass of the body {{math|''m''}} and the velocity of its [[center of mass]] {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;}}:&lt;ref name="McGillKing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BookRags"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Euler's Laws of Motion
| accessdate = 2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Dynamics of particles and rigid bodies
| last = Rao
| first = Anil Vithala
| page = 355

| publisher = Cambridge University Press
| year = 2006
| isbn = 978-0-521-85811-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p =  m \mathbf v_{\rm cm}&lt;/math&gt;.

Internal forces between the particles that make up a body do not contribute to changing the total momentum of the body as there is an equal and opposite force resulting in no net effect.&lt;ref name = Gray&gt;{{cite book
|title = Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics
|last = Gray
|first = Gary L.
|author2=Costanzo, Plesha
|publisher = McGraw-Hill
|year = 2010
|isbn = 978-0-07-282871-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law is also stated as:&lt;ref name = Gray/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F =  m \mathbf a_{\rm cm}&lt;/math&gt;.
where {{math|'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''d'''''v'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}}}} is the acceleration of the centre of mass and {{math|'''F''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''d'''''p'''|''dt''}}}} is the total applied force on the body. This is just the [[time derivative]] of the previous equation ({{math|''m''}} is a constant).

===Euler's second law===
'''Euler's second law''' states that the rate of change of [[angular momentum]] {{math|'''L'''}} (sometimes denoted {{math|'''H'''}}) about a point that is fixed in an inertial reference frame (often the mass center of the body), is equal to the sum of the external moments of force ([[torques]]) acting on that body {{math|'''M'''}} (also denoted {{math|'''τ'''}} or {{math|'''Γ'''}}) about that point:&lt;ref name="McGillKing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BookRags"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao"/&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M = {d\mathbf L \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the above formula holds only if both {{math|'''M'''}} and {{math|'''L'''}} are computed with respect to a fixed inertial frame or a frame parallel to the inertial frame but fixed on the center of mass.  
For rigid bodies translating and rotating in only 2D, this can be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M = \mathbf r_{\rm cm} \times \mathbf a_{\rm cm} m + I \boldsymbol{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the position vector of the center of mass with respect to the point about which moments are summed, {{math|'''α'''}} is the [[angular acceleration]] of the body about its center of mass, and {{math|''I''}} is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body about its center of mass.
See also [[Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics)]].

==Explanation and derivation==

The distribution of internal forces in a deformable body are not necessarily equal throughout, i.e. the stresses vary from one point to the next. This variation of internal forces throughout the body is governed by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]] of conservation of [[linear momentum]] and [[angular momentum]], which for their simplest use are applied to a mass particle but are extended in [[continuum mechanics]] to a body of continuously distributed mass. For continuous bodies these laws are called '''Euler’s laws of motion'''. If a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles, each governed by Newton’s laws of motion, then Euler’s equations can be derived from Newton’s laws. Euler’s equations can, however, be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies, independently of any particle distribution.&lt;ref name=Lubliner&gt;{{Cite book

The total body force applied to a continuous body with mass {{math|''m''}}, [[mass density]] {{math|''ρ''}}, and volume {{math|''V''}}, is the [[volume integral]] integrated over the volume of the body:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_B=\int_V\mathbf b\,dm = \int_V\mathbf b\rho\,dV &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''b'''}} is the force acting on the body per unit mass ([[dimensional analysis|dimension]]s of acceleration, misleadingly called the "body force"), and {{math|''dm'' {{=}} ''ρ dV''}} is an infinitesimal mass element of the body.

Body forces and contact forces acting on the body lead to corresponding moments ([[torque]]s) of those forces relative to a given point. Thus, the total applied torque {{math|'''M'''}} about the origin is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M= \mathbf M_B + \mathbf M_C&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''M'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''M'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;}} respectively indicate the moments caused by the body and contact forces.

Thus, the sum of all applied forces and torques (with respect to the origin of the coordinate system) acting on the body can be given as the sum of a volume and [[surface integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = \int_V \mathbf a\,dm = \int_V \mathbf a\rho\,dV = \int_S \mathbf{t} dS + \int_V \mathbf b\rho\,dV&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M = \mathbf M_B + \mathbf M_C = \int_S \mathbf r \times \mathbf t dS + \int_V \mathbf r \times \mathbf b\rho\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''t''' {{=}} '''t'''('''n''')}} is called the [[surface traction]], integrated over the surface of the body, in turn {{math|'''n'''}} denotes a [[unit vector]] normal and directed outwards to the surface {{math|''S''}}.

Let the coordinate system {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be an [[inertial frame of reference]], {{math|'''r'''}} be the position vector of a point particle in the continuous body with respect to the origin of the coordinate system, and {{math|'''v''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''d'''''r'''|''dt''}}}} be the velocity vector of that point.

'''Euler’s first axiom or law''' (law of balance of linear momentum or balance of forces) states that in an inertial frame the time rate of change of linear momentum {{math|'''p'''}} of an arbitrary portion of a continuous body is equal to the total applied force {{math|'''F'''}} acting on that portion, and it is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d\mathbf p}{dt} &amp;= \mathbf F \\
\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \rho\mathbf v\,dV&amp;=\int_S \mathbf t dS + \int_V \mathbf b\rho \,dV. \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Euler’s second axiom or law''' (law of balance of angular momentum or balance of torques) states that in an inertial frame the time rate of change of angular momentum {{math|'''L'''}} of an arbitrary portion of a continuous body is equal to the total applied torque {{math|'''M'''}} acting on that portion, and it is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d\mathbf L}{dt} &amp;= \mathbf M \\
\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \mathbf r\times\rho\mathbf v\,dV&amp;=\int_S \mathbf r \times \mathbf t dS + \int_V \mathbf r \times \mathbf b\rho\,dV. \\\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v &lt;/math&gt; is the velocity, &lt;math&gt;V &lt;/math&gt; the volume, and the derivatives of {{math|'''p'''}} and {{math|'''L'''}} are [[material derivative]]s.

The '''[[fundamental theorem]] of [[algebra]]''' states that every non-[[constant polynomial|constant]] single-variable [[polynomial]] with [[Complex number|complex]] [[coefficient]]s has at least one complex [[root of a function|root]]. This includes polynomials with real coefficients, since every real number is a complex number with an [[imaginary part]] equal to zero.

Equivalently (by definition), the theorem states that the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[complex number]]s is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]].

The theorem is also stated as follows: every non-zero, single-variable, [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] ''n'' polynomial with complex coefficients has, counted with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiplicity]], exactly ''n'' complex roots. The equivalence of the two statements can be proven through the use of successive [[polynomial division]].

In spite of its name, there is no purely algebraic proof of the theorem, since any proof must use some form of [[Completeness of the real numbers|completeness]], which is not an algebraic concept. Additionally, it is not fundamental for [[modern algebra]]; its name was given at a time when algebra was synonymous with [[theory of equations]].

==History==
Peter Roth, in his book ''Arithmetica Philosophica'' (published in 1608, at Nürnberg, by Johann Lantzenberger),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-rara.ch/doi/10.3931/e-rara-4843 Rare books]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that a polynomial equation of degree ''n'' (with real coefficients) ''may'' have ''n'' solutions. [[Albert Girard]], in his book ''L'invention nouvelle en l'Algèbre'' (published in 1629), asserted that a polynomial equation of degree ''n'' has ''n'' solutions, but he did not state that they had to be real numbers. Furthermore, he added that his assertion holds "unless the equation is incomplete", by which he meant that no coefficient is equal to 0. However, when he explains in detail what he means, it is clear that he actually believes that his assertion is always true; for instance, he shows that the equation &lt;math&gt;x^4 = 4x-3,&lt;/math&gt; although incomplete, has four solutions (counting multiplicities): 1 (twice), &lt;math&gt;-1+i\sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1-i\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

As will be mentioned again below, it follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra that every non-constant polynomial with real coefficients can be written as a product of polynomials with real coefficients whose degree are either 1 or 2. However, in 1702 [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] said that no polynomial of the type ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (with ''a'' real and distinct from 0) can be written in such a way. Later, [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nikolaus Bernoulli]] made the same assertion concerning the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4, but he got a letter from [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] in 1742&lt;ref&gt;See section ''Le rôle d'Euler'' in C. Gilain's article ''Sur l'histoire du théorème fondamental de l'algèbre: théorie des équations et calcul intégral''.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he was told that his polynomial happened to be equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\left (x^2-(2+\alpha)x+1+\sqrt{7}+\alpha \right ) \left (x^2-(2-\alpha)x+1+\sqrt{7}-\alpha \right ), \qquad \alpha = \sqrt{4+2\sqrt{7}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also, Euler mentioned that

:&lt;math&gt;x^4+a^4= \left (x^2+a\sqrt{2}\cdot x+a^2 \right ) \left (x^2-a\sqrt{2}\cdot x+a^2 \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

A first attempt at proving the theorem was made by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] in 1746, but his proof was incomplete. Among other problems, it assumed implicitly a theorem (now known as [[Puiseux's theorem]]) which would not be proved until more than a century later, and furthermore the proof assumed the fundamental theorem of algebra. Other attempts were made by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1749), [[François Daviet de Foncenex|de Foncenex]] (1759), [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1772), and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] (1795). These last four attempts assumed implicitly Girard's assertion; to be more precise, the existence of solutions was assumed and all that remained to be proved was that their form was ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bi'' for some real numbers ''a'' and ''b''. In modern terms, Euler, de Foncenex, Lagrange, and Laplace were assuming the existence of a [[splitting field]] of the polynomial ''p''(''z'').

At the end of the 18th century, two new proofs were published which did not assume the existence of roots, but neither of which was complete. One of them, due to James Wood and mainly algebraic, was published in 1798 and it was totally ignored. Wood's proof had an algebraic gap.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Wood's proof, see the article ''A forgotten paper on the fundamental theorem of algebra'', by Frank Smithies.&lt;/ref&gt; The other one was published by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in 1799 and it was mainly geometric, but it had a topological gap, filled by [[Alexander Ostrowski]] in 1920, as discussed in Smale 1981 [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183547848] (Smale writes, "...I wish to point out what an immense gap Gauss' proof contained. It is a subtle point even today that a real algebraic plane curve cannot enter a disk without leaving. In fact even though Gauss redid this proof 50 years later, the gap remained. It was not until 1920 that Gauss' proof was completed. In the reference Gauss, A. Ostrowski has a paper which does this and gives an excellent discussion of the problem as well..."). A rigorous proof was first published by [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]] in 1806 (and revisited in 1813);&lt;ref&gt; {{MacTutor Biography|id=Argand|title=Jean-Robert Argand}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was here that, for the first time, the fundamental theorem of algebra was stated for polynomials with complex coefficients, rather than just real coefficients. Gauss produced two other proofs in 1816 and another version of his original proof in 1849.

The first textbook containing a proof of the theorem was [[Cauchy]]'s ''Cours d'analyse de l'École Royale Polytechnique'' (1821). It contained Argand's proof, although [[Jean Robert Argand|Argand]] is not credited for it.

None of the proofs mentioned so far is [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive]]. It was [[Weierstrass]] who raised for the first time, in the middle of the 19th century, the problem of finding a [[constructive proof]] of the fundamental theorem of algebra. He presented his solution, that amounts in modern terms to a combination of the [[Durand–Kerner method]] with the [[homotopy continuation]] principle, in 1891. Another proof of this kind was obtained by [[Hellmuth Kneser]] in 1940 and simplified by his son [[Martin Kneser]] in 1981.

Without using [[countable choice]], it is not possible to constructively prove the fundamental theorem of algebra for complex numbers based on the [[construction of the real numbers|Dedekind real numbers]] (which are not constructively equivalent to the Cauchy real numbers without countable choice&lt;ref&gt;For the minimum necessary to prove their equivalence, see Bridges, Schuster, and Richman; 1998; &lt;cite&gt;A weak countable choice principle&lt;/cite&gt;; available from [http://math.fau.edu/richman/HTML/DOCS.HTM].&lt;/ref&gt;). However, [[Fred Richman]] proved a reformulated version of the theorem that does work.&lt;ref&gt;See Fred Richman; 1998; &lt;cite&gt;The fundamental theorem of algebra: a constructive development without choice&lt;/cite&gt;; available from [http://math.fau.edu/richman/HTML/DOCS.HTM].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proofs==
All proofs below involve some [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], or at least the [[Topology|topological]] concept of [[continuous function|continuity]] of real or complex functions. Some also use [[Derivative|differentiable]] or even [[Analytic function|analytic]] functions. This fact has led to the remark that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is neither fundamental, nor a theorem of algebra.{{Citation needed|reason=Who made the remark?|date=February 2016}}

Some proofs of the theorem only prove that any non-constant polynomial with '''real''' coefficients has some complex root. This is enough to establish the theorem in the general case because, given a non-constant polynomial ''p''(''z'') with complex coefficients, the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;q(z)=p(z)\overline{p(\overline z)}&lt;/math&gt;

has only real coefficients and, if ''z'' is a zero of ''q''(''z''), then either ''z'' or its conjugate is a root of ''p''(''z'').

A large number of non-algebraic proofs of the theorem use the fact (sometimes called "growth lemma") that an ''n''-th degree polynomial function ''p''(''z'') whose dominant coefficient is 1 behaves like ''z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' when |''z''| is large enough. A more precise statement is: there is some positive real number ''R'' such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}|z^n|&lt;|p(z)|&lt;\tfrac{3}{2}|z^n|&lt;/math&gt;

when |''z''|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''R''.

===Complex-analytic proofs===
Find a closed [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] ''D'' of radius ''r'' centered at the origin such that |''p''(''z'')|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;|''p''(0)| whenever |''z''|&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''r''. The minimum of |''p''(''z'')| on ''D'', which must exist since ''D'' is [[compact set|compact]], is therefore achieved at some point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the interior of ''D'', but not at any point of its boundary. The [[Maximum modulus principle]] (applied to 1/''p''(''z'')) implies then that ''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. In other words, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a zero of ''p''(''z'').

'''A variation of this proof''' does not require the use of the maximum modulus principle (in fact, the same argument with minor changes also gives a proof of the maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions). If we assume by contradiction that ''a'' := ''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) ≠ 0, then, expanding ''p''(''z'') in powers of ''z'' − ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; we can write

:&lt;math&gt;p(z) = a + c_k (z-z_0)^k + c_{k+1} (z-z_0)^{k+1} + \cdots + c_n (z-z_0)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the ''c&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are simply the coefficients of the polynomial ''z'' → ''p''(''z'' + ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), and we let ''k'' be the index of the first coefficient following the constant term that is non-zero. But now we see that for ''z'' sufficiently close to ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; this has behavior asymptotically similar to the simpler polynomial &lt;math&gt;q(z) = a+c_k (z-z_0)^k&lt;/math&gt;, in the sense that (as is easy to check) the function:

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{p(z)-q(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}\right|&lt;/math&gt; 

is bounded by some positive constant ''M'' in some neighborhood of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore if we define &lt;math&gt;\theta_0 = (\arg(a)+\pi-\arg(c_k)) /k&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;z = z_0 + r e^{i \theta_0}&lt;/math&gt;, then for any sufficiently small positive number ''r'' (so that the bound ''M'' mentioned above holds), using the triangle inequality we see that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
|p(z)| &amp;\le |q(z)| + r^{k+1} \left|\frac{p(z)-q(z)}{r^{k+1}}\right|\\[4pt]
&amp;\le \left|a +(-1)c_k r^k e^{i(\arg(a)-\arg(c_k))}\right| + M r^{k+1} \\[4pt]
&amp;= |a|-|c_k|r^k + M r^{k+1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When ''r'' is sufficiently close to 0 this upper bound for |''p''(''z'')| is strictly smaller than |''a''|, in contradiction to the definition of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (Geometrically, we have found an explicit direction θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that if one approaches ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from that direction one can obtain values ''p''(''z'') smaller in absolute value than |''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)|.)

'''Another''' analytic proof can be obtained along this line of thought observing that, since |''p''(''z'')|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;|''p''(0)| outside ''D'', the minimum of |''p''(''z'')| on the whole complex plane is achieved at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If |''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, then 1/''p'' is a bounded [[holomorphic function]] in the entire complex plane since, for each complex number ''z'', |1/''p''(''z'')|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;|1/''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)|. Applying [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]], which states that a bounded entire function must be constant, this would imply that 1/''p'' is constant and therefore that ''p'' is constant. This gives a contradiction, and hence ''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

'''Yet another''' analytic proof uses the [[argument principle]]. Let ''R'' be a positive real number large enough so that every root of ''p''(''z'') has absolute value smaller than ''R''; such a number must exist because every non-constant polynomial function of degree ''n'' has at most ''n'' zeros. For each ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''R'', consider the number

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c(r)}\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)}\,dz,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c''(''r'') is the circle centered at 0 with radius ''r'' oriented counterclockwise; then the [[argument principle]] says that this number is the number ''N'' of zeros of ''p''(''z'') in the open ball centered at 0 with radius ''r'', which, since ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''R'', is the total number of zeros of ''p''(''z''). On the other hand, the integral of ''n''/''z'' along ''c''(''r'') divided by 2π''i'' is equal to ''n''. But the difference between the two numbers is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c(r)}\left(\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)}-\frac{n}{z}\right)dz=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c(r)}\frac{zp'(z)-np(z)}{zp(z)}\,dz.&lt;/math&gt;

The numerator of the rational expression being integrated has degree at most ''n''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1 and the degree of the denominator is ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. Therefore, the number above tends to 0 as ''r'' → +∞. But the number is also equal to ''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n'' and so ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''.

'''Still another''' complex-analytic proof can be given by combining [[linear algebra]] with the [[Cauchy's integral theorem|Cauchy theorem]]. To establish that every complex polynomial of degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 has a zero, it suffices to show that every [[complex square matrix]] of size ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 has a (complex) [[eigenvalue]].&lt;ref&gt;A proof of the fact that this suffices can be seen [[Algebraically closed field#Every endomorphism of Fn has some eigenvector|here]].&lt;/ref&gt; The proof of the latter statement is [[Proof by contradiction|by contradiction]].

Let ''A'' be a complex square matrix of size ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and let ''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the unit matrix of the same size. Assume ''A'' has no eigenvalues. Consider the [[resolvent formalism|resolvent]] function

:&lt;math&gt; R(z)=(zI_n-A)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

which is a [[meromorphic function]] on the complex plane with values in the vector space of matrices. The eigenvalues of ''A'' are precisely the poles of ''R''(''z''). Since, by assumption, ''A'' has no eigenvalues, the function ''R''(''z'') is an [[entire function]] and [[Cauchy's integral theorem|Cauchy theorem]] implies that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{c(r)} R(z) dz =0.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, ''R''(''z'') expanded as a geometric series gives:

:&lt;math&gt;R(z)=z^{-1}(I_n-z^{-1}A)^{-1}=z^{-1}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{z^k}A^k\cdot&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is valid outside the closed [[disc (mathematics)|disc]] of radius &lt;math&gt;\|A\|&lt;/math&gt; (the [[operator norm]] of ''A''). Let &lt;math&gt;r&gt;\|A\|.&lt;/math&gt; Then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{c(r)}R(z)dz=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\int_{c(r)}\frac{dz}{z^{k+1}}A^k=2\pi iI_n&lt;/math&gt;

(in which only the summand ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 has a nonzero integral). This is a contradiction, and so ''A'' has an eigenvalue.

'''Finally''', [[Rouché's theorem]] gives perhaps the shortest proof of the theorem.

===Topological proofs===
Suppose the minimum of |''p''(''z'')| on the whole complex plane is achieved at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; it was seen at the proof which uses Liouville's theorem that such a number must exist. We can write ''p''(''z'') as a polynomial in ''z''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: there is some natural number ''k'' and there are some complex numbers ''c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 and:

:&lt;math&gt;p(z)=p(z_0)+c_k(z-z_0)^k+c_{k+1}(z-z_0)^{k+1}+ \cdots +c_n(z-z_0)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is nonzero, it follows that if ''a'' is a ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root of −''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/''c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and if ''t'' is positive and sufficiently small, then |''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ta'')|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;|''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)|, which is impossible, since |''p''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)| is the minimum of |''p''| on ''D''.

For another topological proof by contradiction, suppose that the polynomial ''p''(''z'') has no roots, and consequently is never equal to 0. Think of the polynomial as a map from the complex plane into the complex plane. It maps any circle |''z''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''R'' into a closed loop, a curve ''P''(''R''). We will consider what happens to the [[winding number]] of ''P''(''R'') at the extremes when ''R'' is very large and when ''R'' = 0. When ''R'' is a sufficiently large number, then the leading term ''z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' of ''p''(''z'') dominates all other terms combined; in other words, 

:&lt;math&gt;\left | z^n \right | &gt; \left | a_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \right |.&lt;/math&gt;

When ''z'' traverses the circle &lt;math&gt;Re^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt; once counter-clockwise &lt;math&gt;(0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi),&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;z^n=Re^{in\theta}&lt;/math&gt; winds ''n'' times counter-clockwise &lt;math&gt;(0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi n)&lt;/math&gt; around the origin (0,0), and ''P''(''R'') likewise. At the other extreme, with |''z''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the curve ''P''(0) is merely the single point ''p''(0), which must be nonzero because ''p''(''z'') is never zero. Thus ''p''(0) must be distinct from the origin (0,0), which denotes 0 in the complex plane. The winding number of ''P''(0) around the origin (0,0) is thus 0. Now changing ''R'' continuously will [[homotopy | deform the loop continuously]]. At some ''R'' the winding number must change. But that can only happen if the curve ''P''(''R'') includes the origin (0,0) for some ''R''. But then for some ''z'' on that circle |''z''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''R'' we have ''p''(''z'') = 0, contradicting our original assumption. Therefore, ''p''(''z'') has at least one zero.

===Algebraic proofs===
These proofs use two facts about real numbers that require only a small amount of analysis (more precisely, the [[intermediate value theorem]]):
* every polynomial with odd degree and real coefficients has some real root;
* every non-negative real number has a square root.

The second fact, together with the [[quadratic formula]], implies the theorem for real quadratic polynomials. In other words, algebraic proofs of the fundamental theorem actually show that if ''R'' is any [[real-closed field]], then its extension ''C'' = ''R''({{radic|−1}}) is algebraically closed.

As mentioned above, it suffices to check the statement "every non-constant polynomial ''p''(''z'') with real coefficients has a complex root". This statement can be proved by induction on the greatest non-negative integer ''k'' such that 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; divides the degree ''n'' of ''p''(''z''). Let ''a'' be the coefficient of ''z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' in ''p''(''z'') and let ''F'' be a [[splitting field]] of ''p''(''z'') over ''C''; in other words, the field ''F'' contains ''C'' and there are elements ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''F'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;p(z)=a(z-z_1)(z-z_2) \cdots (z-z_n).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then ''n'' is odd, and therefore ''p''(''z'') has a real root. Now, suppose that ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;m'' (with ''m'' odd and ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0) and that the theorem is already proved when the degree of the polynomial has the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;''m''′ with ''m''′ odd. For a real number ''t'', define:

:&lt;math&gt;q_t(z)=\prod_{1\le i&lt;j\le n}\left(z-z_i-z_j-tz_iz_j\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Then the coefficients of ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') are [[symmetric polynomial]]s in the ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with real coefficients. Therefore, they can be expressed as polynomials with real coefficients in the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s, that is, in −''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., (−1)''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. So ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') has in fact ''real'' coefficients. Furthermore, the degree of ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''(''z'') is ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sup&gt;''m''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1), and ''m''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) is an odd number. So, using the induction hypothesis, ''q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' has at least one complex root; in other words, ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''tz&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is complex for two distinct elements ''i'' and ''j'' from {1, ..., ''n''}. Since there are more real numbers than pairs (''i'', ''j''), one can find distinct real numbers ''t'' and ''s'' such that ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''tz&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''sz&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are complex (for the same ''i'' and ''j''). So, both ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are complex numbers. It is easy to check that every complex number has a complex square root, thus every complex polynomial of degree 2 has a complex root by the quadratic formula. It follows that ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are complex numbers, since they are roots of the quadratic polynomial ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp; (''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'')''z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Joseph Shipman showed in 2007 that the assumption that odd degree polynomials have roots is stronger than necessary; any field in which polynomials of prime degree have roots is algebraically closed (so "odd" can be replaced by "odd prime" and furthermore this holds for fields of all characteristics). For axiomatization of algebraically closed fields, this is the best possible, as there are counterexamples if a single prime is excluded. However, these counterexamples rely on −1 having a square root. If we take a field where −1 has no square root, and every polynomial of degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I'' has a root, where ''I'' is any fixed infinite set of odd numbers, then every polynomial ''f''(''x'') of odd degree has a root (since {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''(''x'')}} has a root, where ''k'' is chosen so that {{nowrap|deg(''f'') + 2''k'' ∈ ''I''}}). Mohsen Aliabadi generalized Shipman's result for any field in 2013, proving that the sufficient condition for an arbitrary field (of any characteristic) to be algebraically closed is having a root for any polynomial of prime degree.&lt;ref&gt;M. Aliabadi, M. R. Darafsheh, On maximal and minimal linear matching property, ''Algebra and discrete mathematics'', Volume 15 (2013). Number 2. pp. 174–178&lt;/ref&gt;

Another algebraic proof of the fundamental theorem can be given using [[Galois theory]]. It suffices to show that '''C''' has no proper finite [[field extension]].&lt;ref&gt;A proof of the fact that this suffices can be seen [[Algebraically closed field#The field has no proper finite extension|here]].&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''K''/'''C''' be a finite extension. Since the [[Normal extension#Normal closure|normal closure]] of ''K'' over '''R''' still has a finite degree over '''C''' (or '''R'''), we may assume [[without loss of generality]] that ''K'' is a [[normal extension]] of '''R''' (hence it is a [[Galois extension]], as every algebraic extension of a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 is [[separable extension|separable]]). Let ''G'' be the [[Galois group]] of this extension, and let ''H'' be a [[Sylow theorems|Sylow]] 2-subgroup of ''G'', so that the [[order (group theory)|order]] of ''H'' is a power of 2, and the [[index of a subgroup|index]] of ''H'' in ''G'' is odd. By the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], there exists a subextension ''L'' of ''K''/'''R''' such that Gal(''K''/''L'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''H''. As [''L'':'''R''']&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''G'':''H''] is odd, and there are no nonlinear irreducible real polynomials of odd degree, we must have ''L''&amp;nbsp;= '''R''', thus [''K'':'''R'''] and [''K'':'''C'''] are powers of 2. Assuming by way of contradiction that [''K'':'''C''']&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, we conclude that the [[p-group|2-group]] Gal(''K''/'''C''') contains a subgroup of index 2, so there exists a subextension ''M'' of '''C''' of degree&amp;nbsp;2. However, '''C''' has no extension of degree&amp;nbsp;2, because every quadratic complex polynomial has a complex root, as mentioned above. This shows that [''K'':'''C'''] = 1, and therefore ''K'' = '''C''', which completes the proof.

===Geometric proofs===
There exists still another way to approach the fundamental theorem of algebra, due to J. M. Almira and A. Romero: by [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian geometric]] arguments. The main idea here is to prove that the existence of a non-constant polynomial ''p''(''z'') without zeros implies the existence of a [[Flat manifold|flat Riemannian metric]] over the sphere '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This leads to a contradiction, since the sphere is not flat.

A Riemannian surface (''M'', ''g'') is said to be flat if its Gaussian curvature, which we denote by ''K&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'', is identically null. Now, [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]], when applied to the sphere '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, claims that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{S}^2}K_g=4\pi,&lt;/math&gt;

which proves that the sphere is not flat.

Let us now assume that ''n'' &gt; 0 and 

:&lt;math&gt;p(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + \cdots + a_n z^n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

for each complex number ''z''. Let us define 

:&lt;math&gt;p^*(z) = z^n p \left ( \tfrac{1}{z} \right ) = a_0 z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, ''p*''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;≠ 0 for all ''z'' in '''C'''. Consider the polynomial ''f''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''(''z'')''p*''(''z''). Then ''f''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;≠ 0 for each ''z'' in '''C'''. Furthermore,

:&lt;math&gt;f(\tfrac{1}{w}) = p \left (\tfrac{1}{w} \right )p^* \left (\tfrac{1}{w} \right ) = w^{-2n}p^*(w)p(w) = w^{-2n}f(w).&lt;/math&gt;

We can use this functional equation to prove that ''g'', given by

:&lt;math&gt;g=\frac{1}{|f(w)|^{\frac{2}{n}}}\,|dw|^2 &lt;/math&gt;

for ''w'' in '''C''', and

:&lt;math&gt;g=\frac{1}{\left |f\left (\tfrac{1}{w} \right ) \right |^{\frac{2}{n}}}\left |d\left (\tfrac{1}{w} \right ) \right |^2 &lt;/math&gt;

for ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\{0}, is a well defined Riemannian metric over the sphere '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (which we identify with the extended complex plane '''C'''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{∞}).

Now, a simple computation shows that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall w\in\mathbf{C}: \qquad  \frac{1}{|f(w)|^{\frac{1}{n}}} K_g=\frac{1}{n}\Delta \log|f(w)|=\frac{1}{n}\Delta \text{Re}(\log f(w))=0,&lt;/math&gt;

since the real part of an analytic function is harmonic. This proves that ''K&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

==Corollaries==
Since the fundamental theorem of algebra can be seen as the statement that the field of complex numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], it follows that any theorem concerning algebraically closed fields applies to the field of complex numbers. Here are a few more consequences of the theorem, which are either about the field of real numbers or about the relationship between the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers:

* The field of complex numbers is the [[algebraic closure]] of the field of real numbers.

* Every polynomial in one variable ''z'' with complex coefficients is the product of a complex constant and polynomials of the form ''z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a'' with ''a'' complex.

* Every polynomial in one variable ''x'' with real coefficients can be uniquely written as the product of a constant, polynomials of the form ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a'' with ''a'' real, and polynomials of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' with ''a'' and ''b'' real and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4''b''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 (which is the same thing as saying that the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' has no real roots). (By the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]], the real numbers ''a'' and ''b'' are not necessarily expressible in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial, the basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of ''n''-th roots.) This implies that the number of non-real complex roots is always even and remains even when counted with their multiplicity.

* Every [[rational function]] in one variable ''x'', with real coefficients, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form ''a''/(''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''n'' is a natural number, and ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers), and rational functions of the form (''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'')/(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''cx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''n'' is a natural number, and ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' are real numbers such that ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4''d''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0). A [[corollary]] of this is that every rational function in one variable and real coefficients has an [[elementary function (differential algebra)|elementary]] [[Antiderivative|primitive]].

* Every [[algebraic extension]] of the real field is isomorphic either to the real field or to the complex field.

==Bounds on the zeros of a polynomial==
{{main|Properties of polynomial roots}}
While the fundamental theorem of algebra states a general existence result, it is of some interest, both from the theoretical and from the practical point of view, to have information on the location of the zeros of a given polynomial. The simpler result in this direction is a bound on the modulus: all zeros ζ of a monic polynomial &lt;math&gt;z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1z +a_0&lt;/math&gt; satisfy an inequality |ζ| ≤ ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\infty}:= 1+\max\{|a_0|,\ldots,|a_{n-1}|\}. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that, as stated, this is not yet an existence result but rather an example of what is called an [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]] bound: it says that ''if there are solutions'' then they lie inside the closed disk of center the origin and radius ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. However, once coupled with the fundamental theorem of algebra it says that the disk contains in fact at least one solution. More generally, a bound can be given directly in terms of any [[p-norm]] of the ''n''-vector of coefficients &lt;math&gt;a:=( a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}),&lt;/math&gt; that is |ζ| ≤ ''R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is precisely the ''q''-norm of the 2-vector &lt;math&gt;(1, \|a\|_p),&lt;/math&gt; ''q'' being the conjugate exponent of ''p'', &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{p} + \tfrac{1}{q} =1,&lt;/math&gt; for any 1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ∞. Thus, the modulus of any solution is also bounded by

:&lt;math&gt; R_1:= \max\left \{ 1 , \sum_{0\leq k&lt;n} |a_k|\right \},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_p:= \left[ 1 + \left(\sum_{0\leq k&lt;n}|a_k|^p\right )^{\frac{q}{p}}\right ]^{\frac{1}{q}},&lt;/math&gt;

for 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞, and in particular

:&lt;math&gt; R_2:= \sqrt{\sum_{0\leq k\leq n} |a_k|^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

(where we define ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' to mean 1, which is reasonable since 1 is indeed the ''n''-th coefficient of our polynomial). The case of a generic polynomial of degree ''n'', 

:&lt;math&gt;P(z):= a_n z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1z +a_0,&lt;/math&gt;

is of course reduced to the case of a monic, dividing all coefficients by ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ 0. Also, in case that 0 is not a root, i.e. ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0, bounds from below on the roots ζ follow immediately as bounds from above on &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the roots of 

:&lt;math&gt;a_0 z^n+a_1z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}z +a_n.&lt;/math&gt; 

Finally, the distance &lt;math&gt;|\zeta-\zeta_0|&lt;/math&gt; from the roots ζ to any point &lt;math&gt;\zeta_0&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated from below and above, seeing &lt;math&gt;\zeta-\zeta_0&lt;/math&gt; as zeros of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(z+\zeta_0)&lt;/math&gt;, whose coefficients are the [[Taylor expansion]] of ''P''(''z'') at &lt;math&gt;z=\zeta_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ζ be a root of the polynomial 

:&lt;math&gt;z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1z +a_0;&lt;/math&gt;

in order to prove the inequality |ζ| ≤ ''R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' we can assume, of course, |ζ| &gt; 1. Writing the equation as 

:&lt;math&gt;-\zeta^n=a_{n-1}\zeta^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1\zeta+a_0,&lt;/math&gt; 

and using the [[Hölder's inequality]] we find 

:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta|^n\leq \|a\|_p \left \| \left (\zeta^{n-1},\ldots,\zeta, 1 \right ) \right \|_q.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if ''p'' = 1, this is 

:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta|^n\leq\|a\|_1\max \left \{|\zeta|^{n-1},\ldots,|\zeta|,1 \right \} =\|a\|_1|\zeta|^{n-1},&lt;/math&gt;

thus 

:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta|\leq \max\{1, \|a\|_1\}.&lt;/math&gt; 

In the case 1 &lt; ''p'' ≤ ∞, taking into account the summation formula for a [[geometric progression]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta|^n\leq \|a\|_p \left(|\zeta|^{q(n-1)}+\cdots+|\zeta|^q +1\right)^{\frac{1}{q}}=\|a\|_p \left(\frac{|\zeta|^{qn}-1}{|\zeta|^q-1}\right)^{\frac{1}{q}}\leq\|a\|_p \left(\frac{|\zeta|^{qn}}{|\zeta|^q-1}\right)^{\frac{1}{q}},&lt;/math&gt;

thus 

:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta|^{nq}\leq \|a\|_p^q \frac{|\zeta|^{qn}}{|\zeta|^q-1}&lt;/math&gt; 

and simplifying, 

:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta|^q\leq 1+\|a\|_p^q.&lt;/math&gt; 

Therefore 

:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta|\leq \left \| \left (1,\|a\|_p \right ) \right \|_q=R_p &lt;/math&gt; 

holds, for all 1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ∞.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23372">'''Garden waste''', or '''[[green waste]] dumping''' is the act of discarding or depositing garden waste somewhere it does not belong.    
 
[[Green waste|Garden waste]] is the accumulated plant matter from gardening activities which involve cutting or removing vegetation, i.e. cutting the lawn, weed removal, hedge trimming or pruning consisting of lawn clippings. leaf matter, wood and soil.&lt;ref name="Aarhus 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boldrin | first1 = A. | last2 = Christensen | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | title = Seasonal generation and composition of garden waste in Aarhus (Denmark) | doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2009.11.031 | pmid = 20042325 | journal = Waste Management | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 551–557 | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/seasonal-generation-and-composition-of-garden-waste-in-aarhus-denmark(4b0d9f5e-3ce8-4e63-ac0a-97fdd557b784).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition and volume of garden waste can vary from season to season and location to location. A study in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], found that on average, garden waste generation per person ranged between 122&amp;nbsp;kg to 155&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref name="Aarhus 2009"/&gt;

Garden waste may be used to create [[compost]] or [[mulch]], which can be used as a soil conditioner, adding valuable nutrients and building [[humus]]. The creation of compost requires a balance between, nitrogen, carbon, moisture and oxygen. Without the ideal balance, plant matter may take a long time to break down, drawing nitrogen from other sources, reducing nitrogen availability to existing vegetation which requires it for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Bertoldi | first1 = M. | last2 = Vallini | first2 = G. | last3 = Pera | first3 = A. | year = 1983 | title = The Biology of Composting: a Review | doi = 10.1177/0734242x8300100118 | journal = Waste Management &amp; Research | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 157–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of dumping garden waste is that it may contain seeds and plant parts that may grow ([[propagules]]), as well as increase fire fuel loads, disrupt visual amenity, accrue economic costs associated with the removal of waste as well as costs associated with the mitigation of associated impacts such as [[weed control]], forest fire.

==Cause==
There are strong links between weed invasion of natural areas and the proximity and density of housing.&lt;ref name="Another way forward"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = T | year = 2005 | title = Another way forward | doi = 10.1038/vital306-2c | journal = Vital | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The size and duration of the community have a direct relation to the density of weed infestation.&lt;ref name="Another way forward"/&gt; Of the various means in which migration of exotic species from gardens take place, such as vegetative dispersal of runners, wind born and fallen seed, garden waste dumping can play a significant role.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakayama | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = ChemInform Abstract: Chemistry of Inner Salts which Are Composed of (R2N)2C+- and -CX2- (X: S, Se) Ions | doi = 10.1002/chin.200226261 | journal = ChemInform | volume = 33 | issue = 26| pages = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of one North German study found that of the problematic population of [[Fallopia]], app. 29% originated from garden waste. Of a population of [[Heracleum mantegazzianum]], 18% was found by Schepker to be generated by garden waste (as cited by Kowarik &amp; von der Lippe, 2008) pg 24-25.

An Australia government publication suggest that some of the main reasons for the dumping of garden waste can be attributed to lack of care for the environment, convenience, or a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. 2013). People dump garden waste to avoid disposal fees at [[landfill]] sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly. This activity is carried out by people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses, such as professional landscapers and gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fabricius | first1 = K. | last2 = Logan | first2 = M. | last3 = Weeks | first3 = S. | last4 = Lewis | first4 = S. | last5 = Brodie | first5 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Changes in water clarity in response to river discharges on the Great Barrier Reef continental shelf: 2002–2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecss.2016.03.001 | journal = Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science | volume = 173 | issue = | pages = A1–A15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The spread of exotic vegetation can out-compete locally endemic vegetation, altering the composition and structure of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qvenild | first1 = M. | last2 = Setten | first2 = G. | last3 = Skår | first3 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Politicising plants: Dwelling and invasive alien species in domestic gardens in Norway | doi = 10.1080/00291951.2013.870599 | journal = [[Norwegian Journal of Geography|Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift - Norwegian Journal of Geography]] | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 22–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumping of garden waste in particular facilitates the spread of exotic vegetation into forest remnants via the introduction of seeds and propagules contained within the garden waste.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Common selection criteria for home gardeners when choosing plants are often based on ease of propagation, suitability to local environmental conditions and novelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rusterholz | first1 = H. | last2 = Wirz | first2 = D. | last3 = Baur | first3 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Garden waste deposits as a source for non-native plants in mixed deciduous forests | doi = 10.1111/j.1654-109x.2011.01175.x | journal = Applied Vegetation Science | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 329–337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific chosen characteristics increase the chance of plant parts and seeds that are introduced into forested areas becoming a problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The three major causes of animal habitat degradation are; the disruption or loss of ecosystem functions, the loss of food resources and loss of resident species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Airoldi | first1 = L. | last2 = Balata | first2 = D. | last3 = Beck | first3 = M.W. | year = 2008 | title = The Gray Zone: Relationships between habitat loss and marine diversity and their applications in conservation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology | volume = 366 | issue = | pages = 8–15 | doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2008.07.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-native invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through competition, pest and disease transportation and habitat and ecosystem alteration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mack | first1 = R.N. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = D. | last3 = Lonsdale | first3 = W.M. | last4 = Evans | first4 = H. | last5 = Clout | first5 = M. | last6 = Bazzaz | first6 = F.A. | year = 2000 | title = Biotic invasions: causes, epidemiology, global consequences, and control | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 689–710 | doi=10.2307/2641039| jstor = 2641039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The dumping of garden waste in nature reserves surrounding and near urban areas increases the risk of fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dumped garden waste will eventually dry out creating fuel adding to already fallen debris fuel load on which a fire can thrive and spread on.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/threatenedspecies/08450krp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds build fuel for fires.
Dumped garden waste can facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.&lt;ref name="ehp.qld.gov.au"&gt;Department of Environment and Heritage Protection. (2016). Ehp.qld.gov.au. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;
With no root systems for stabilisation the top soil is vulnerable to erosion (Ritter, J. 2015), This can add higher  levels of sediments, contributing to the siltation of creeks and waterways.&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"&gt;Home - Maroondah City Council. (2016). Maroondah.vic.gov.au. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.maroondah.vic.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

If plant matter gets into waterways it can create reduced oxygen levels through the process of decomposition of green waste such as lawn clippings. This directly upsets the quality of water, affecting fish and aquatic wildlife.&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"/&gt;
This dumping of green waste can also lead to the blocking of drainage systems; directly through the build-up of plant debris, and indirectly through the spread of invasive plant species that colonise wet areas, reducing and or changing the flow of waterways. This change in flow, including path and velocity, can alter hydrological cycles, affecting frequency and intensity of floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gordon | first1 = D | year = 1998 | title = Effects of Invasive, Non-Indigenous Plant Species on Ecosystem Processes: Lessons from Florida | doi = 10.2307/2640955 | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = 975 | jstor = 2640955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Green and garden waste has a direct impact to the visual aesthetics of land and can often attract further [[illegal dumping]].

===Increased fire risk===
Dumping garden waste in [[nature reserves]] and parks surrounding and near [[urban areas]] can effect directly and indirectly the existing [[flora]] and [[fauna]], as well as human life through the  increased risk of fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dumped garden waste will eventually dry, creating additional  fuel, adding to already fallen debris on which a fire can thrive and spread. Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds also build fuel for fires. Fires may also spread to the suburban areas where humans can also be impacted by losing their homes from fire, incur injury or death from smoke or burns, and suffer economic loses such as income loss and clean-up costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scorza | first1 = C. | last2 = Cavalheiro | first2 = E. | last3 = Scorza | first3 = F. | year = 2008 | title = Myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2C (MEF2C) expression in the dentate gyrus during development and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus: a preliminary report | doi = 10.1590/s0004-282x2008000500024 | journal = Arq. Neuro-Psiquiatr | volume = 66 | issue = 3b| pages = 731–735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fires can lead to an overall loss of [[habitat]] and biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threat to biodiversity===
The invasion of exotic plant [[species]] into remnant native forests is a threat to biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allison | first1 = H. | last2 = Hobbs | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Natural Resource Management at Four Social Scales: Psychological Type Matters | doi = 10.1007/s00267-010-9442-1 | pmid = 20148248 | journal = Environmental Management | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 590–602 | url = http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/1435/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some impacts of habitat degradation include; when native animals, insects and birds become vulnerable and put at risk; loss of food source for native wildlife; disruption of native plant-animal relationships ie pollination and seed dispersal and disconnection of plant-host relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = A. | last2 = Singhal | first2 = G. | year = 1999 | title = Journal search results - Cite This For Me. | doi = 10.1023/a:1007095426376 | journal = Photosynthetica | volume = 36 | issue = 1/2| pages = 213–223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly adaptive plants chosen for their ease of cultivation out compete more specialised species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Weed invasion of a forest system can change the processes of plant succession (the system of one species replacing another due to disturbance factors), the composition of the [[plant community]] and the composition and availability of nutrients. The change in forest composition can lead to loss of unique plant species.
When a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other [[organisms]] that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and [[extinction]] becomes a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/mahc.2004.35 | volume=26 | issue=4 | title=Table of Contents | journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | pages=c2| year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem. The term 'hotspot' is used to describe areas featuring exceptional concentrations of endemic species and facing high potential of habitat degradation. The 25 most significant hotspots contain the habitats of 133,149 plant species (44% of all plant species worldwide; table 1) and 9,645 vertebrate species (35% of all vertebrate worldwide; table 2). These endemics are confined to an expanse of 2.1 million square kilometers (1.4% of land surface). Having lost 88% of their primary vegetation, they formerly occupied 17.4 million square kilometers or 11.8% of land surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The surface of α-subunit loop 1 distant from the subunit interface is exposed in the hCG lutropin receptor complex | doi = 10.1016/s0304-4165(00)00097-0 | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects | volume = 1475 | issue = 3| pages = 390–394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The recruitment of alien invasive species may lead to a homogenisation of landscapes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Although increased bio diversity in subregions created by newly [[introduced species]] may occur, the displacement of the existing plant species may lead to reduced biodiversity on a global scale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

When population-level properties that indicate superior competitive ability of the invading species are examined, 13–24 (42–77%) of the species are included, with the majority of species showing traits capable of modifying natural systems at both ecosystem and community/population scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Doria R.|date=1998-01-01|title=Effects of Invasive, Non-Indigenous Plant Species on Ecosystem Processes: Lessons from Florida|jstor=2640955|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|issue=4|pages=975–989|doi=10.2307/2640955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waterways quality===
The dumping of green waste such as lawn clippings can block drainage systems which pollutes water therefore effecting water quality and the health of aquatic plants and animals. Dumped garden waste can add high levels of sediments, reducing the light available for photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Water quality"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maroondah.vic.gov.au/WaterQuality.aspx|title=Water quality|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"/&gt;  Dumping also block waterways and roads, cause flooding and facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.&lt;ref name="ehp.qld.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Water quality"/&gt;

==Causes / stakeholders==
Illegal dumping is carried out by all types of people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses and other organizations. Addressing these motivations will enable strategies to be developed that deal with the root causes, rather than the results, of illegal dumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=164054495563058;res=IELAPA |title=Tougher penalties for illegal waste in NSW [online]|journal=Waste Management and Environment |volume=25|issue=2|pages=14|date=March 2014|last1=Parrino|first1=Maysaa|last2=Kaoutarani|first2=Salam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main reasons for this careless disregard for waste can be put down to sheer convenience, lack of care for the environment and also a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. The monitoring of illegally dumped garden waste by the community and industries will drive effectual tactics to battle illegal depositing. People dump waste illegally to avoid disposal fees at landfill sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly.&lt;ref name="Water quality"/&gt; Alligator weed (''Alternanthera philoxeroides'' (Mart.) Griseb.) is an introduced weed originating from Sri Lanka and is creating major issues throughout the Australia since its introduction into the country. Alligator weed has the potential to affect aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity severely and to cause considerable social and economic costs, particularly in aquatic situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panetta|first=F. Dane|last2=Lawes|first2=Roger|date=2005-09-01|title=Evaluation of weed eradication programs: the delimitation of extent|journal=Diversity and Distributions|language=en|volume=11|issue=5|pages=435–442|doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2005.00179.x|issn=1472-4642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==
Education on the value of biodiversity and the negative effects of weed invasion have been identified as key items in changing current trends. Specific education campaigns on the risks of dumping garden waste could be targeted at high-risk societal groups such as residents of housing in close proximity to reserves as well as members of gardening communities and plant sellers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Restricting the selection of garden species in new housing developments adjacent to reserves may reduce the effects of [[illegal dumping]], thereby reducing requirement and associated cost of weed management. Creating habitat for wildlife by planting native plants, making a water source available, provide shelter and places to raise young.&lt;ref&gt;National Wildlife Federation. (2016). Nwf.org. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.nwf.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy ecosystems are necessary for the survival and health of all organisms, and there are a number of ways to reduce negative impact on the environment. Cultivation of native plant species may benefit not only native plant populations but also native animal populations. For example, Sears &amp; Anderson suggest&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Biodiversity 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinney | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Urbanization, Biodiversity, and Conservation | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0883:ubac]2.0.co;2 | journal = BioScience | volume = 52 | issue = 10| page = 883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that native bird species diversity in Australia and North America tend to match the volume and diversity of native vegetation. Crisp also explains&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Biodiversity 2002"/&gt; the percentage of native insect species in a fauna has been found to be consistent with the percentage of native plant species.

Composting is a great way to recycle nutrients back into soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 0 | last1 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Dr. Reynolds, ''et al.'' reply | doi = 10.3899/jrheum.080694 | pmid = 19208581 | journal = The Journal of Rheumatology | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 454–5; author reply 455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulching the garden with leaves and clippings (BMCC, n.d). 
Fostering an appreciation of local natural environmental features and plant species may also help mitigate the issue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as well as the restriction of highly invasive plant species through international policy.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN. 2000. Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species. http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/SSCwebsite/Policy&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Utilization of green waste bins that are provided by some councils or shires that are emptied via curbside collection (BMCC. n.d). The addition of facilities for waste disposal could also improve the issue (DECC. 2008).
Mitigation may involve governments holding campaigns that show people disposing legally and reporting the consequences for disposing illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/waste/150111env-guide-solid-waste-landfills.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A way Australian governments are addressing the problem is through the increase of fines in conjunction with better law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/waste/150111env-guide-solid-waste-landfills.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia, fines can be up to $1,000,000 and can also incur imprisonment. The Protection of the Environment Operations Act imposes penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility.&lt;ref&gt;Increased penalties for illegal waste dumping in NSW - Colin Biggers &amp; Paisley. (2016). Cbp.com.au. Retrieved 21 May 2016, from http://www.cbp.com.au/publications/2013/november/increased-penalties-for-illegal-waste-dumping-in-n&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The new section of the ''POEO Act'' (The Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997) now imposes further penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/waste/illegal_dumping.html|title=Illegal dumping|last=Protection|first=jurisdiction=Queensland; sector=government; corporateName=Department of Environment and Heritage|website=www.ehp.qld.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Parrino, Maysaa, Kaoutarani &amp; Salam, 2014). Communities are encouraged to report illegal dumping. In accordance with NSW Illegal Dumping Strategy 2014-16, hefty fines and a maximum jail sentence of 2 years can be handed down to repeat offenders.

In engineering, a '''housing''' is an exterior case or enclosure used to protect an interior mechanism, including integrated fittings or brackets to keep internal components in place. The housing prevents the interior mechanism from being fouled by outside debris or to contain the internal components. Housing may be the body of the device, vital to its function.

==Description==
Housing is an exterior case or enclosure used to protect an interior mechanism. The housing prevents the interior mechanism from being fouled by outside debris. It may also have integrated fittings or brackets to keep internal components in place; sometimes a housing is the body of the device, vital to its function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnE1DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303&amp;lpg=PA303&amp;dq=engine+housing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q0q1aNEfKn&amp;sig=5IFaYJuc-Y2SFB0uRRt744WjgfI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitr5iy8brWAhVCLFAKHWAGCf44ChDoAQhTMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=engine%20housing&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of Automotive Technology|last=Vangelder|first=|date=2017-02-24|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year=|isbn=9781284109955|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Basic Components of the Rotary Engine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Housings are most commonly made of metal or plastic.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The design of housing is specific to the item and its use. Housing may provide a number of functions.
===Contamination control===
Housing prevents the interior mechanism from being fouled by outside debris. Housings are sometimes made watertight, especially when the interior mechanisms contain [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=DE | number=3612975C2 |status=grant |title=Watertight housing, especially for the encapsulation of electrical and electronic components |gdate=1989-11-02 |fdate=| pridate=1985-04-29 |invent1=Friedhelm Rose |assign1=Friedhelm Rose |class=| url=https://patents.google.com/patent/DE3612975C2/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Containment===
Housings are commonly used to protect [[gearbox]]es,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandvik.coromant.com/en-gb/industrysolutions/windpower/pages/gearbox-housing.aspx|title=Gearbox housing|website=www.sandvik.coromant.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the housing also is responsible for containing the [[lubricant]]. Housings can also play a safety role, by providing a barrier between people and dangerous or fast-moving mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.directindustry.com/industrial-manufacturer/machine-frame-housing-97831.html|title=Machine frame and housing - All industrial manufacturers - Videos|website=www.directindustry.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interface===
Housing may need to provide a [[user interface]] for the internal devices, such as for [[television]]s and [[video game controller]]s.

===Decoration===
{{anchor|Faceplate}}
Housing may include [[ornament (art)|decorative elements]]. When these elements are removable and replaceable panels, they may be known as faceplates. Interchangeable faceplates provide a method to update the cosmetics of the housing without replacing the entire enclosure.

The figure at left holds the severed head of the figure at right, who spouts blood in the form of serpents from his neck]]
During the [[pre-Columbian era]], '''human sacrifice in Maya culture''' was the ritual offering of nourishment to the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]]. Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] of a living creature was a powerful [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood offering]]. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in [[human sacrifice]]. Generally only high status prisoners of [[Maya warfare|war]] were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sacrifice among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] is evident from at least the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic period]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;250–900) right through to the final stages of the [[Spanish conquest of Petén|Spanish conquest]] in the 17th century. Human sacrifice is depicted in Classic [[Ancient Maya art|Maya art]], is mentioned in Classic period [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]] and has been verified archaeologically by analysis of skeletal remains from the Classic and [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;900–1524) periods. Additionally, human sacrifice is described in a number of late Maya and early Spanish colonial texts, including the ''[[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]'', the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] epic ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the K'iche' ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'', the [[K'iche' language]] ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', the ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'', the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]] ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' and [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]''.

A number of methods were employed by the Maya, the most common being decapitation and heart extraction. Additional forms of sacrifice included ritually shooting the victim with arrows, hurling sacrifices into a deep [[sinkhole]], entombing alive to accompany a noble burial, tying the sacrifice into a ball for a ritual reenactment of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] and disembowelment.

==Methods==
A variety of methods were used by the ancient Maya to perform human sacrifice, such as:

===Decapitation===
{{Maya civilization}}
Important rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human sacrificial offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized offering, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the [[Maya maize god]] by the [[Maya death gods]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; In AD 738, the vassal king [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] of [[Quiriguá]] captured his overlord, [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] of [[Copán]] and a few days later he ritually decapitated him;&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp.134–35. Looper 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; such royal sacrifices were often recorded in [[Maya script]] with the "ax event" [[glyph]]. The decapitation of an enemy king may have been performed as part of a ritual [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame]] reenacting the victory of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] over the gods of the [[Xibalba|underworld]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt;

Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]].&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p96"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted on [[relief]]s at [[Chichen Itza]] in two of the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] (the Great Ballcourt and the Monjas Ballcourt).&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hero Twins myth recounted in the Popol Vuh relates how one of each pair of twins (the Hero Twins themselves and their father and uncle) was decapitated by their ballgame opponents.&lt;ref name="Gillespie91p322-323"&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 322–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart removal===
During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic period]] (c. 900–1524) the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the [[Aztec]]s in the [[Valley of Mexico]];&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid-temple]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice was stripped and [[Maya Blue|painted blue]], which was the colour representing sacrifice, and was made to wear a peaked headdress.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139"/&gt;

Four blue-painted attendants representing the four [[Chaac]]s of the cardinal directions stretched the sacrifice out over a convex stone that pushed the victim's chest upwards;&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752. Read and Gonzalez 2000, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; An official referred to as a ''nacom'' in [[Diego de Landa|Landa]]'s ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]'' used a sacrificial knife made from [[flint]] to cut into the ribs just below the victim's left breast and pull out the still-beating heart.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752. Wild 2008, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nacom'' then passed the heart to the officiating priest, or ''chilan'', who smeared blood upon the image of the temple's deity.

Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the four Chaacs would throw the corpse down the pyramid steps to the courtyard below, where it would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The ''chilan'' would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolised the rebirth of life. If it was a notably courageous warrior who had been sacrificed, then the corpse would be cut into portions and parts would be [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|eaten]] by attending warriors and other bystanders. The hands and feet were given to the ''chilan'' who, if they had belonged to a war captive, wore the bones as a trophy.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"/&gt; Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.&lt;ref name="TieslerCucina06p493"&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrow sacrifice===
Some rituals involved the sacrifice being killed with bow and arrows. The sacrificial victim was stripped and painted blue and made to wear a peaked cap, in a similar manner to the preparation for heart sacrifice. The victim was bound to a stake during a ritual dance, and blood was drawn from the genitals and smeared onto the image of the presiding deity. A white symbol was painted over the victim's heart, which served as a target for the archers. The dancers then passed in front of the sacrificial victim, shooting arrows in turn at the target until the whole chest was filled with arrows. Sacrifice with bow and arrow is recorded as far back as the Classic Period (c. 250-900), and was depicted with graffiti upon the walls of [[Tikal Temple II]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"/&gt; The ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' are a collection of Yucatec Maya poems written down in the mid-18th century; two poems deal with arrow sacrifice and they are believed to be copies of poems dating to the 15th century, during the Postclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1982, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The first, called ''Little Arrow'', is a song calling upon the sacrifice to be brave and take comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1982, pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is entitled ''Dance of the Archer'' and is a ritual dedicated to the rising sun; it includes instructions to the archer; the archer is instructed upon how to prepare his arrows and to dance three times around the sacrifice. The archer is instructed not to shoot until the second circuit, and to be careful to make sure that the sacrifice dies slowly. On the third circuit, whilst still dancing, the archer is instructed to shoot twice.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonson 1982, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar scene is described in the [[Annals of the Kaqchikels]], where an important prisoner is bound to a scaffold; the Kaqchikel warriors begin a ritual "blood dance" and proceed to shoot him full of arrows.&lt;ref name="Akkeren99p283"/&gt; In the Late Postclassic [[K'iche' language]] drama ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', an important war captive is tied to a stake representing the mythological Maize Tree and is sacrificed by being shot with arrows; the text compares the archers to hunters and the sacrifice to game.&lt;ref&gt;van Akkeren 1999, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===
Late Classic graffiti from a structure buried under Group G in Tikal depicts a sacrifice bound to a stake with his hands tied behind his head; the victim was disembowelled.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p753"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 753.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Classic period city of [[Palenque]], a woman in her twenties was entombed alive to accompany a deceased nobleman as a funerary offering.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p97"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Sacred Cenote]] in Chichen Itza, people were hurled into the [[cenote]] during times of drought, famine or disease. The Sacred Cenote is a naturally occurring [[sinkhole]] eroded from the local [[limestone]]; it is approximately {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide and drops {{convert|20|m|ft}} to the water surface, with the water another {{convert|20|m|ft}} deep. The sides of the cenote are sheer. Human sacrifice was practiced right up until the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], well after the decline of the city.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p753"/&gt;

At times sacrifices were tightly bound into a ball and were bounced in a ritual reenactment of the ballgame.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p97"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Maya vessel with sacrificial scene DMA 2005-26.jpg|thumb|right|Classic period Maya vessel with a scene of human sacrifice]]

===Classic period (250–900)===
Human sacrifice is depicted in Late Classic artwork and sometimes involved torture; sacrifice was generally via decapitation. At times the sacrificial victim was dressed as a deer. The intended sacrifice may have been publicly displayed and paraded before the act of sacrifice itself. Images of human sacrifice were often sculpted into the steps of [[Maya architecture]] and such stairways may have been the site of periodic sacrifice.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube9303p96"/&gt; Ritual decapitation is well attested from [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic texts]] throughout the Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Freidel 1991, pp. 311–312n6.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of mass sacrifice during the Classic period has not been recovered archaeologically.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological excavations at a number of sites, including [[Palenque]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Becan]], have uncovered skeletons that bear marks to the vertebrae and ribs consistent with heart extraction at the time of death using a long-bladed flint knife.&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, pp. 493, 501, 503.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classic period, the sacrifice of companions to accompany high-ranking burials is likely to have been widespread and performed using the heart extraction method, leaving little evidence on skeletal remains. Analysis of those remains that do bear marks suggestive of heart sacrifice indicates that during the Classic period the Maya used a method involving cutting across the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] immediately below the ribcage and cutting the heart free.&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassic period (900–1524)===
A Postclassic mass burial in [[Champotón, Campeche|Champotón]] in [[Campeche]], Mexico, included skeletons bearing evidence of violent blows to the sternum that have been interpreted as evidence of heart sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]], a Postclassic hieroglyphic Maya book, has an illustration of sacrifice by heart extraction, with the victim stretched over an arched stone.&lt;ref&gt;Vail et al. December 2003, p. S108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche']] of highland Guatemala, human sacrifice was performed to the K'iche' gods. Writing at the end of the 17th century, [[Francisco Ximénez]] described the tradition that upon the temple of [[Tohil]], human sacrifices were tied before the representation of the deity, where the priest would open the victim's chest and cut out his heart.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001, pp.356-357.&lt;/ref&gt; After sacrifice, the victim's body was probably hurled down the front stairway of the temple where his head would be severed to be placed on a [[Tzompantli|skull rack]] that was located in front of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001, p.360.&lt;/ref&gt; In the K'iche' epic [[Popol Vuh]], the god Tohil demands his right to suckle from his people, as an infant to its mother, but Tohil suckled upon human blood from the chest of the sacrificial victim.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Popol Vuh'' also describes how the Hero Twin Hunahpu was sacrificed with both the removal of his heart and his head.&lt;ref name="Gillespie91p322-323"/&gt; Human sacrifice was probably also performed to the K'iche' mountain god [[Jacawitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001, pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Human sacrifice is also mentioned in the K'iche' document ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'' ("Title of Totonicapán"). A long passage describing human sacrifice is difficult to interpret but features heart and arrow sacrifice, the flaying of the victim and wearing of his skin in a manner similar to the Aztec rituals associated with their god [[Xipe Totec]], and mention of the sacrificial knife of Tohil.&lt;ref&gt;van Akkeren 1999, pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madrid Codex sacrifice scene p76.jpg|thumb|right|A section of page 76 of the Madrid Codex, depicting sacrifice by heart extraction]]
The [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] Maya, neighbours of the K'iche', also practised human sacrifice. Ample evidence of human sacrifice has been excavated at [[Iximche]], their capital. Human sacrifice is evidenced at the site by the altar upon Structure 2, of a type used in heart sacrifice, and by a cylindrical cache of skulls taken from decapitated victims accompanied by obsidian knives.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"&gt;Guillemin 1965, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] flute crafted from a child's [[femur]] was recovered from one of the temples and is also indicative of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; A sacrificial flint knife was also recovered from Structure 3,&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt; and a circular altar at the site is very similar to those used for so-called "[[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|gladiatorial sacrifice]]" by the Aztecs and it may have served this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'' record that around 1491 the rulers of Iximche captured the rulers of the K'iche', as well as the image of Tohil. The captured king and his co-ruler were sacrificed together with the son and grandson of the king, other noblemen and high-ranking warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1998, 1999, pp. 295, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The same text describes how the Kaqchikel captured a powerful lord, called Tolk'om, who was tied to a scaffold and was shot with arrows during a ritual dance.&lt;ref name="Akkeren99p283"&gt;van Akkeren 1999, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice during the Spanish conquest (1511–1697)===
In 1511 the Spanish caravel ''Santa María de la Barca'' set sail along the Central American coast to [[Santo Domingo]] from [[Darién Province|Darien]] under the command of [[Pedro de Valdivia (captain of the Santa María de la Barca)|Pedro de Valdivia]].&lt;ref name="deDíosGonzález08p25GómezMartínJune13p56"&gt;de Díos González 2008, p. 25. Gómez Martín June 2013, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was wrecked upon a reef somewhere off [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="deDíosGonzález08p25GómezMartínJune13p56"/&gt; There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]] and [[Gonzalo Guerrero]].&lt;ref&gt;de Díos González 2008, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats, with bad oars and no sail; after thirteen days during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucatán.&lt;ref name="deDíosGonzález08p25GómezMartínJune13p56"/&gt; There they were seized by the Maya Lord Halach Uinik.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Halach Uinik is actually a title rather than a personal name, meaning "real man" and referring to the ruler of a province. Clendinnen 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Valdivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast. The other prisoners were fattened for killing, although Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;de Díos González 2008, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disastrous Spanish-led assault on [[Uspantán]] in 1529, captives taken by the [[Uspantek people|Uspanteks]] were sacrificed to Exbalamquen, one of the Hero Twins.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell 2005, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555 the [[Acala Ch'ol|Acala]] and their [[Lakandon Ch'ol|Lacandon]] allies killed the Spanish friar [[Domingo de Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; De Vico, who had established a small missionary church in San Marcos (in [[Alta Verapaz]], Guatemala), had offended a local Maya ruler;&lt;ref&gt;Salazar 1620 2000, pp. 38, 52. ITMB 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; the indigenous leader shot the friar through the throat with an arrow; the angry natives then sacrificed him by cutting open his chest and extracting his heart. His corpse was then decapitated;&lt;ref&gt;Salazar 1620, 2000, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; the natives carried off his head as a trophy, which was never recovered by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Salazar 1620, 2000, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1620s a Spanish party received permission to visit the still independent [[Itza people|Itza]] capital at [[Nojpetén]], headed by friar Diego Delgado who was accompanied by 13 Spanish soldiers and 80 Christianised Maya guides from [[Tipu, Belize|Tipu]], now in [[Belize]]. The party was seized when they arrived at Nojpetén and sacrificed with their hearts cut out. They were then decapitated and their heads displayed on stakes around the city; Delgado was dismembered.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Means 1917, pp. 79-81. Jones 1998, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The main Spanish party was ambushed at Sakalum in January 1624 and slaughtered. The Spanish Captain Francisco de Mirones and a Franciscan priest were sacrificed using the heart extraction method after being bound to the forked posts of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Jones 1998, p. 48. Thompson 1977, 2014, loc. 857.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the Spanish party were also sacrificed, and their bodies impaled on stakes at the village entrance.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1977, 2014, loc. 857.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1684 three [[Franciscan]] friars were killed, probably by heart sacrifice, at the [[Manche Ch'ol]] settlement of Paliac on the Caribbean coast of Belize. They included Francisco Custodio, Marcos de Muros, and an unnamed lay brother.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1988, p. 35. Bracamonte y Sosa 2001, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of additional Spanish missionaries were sacrificed at Nojpetén. In February 1696 Franciscan friar Juan de San Buenaventura and an unspecified Franciscan companion were taken to Nojpetén during a skirmish between the Yucatec Spanish and the Itza on the west shore of Lake Petén Itzá. The Itza high priest AjKin Kan Ek' later related that he had the Franciscans bound in the form of crosses and then cut out their hearts.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, pp. 227–228, 303.&lt;/ref&gt; About a month later a Guatemalan Spanish expedition was ambushed and slaughtered; [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas were taken across to the island of Nojpetén and were similarly bound to X-shaped crosses before having their hearts cut out.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, pp. 233, 479n59.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jus soli''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|dʒ|ʌ|s|_|ˈ|s|oʊ|l|aɪ}}; {{IPA-la|juːs ˈsɔ.liː}}), meaning "right of the soil",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jus%20soli jus soli], definition from [http://www.merriam-webster.com/ merriam-webster.com].&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as '''birthright citizenship''' in the [[United States]], is the [[right]] of anyone born in the territory of a state to [[nationality]] or [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=Andrew |title=Nationalism and Particularity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |location=Cambridge; New York |pages=|url=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jus soli'' was part of the [[English common law|English]] [[common law]], in contrast to ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', which derives from the [[Roman law]] that influenced the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] systems of [[continental Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayelet Shachar, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xXt5SoXtqEsC&amp;pg=PA120 The Birthright Lottery: Citizenship and Global Inequality]'' (Harvard University Press, 2009), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rey Koslowski, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0lZxEfg-tQMC&amp;pg=PA77 Migrants and Citizens: Demographic Change in the European State System]'' (Cornell University Press, 2000), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Where it exists universally, it is often not quite unconditional.

Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania grant citizenship at birth based upon the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (right of blood), in which citizenship is inherited through parents not by birthplace, or a restricted version of ''jus soli'' in which citizenship by birthplace is automatic only for the children of certain immigrants. Countries that have acceded to the [[1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]] will grant nationality to otherwise [[stateless person]]s who were born on their territory, or on a ship or aircraft flagged by that country.

''Jus soli'' is associated with permissive citizenship rights. Most countries with unconditional or near-unconditional ''jus soli'' laws tend to give birthright citizenship (and nationality) based on ''jus sanguinis'' rules as well, although these stipulations tend to be more restrictive than in countries that use ''jus sanguinis'' as the primary basis for nationality.

== History ==
An early form of ''jus soli'' dates from [[Cleisthenes]]' reforms of ancient [[Athenian]] law in the 6th century BC. It developed further in the Roman world, where citizenship was extended to all free inhabitants of the [[Roman Empire]] by the [[Constitutio Antoniniana|Edict of Caracalla]] in AD 212.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Much later, the independence of the English colonies in America and the French Revolution in the late 18th century laid the foundations for ''jus soli''. With the social and economic development of the 19th and 20th centuries and the massive migrations to the Americas and Western Europe, ''jus soli'' was established in a greater and greater number of countries.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

At the turn of the 19th century, [[nation-states]] commonly divided themselves between those granting nationality on the grounds of ''jus soli'' ([[France]], for example) and those granting it on the grounds of ''jus sanguinis'' (for example, [[Germany]] before 1990). However, since 2007 the [[European migrant crisis]] has focused attention on these two conflicting sources of nationality rights.

== {{anchor|Lex soli}}National laws ==
''Lex soli'' is a law used in practice to regulate who and under what circumstances an individual can assert the right of ''jus soli''. Most states provide a specific ''lex soli—''in application of the respective ''jus soli—''and it is the most common means of acquiring nationality. However, a frequent exception to ''lex soli'' is imposed when a child is born to a parent in the diplomatic or consular service of another state on a mission to the state in question.&lt;ref&gt;Guimezanes, Nicole.

'''Kaldor's growth laws''' are a series of three ''laws'' relating to the causation of economic growth.

Looking at the countries of the world now and through time [[Nicholas Kaldor]] noted a high correlation between living standards and the share of resources devoted to industrial activity, at least up to some level of income. Only New Zealand, Australia and Canada have become rich whilst relying mainly on agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaldor |first=N. |year=1967 |title=Strategic Factors in Economic Development |location=New York |publisher=Ithaca |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thirlwall |first=A. |year=2003 |title=Growth and Development: With Special Reference to Developing Economies |edition=7th |location= |publisher=Palgrave |pages=121–122 |isbn=0-333-98089-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed three laws on these empirical regularities:
#The growth of the GDP is positively related to the growth of the manufacturing sector. This is perhaps better stated in terms of GDP growth being faster the greater the excess of growth of industrial growth relative to GDP growth: that is when the share of industry in GDP is rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thirlwall|first=A. P.|date=1983|title=A Plain Man's Guide to Kaldor's Growth Laws|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4537750|journal=Journal of Post Keynesian Economics|volume=5|issue=3|pages=345–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The productivity of the manufacturing sector is positively related the growth of the manufacturing sector (this is also known as [[Verdoorn's Law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verdoorn |first=P. J. |year=1949 |title=Fattori che regolano lo sviluppo della produttivita del lavoro |journal=L‘Industria |volume=1 |issue= |pages=310 |doi= }} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Here the argument is that there are increasing returns to scale in manufacturing. These may be static—where the larger the size of the sector the lower the average costs—or dynamic via the induced effect that output growth has on capital accumulation and technical progress. Learning by doing effects are also likely to be important.
#The productivity of the non-manufacturing sector is positively related to the growth of the manufacturing sector. This last law is the least intuitive and is based on the argument that the non-industrial sector has diminishing returns to scale. As resources are moved out the average productivity of those that remain will rise.

[[Anthony Thirlwall|Thirlwall]] (2003, p123–124) also reports Kaldor's highlighting of three subsidiary propositions which are also important to take into account. They are:
# That as the scope for the increasing returns sector to absorb the labour from the diminishing returns sector reduces so too will the rate of growth of GDP.
# That in the early stages of industrialisation the demand comes from the agricultural sector—but in the later stages export demand is likely to drive the process. Here the limited size of the internal market is likely to be such as to limit the realisation of economies of scale and there is the need for generating foreign exchange to import necessary inputs.
# A [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|virtuous circle]] can be generated by export growth and output growth but that this is difficult to establish as it is likely to depend on exceptional enterprise, protection or subsidy.

The '''Khitan scripts''' were the writing systems for the now-extinct [[Mongolic languages#Para-Mongolic|Para-Mongolic]] [[Khitan language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian.|date=2014|publisher=John Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9027238252|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the 10th-12th century by the [[Khitan people]] who had established the [[Liao dynasty]] in [[Northeast China]]. There were two scripts, the [[Khitan large script|large script]] and the [[Khitan small script|small script]]. These were functionally independent and appear to have been used simultaneously. The Khitan scripts continued to be in use to some extent by the [[Jurchen people]] for several decades after the fall of the Liao dynasty until the Jurchens fully switched to a [[Jurchen script|script of their own]].  Examples of the scripts appeared most often on [[epitaph]]s and [[monument]]s, although other fragments sometimes surface.

Many scholars recognize that the Khitan scripts have not been fully [[Decipherment|deciphered]] and that more research and discoveries would be necessary for a proficient understanding of them.&lt;ref name=daniels&gt;{{Citation|last=Daniels|first=Peter T.|last2=Bright|first2=William|publication-date =1996|title =The World’s Writing Systems|publication-place=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages =230–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kara&gt;{{Citation|last=Kara|first= György|publication-date=1987|title= On the Khitan Writing Systems|periodical=Mongolian Studies|series=10|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Khitan scripts are part of the [[Chinese family of scripts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp028_chinese_scripts.html|title=The Family of Chinese Character-Type Scripts (Twenty Members and Four Stages of Development)|surname=Zhou|given=Youguang|author-link=Zhou Youguang|editor-given=Victor H.|editor-surname=Mair|editor-link=Victor H.

Knowledge of the Khitan language, which was written by the Khitan script, is quite limited as well. Although there are several clues to its origins, which might point in different directions, the Khitan language shares an ancestor with the Mongolian languages but is not one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian|date=2014|publisher=John Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-9027238252|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Large script==
{{Main| Khitan large script}}
[[Emperor Taizu of Liao|Abaoji]] of the [[Yelü clan]], founder of the Khitan, or Liao Dynasty, introduced the original Khitan script in 920 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=script%20khitan%20close%20%20%20write&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=353|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Large script”, or “big characters" (大字), as it was referred to in some Chinese sources, was established to keep the record of the new Khitan state. The Khitan script was based on the idea of the Chinese script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=khitan%20inspired&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=34|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mote2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick W.

[[File:Yanningmuzhi.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Memorial for Yelü Yanning in Khitan large script. Dated 986.]]
The Khitan large script was considered to be relatively simple.  The large script characters were written equally spaced, in vertical columns, in [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|the same way]] as the Chinese has been traditionally written.  Although large script mostly uses [[logogram]]s, it is possible that [[ideogram]]s and [[Syllabary|syllabograms]] are used for [[Grammar|grammatical]] functions.  The large script has a few similarities to [[Chinese character|Chinese]], with several words taken directly with or without modifications from the Chinese (e.g. characters 二,三,十,廿,月,日, which appear in dates in the apparently bilingual ''Xiao Xiaozhong muzhi''  inscription from Xigushan, [[Huludao|Jinxi]], [[Liaoning Province]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Most large script characters, however, cannot be directly related to any Chinese characters. The meaning of most of them remains unknown, but that of a few of them (numbers, symbols for some of the  [[Wu Xing|five elements]] and the [[Earthly Branches|twelve animals]] that the Khitans apparently used to designate years of the [[sexagenary cycle]]) has been established by analyzing dates in Khitan inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

While there has long been controversy as to whether a particular monument belong to the large or small script,&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;
there are several monuments (steles or fragments of stelae) that the specialists at least tentatively identify as written in the Khitan large script. However, one of the first inscriptions so identified (the ''Gu taishi mingshi ji'' epitaph, found in 1935) has been since lost, and the preserved [[Gravestone rubbing|rubbings]] of it are not very legible; moreover, some believe that this inscription was a forgery in the first place. In any event, the total of about 830 different large-script characters are thought to have been identified, even without the problematic ''Gu taishi mingshi ji''; including it, the character count rises to about 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), pp. 6, 12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Memorial for Yelü Yanning]] (dated 986 CE) is one of the earliest inscriptions in Khitan large script.

==Small script==
{{Main| Khitan small script }}
The Khitan small script was invented in about 924 or 925 CE by a scholar named [[Yelü Diela]].  He drew his inspiration from “the [[Uyghur language]] and script,”&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt; which he was shown by a visiting Uyghur ambassador at the Khitan court.  For this reason, Khitan small script was originally thought to be a daughter script of the [[Uyghur alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=based%20on%20uighur%20script&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=354|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a smaller number of symbols than large script, small script was less complex, yet still “able to record any word.”&lt;ref name=kara/&gt; While small-script inscriptions employed some logograms as well, most words in small script were made using a blocked system reminiscent of the later [[Hangul]] writing of [[Korea]], meaning that a word is represented by one group (square block) composed of several [[glyph]]s with individual phonetic meanings (somewhat similar to the ''[[Hangul#Jamo|jamo]]'' units of Hangul). Unlike Hangul's ''jamo'', a Khitan phonetic symbol could represent not just a single vowel or consonant, but a CV or VC pair as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Each block could incorporate two to seven such "phonetic element" characters, written in pairs within the block, with the first half of the pair on the left.  If there were an odd number of characters in a block, the unpaired character would be centered below the preceding pair.

Although there is some speculation, it appears there are no characters that both scripts share.  Periodically, epitaphs written using small script will be written using the large script method of [[linear]]ity{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. &lt;!-- what was that supposed to mean? --&gt; Although small script had some similarities to Chinese, Khitan characters were often used to record Chinese words.  The appearance of a likeness between a small script and a Chinese character does not aide in the reading of Khitan.  For example, the  Chinese character for ‘mountain’(山) is the same as the Khitan small script logogram for ‘gold’(and, thus, the name of the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]]).&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 378 known small script characters, 125 are [[Semantics|semantic]], 115 are [[Phonetics|phonetic]], and the remainder have not been deciphered.&lt;ref name=kara/&gt;  (Usually, it was possible to guess the phonetic value of an element if it has been used to transcribe a Chinese loanword in a Khitan inscription; otherwise, such phonetic values are hard to determine, as very little of the Khitan language is known.&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;)
Small script uses a mixture of logograms, syllabograms, and, as some as sources claim, a few single sound [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]].  Sometimes [[suffix]]es were written with syllabograms, just as single syllables sometimes were written with three syllabograms (with one each for the initial, medial, and final sounds of the syllable).  Sometimes the initial [[consonants]] of syllables are indicated to be [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[guttural]], or [[Nasal stop|nasal]] etc., based on the syllabograms involved.  Additionally, [[vowels]] are sometimes indicated to be labial or non-labial, or [[Pronunciation|pronounced]] in the front or back of the mouth.

Much of this information came from the "Khitan Script Research Group", led by the [[Inner Mongolia|Mongolian]] scholar named [[Chinggeltei|Činggeltei]], &lt;!-- (清格尔泰, born 06.1924) --&gt; who used monuments, [[Chinese calendar|calendar]], and similar Chinese texts to decipher sections of small script.&lt;ref&gt;According to Kane (1989) (p. 13), the most complete publication on the Khitan small script as of that time was the book by Činggeltei et al. (1985). It contained the complete corpus of inscriptions in that script known to date, summary of research done on the subject in China and elsewhere, and a complete bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly valuable object of their study was the inscription on the ''Da Jin huangdi dotong jinglüe langjun xingji'' (大金皇帝都统经略郎君行记) stele, which is the only known bilingual Chinese-Khitan inscription. Produced during the Jurchen [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]], it was originally (before the discovery of other Khitan inscriptions in 1922) thought to be in [[Jurchen script|Jurchen]].&lt;ref&gt;Kane (1989), pp. 4-5, 13-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurchen==
{{main|Jurchen script}}
Some of the characters of the [[Jurchen script]]s have similarities to Khitan large script.  According to some sources, the discoveries of inscriptions on monuments and epitaphs give clues to the connection between Khitan and Jurchen.&lt;ref name=kiyose&gt;{{Citation|last=Kiyose|first=Gisaburo N.|publication-date =1985|title= The Significance of the New Kitan and Jurchen Materials|periodical=Papers in East Asian Languages|pages=75–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the fall of the Liao Dynasty, the Khitan (small-character) script continued to be used by the Jurchen people for a few decades, until fully replaced with Jurchen script and, in 1191,  suppressed by [[Emperor Zhangzong of Jin|imperial]] order.&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+Chinese+civilization&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=boPQTc2wCs2RgQf618y5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=khitan%20script%20big%20characters&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=359|pages=|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corpus ==
{{main|List of Khitan inscriptions}}

[[File:Small Khitan Fish Tally.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Bronze 'fish tally' with small Khitan inscription owned by [[Stephen Wootton Bushell]]]]
There are no surviving examples of printed texts in the Khitan language, and aside from five example Khitan large characters with Chinese glosses in a book on calligraphy written by Tao Zongyi (陶宗儀) during the mid 14th century, there are no Chinese glossaries or dictionaries of Khitan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The main source of Khitan texts are monumental inscriptions, mostly comprising memorial tablets buried in the tombs of Khitan nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are about 17 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan large script, ranging in date from 986 to 1176, and about 33 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan small script, ranging in date from 1053 to 1171.  The two scripts are mutually exclusive (never occurring together on the same monument), but it is not known why the Khitan people used two different scripts, or what determined the choice of which script to use.

In addition to monumental inscriptions, short inscriptions in both Khitan scripts have also been found on tomb murals and rock paintings, and on various portable artefacts such as mirrors, amulets, [[paiza]] (tablets of authority given to officials and envoys), and special non-circulation coins.  A number of bronze official [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] with the seal face inscribed in a convoluted [[seal script]] style of Khitan characters are also known.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43802">{{Politics of Latvia}}
Articles 4 and 114 of the [[Constitution of Latvia]] form the foundation for '''language policy in Latvia''', declaring [[Latvian language|Latvian]] to be the official state language and affirming the rights of ethnic minorities to preserve and develop their languages. [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] and the [[Livonian language]], in addition to Latvian, are considered indigenous and all other languages foreign, including [[Russian language|Russian]] (the [[first language]] for more than one third of the population&lt;ref name="2000 census results"&gt;[http://data.csb.gov.lv/DATABASEEN/tautassk/databasetree.asp?lang=1 2000 census results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321200854/http://data.csb.gov.lv/DATABASEEN/tautassk/databasetree.asp?lang=1 |date=21 March 2008 }} — choose "Results of Population Census Year 2000, in short" and "Iedzīvotāju dzimtā valoda un citu valodu prasme"{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Other significant minority foreign languages include [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Romani language|Romani]].

The preamble to the State Language Law includes as its goals "the integration of national minorities into Latvian society while respecting their right to use their mother tongue or any other language; [and] the increase of the influence of the Latvian language in the cultural environment of Latvia by promoting a faster integration of society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minelres.lv/NationalLegislation/Latvia/Latvia_Language_English.htm State Language Law] — Sections 1, 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
The [[official language]] (''valsts valoda'', literally ''state language'') in Latvia is Latvian; this status has been explicitly defined since 1988.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=167|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, amendments to the 1989 Law on Languages strengthened the position of Latvian. All other languages, except the [[Extinct language|extinct]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/fu.html|title=Uralic (Finno-Ugrian) languages|website=Helsinki.fi|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livonian language]], are defined as foreign languages in Section 5 of the State Language Law of 1999.

Since 1998, the official status of the Latvian language has been written into the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution]] (Article 4); and since 2002, MPs have been asked to promise to strengthen Latvian as the only official language in order to take their seats (Article 18). In the Constitution's chapter on human rights, rights to get answers from authorities in Latvian are specified since 2002 (Article 104). The current State Language Law was not amended since its adoption in 1999 (as at 2017).

In 1995, Latvia signed, and in 2005 ratified the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]. When ratifying it, the Latvian [[Saeima]] (Parliament) made two declarations (worded as reservations) limiting the implementation of Articles 10 and 11. As at 2008, Latvia did not plan to sign the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]], 2008 — see Paragraph 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Language policy is implemented by a number of institutions: the State Language Commission (under the [[President of Latvia|President]]) prepares proposals in this field; the [[Latvian State Language Center|State Language Centre]] (under the Ministry of Justice) executes control, imposes fines for administrative violations and translates documents of international significance, the Latvian Language Agency (under the Ministry of Education and Science) provides consultations and opportunities for learning the Latvian language, analyses the language situation.

== Official use of languages ==

Since the State Language Law came into force in 2000, submitting documents to government (local included) and state public enterprises is allowed in Latvian only, except in cases specially defined in the law (emergency services, foreign residents etc.), according to Section 10. From 1992–2000, authorities had to accept documents in Russian, German and English, too, and were allowed to answer in the language of application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=165 1992 Law on Languages] — Sections 8, 9{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the losses of the Latvian government in the cases ''[[Podkolzina v. Latvia]]'' ([[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]]) and ''[[Ignatāne v. Latvia]]'' ([[Human Rights Committee|UN HRC]]), a certain level of command in Latvian was asked for eligibility to Parliament and local councils. In practice, this had led to re-examinations of various candidates, at least sometimes unexpected, which prevented Ignatāne and Podkolzina (representatives of the [[Equal Rights (Latvia)|Equal Rights]] party in the 1997 local and 1998 parliamentary elections&lt;ref&gt;''Жданова Д.'' ООН встала на защиту «Равноправия», «Час» 10.08.01.{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from participation.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} - This is exactly what the mentioned ''Iganatane'' and ''Podkolzina'' cases are about - see, e.g., Para 7.4. in ''Ignatane'', Para. 36 in ''Podkolzina'' judgment--&gt; As of 2011, candidates do not need to prove language proficiency, but elected members of Saeima&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saeima.lv/en/legislation/rules-of-procedure|title=Rules of Procedure|website=saeima.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local councilors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=58052&amp;from=off Law on status of member of republican city or municipality council — See Section 4]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be deprived of mandate for insufficient command of Latvian.

Names and surnames in Latvian-issued documents are formed in Latvianized form, according to Section 19. These provisions were subject in ECHR cases ''Kuhareca v. Latvia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=721719&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECHR decision in case No. 71557/01]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mencena v. Latvia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=816503&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECHR decision in case No. 71074/01]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; (both declared inadmissible in 2004), since the Latvian Constitutional Court had found them constitutional in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2001/06/2001-04-0103_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgment in case No. 2001-04-0103|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analogous application was submitted to UN HRC in 2007 and won by the applicant on grounds of privacy (''[[Raihman v. Latvia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.microlink.lv/pipermail/minelres/2007-July/005184.html|title=MINELRES: Communication to the UN HRC: minority names spelling in Latvia|website=Lists.microlink.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toponyms are formed in Latvian language only (on the [[Livonian coast]] - in Livonian as well), according to Section 18 of the State Language Law.

The Electronic Mass Media Law&lt;ref name="Law on Electronic Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/Electronic_Mass_Media_Law.doc|title=Electronic Mass Media Law|website=Vvc.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; orders to use only Latvian language in the first channels of public radio and television, and basically Latvian language in their second channels (Section 66).

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Latvia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Language policy is an important issue in Latvia: here, demonstrators demand official status for the Russian language.]] --&gt;
The government of Latvia in its policy documents refers to Latvia as a (democratic) [[nation state]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.km.gov.lv/UI/imagebinary.asp?imageid=3124 Guidelines of cultural policy 2006-2015 "Nation state"]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructing societal integration on the basis of the Latvian language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; while respecting the diversity of languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/VVA_angl.pdf Guidelines of the State Language Policy for 2005-2014] — p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity (Latvian political party)|Unity block]], comprising most of the governing coalition as of 2011, also describes Latvia as a nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvk.lv/cgi-bin/wdbcgiw/base/komisijas2010.CVKAND10.progr?NR=5|title=Programma|website=Cvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the nation state, where "language = nation", is seen as the core and main engine of the language policy of the Latvian state.&lt;ref&gt;''Dilāns G.''

One critic, James Hughes, Reader in Comparative Politics at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], has pointed out that Russian-speakers in Latvia constitute one of the largest linguistic minorities in Europe, therefore he considers Latvia's language laws to be denying Russophones their language rights, and thus they are contrary to international practice in the field of minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |title=Discrimination against the Russophone Minority in Estonia and Latvia |accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=James Hughes |year=2005 |work=Development &amp; Transition |publisher=[[London School of Economics]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504025222/http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |archivedate= 4 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nataliya Pulina in ''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]'' asserts that Latvia's Russophones are by percentage actually the largest linguistic minority in the [[European Union|EU]] whose language has no official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Наталия |last=Пулина |script-title=ru:Татьяна Жданок: "Русские могут влиять на политику Латвии" |url=http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |work=[[Moskovskiye Novosti|Московские новости]] |language=Russian |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2008-03-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080326223109/http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |archivedate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the demographic arguments for Russian language rights in Latvia, the [[BBC]]'s Angus Roxburgh reported in 2005:
{{cquote|There are as many Russians, proportionally, in Latvia as there are French speakers in Belgium. They argue that, being such a large minority, they should have the right to education in their native language if the demand exists—which it certainly does.&lt;br&gt;[They] say that Russian should be an official language with equal rights, just as Swedish is in Finland (for just 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Angus |last=Roxburgh |title=Latvian lessons irk Russians |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4380437.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-03-29 |accessdate=2008-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the political parties, [[ForHRUL]] offers in its programme to grant co-official status to Russian, Latgalian and possibly others languages in municipalities where these are native for more than 20% of population.&lt;ref&gt;ForHRUL programme (2006) — see section 7.5.: [http://rusojuz.lv/ru/party/programma/14661-/ Russian], [http://rusojuz.lv/lv/party/Programmas/24543-/ Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; In a draft of its political programme,&lt;ref&gt;HC programme project – section "Cultural and language diversity": [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Russian], [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harmony Centre|HC]] offers to grant co-official status to Latgalian and Russian in printed media, public sphere and education (for Russian, in communication with authorities, as well), stressing its support for the sole state language. Both these parties are in permanent opposition on the state level.

On the other hand, TB/LNNK, a member of governing coalition between 2006 and 2010, is demanding that Latvian be made the sole language of instruction, even in minority schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tb.lv/index.php?id=382|title=Jaunumi|website=Tb.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research conducted by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf Ethnopolitical tension in Latvia: looking for solving the conflict — see p. 39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509041733/http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf |date=9 May 2007 }} {{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority (77%) of ethnic Latvians opposed (56%) or mostly opposed (21%) granting Russian status as a second official language, while the majority (87%) of Russians supported (59%) or mostly supported (28%) such status, while a majority (75%) of other ethnicities also supported (40%) or rather supported (35%) such status.
(Sample size was 1,018 respondents, with 51% supporting or rather supporting official status for Russian and 44% opposing or rather opposing it.)

==Private use of languages==
The Law on Electronic Media&lt;ref name="Law on Electronic Media"/&gt; prescribes that national and regional electronic media need to broadcast at least 65 % in Latvian language (section 32). Besides, films aired in any channel should be dubbed in Latvian or to have original soundtrack and Latvian subtitles; TV broadcasts in languages other than Latvian, except news, live events, language learning broadcasts and retranslated content, must be subtitled in Latvian.(Section 28). The same concerns films shown in cinemas, according to Section 17 of State Language Law. Until a judgement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2003/01/2003-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2003-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court upon request of 24 ForHRUL MPs (delivered in 2003), broadcasting in minority languages was limited for private TV and radio (originally within 30%, since 1998 within 25%).

According to Section 6 of State Language Law, levels of skills in Latvian are defined for various professions, which concern legitimate public interest. Totally, there are six levels and two lists of professions (longer for public sector and shorter for private sector), classified by needed level. For those who didn't get education in Latvian and aren't disabled, an examination is needed to define their skills in Latvian, to work in these professions. Those who fail to show needed level during inspections, can be fined. Labour market shows high demand for skills in Latvian, Russian and English languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/A5_VVA_valodu_prasmes_LV_Q.pdf Valodu prasmes ietekme uz ekonomiski aktīvo iedzīvotāju dzīves kvalitāti], 2006{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Section 11 of State Language Law, organizers of public events have to provide in Latvian information, which concerns legitimate public interest (defined in Section 2 — public safety, health care ''et cetera'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=10124|title=Noteikumi par tulkojumu nodrošināšanu pasākumos|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same affects posters, billboards and signboards, according to Section 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=DOC&amp;id=102667|title=Noteikumi par valodu lietošanu informācijā|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, according to the Law of languages as amended in 1992 (Section 5), organizers of any public event had to provide translation into Latvian in their conferences. An exemption had existed for organizations of ethnic minorities and religious organizations; 1997 Law on Meetings, Processions and Pickets has foreseen free choice of language in meetings, pickets and processions, too (Section 19).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=KDOC&amp;id=42090&amp;version_date=13.02.1997|title=Par sapulcēm, gājieniem un piketiem|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of the 1990s, some Polish language schools were created besides the existing schools with Latvian and Russian language of instruction. Certain schools (e.g., Riga Dubnov Jewish Secondary school, founded in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revs.lv|title=Š.

As at 2007, there was also increasing number of minority children attending Latvian-language schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by ECRI — see Paragraph 54&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Education law,&lt;ref&gt;Education law: [http://www.ttc.lv/index.php?&amp;id=10&amp;tid=59&amp;l=LV&amp;seid=down&amp;itid=13759 edition being in force between 27.02.2004. and 15.09.2005., English] and [http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=50759&amp;menu_body=KDOC current version, Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; as adopted in 1998, the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) had to be only Latvian since 2004. This has mostly affected Russian schools, some existing in Latvia without interruption since at least 1789.&lt;ref&gt;''Гурин А. Г.'' [http://www.russkije.lv/ru/journalism/read/pervye-russkie-shkoly/ Первые русские школы]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Russian School Defense Staff|wide protests in 2003 and 2004]], the law was amended allowing to teach up to 40% of curricula in minority languages (Transition Rules) and allowing orphans to continue their education not only in Latvian, but also in the language he or she began it (Section 56).

In 2005, one judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/2005-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgment in case No. 2005-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court (upon request of ForHRUL, NHP and LSP MPs) has declared unconstitutional the ban of public co-funding for private minority schools, another&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/2004-18-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2004-18-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has declared the proportion "60+:40" constitutional.

According to the same 1998 Education Law, the tertiary education in public colleges and universities has to be in Latvian only since 1999 (it had to be basically in Latvian since the second year, according to 1992 Law on Languages, Section 11). In fact, there still exist programmes with education in English for foreigners ([[Riga Technical University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtuasd.lv/resource/show/3|title=Riga Technical University Department of Foreign Students|website=Rtuasd.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or according to special laws ([[Riga Graduate School of Law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=124716&amp;mode=DOC 2005 Latvian-Swedish Treaty on Riga Graduate School of Law] - See Article 7; there is a version in English under one in Latvian&lt;/ref&gt;). There is a demand for tertiary education in Russian, too: it is used, for example, at the [[Baltic International Academy]].

In 2018, President [[Raimonds Vejonis]] promulgated the bill banning use of Russian as the language of instruction also at private universities in Latvia. The Latvian parliament passed the legislation on June 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/education/?doc=141364&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
&lt;!-- {{main|Language legislation in Latvia}}--&gt;

In the medieval [[Livonian Confederation]], [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] were the dominant languages of education and administration. German kept this position under subsequent periods of rule by [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and, initially, under the [[Russian Empire]]. German was the language of instruction in the first institution of tertiary education on the territory of Latvia ([[Riga Polytechnicum]], founded in 1862). In [[Latgale]], the Polish language gained some influence, beginning from the 16th century.

From the mid-19th century, Latvian started to rise in influence. At the end of the 19th century, tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] instigated a policy of [[Russification]] in non-Russian areas of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Russia |last= Raisanovsky |first= Nicholas V. |authorlink= Nicholas V. Riasanovsky |year= 1993 |edition= 5th |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York; Oxford |isbn= 0-19-507462-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, language of administration, that of Riga Polytechnicum and most schools was changed from German to Russian, and some German toponyms in eastern Latvia were Russianized (e.g., Dünaburg became Dvinsk). After the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 revolution]], possibilities for schooling in Latvian increased.

The pro-[[Bolshevik]] revolutionary [[Soviet (council)|soviet]], [[Iskolat]], declared on 4 January 1918 that Latvian should be the primary language of administration on the territory of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=170|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the short-lived [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]] in 1919, Latgalian enjoyed co-equal status with both Latvian and Russian as an official language of administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=169|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Latvia (founded in 1918) was initially liberal in its language policy: while Latvianizing toponyms (e.g., Dvinsk became [[Daugavpils]]), it also allowed Russian and German languages to be used in Parliament along Latvian,&lt;ref&gt;Saeimas kārtības rullis.

Русские в довоенной Латвии — Р.: БРИ, 2000. {{ISBN|9984-606-68-6}} — стр. 281—296 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly hard hit were the Belarusian primary schools, all but 5 of which were closed. Belarusian schoolteachers and other intellectuals in Latvia were suspected of having a pro-Soviet agenda harmful to national security.&lt;ref&gt;''Latvijas izlūkdienesti 1919-1940: 664 likteņi'', ed.

During World War II, Latvia's German community was mostly moved to Germany, and the Jewish community was destroyed (hit first by the Stalinist deportations in 1941, then by the [[Holocaust]]). Due to that, these groups' respective schools disappeared.

In the postwar [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the proportion of Latvian-speaking population decreased due to large losses in World War II and mass deportation, while the Russian-speaking population increased due to the presence of military forces and mass immigration of labour to implement the Soviet Union's industrialization policy (still, due to low birth rate, the population of Latvia had grown by 27.4% between 1959 and 1989 censuses, while that of the whole USSR — by 36.8%).&lt;ref&gt;''demoscope.ru'' database: population of USSR and its republics (by ethnicity) — [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172652/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php |date=16 March 2010 }}, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172713/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php |date=16 March 2010 }}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the use of Russian increased and it started to dominate in the areas integrated on a federal level (state security, railway etc.). As concerns tertiary education, in some faculties, the language of instruction was only Latvian, in some, only Russian; in some there were two language "streams".&lt;ref&gt;Latvijas PSR augstākās mācību iestādes.

Latvian was declared the state language of the Latvian SSR by a decree of the republican [[Supreme Soviet]] on 6 October 1988. Nevertheless, citizens could still choose to communicate with state authorities in Russian, and all correspondence with the USSR's federal bodies was to be in Russian.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Demographic background ==
&lt;!--{{main|Languages of Latvia}}--&gt;
In the first post-Soviet [[census]] in 2000, 1,311,093 persons in Latvia reported Latvian as their mother tongue,&lt;ref name="Census"/&gt; representing the vast majority of the estimated 1.5 million Latvian speakers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lav|title=Latvian|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, [[Livonian language|Livonian]] was a [[moribund language]] spoken by some 35 people, of whom only 10 were fluent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nyelvrokonaink |last=Nanovfszky |first=György (ed.) |year=2000 |publisher=Teleki László Alapítvány |location=Budapest |isbn=963-00-3424-7 |language=Hungarian, Russian |oclc=45621804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade of the 21st century, it was estimated that Livonian was the native tongue of 4 people in Latvia, all of whom were older than 70.&lt;ref&gt;''Ernšreits V.''

Latvia's current territory is a close approximation to the range of Latvian habitation since the Latvian people emerged. As such, Latvian and Livonian are native only to Latvia.&lt;!-- and have been given special status under Latvian law with the intent to counter the policy of Russification under the Soviet Union--&gt;

In age groups over 15 years, however, more Latvians expressed proficiency in Russian than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=470|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 71% of ethnic Latvians said they could speak Russian, and 52% of Russians could speak Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=389|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all districts and cities in Latvia, the highest command of Latvian was in [[Talsi District]] (98.8%), while the lowest was in Daugavpils (41.4%). In Daugavpils was also the highest percentage of people speaking Russian (95.7%), and in [[Kuldīga District]] the lowest (57.6%). There was a similar breakdown with regards to mother tongue: 94.6% in Talsi District and for 11.6% in Daugavpils for Latvian, 80.4% in Daugavpils and for 3.0% in Talsi District for Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=388|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the previous 1989 census, conducted while Latvia was still part of the USSR, Latvian was reported as the native language for 52.0% of the population, Russian for 42.1%;&lt;ref&gt;1989. gada tautas skaitīšanas rezultāti Latvijā. Итоги переписи населения 1989 года по Латвии — Rīga: LR Valsts statistikas komiteja, 1992 — 89. lpp./стр.{{lv icon}}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 62.4% of population could speak Latvian, and 81.6% could speak Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020219174758/http://vip.latnet.lv/LPRA/migranti.htm ] &lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] was not considered a language separate from Latvian in any census, whether during the Soviet period, or since the restoration of independence. Therefore, no specific data on the number of its native speakers were available until the 2011 census. Then, 8.8. % of the population indicated they use Latgalian, described as a variety of Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/notikumi/home-latvian-spoken-62-latvian-population-majority-vidzeme-and-lubana-county-39158.html|title=At home Latvian is spoken by 62% of Latvian population; the majority – in Vidzeme and Lubāna county - Latvijas statistika|website=Csb.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Materialism''' is a form of [[monism|philosophical monism]] which holds that [[matter]] is the fundamental [[Substance theory|substance]] in [[nature]], and that all things, including [[mind|mental aspects]] and [[consciousness]], are results of material interactions.

In [[Idealism]], [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] are first-order realities to which matter is subject and secondary. In philosophical materialism the converse is true. Here mind and consciousness are [[by-product]]s or [[Epiphenominalism|epiphenomena]] of material processes (the [[biochemistry]] of the [[human brain]] and nervous system, for example) without which they cannot exist. According to this doctrine the material creates and determines consciousness, not vice versa. 

Materialist theories are mainly divided into three groups. Naive materialism identifies the material world with specific elements (e.g. the scheme of the four elements—fire, air, water and earth—devised by the [[pre-Socratic philosopher]] [[Empedocles]]). Metaphysical materialism examines separated parts of the world in a static, isolated environment. [[Dialectical materialism]] adapts the Hegelian dialectic for materialism, examining parts of the world in relation to each other within a dynamic environment.

Materialism is closely related to [[physicalism]], the view that all that exists is ultimately physical. Philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the discoveries of the physical sciences to incorporate more sophisticated notions of physicality than mere ordinary matter, such as: [[spacetime]], [[energy|physical energies]] and [[force]]s, [[dark matter]], and so on. Thus the term "physicalism" is preferred over "materialism" by some, while others use the terms as if they are [[synonym]]ous.

Philosophies contradictory to materialism or physicalism include [[idealism]], [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], and other forms of [[monism]].

==Overview==
[[File:La Mettrie, L'homme machine, 1748 Wellcome L0015753.jpg|thumb|In 1748, French doctor and philosopher [[La Mettrie]] exposes the first materialistic definition of the human soul in [[L'Homme Machine]] ]]
Materialism belongs to the class of [[monism|monist]] [[ontology]]. As such, it is different from ontological theories based on [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] or [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]. For singular explanations of the phenomenal reality, materialism would be in contrast to [[idealism]], [[neutral monism]], and [[spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualism]].

Despite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many,&lt;ref name=Edwards1972&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Edwards |editor-first=Paul  |editor-link=Paul Edwards (philosopher)|date=1972 |origyear=1967 |title=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy |volume=Vols.1-4 |postscript=(Originally published 1967 in 8 volumes) |isbn=0-02-894950-1}} Alternative {{ISBN|978-0-02-894950-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Priest1991&gt;{{citation |last=Priest |first=Stephen |year=1991 |title=Theories of the Mind |place=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-013069-1}} Alternative {{ISBN|978-0-14-013069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novack1979&gt;{{citation |last=Novack |first=George |year=1979 |authorlink=George Novack |title=The Origins of Materialism |place=New York |publisher=Pathfinder Press |isbn=0-87348-022-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, which are defined in contrast to each other: idealism and materialism.{{ref label|a|a|none}} The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality, and the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions: "what does reality consist of?" and "how does it originate?" To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind (ideas) are primary, and matter secondary. To materialists, matter is primary, and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary, the product of matter acting upon matter.&lt;ref name=Novack1979/&gt;

The materialist view is perhaps best understood in its opposition to the doctrines of immaterial substance applied to the mind historically, famously by [[René Descartes]]. However, by itself materialism says nothing about how material substance should be characterized. In practice, it is frequently assimilated to one variety of [[physicalism]] or another.

Materialism is often associated with [[Reduction (philosophy)|reductionism]], according to which the objects or phenomena individuated at one level of description, if they are genuine, must be explicable in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description—typically, at a more reduced level. '''Non-reductive materialism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; explicitly rejects this notion, however, taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects, properties, or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents. [[Jerry Fodor]] influentially argues this view, according to which empirical laws and explanations in "special sciences" like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics. A lot of vigorous literature has grown up around the relation between these views.

Modern philosophical materialists extend the definition of other scientifically observable entities such as [[energy]], [[force]]s, and the [[curvature of space]]. However philosophers such as [[Mary Midgley]] suggest that the concept of "matter" is elusive and poorly defined.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Midgley]] ''The Myths We Live By''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Materialism typically contrasts with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], [[phenomenalism]], [[idealism]], [[vitalism]], and [[dual-aspect monism]]. Its materiality can, in some ways, be linked to the concept of [[determinism]], as espoused by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers.

During the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] extended the concept of materialism to elaborate a ''materialist conception of history'' centered on the roughly empirical world of human activity (practice, including labor) and the [[institution]]s created, reproduced, or destroyed by that activity (see [[historical materialism|materialist conception of history]]). Later Marxists, such as [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] developed the notion of [[dialectical materialism]] which characterized later [[Marxist philosophy]] and method.

==History&lt;!--'History of materialism' and 'New materialism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{also|History of metaphysical naturalism}}
===Axial Age===
Materialism developed, possibly independently, in several geographically separated regions of [[Eurasia]] during what [[Karl Jaspers]] termed the [[Axial Age]] ({{Circa}} 800–200 BC).

In [[ancient Indian philosophy]], materialism developed around 600 BC with the works of [[Ajita Kesakambali]], [[Payasi]], [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], and the proponents of the [[Cārvāka]] school of philosophy. Kanada became one of the early proponents of [[atomism]]. The [[Nyaya]]–[[Vaisesika]] school ({{Circa}} 600 BC – 100 BC) developed one of the earliest forms of atomism, though their proofs of God and their positing that consciousness was not material precludes labelling them as materialists. [[Buddhist atomism]] and the [[Jainism|Jaina]] school continued the atomic tradition.

[[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] [[atomists]] like [[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], and [[Epicurus]] prefigure later materialists. The Latin poem ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' by [[Lucretius]] (99 BC – c. 55 BC) reflects the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] philosophy of Democritus and Epicurus. According to this view, all that exists is matter and void, and all phenomena result from different motions and conglomerations of base material particles called "atoms" (literally: "indivisibles"). ''De Rerum Natura'' provides mechanistic explanations for phenomena such as erosion, evaporation, wind, and sound. Famous principles like "nothing can touch body but body" first appeared in the works of Lucretius. Democritus and Epicurus however did not hold to a monist ontology since they held to the ontological separation of matter and space i.e. space being "another kind" of being, indicating that the definition of "materialism" is wider than given scope for in this article.

===Common Era===
[[Wang Chong]] (27 – c. 100 AD) was a Chinese thinker of the early [[Common Era]] said to be a materialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=tAeFipOVx4MC |page=228 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism (2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Indian materialist [[Jayaraashi Bhatta]] (6th century) in his work ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' ("The upsetting of all principles") refuted the [[Nyaya Sutra]] epistemology. The materialistic [[Cārvāka]] philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1400. When [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] compiled ''Sarva-darśana-samgraha'' (a digest of all philosophies) in the 14th century, he had no Cārvāka/Lokāyata text to quote from, or even refer to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carvaka4india.com/2011/12/history-of-indian-materialism.html ''History of Indian Materialism''], Ramakrishna Bhattacharya&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 12th-century [[al-Andalus]], the [[Early Islamic philosophy|Arabian philosopher]], [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer), wrote discussions on materialism in his [[philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus''), while vaguely foreshadowing the idea of a [[historical materialism]].&lt;ref name=Urvoy&gt;Dominique Urvoy, "The Rationality of Everyday Life: The Andalusian Tradition? (Aropos of Hayy's First Experiences)", in Lawrence I. Conrad (1996), ''The World of Ibn Tufayl: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Ḥayy Ibn Yaqẓān'', pp. 38-46, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09300-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern philosophy&lt;!--'German materialism' redirects here--&gt;===
[[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679)&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes/ Thomas Hobbes (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592–1665)&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gassendi/ Pierre Gassendi (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; represented the materialist tradition in opposition to the attempts of [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) to provide the [[natural sciences]] with dualist foundations. There followed the materialist and [[atheism|atheist]] ''abbé'' [[Jean Meslier]] (1664–1729) and the works of the [[French materialism|French materialists]]: [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]], the German-French [[Baron d'Holbach]] (1723–1789), [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784), and other French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers. In England [[John "Walking" Stewart]] (1747–1822) insisted in seeing matter as endowed with a [[moral]] dimension had a major impact on the philosophical poetry of [[William Wordsworth]] (1770–1850).

In [[late modern philosophy]], German [[dialectical materialist]] and atheist anthropologist [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]&lt;ref name="NC57"&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; would signal a new turn in materialism through his book, ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841), which presented a [[Humanism|humanist]] account of religion as the outward projection of man's inward nature. 

Another notable school of naturalist thought that developed in the middle of the 19th century was '''German materialism''': members included [[Ludwig Büchner]], [[Jacob Moleschott]], and [[Karl Vogt]].&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen Chadwick, ''The Secularization of the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 165: "During the 1850s German ... scientists conducted a controversy known ... as the materialistic controversy. It was specially associated with the names of Vogt, Moleschott and Büchner" and p. 173: "Frenchmen were surprised to see Büchner and Vogt. ... [T]he French were surprised at German materialism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Nineteenth Century and After]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=8-VXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q= Vol. 151], 1952, p. 227: "the Continental materialism of Moleschott and Buchner&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt;

Feuerbach's materialism would later heavily influence [[Karl Marx]], who in the late 19th century elaborated the concept of [[historical materialism]], which is the basis for what Marx and Engels outlined as [[scientific socialism]]:

{{Quote|text=The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and, next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view, the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in men's better insights into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange. They are to be sought, not in the philosophy, but in the economics of each particular epoch.|sign=Friedrich Engels|source=''Socialism: Scientific and Utopian''}}

Later, [[Vladimir Lenin]] outlined philosophical materialism in his book ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]'', which connected the political conceptions put forth by his opponents to their anti-materialist philosophies. Therein, Lenin attempted to answer questions concerning matter, experience, sensations, space and time, causality, and freedom.

===Contemporary philosophy===
====Continental philosophy====
{{main|Speculative materialism|Transcendental materialism}}
[[Contemporary philosophy|Contemporary]] [[Continental philosopher]] [[Gilles Deleuze]] has attempted to rework and strengthen classical materialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/deleuze/ |title=Gilles Deleuze |last=Smith |first=Daniel |last2=Protevi |first2=John |date=1 January 2015 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary theorists such as [[Manuel DeLanda]], working with this reinvigorated materialism, have come to be classified as "new materialist" in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dolphijn |first=Rick |last2=Tuin |first2=Iris van der |date=1 January 2013 |title=New Materialism: Interviews &amp; Cartographies |url=http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/books/titles/new-materialism/ |language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''New materialism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; has now become its own specialized subfield of knowledge, with courses being offered on the topic at major universities, as well as numerous conferences, edited collections, and monographs devoted to it. [[Jane Bennett (political theorist)|Jane Bennett]]'s book ''Vibrant Matter'' (Duke UP, 2010) has been particularly instrumental in bringing theories of monist ontology and vitalism back into a critical theoretical fold dominated by [[poststructuralist]] theories of language and discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OcUcmAEACAAJ |title=Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things |last=Bennett |first=Jane |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=9780822346333 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Mel Y.

====Analytic philosophy====
{{see also|Physicalism|Scientific materialism}}
[[Contemporary philosophy|Contemporary]] [[analytic philosopher]]s—e.g., [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], and [[Jerry Fodor]]—operate within a broadly [[physicalist]] or [[scientific materialist]] framework, producing rival accounts of how best to accommodate [[mind]], including [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[anomalous monism]], [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]], and so on.&lt;ref name=StandfordEM&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/materialism-eliminative/#SpeProFolPsy, by William Ramsey&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific materialism is often synonymous with, and has so far been described, as being a [[reductive materialism]]. In recent years, [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] have advocated a radically contrasting position (at least, in regards to certain hypotheses); [[eliminativist materialism]] holds that some mental phenomena simply do not exist at all, and that talk of those mental phenomena reflects a totally spurious "[[folk psychology]]" and [[introspection illusion]]. That is, an eliminative materialist might believe that a concept like "belief" simply has no basis in fact—the way folk science speaks of demon-caused illnesses would be just one obvious example. Reductive materialism being at one end of a continuum (our theories will ''reduce'' to facts) and eliminative materialism on the other (certain theories will need to be ''eliminated'' in light of new facts), [[Revisionary materialism]] is somewhere in the middle.&lt;ref name="StandfordEM"/&gt;

==Defining matter==
The nature and definition of matter—like other key concepts in science and philosophy—have occasioned much debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Is there a single kind of matter ([[hyle]]) which everything is made of, or multiple kinds? Is matter a continuous substance capable of expressing multiple forms ([[hylomorphism]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9041771 "Hylomorphism"] ''Concise Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; or a number of discrete, unchanging constituents ([[atomism]])?&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-21 "Atomism: Antiquity to the Seventeenth Century"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909182942/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-21 |date=9 September 2006 }} ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas''&lt;br&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050305082323/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-22 "Atomism in the Seventeenth Century"] ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas''
&lt;br&gt;[http://people.umass.edu/schaffer/papers/Fundamental.pdf Article by a philosopher who opposes atomism]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061221163403/http://people.umass.edu/schaffer/papers/Fundamental.pdf |date=21 December 2006 }}

&lt;br&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/ Article on traditional Greek atomism]
&lt;br&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-modern/ "Atomism from the 17th to the 20th Century"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Does it have intrinsic properties ([[substance theory]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/substance/ |title='&amp;#39;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'&amp;#39; on substance theory |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/essence.htm |title=The Friesian School on Substance and Essence |publisher=Friesian.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or is it lacking them ([[prima materia]])?

One challenge to the traditional concept of matter as tangible "stuff" came with the rise of [[field physics]] in the 19th century. [[Special relativity|Relativity]] shows that matter and energy (including the spatially distributed energy of fields) are interchangeable. This enables the ontological view that energy is prima materia and matter is one of its forms. On the other hand, the Standard Model of Particle physics uses [[quantum field theory]] to describe all interactions. On this view it could be said that fields are prima materia and the energy is a property of the field.

According to the dominant cosmological model, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], less than 5% of the universe's energy density is made up of the "matter" described by the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and the majority of the universe is composed of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]—with little agreement amongst scientists about what these are made of.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Sadoulet "Particle Dark Matter in the Universe: At the Brink of Discovery?" ''Science'' 5 January 2007: Vol. 315. no. 5808, pp. 61 - 63&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of quantum physics, some scientists believed the concept of matter had merely changed, while others believed the conventional position could no longer be maintained. For instance [[Werner Heisenberg]] said "The ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct 'actuality' of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation, however, is impossible... atoms are not things." Likewise, some philosophers{{which|date=November 2010}} feel that these dichotomies necessitate a switch from materialism to physicalism. Others use the terms "materialism" and "physicalism" interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/materialism.html "Many philosophers and scientists now use the terms `material' and `physical' interchangeably"] ''Dictionary of the Philosophy of Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of matter has changed in response to new scientific discoveries. Thus materialism has no definite content independent of the particular theory of matter on which it is based. According to [[Noam Chomsky]], any [[property (philosophy)|property]] can be considered material, if one defines matter such that it has that property.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, Noam 2000"&gt;Chomsky, Noam (2000) ''New Horizons in the Study of Language and Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physicalism==
George Stack distinguishes between materialism and physicalism: {{quote|In the twentieth century, physicalism has emerged out of positivism. Physicalism restricts meaningful statements to physical bodies or processes that are verifiable or in principle verifiable. It is an empirical hypothesis that is subject to revision and, hence, lacks the dogmatic stance of classical materialism. [[Herbert Feigl]] defended physicalism in the United States and consistently held that mental states are brain states and that mental terms have the same referent as physical terms. The twentieth century has witnessed many materialist theories of the mental, and much debate surrounding them.&lt;ref name="Craig1998"&gt;{{Citation |first=George J. |last=stack |editor-first=E. |editor-last=Craig |year=1998 |title=Materialism |encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Luther to Nifo |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-18714-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3UBxqkkCX8C&amp;pg=PA171 |pages=171–172 |issue=v. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, not all conceptions of physicalism are tied to verificationist theories of meaning or direct realist accounts of perception. Rather, physicalists believe that no “element of reality” is missing from the mathematical formalism of our best description of the world. “Materialist” physicalists also believe that the formalism describes fields of insentience. In other words, the intrinsic nature of the physical is non-experiential. 

==Criticism and alternatives==

===From scientists===
[[Rudolf Peierls]], a physicist who played a major role in the [[Manhattan Project]], rejected materialism, saying "The premise that you can describe in terms of physics the whole function of a human being...including knowledge and consciousness, is untenable. There is still something missing."&lt;ref&gt;[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/vedanta/matter-undermined/articleshow/17055344.cms]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erwin Schrödinger]] said "Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else".&lt;ref&gt;"General Scientific and Popular Papers," in Collected Papers, Vol. 4. Vienna: Austrian Academy of Sciences. Friedr. Vieweg &amp; Sohn, Braunschweig/Wiesbaden. p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Werner Heisenberg]], who came up with the [[uncertainty principle]] wrote "The [[ontology]] of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct ‘actuality’ of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation, however, is impossible…Atoms are not things".&lt;ref&gt;W. Heisenberg (1962). ''Physics and philosophy: the revolution in modern science''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quantum mechanics====
Some 20th century physicists (such as [[Eugene Wigner]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ie/books?id=EFboCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=solipsism+may+be+logically+consistent+with+present+quantum+mechanics,+monism+in+the+sense+of+materialism+is+not.”&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9-tyUwZfeAhUEC8AKHQsGCfEQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=solipsism%20may%20be%20logically%20consistent%20with%20present%20quantum%20mechanics%2C%20monism%20in%20the%20sense%20of%20materialism%20is%20not.”&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Stapp]])&lt;ref&gt;"Quantum interactive dualism - an alternative to materialism," ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and modern day physicists and science writers—such as [[Paul Davies]] and [[John Gribbin]]—have argued that materialism has been disproven by certain scientific findings in physics, such as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[chaos theory]]. In 1991, Gribbin and Davies released their book ''The Matter Myth'', the first chapter of which, "The Death of Materialism", contained the following passage:

{{quotation|Then came our Quantum theory, which totally transformed our image of matter. The old assumption that the microscopic world of atoms was simply a scaled-down version of the everyday world had to be abandoned. Newton's deterministic machine was replaced by a shadowy and paradoxical conjunction of waves and particles, governed by the laws of chance, rather than the rigid rules of causality. An extension of the quantum theory goes beyond even this; it paints a picture in which solid matter dissolves away, to be replaced by weird excitations and vibrations of invisible field energy.

Quantum physics undermines materialism because it reveals that matter has far less "substance" than we might believe. But another development goes even further by demolishing Newton's image of matter as inert lumps. This development is the theory of chaos, which has recently gained widespread attention.|Paul Davies and John Gribbin|''The Matter Myth''|Chapter 1}}

====Digital physics====
Davies' and Gribbin's objections are shared by proponents of [[digital physics]] who view information rather than matter to be fundamental. Famous physicist and proponent of digital physics [[John Archibald Wheeler]] wrote "all matter and all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a [[Participatory Antropic Principle|participatory universe]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Information, Physics, Quantum: The Search for Links" in ''Complexity, Entropy and the Physics of Information'' (1990), ed. by [[Wojciech H. Zurek]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their objections were also shared by some founders of quantum theory, such as [[Max Planck]], who wrote:

{{quotation|As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter.|Max Planck|''Das Wesen der Materie''|1944}}

===Religious and spiritual views===
According to Constantin Gutberlet writing in  ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1911), materialism, defined as "a philosophical system which regards matter as the only reality in the world [...] denies the existence of God and the soul".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913 |first=Constantin |last=Gutberlet |wstitle=Materialism |volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view materialism could be perceived incompatible with most world religions.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Materialism could be conflated with atheism.{{cn|date=January 2018}} However Friedrich Lange wrote in 1892 "Diderot has not always in the Encyclopaedia expressed his own individual opinion, but it is just as true that at its commencement he had not yet got as far as Atheism and Materialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lange |first1=Friedrich Albert |author-link1=Friedrich Albert Lange |series=English and foreign philosophical library |title=History of Materialism and Criticism of Its Present Importance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rng3AAAAMAAJ |volume=2: History of materialism until Kant |publisher=K. Paul, Trench, Trübner, &amp; Company, Limited |publication-date=1892 |edition=4 |pages=25–26 |accessdate=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of [[Hinduism]] and [[transcendentalism]] regards all matter as an illusion called [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]], blinding humans from knowing the truth. Transcendental experiences like the perception of [[Brahman]] are considered to destroy the illusion.&lt;ref name="Maya"&gt;[http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/06/25/maya-the-concept-of-illusion/ mahavidya.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], taught: "There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes; We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] {{lds||dc|131|7|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spirit element is believed to always have existed and to be co-eternal with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Smith |year=1938 |editor-first=Joseph Fielding |editor-last=Smith |editor-link=Joseph Fielding Smith |title=[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]] |place=Salt Lake City |publisher=Deseret Book |oclc=718055 |pages=352–354 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical objections===
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] argued against all three forms of materialism, subjective [[idealism]] (which he contrasts with his "[[transcendental idealism]]"&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' where he gives a "refutation of idealism" in pp345-52 (1st Ed) and pp 244-7 (2nd Ed) in the Norman Kemp Smith edition&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[mind–body dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (A379, p352 NKS translation).

"If, however, as commonly happens, we seek to extend the concept of dualism, and take it in the transcendental sense, neither it nor the two counter-alternatives — pneumatism [idealism] on the one hand, materialism on the other — would have any sort of basis [...] Neither the transcendental object which underlies outer appearances nor that which underlies inner intuition, is in itself either matter or a thinking being, but a ground (to us unknown)..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kant also argues that change and time require an enduring substrate,&lt;ref&gt;"Kant argues that we can determine that there has been a change in the objects of our perception, not merely a change in our perceptions themselves, only by conceiving of what we perceive as successive states of enduring substances (see Substance)".[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/DB047SECT7 ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206102552/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/DB047SECT7 |date=6 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and does so in connection with his refutation of idealism.&lt;ref&gt;"All determination of time presupposes something permanent in perception. This permanent cannot, however, be something in me [...]" ''Critique of Pure Reason'', B274, P245 (NKS translation)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodern]]/[[poststructuralist]] thinkers also express a skepticism about any all-encompassing metaphysical scheme. Philosopher [[Mary Midgley]],&lt;ref&gt;see [[Mary Midgley]] ''The Myths we Live by''&lt;/ref&gt; among others,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, L. (1987). ''Saving Belief'' Princeton, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reppert, V. (1992). "Eliminative Materialism, Cognitive Suicide, and Begging the Question". ''Metaphilosophy'' 23: 378-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (10 June 2009) "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology". Mater Dei Institute. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boghossian, P. (1990). "The Status of Content" ''Philosophical Review'' 99: 157-84. and (1991) "The Status of Content Revisited". ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'' 71: 264-78.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that materialism is a [[self-refuting idea]], at least in its [[Eliminative materialism|eliminative]] form.

====Idealisms====
An argument for [[idealism]], such as those of [[Hegel]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], is ''[[ipso facto]]'' an argument against materialism. Matter can be argued to be redundant, as in [[bundle theory]], and mind-independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective [[percept]]s.  Berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external.  As such, the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent (perceived) stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience.

If matter and energy are seen as necessary to explain the physical world, but incapable of explaining mind, [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] results. [[Emergence]], [[holism]], and [[process philosophy]] seek to ameliorate the perceived shortcomings of traditional (especially [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]]) materialism without abandoning materialism entirely.

===Materialism as methodology===
Some critics object to materialism as part of an overly skeptical, narrow or [[reductionism|reductivist]] approach to theorizing, rather than to the ontological claim that matter is the only substance.
[[particle physics|Particle physicist]] and Anglican [[theology|theologian]] [[John Polkinghorne]] objects to what he calls ''promissory materialism''—claims that materialistic science ''will'' eventually succeed in explaining phenomena it has not so far been able to explain.&lt;ref&gt;However, critics of materialism are equally guilty of prognosticating that it will ''never'' be able to explain certain phenomena. "Over a hundred years ago [[William James]] saw clearly that science would never resolve the [[mind-body dichotomy|mind-body problem]]." [http://www.designinference.com/documents/1999.10.spiritual_machines.htm ''Are We Spiritual Machines?''] Dembski, W.&lt;/ref&gt; Polkinghorne prefers "[[dual-aspect monism]]" to materialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/polkinghorne.htm |title=Interview with John Polkinghorne |publisher=Crosscurrents.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientific materialists have been criticized, for example by [[Noam Chomsky]], for failing to provide clear definitions for what constitutes matter, leaving the term "materialism" without any definite meaning. Chomsky also states that since the concept of matter may be affected by new scientific discoveries, as has happened in the past, scientific materialists are being dogmatic in assuming the opposite.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, Noam 2000" /&gt;

"'''Mississippi Goddam'''" is a song written and performed by American singer and pianist [[Nina Simone]], who later announced the anthem to be her "first civil rights song"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldstein|first=Ruth|authorlink=Ruth Feldstein|date=March 1, 2005|title="I Don't Trust You Anymore": Nina Simone, Culture, and Black Activism in the 1960s|url=|journal=Journal of American History|volume=|pages=1349|via=ignacio}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was released on her album ''[[Nina Simone in Concert]]'' in 1964. The album was based on recordings of three concerts she gave at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1964. The album was her first release for the Dutch label [[Philips Records]] and is indicative of the more political turn her recorded music took during this period.   

Simone composed "Mississippi Goddam" in less than an hour. Together with "[[Four Women (song)|Four Women]]" and "[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]", it is one of her most famous [[protest song]]s and self-written compositions.

==Interpretation==
The song captures Simone's response to the murder of [[Medgar Evers]] in Mississippi; and the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], killing four black children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Nina Simone's Time Is Now, Again|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/movies/nina-simones-time-is-now-again.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = June 19, 2015|access-date = 2015-07-05|issn = 0362-4331|first = Salamishah|last = Tillet}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the recording she cynically announces the song as "a [[show tune]], but the show hasn't been written for it yet." The song begins jauntily, with a show tune feel, but demonstrates its political focus early on with its refrain "Alabama's got me so upset, Tennessee's made me lose my rest, and everybody knows about Mississippi ''goddam.''" In the song she says: "Keep on sayin' 'go slow'...to do things gradually would bring more tragedy. Why don't you see it? Why don't you feel it? I don't know, I don't know. You don't have to live next to me, just give me my equality!''
"

== Reception ==
Simone first performed the song at the [[The Village Gate|Village Gate]] nightclub in [[Greenwich Village]], and shortly thereafter in March 1964 at Carnegie Hall, in front of a mostly white audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A raised voice: How Nina Simone turned the movement into music|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice|website = The New Yorker|accessdate =July 5, 2015|date =August 11, 2014|last = Pierpont|first = Claudia Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carnegie Hall recording was subsequently released as a single and became an anthem during the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nina Simone Reveals 'Mississippi Goddam' Song 'Hurt My Career'|work=Jet|date=March 24, 1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22mississippi+goddam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o_kDT6rhKIivgweo5_GfAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mississippi%20goddam%22&amp;f=false|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mississippi Goddam" was banned in several Southern states, ostensibly because of the word "goddam" in the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2010/03/mississippi-goddam-nina-simone |title=Top 20 Political Songs: Mississippi Goddam – Nina Simone – 1964 |date=March 25, 2010 |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |first=Ian K. |last=Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boxes of promotional singles sent to radio stations around the country were returned with each record cracked in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How the Civil-Rights Era Made and Broke Nina Simone|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/nina-simone-and-mississippi-goddam/396923/|accessdate =July 5, 2015|date =June 27, 2015|website = The Atlantic|last = Chandler|first = Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simone performed the song in front of 10,000 people at the end of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] when she and other black activists, including [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and [[Harry Belafonte]] crossed police lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Almost Forgotten Selma March|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/20/the-forgotten-second-selma-march.html|website = The Daily Beast|date = March 20, 2015|accessdate =July 5, 2015|first = Gary|last = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madutā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "malleability", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāyamadutā'' - malleability of mental body (or pliancy of cetisakas)
* ''Cittamadutā'' - malleability of consciousness (or pliancy of citta)

These two mental factors have the characteristic of the subsiding of rigidity (''thambha'') in the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2367-2369}}
:The twofold malleability has the characteristic of the subsiding of rigidity (''thambha'') in the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush rigidity. It is manifested as non-resistance, and its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to such defilements as wrong views and conceit, which create rigidity.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=226}}
:According to the ''Dhammasangani'' (par 44, 45) this pair of cetasikas consist in suavity, smoothness and absence of rigidity.

The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 130) states:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=226}}
: They have the characteristic of suppressing the rigidity of mental factors and of consciousness; the function of crushing the same in both; the manifestation or effect of setting up no resistance; and have mental factors and consciousness as proximate cause. They are the opponents of the corruptions, such as opinionatedness (''diṭṭhi'') and conceit which cause mental rigidity.

{{Administrative law}}
The '''doctrine of nondelegation''' is the theory that one branch of government must not authorize another entity to exercise the power or function which it is constitutionally authorized to exercise itself. It is [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] or [[wikt:implicit|implicit]] in all written [[constitution]]s that impose a strict structural [[separation of powers]]. It is usually applied in questions of constitutionally improper delegations of powers of any of the three branches of government to either of the other, to the administrative state, or to private entities. Although it is usually constitutional for executive officials to delegate executive powers to executive branch subordinates, there can also be improper delegations of powers within an executive branch.

==Australia==

[[Federalism in Australia|Australian federalism]] does not permit the federal Parliament or Government to delegate its powers to state or territorial parliaments or governments, nor territorial parliaments or governments to delegate their powers to the federal Parliament or Government, but the states parliaments delegate its powers to the federal parliament by means of section 51 subsection (xxxvii) of the Constitution Act 1901.

==Canada==

[[Canadian federalism]] does not permit Parliament or the provincial legislatures to delegate their powers to each other.

==United States==

In the [[Federal Government of the United States]], the ''nondelegation doctrine'' is the principle that the [[Congress of the United States]], being vested with "all legislative powers" by [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 1 of the [[United States Constitution]], cannot delegate that power to anyone else.  However, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[J. W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States]]'' (1928)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |title=J. W. Hampton, Jr. &amp;amp; Co. v. United States
  |id=276 U.S. 394 (1928)
  |date=April 9, 1928
  |publisher=Justia US Supreme Court Center
  |url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/276/394/case.html
  |accessdate=2012-03-29
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; that congressional delegation of legislative authority is an [[Implied powers|implied power]] of Congress that is constitutional so long as Congress provides an "[[Intelligibility (communication)|intelligible]] principle" to guide the executive branch: "'In determining what Congress may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the government co-ordination.' So long as Congress 'shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.'"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'' (1989), citing ''[[J. W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States]]'', 276 U.S. 394, 406, 48 S.Ct. 348, 351(1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is an agency in the [[Executive (government)|Executive branch]] created by Congress with the power to regulate [[food]] and [[approved drug|drugs]] in the United States. Congress has given the FDA a broad mandate to ensure the safety of the public and prevent [[false advertising]], but it is up to the agency to assess risks and announce prohibitions on harmful additives, and to determine the process by which actions will be brought based on the same. Similarly, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has been given the responsibility of collecting taxes that are assessed under the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. Although Congress has determined the amount of the tax to be assessed, it has delegated to the IRS the authority to determine how such taxes are to be collected. [[Independent agencies of the United States government|Administrative agencies]] like these are sometimes referred to as the [[Fourth Branch]] of government.

===Case law===
The origins of the nondelegation doctrine, as interpreted in U.S., can be traced back to, at least, 1690, when [[John Locke]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Legislative  transfer the Power of Making Laws to any other hands. For it being but a delegated Power from the People, they, who have it, cannot pass it over to others. . . . And when the people have said, We will submit to rules, and be govern'd by Laws made by such Men, and in such Forms, no Body else can say other Men shall make Laws for them; nor can the people be bound by any Laws but such as are Enacted by those, whom they have Chosen, and Authorised to make Laws for them. The power of the Legislative being derived from the People by a positive voluntary Grant and Institution, can be no other, than what the positive Grant conveyed, which being only to make Laws, and not to make Legislators, the Legislative can have no power to transfer their Authority of making laws, and place it in other hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]], ''[[Second Treatise of Civil Government]] (1690).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of nondelegation was ''Wayman v. Southard'' (1825).&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=23&amp;invol=1 FindLaw.com ''Wayman v. Southard'' decision tesxt]&lt;/ref&gt; Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe [[Due process|judicial procedure]]; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between "important" subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that "a general provision may be made, and power given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details." In 1892, the Court in ''Field v. Clark'', 143 U.S. 649, noted "That congress cannot delegate legislative power to the president is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution"&lt;ref name="field"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?friend=nytimes&amp;court=us&amp;vol=143&amp;invol=649 FindLaw.com ''Field v. Clark'' decision text]&lt;/ref&gt; while holding that the tariff-setting authority delegated in the [[McKinley Tariff|McKinley Act]] "was not the making of law," but rather empowered the executive branch to serve as a "mere agent" of Congress.&lt;ref name="field"/&gt;

During the 1930s, Congress provided the executive branch with wide powers to combat the [[Great Depression]]. The Supreme Court case of ''[[Panama Refining v. Ryan]]'', [[Case citation|293 U.S. 388]] (1935) involved the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], which included a provision granting the [[President of the United States|President]] the authority to prohibit the interstate shipment of [[petroleum]] in excess of certain quotas. In the ''Panama Refining'' case, however, the Court struck down the provision on the ground that Congress had set "no criterion to govern the President's course."

Other provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act were also challenged. In ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'' (1935), the Supreme Court considered a provision which permitted the President to approve trade codes, drafted by the businesses themselves, so as to ensure "fair competition." The Supreme Court found that, since the law sets no explicit guidelines, businesses "may roam at will and the President may approve or disapprove their proposal as he may see fit." Thus, they struck down the relevant provisions of the Recovery Act.

In the 1989 case ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.buffalo.edu/Academics/courses/631/eemeid/materials/Mistretta.htm ''Mistretta v. United States decision text]&lt;/ref&gt; the Court stated that:

{{quote|Applying this "intelligible principle" test to congressional delegations, our jurisprudence has been driven by a practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives. Accordingly, this Court has deemed it "constitutionally sufficient" if Congress clearly delineates the general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.}}

Only rarely has the Supreme Court invalidated laws as violations of the nondelegation doctrine. Exemplifying the Court's legal reasoning on this matter, it ruled in the 1998 case ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'' that the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]], which authorized the President to selectively void portions of [[appropriation bill]]s, was a violation of the [[Presentment Clause]], which sets forth the formalities governing the passage of legislation. Although the Court noted that the attorneys prosecuting the case had extensively discussed the nondelegation doctrine, the Court declined to consider that question. However, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], in a [[concurring opinion]], wrote that he would have found the statute to violate the exclusive responsibility for laws to be made by Congress.

===Original Sixteenth Amendment===

The original [[United_States_Bill_of_Rights|Bill of Rights]] approved by the House of Representatives included a Sixteenth Article, which stated that "(t)he powers delegated by the Constitution to the government of the United States, shall be exercised as therein appropriated, so that the Legislative shall never exercise the powers vested in the Executive or Judicial; nor the Executive the powers vested in the Legislative or Judicial; nor the Judicial the powers vested in the Legislative or Executive." This article was not included in subsequent versions of the Articles or in the final Amendments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33278">'''Normality''' is a [[behavior]] that can be normal for an individual (intrapersonal normality) when it is consistent with the most common behaviour for that person. Normal is also used to describe individual behaviour that conforms to the most common behaviour in society (known as [[conformity]]). Definitions of normality vary by person, time, place, and situation – it changes along with changing societal standards and [[Norm (social)|norms]]. Normal behavior is often only recognized in contrast to [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormality]].  In its simplest form, normality is seen as good while abnormality is seen as bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven James|title=Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health|year=2011|publisher=Praeger|location=New York|isbn=9780313399312|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=otwxtVaj_O0C&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=Normality+does+not+equal+mental+health:+The+need+to+look+elsewhere+for+standards+of+good+psychological+health.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone being seen as normal or not normal can have social ramifications, such as being [[Inclusion (value and practice)|included]], excluded or [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] by larger society.

== Definitions ==
Normality has been functionally and differentially defined by a vast number of disciplines, so there is not one single definition.

===Statistics===
In general, 'normal' refers to a lack of significant deviation from the average.  The word normal is used in a more narrow sense in mathematics, where a [[normal distribution]] describes a population whose characteristics centers around the average or the norm.  When looking at a specific behaviour, such as the frequency of lying, a researcher may use a Gaussian bell curve to plot all reactions, and a normal reaction would be within one standard deviation, or the most average 68.3%.  However, this mathematical model only holds for one particular trait at a time, since, for example,  the probability of a single individual being within one standard deviation for 36 independent variables would be one in a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Modis|first=Theodore|title=The normal, the natural, and the harmonic|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|date=March 2007|volume=74|issue=3|pages=391–398|url=http://growth-dynamics.com/articles/Normal.htm|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2006.07.003|access-date=2012-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085907/http://growth-dynamics.com/articles/Normal.htm|archive-date=2012-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In statistics, normal is often arbitrarily considered anything that falls within about 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, or the most average 95% (see [[1.96]]). The probability of an individual being within 1.96 standard deviations for 269 independent variables is approximately one in a million.&lt;ref&gt;Figured mathematically 0.95^269 is approximately 0.000001&lt;/ref&gt;  For only 59 independent variables, the probability is just under 5%.&lt;ref&gt;Figured mathematically 0.95^59 is approximately 0.048&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this definition of normal, it is abnormal to be normal for 59 independent variables.{{clarify|what is the relevance of this?  For instance, is this bounding what it means to be socially normal to 59 traits, or is it simply saying nothing can be technically "normal" when 60 variables are in play?--the latter statement seems much more concise than what is currently stated in the article.|date=August 2018}}

===Durkheim===
The French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] indicated in his ''Rules of the Sociological Method'' that it was necessary for the sociological method to offer parameters to distinguish normality from pathology or abnormality.  He suggested that behaviors or "social facts" which are present in the majority of cases are normal, and exceptions to that behavior indicate pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=Émile|title=Rules of Sociological Method|year=1982|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-907940-9|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Durkheim's model of normality further explained that the most frequent or general behaviors, and thus the most normal behaviors, will persist through transition periods in society. Crime, for instance, exists under every society through every time period, and so should be considered normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Robert Alun|title=mile Durkheim: An Introduction to Four Major Works|year=1986|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=60–81|url=http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/rules.html#pgfId=2822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a two-fold version of normality; behaviors considered normal on a societal level may still be considered pathological on an individual level. On the individual level, people who violate social norms, such as  [[criminals]], will invite a punishment from others in the society.

===Influence of social norms===
Individuals' behaviours are guided by what they perceive to be society's expectations and their peers' norms. People measure the appropriateness of their actions by how far away they are from those [[norm (social)|social norms]]. However, what is perceived as the norm may or may not actually be the most common behaviour. In some cases of [[pluralistic ignorance]], most people falsely believe the social norm is one thing, but in fact very few people hold that view.

When people are made more aware of a social norm, particularly a [[descriptive norm]] (a norm describing what is done), their behaviour changes to become closer to that norm.  The power of these norms can be harnessed by [[Social norms approach|social norms marketing]], where the social norm is advertised to people in an attempt to stop extreme behaviour, such as binge drinking.  However, people at the other extreme (very little alcohol consumption) are equally likely to change their behaviour to become closer to the norm, in this case by increasing alcohol consumption.  Instead of using descriptive norms, more effective social norms marketing may use  [[injunctive norms]].  Instead of describing what behaviour is most commonly done, an injunctive norm is what is approved or disapproved of by society.  When individuals become aware of the injunctive norm, only the extremes will change their behaviour (by decreasing alcohol consumption) without the boomerang effect of under-indulgers increasing their drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=P. Wesley|author2=Jessica M. Nola |author3=Robert B. Cialdini |author4=Noah J. Goldstein |author5=Vladas Griskevicius |title=The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms|journal=Psychological Science|date=May 2007|volume=18 | issue = 5|pages=429–434|url=https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/118375.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x |pmid=17576283|hdl=10211.3/199684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social norms that guide people are not always normal for everyone.  Behaviours that are abnormal for most people may be considered normal for a subgroup or [[subculture]].  For example, normal college student behaviour may be to party and drink alcohol, but for a subculture of religious students, normal behaviour may be to go to church and pursue religion related activities.  Subcultures may actively reject "normal" behaviour, instead replacing society norms with their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magolda|first=Peter|author2=Kelsey Ebben |title=Students Serving Christ: Understanding the Role of Student Subcultures on a College Campus|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|date=January 2008|volume=32|issue=2|pages=138–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===
A disharmony exists between a virtual identity of the self and a real social identity, whether it be in the form of a trait or attribute. If a person does not have this disharmony, then he or she is described as normal. A virtual identity can take many definitions, but in this case a virtual identity is the identity that persons mentally create that conforms to societal standards and norms, it may not represent how they actually are, but it represents what they believe is the typical "normal" person. A real social identity is the identity that persons actually have in their society or is perceived, by themselves or others, to have. If these two identities have differences between each other, there is said to be disharmony.  Individuals may monitor and adapt their behaviour in terms of others' expected perceptions of the individual, which is described by the social psychology theory of [[self-presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=PRESENTATION OF SELF IN EVERYDAY LIFE|year=1959|publisher=DOUBLEDAY &amp; COMPANY INC|location=NY|url=http://www.clockwatching.net/~jimmy/eng101/articles/goffman_intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, normality exists based on societal norms, and whether someone is normal is entirely up to how he or she views him- or herself in contrast to how society views him or her. While trying to define and quantify normality is a good start, all definitions confront the problem of whether we are even describing an idea that even exists since there are so many different ways of viewing the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skopalová|first=Jitka|title=Social eviations, Labelling, and Normality|journal=Human Affairs|year=2010|volume=20|issue=4|pages=327–337|doi=10.2478/v10023-010-0034-8|url=http://versita.metapress.com/content/a17053485p84802w/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==
Many difficulties arise in measuring normal behaviors – biologists come across parallel issues when defining normality.  One complication which arises regards whether 'normality' is used correctly in everyday language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wachbroit|first=Robert|title=Normality as a Biological Concept|year=1994|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=61|issue=4|pages=579–591 |doi=10.1086/289823}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People say "This heart is abnormal" if only a portion of it is not working correctly, yet it may be inaccurate to include the entirety of the heart under the abnormal description.  There can be a difference between the normality of the structure and function of a body part.  Similarly, a behavioural pattern may not conform to social norms, but still be effective and non-problematic for that individual.  Where there is a dichotomy between appearance and function of a behaviour, it may be difficult to measure its normality.  This is applicable when trying to diagnose a pathology and is addressed in the DSM.

== Social Norms ==
What is viewed as normal can change dependent on both timeframe and environment. Normality can be viewed as "an endless process of man's self-creation and his reshaping of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Syristová|first=Eva|title=A Contribution to Phenomenology of the Human Normality in the Modern Time|year=2010| publisher=Dordrecht: Springer Science + Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this idea, it is possible to surmise that normality is not an all-encompassing term, but simply a relative term based around a current trend in time. With statistics, this is likened to the thought that if the data gathered provides a mean and standard deviation, over time these data that predict "normalness" start to predict or dictate it less and less since the social idea of normality is dynamic. This is shown in studies done on behavior in psychology and sociology where behavior in mating rituals or religious rituals can change within a century in humans, showing that the "normal" way that these rituals are performed shift and a new procedure becomes the normal one.

As another example, understandings of what is normal sexual behaviour varies greatly across time and place.  In many countries, perceptions on [[human sexuality|sexuality]] are largely becoming more liberal, especially views on the normality of masturbation and homosexuality.  Social understanding on normal sexual behaviour also varies greatly country by country – countries can be divided into categories of how they approach sexual normality, as conservative, homosexual-permissive, or liberal.  The United States, Ireland, and Poland have more conservative social understanding of sexuality among university students, while Scandinavian students consider a wider variety of sexual acts as normal.  Although some attempts have been made to define sexual acts as normal, abnormal, or indeterminate, these definitions are time-sensitive.  [[Gayle Rubin]]'s 1980s model of sexual 'normality' was comprehensive at the time but has since become outdated as society has liberalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Todd G.|author2=Travis A. Ryan |author3=Lisa Fox |author4=Daragh T. McDermott |author5=Melanie A. Morrison |title=Canadian university students' perceptions of the practices that constitute "normal" sexuality for men and women|journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|year=2008|volume=17 | issue = 4|pages=161–171|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_4_17/ai_n31903471/?tag=content;col1|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since normality shifts in time and environment, the mean and standard deviation are only useful for describing normality from the environment from which they are collected.

{{anchor|interpersonal}}

==Intrapersonal==
Most definitions of normality consider interpersonal normality, the comparison between many different individual's behaviours to distinguish normality from abnormality.  Intrapersonal normality looks at what is normal behaviour for one particular person (consistency within a person) and would be expected to vary person-to-person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hur|first=Taekyun |author2=Neal J. Roese |author3=Jae-Eun Namkoong|title=Regrets in the East and West: Role of intrapersonal versus interpersonal norms|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|date=June 2009|volume=12|issue=2|pages=151–156|doi=10.1111/j.1467-839X.2009.01275.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A mathematical model of normality could still be used for intrapersonal normality, by taking a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of many different occurrences of behaviour from one person over time.  Also like interpersonal normality, intrapersonal normality may change over time, due to changes in the individual as they age and due to changes in society (since society's view of normality influences individual peoples' behaviour).

It is most comfortable for people to engage in behaviour which conforms to their own personal habitual norms.  When things go wrong, people are more likely to attribute the negative outcome on any abnormal behaviour leading up to the mishap.  After a car crash, people may say "if only I didn't leave work early", blaming the crash on their actions which were not normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catellani|first=Patrizia|author2=Augusta I. Albertici |author3=Patrizia Milesi |title=Counterfactual thinking and stereotypes: The nonconformity effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=34|issue=4|pages=421–436|doi=10.1002/ejsp.206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[counterfactual thinking]] particularly associates abnormal behaviour with negative outcomes.

== Medicine ==
In [[medicine]], behavioral normality pertains to a patient's mental condition aligning with that of a model, [[health]]y patient.  A person without any [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] is considered a normal patient, whereas a person with a mental disability or illness is viewed as abnormal. These normals and abnormals in the context of mental health subsequently create negative stigmatic perceptions towards individuals with mental illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Mental Illness|url = https://bbrfoundation.org/mental-illness-1|website = Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation (Formerly NARSAD)|accessdate = 2015-12-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222135329/https://bbrfoundation.org/mental-illness-1|archive-date = 2015-12-22|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation stated that "an estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older – about 1 in 4 adults – suffer from one or more of (several) disorders in a given year".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the population of American individuals living with mental illness is not as small of a minority as commonly perceived, it is considered abnormal nonetheless, therefore the subject of discrimination and abuse such as violent therapies, punishments, or labeling for life by the normal, healthy majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Top 10 Forms of Psychiatric Institution Abuse {{!}} CCHR International|url = http://www.cchrint.org/2014/11/13/top-10-forms-of-psychiatric-institution-abuse/|accessdate = 2015-12-10|date = 2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC reported that "cluster[s] of negative attitudes and beliefs motivate the general public to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people with mental illnesses".  In continuum, the resources available to those who suffer from such illness are limited, and government support is constantly being cut from programs that help individuals living with mental illness live more comfortable, accommodative, happier lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Neglect of Mental Illness Exacts a Huge Toll, Human and Economic|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-neglect-of-mental-illness/|website = Scientific American|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuronal and synaptic ==
Hebbian associative learning and memory maintenance depends on synaptic normalization mechanisms to prevent [[synaptic runaway]].&lt;ref name="Arbib"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbib|first=M. A.|title=The handbook of brain theory and neural networks|year=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where synaptic runaway describes overcrowding of [[dendrite|dendritic]] associations, which reduce sensory or behavioural acuteness proportional to the level of synaptic runaway. Synaptic/neuronal normalization refers to synaptic competition, where the prosper of one synapse may weakening the efficacy of other nearby surrounding synapses with redundant neurotransmission.

Animal dendritic density greatly increases throughout waking hours despite intrinsic normalization mechanisms as described as above. The growth rate of synaptic density is not sustained in a cumulative fashion. Without a pruning state, the signal to noise ratio of CNS mechanism would not be able to operate with maximum effectiveness, and learning would be detrimental to animal survival. Neuronal and synaptic normalization mechanisms must operate so positive association feedback loops to not become rampant while constantly processing new environmental information.&lt;ref name="Arbib"/&gt;

Some researchers speculate that the slow oscillation (nREM) cycles of animal sleep constitute an essential 're-normalization' phase. The re-normalization occurs from cortical large amplitude brain rhythm, in the low delta range (0.5–2&amp;nbsp;Hz), synaptically downscaling the associations from the wakeful learning state.&lt;ref name="Tononi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tononi|first=Giulio|title=Giulio Tononi: 2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science Symposium|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEbyITI13zg|work=In search of sleep function|publisher=Allan Institute for Brain Science|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the strongest associations survive the pruning from this phase. This allows retention of salient information coding from the previous day, but also allows more cortical space and energy distribution to continue effective learning subsequently after a slow-wave oscillation episode of sleep.&lt;ref name="Tononi"/&gt;

Also, organisms tend to have a normal biological developmental pathway as a central nervous system ages and/or learns. Deviations for a species' normal development frequently will result in behaviour dysfunction, or death, of that organism.

==Effects of labeling==
When people do not conform to the normal standard, they are often labelled as sick, disabled, abnormal, or unusual, which can lead to marginalization or [[social stigma|stigmatization]].  Most people want to be normal and strive to be perceived as such, so that they can relate to society at large.  Without having things in common with the general population, people may feel isolated among society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridgens|first=Ruth|title=Disability and Being 'Normal': A Response to McLaughlin and Goodley: Response|journal=Sociology|date=5 August 2009|volume=43|pages=753–761|doi=10.1177/0038038509105419|url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/43/4/753|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abnormal person feels like they have less in common with the normal population, and others have difficulty relating to things that they have not experienced themselves.  Additionally, abnormality may make others uncomfortable, further separating the abnormally labelled individual.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Since being normal is generally considered an ideal, there is often pressure from external sources to [[conformity|conform]] to normality, as well as pressure from people's intrinsic desire to feel included.  For example, families and the medical community will try to help [[disability|disabled]] people live a normal life.  However, the pressure to appear normal, while actually having some deviation, creates a conflict – sometimes someone will appear normal, while actually experiencing the world differently or struggling.  When abnormality makes society feel uncomfortable, it is the exceptional person themselves who will laugh it off to relieve social tension.  A disabled person is given normal freedoms, but may not be able to show negative emotions. Lastly, society's rejection of deviance and the pressure to normalize may cause shame in some individuals.  Abnormalities may not be included in an individual's sense of [[identity (social science)|identity]], especially if they are unwelcome abnormalities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

When an individual's abnormality is labelled as a [[pathology]], it is possible for that person to take on both elements of the [[sick role]] or the stigmatization that follows some illnesses.  Mental illness, in particular, is largely misunderstood by the population and often overwhelms others' impression of the patient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Clinical ==
Applying normality clinically depends on the field and situation a practitioner is in. In the broadest sense, clinical normality is the idea of uniformity of physical and psychological functioning across individuals. Normality, and abnormality, can be characterized statistically.
Related to the previous definition, statistically normality is usually defined it in terms of a normal distribution curve, with the so-called 'normal zone' commonly accounting for 95.45%  percent of all the data. The remaining 4.55% will lie split outside of two standard deviations from the mean. Thus any variable case that lies outside of two deviations from the mean would be considered abnormal. However, the critical value of such statistical judgments may be subjectively altered to a less conservative estimate. It is in fact normal for a population to have a proportion of abnormals. The presence of abnormals is important because it is necessary to define what 'normal' is, as normality is a relative concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thibaut|first=John W.|title=The concept of normality in clinical psychology|journal=Psychological Review|year=1943|volume=50|issue=3|pages=4–7|doi=10.1037/h0062556}}&lt;/ref&gt; So at a group, or macro level, of analysis; abnormalities are normal given a demographic survey, but at an individual level abnormal individuals are seen as being deviant in someway that needs to be corrected.
Statistical normality is important in determining demographic pathologies. When a variable rate, such as virus spread within a human population, exceeds its normal infection rate then preventative or emergency measures can be introduced. 
It is often impractical to apply statistical normality to diagnose individuals. Symptom normality is the current, and assumed most effective, way to assess patient pathology. Psychiatric normality, in a broad sense, states that psychopathology are disorders that are deviations from normality.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;

=== DSM ===
Normality, as a relative concept, is intrinsically involved with contextual elements. As a result, clinical disorder classification has particular challenges in discretely diagnosing 'normal' constitutions from  true disorders. The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) is the psychiatric profession's official classification manual of mental disorders since its first published version DSM-I in by the APA,{{clarify|date=February 2015}} 1952. As the DSM evolved into its current version, DSM-5 in late 2013, there have been numerous conflicts in proposed classification between [[mental illness]] and normal mentality. Dr. Allen Frances, who chaired the task force for content in the DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR even wrote a scathing indictment of the pressures incumbent on the definition of "normal" relative to psychological constructs and mental illness in his book, ''Saving Normal''.

Most of this difficulty stems from the DSM's ambiguity of natural contextual stressor reactions versus individual dysfunction. There are some key progressions along the DSM history that have attempted to integrate some aspects of normality into proper diagnosis classification. As a diagnostic manual for classification of abnormalities, all DSMs have been biased towards classifying symptoms as disorders by emphasizing symptomatic singularity. The result is an encompassing misdiagnosis of  possible normal [[symptom]]s, appropriate as contextually derived.&lt;ref name="Allan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horwitz|first=Allan V.|title=Transforming Normality into Pathology: The DSM and the Outcomes of Stressful Social Arrangements|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behaviour|year=2007|volume=48|issue=3|pages=211–222|doi=10.1177/002214650704800301|pmid=17982864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-II ===

The second edition of the DSM, DSM-II, could not be effectively applied because of its vague descriptive nature. [[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamic]] etiology was a strong theme in classifying mental illnesses. The applied definitions became idiosyncratic, stressing individual unconscious roots. This made applying the DSM unreliable across [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]].&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt; No distinction between abnormal to normal was established.

Evidence of the classification ambiguity were punctated by the [[Rosenhan experiment]] of 1972. This experiment demonstrated that the methodology of psychiatric diagnosis could not effectively distinguish normal from disordered mentalities. DSM-II labelled 'excessive' behavioral and emotional response as an index of abnormal mental wellness to diagnose some particular disorders.&lt;ref name="DSMII"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, Second edition|year=1968|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Excessiveness' of a reaction implied alternative normal behaviour which would have to include a situational factor in evaluation. As an example; a year of intense grief from the death of a spouse may be a normal appropriate response. To have intense [[grief]] for twenty years would be indicative of a mental disorder. As well, to grieve intensely over the loss of a sock would also not be considered normal responsiveness and indicate a mental disorder. The consideration of proportionality to stimuli was a perceived strength in psychiatric diagnosis for the DSM-II.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

Another characteristic of the DSM-II systemization was that it classified [[homosexuality]] as a mental disorder. Thus, homosexuality was psychiatrically defined a pathological deviation from 'normal' sexual development. Homosexuality was later replaced in the 7th printing of DSM-II, instead categorized as a 'Sexual orientation disturbance'. The intent was to have a label that applied only to those homosexual individuals who were bothered by their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homosexuality: Proposed Change in DSM-11|journal=The American Psychiatric Association|year=1973|volume=6th Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner homosexuality would not be viewed as an atypical illness.&lt;ref name="change"/&gt; Only if it was distressing would homosexuality be classified as a mental illness.&lt;ref name="DSMII"/&gt; However, the DMS-II did not explicitly state that any homosexuality was normal either.  This stigma lasted into DSM-III until it was reformed entirely from DSM classifications in 1987.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSMII"/&gt;

=== DSM-III ===

DSM-III was a best attempt to credit psychiatry as a scientific discipline, from the opprobrium resulting from DSM-II.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven|title=Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction in the psychodynamic etiologies of DSM-II spilled over into a reduction symptom etiology altogether. Thus, DSM-III was a specific set of definitions for mental illnesses, and entities more suited to diagnostic psychiatry, but which annexed response proportionality as a classification factor. The product was that  all symptoms, whether normal proportional response or inappropriate pathological tendencies, could both be treated as potential signs of mental illness.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;

=== DSM-IV ===

[[DSM-IV#DSM-IV .281994.29|DSM-IV]] explicitly distinguishes mental disorders and non-disordered conditions. A non-disordered condition results from, and is perpetuated by, social stressors.  Included in DSM-IV's classification is that  a mental disorder  "must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual" (American Psychiatric Association 2000:xxxi)
This had supposedly injected normality consideration back into the DSM, from its removal from DSM-II. However, it has been speculated that DSM-IV still does not escape the problems DSM-III faced, where psychiatric diagnoses still include symptoms of expectable responses to stressful circumstances to be signs of disorders, along with symptoms that are individual dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt; The example set by DSM-III, for principally symptom-based disorder classification, has been integrated as the norm of mental diagnostic practice.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

=== DSM-5 ===
The DSM-5 was released in the second half of 2013.  It has significant differences from DSM IV-TR, including the removal of the multi-axial classifications and reconfiguring the [[Asperger's]]/[[autistic spectrum]] classifications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Criticisms of diagnostics ===
Since the advent of DSM-III, the subsequent editions of the DSM have all included a heavy symptom based pathology diagnosis system. Although there have been some attempts to incorporate environmental factors into mental and behavioural diagnostics, many practitioners and scientists believe that the most recent DSM's are misused. The symptom bias makes diagnosing quick and easier allowing for practitioners to increase their clientele because symptoms can be easier to classify and deal with than dealing with life or event histories which have evoked what may be a temporary and normal mental state in reaction to a patients environmental circumstances. 
The easy-to-use manual not only has increased the perceived need for more mental health care, stimulating funding for mental health care facilities, but also has had a global impact on marketing strategies. Many pharmaceutical commercial ads list symptoms such as fatigue, depression, or anxiety. However, such symptoms are not necessarily abnormal, and are appropriate responses to such occurrences as the loss of a loved one. The targets of such ads in such cases do not need medication, and can naturally overcome their grief, but with such an advertising strategy pharmaceutical companies can greatly expand their marketing.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

'''''On Weights and Measures''''' is a historical, lexical, [[metrological]], and geographical treatise compiled in 392 [[Common Era|CE]] in [[Salamis, Cyprus|Constantia]] by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c. 315&amp;ndash;403). The greater part of the work is devoted to a discussion on ancient Greek and Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|weights and measures]].

The composition was written at the request of a Persian priest, sent to Epiphanius by letter from the Roman emperor in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen A. Shaw, ''On Measures and Weights by Epiphanius'', National Mathematics Magazine 11.1 (October 1936: 3–7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 11 (note 3). The letter was apparently signed jointly by [[Valentinian II]], emperor of the West, and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], emperor of the East, as well as Theodosius' two sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although five fragments of an early Greek version are known to exist, with one entitled περὶ μέτρων καὶ στάθμων (''On Weights &amp; Measures''), added by a later hand,&lt;ref&gt;The Codex Parisinus Graecus 835, as noted by J.E. Dean (ed.), in ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures: The Syriac Version'', (Chicago 1935), Introduction p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version is the only complete copy that has survived. Partial translations in Armenian and Georgian&lt;ref&gt;Found in the “Shatberd codex” MS. 1141, in the library of the ''Obshchestvo rasprostranenifa gramotnosti sredi gruzin'', Tiflis&lt;/ref&gt; are also known to exist. Its modern title belies its content, as the work also contains important historical anecdotes about people and places not written about elsewhere.

Two manuscripts of ''On Weights and Measures'', written in Syriac on parchment, are preserved at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]]. The older was found in [[Egypt]] and, according to the colophon, was written in the [[Seleucid era]], in "nine-hundred and sixty-[...]" (with the last digit effaced, meaning, that it was written between the years 649 CE–659 CE). The younger manuscript is designated "Or. Add. 14620".&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, [http://www.trismegistos.org/tm/detail.php?tm=115426 ''Catalogue of Syriac manuscripts in the British Museum''] 2 756 (pp. 717–718)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to attempt a modern publication of Epiphanius' work was [[Paul de Lagarde]] in 1880, who reconstructed the original Syriac text by exchanging it with Hebrew characters,&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Lagarde, ''Veteris Testamenti ab Origene recensiti fragmenta apud Syros servata quinque. Praemittitur Epiphanii de mensuris et ponderibus liber nunc primum integer et ipse syriacus'', Gootingae 1880&lt;/ref&gt; and who had earlier published excerpts from several of the Greek fragments treating on weights and measures in his ''Symmicta''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Largarde, ''Symmicta'' I, Göttingen 1877, pp. 210–225&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, a critical edition of the Greek text was published by E.D. Moutsoulas in ''Theologia''.&lt;ref&gt;E.D. Moutsoulas, ed., "Epiphanius of Salamis, Concerning Weights and Measures" (Introduction, Commentary, Text and Notes), ''Theologia'', 44 (1973), pp. 157&amp;ndash;198&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part One'''&lt;/small&gt;
In folios [54b–55c], [[Hadrian]]'s journey and arrival in the East is dated "47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem."
*Translations
In folios [47a–49a]; [51d–52a]; [56d–57b] Epiphanius names four major translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]], made in the Greek tongue: the [[Septuagint|LXX]] made by the seventy-two translators, another by [[Aquila of Pontus]], one by [[Theodotion]], and yet another by [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. A fifth Greek translation was discovered in wine jars in [[Jericho]], and a sixth in [[Nicopolis]] near Actium. Afterwards, [[Origen]] arranged six columns of the extant Greek translations and two of the Hebrew side by side, naming it the [[Hexapla]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 33&amp;ndash;34, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius expands his description of the translation of the seventy-two translators (known as the Septuagint) and how they were assigned thirty-six cells, two to each cell, on the Pharian island. Two translators translated the [[Book of Genesis]], another two the [[Book of Exodus]], another two the [[Book of Leviticus]], and so forth, until the entire 22 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible had all been translated into the Greek tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Excluding [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Song of Solomon]], which books had only later been added to the canon, according to Jewish tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; The seventy-two translators were drawn from the twelve tribes of Israel, six men to each tribe who were skilled in the Greek language.
 
In folios [49a–50a] Epiphanius gives a description of the canonical books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and translations made of the same. In his day, he notes that the Scroll of Ruth and the Book of Judges were joined together, and considered as one book. So, too, the [[Book of Ezra|Books of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] were joined, and considered as one book, as were First and Second [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] (''Paraleipomena'') considered as one book, as were the First and Second [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] (''Book of First and Second Kingdoms'') considered as one book, and the First and Second [[Books of Kings|Kings]] (''Book of Third and Fourth Kingdoms'') considered as one book.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Two'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Prominent figures
In spite of Epiphanius' interest in Jewish themes, his narrative often takes on a distorted and stereotypical view of [[Judaism]], based on the dogmas of his persuasion. Still, he is an invaluable source on the lives of people and places that figure highly in Jewish [[Oral tradition|lore]]. In folios [54a–55c]; [55c–55d] Epiphanius treats on the lives of two prominent persons who became [[proselytes]] to the Jewish religion; the one [[Aquila of Pontus|Aquila]] (known also as Onkelos) who was a relation of [[Hadrian]], and whom he made the overseer of Jerusalem's rebuilding around 115 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The other person of interest who is described by him is [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]], also known as ''Sūmkos'' ({{lang-he-n|'''סומכוס'''}}) in rabbinic literature.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Mishnah]] ''Eruvin'' 3:1; ''Baba Metzia'' 6:5; ''Ḥullin'' 5:3 in ''The Mishnah'' (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press, 1974; the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b, ''Baba Bathra'' 73a, ''Baba Kamma'' 46a, ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus is mentioned as belonging originally to the [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] nation, and is said to have converted to Judaism during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius|Verus]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Epiphanius, Marcus Aurelius was also called Verus.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently underwent a second [[circumcision]]&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and became a disciple of [[Rabbi Meir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus belonged to the fifth generation (165&amp;ndash;200 [[Common Era|CE]]) of Rabbinical teachers referred to in the text of the [[Mishnah]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mishnah'' (ed. [[Herbert Danby]]), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix III, pp. 799&amp;ndash;800 {{ISBN|0 19 815402 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor [[Hadrian]] is said to have passed through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] while ''en route'' to Egypt, some 47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Three'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Weights and Measures
Folios [61d–73b] contain a treatise on the known weights and measures used in his day among the [[Jews|Hebrews]], the Greeks and the Romans. He states the equivalent weights for the ''[[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|kab]]'' (''cab''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; ''kor'',&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equal to 30 ''modii'' (seahs). v. ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 12 (folio 45d). The same is defined in the Talmud (''Baba Bathra'' 86b, 105a) as equal to thirty ''seahs'', a capacity equal to about 395.533 cubic centimeters.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''lethekh'' ([[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|Lethek]]), [[Homer (unit)|''homer'']], [[Bath (unit)|''bath'']], ''modius'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''seah'' = lit. "measure"),&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equivalent to the volume of 144 medium-sized eggs (9.6 litres); Marcus Jastrow, ''Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature'' (2nd edition), Massachusetts 2006, s.v. '''מודיא''' p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mina (unit)|mina]]'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''maneh''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 60 (§ 51), 65; a weight in silver that was equal to 100 ''[[denarii|denaria]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In folios [62b–62c] Epiphanius distinguishes between "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא כַף'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a17.htm#12 I Kings 17:12] and "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא חֹפֶן'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0209.htm#8 Exodus 9:8] and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0316.htm#12 Leviticus 16:12]; in the former case it refers to only one handful, but in latter cases it refers to "a measure of two handfuls."&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Four'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Geography of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]
In folios [73b–75a] Epiphanius gives the names of several cities and places of renown, both in his time and in ancient times, such as: [[Mount Ararat]] (§ 61), Aṭaṭ (§ 62), or what is known as the "threshing floor of the thorn bush" ({{Lang-he-n|'''גרן האטד'''}}), and whose description echoes that of [[Rashi]]'s commentary on Genesis 50:10,&lt;ref&gt;Said to be a place about two miles from the Jordan River, called ''Beth-ḥagla'' (lit. "the place of the circuit").&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abarim]] (§ 63); [[Eben-Ezer|Aviʿazar]] (§ 68), or what is ''Eḇen haʿezer'' of [[I Samuel]] 4:1, said to be "fourteen [Roman] miles distant east and north of [[Eleutheropolis]], in a valley"; [[Carmel (biblical settlement)|Carmel]]{{nbsp}}(§ 77); [[Mount Carmel|Carmel]] of the sea (§ 78); [[Akko]] (§ 76);  [[Anathoth]] (§ 66); [[Azekah]] (§ 64) - a city in whose time was called Ḥ&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt;warta;&lt;ref&gt;R. Steven Notley &amp; [[Ze'ev Safrai]], in their book, "Eusebius, ''Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture'' (Brill: Leiden 2005, p. 19, note 47), have noted: "According to his (Epiphanius') formulation, it would seem that he was of the opinion that Hiwarta, which means 'white' (''lavan''), is the translation of Azekah. About five kilometers to the southeast of Tell Zechariah is a high hill called Tell el-Beida, meaning in Arabic 'white'. In current maps, the site is named Tell Livnin, which means the hill of bricks (''livanim''), and it is to this that Eusebius (who also wrote about Azekah) most probably referred. 'Azekah' is not 'white', either in Hebrew or in Aramaic. ''Le-azek'' in Hebrew means to remove stones, and then the soil appears a bit paler. It therefore appears that Epiphanius, who was born in Beit Zedek, near [[Eleutheropolis]], identified Azekah with Tell el-Beida. Azekah is six kilometers from Eleutheropolis, and Tell Livnin is eight kilometers from there. Epiphanius adapted the new name to the identification by means of an etymological exegesis that has no linguistic basis. At any rate, no settlement existed on Tell Azekah in the Roman-Byzantine period. The early site moved from the high hill to the fields in the plain at the foot of the tell. It may possibly have moved as fr as Kh. el-Beida, although this is difficult to accept."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bethel]] (§ 73); [[Ophrah (Taybeh)|Ophrah]] (§ 67); [[Carthage]] (§ 79) - where the [[Canaanites]] had migrated from [[Phoenicia]] and who were called in his day ''Bizakanoi'' (scattered people); [[Petra|Rekem]] (§ 71), [[Jaffa]] (§ 75), [[Jerusalem]]{{nbsp}}(§ 74), ''et al.''

==Chronology of the Roman emperors==

* [[Maximian]], [[Licinius]] and [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], who ruled in succession one after the other = reign: 32 years&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Gildas Sapiens]]’ ''De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae'', Maximian, Licinius and Constantine ruled jointly over the Roman Empire, lasting altogether for 32 years.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Constans]], [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine]] and [[Constantius II|Constantius]], followed by [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], [[Valentinian I|Valentinian the Great]], [[Valens]], [[Gratian|Gratian the son of Valentinian]], [[Valentinian II|Valentinian the younger]] (son of [[Valentinian I|Valentinian]]), [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], [[Arcadius|Arcadius the son of Theodosius]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius the Illustrious]], who was the son of [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], as far as the time of Epiphanius, during the second consulship of Arcadius Augustus and Rufus = years collected altogether: 57 years

The regnal years of the Caesars as stated by Epiphanius differ slightly in some places from the extant Greek versions. With respect to events in Rome after the reign of [[Pertinax]], both Epiphanius and [[Jerome]] do not mention the ascension of [[Didius Julianus]] after the assassination of Pertinax, but write only that [[Septimius Severus|Severus]] succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 193. Epiphanius, by his own admittance (''On Weights and Measures'', p. 66 [folio 71c]), was familiar with [[Eusebius]]' ''Chronicle'' from which Jerome had based his ''Chronicon'' and may have used it to construct his own chronologies.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been because they did not consider his 9-week reign, which he obtained through usurpation, to be legitimate. Similarly, Epiphanius does not mention the ascension of [[Aemilian]]. It can be adduced from Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' that Aemilian, who "caused a revolt in Moesia," was never officially confirmed by the Senate in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 254&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius' method of recording the regnal years from Augustus to Hadrian, with his pinpoint recollection of the number of months and days to each reign, can be said to be accurate, based on [[Josephus]]' own testimony about himself, saying that he was aged 56  in the 13th year of the reign of Caesar [[Domitian]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (20.11.3)&lt;/ref&gt; and that he (Josephus) was born in the 1st year of Caesar [[Caligula|Gaius]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' § 1&lt;/ref&gt; Using Epiphanius' chronology, the years are indeed collected as 56. By comparison, the span of years in [[Suetonius]]' ''De vita Caesarum'' (Lives of the Caesars), which gives 14 years for Claudius and 15 years for Nero, the same time frame would span a period of some 58 years!&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Lives of the Caesars'' (the Loeb Classical Library series), vol. ii, book v, paragraph xlv&lt;/ref&gt;

PerfectO was part of the SILVERRUN suite of modeling tools, known in the modeling community since the 1990s;&lt;ref&gt;The Decline And Fall of the American Programmer, Edward Yourdon, Yourdon Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-13-191958-X}}, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; PerfectO was used to support object-oriented modeling (limited to class modeling at that time) and object-relational modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Informix Unleashed, Sams Publishing, 1997, Chapter 45 (Modeling Types in Informix-Universal Server, Jim Pradesh), {{ISBN|0-672-30650-6}}, pp 1117-1118&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, PerfectO was translated into Java resulting in SILVERRUN-JD (Java Designer). With the addition of relational data modeling, the product was renamed to SILVERRUN ModelSphere and released in 2002.  Later on, more features were added including support for business process modeling, conceptual data modeling, and UML diagramming.

In September 2008, Grandite released ModelSphere's core application as an open source product based on the GNU Public License version 3. Its development environment was hosted on [[JavaForge]] which shut down March 31, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://intland.com/blog/oss/javaforge-to-shut-down-on-31-march-2016/|title=JavaForge to Shut Down on 31 March 2016|newspaper=Intland Software|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An empty project is hosted on SourceForge which was registered on Sep 16th, 2008 and last updated on Mar 27th, 2013. No releases, files, or source code are available on the SourceForge project page as of Oct 18th, 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4479">'''Peace Love Unity Respect''', commonly shortened to '''PLUR''', is a set of principles that is associated with the [[rave]] culture. Originating from early online discussions about rave culture conducted on [[Usenet]], it has been commonly used since the early 1990s when it became commonplace in club flyers and especially on club paraphernalia advertising underground outdoor trance parties. It has since expanded to the larger rave dance music culture as well.

It may be interpreted as the essential philosophy of life for ravers and clubbers, at least insomuch as it relates to interpersonal relationships, with basic directions on how people are expected to behave at a rave gathering. This universalist philosophy underpinning the tribal dance culture which began circling the globe with the rise of the internet, theoretically takes precedence over any chemical or musical aspects of the rave scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rave Culture and Religion |last=St. John |first=Graham |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=149 |isbn=0-415-31449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raves represent a modern ritualistic experience, promoting a strong communal sense, where PLUR is considered an ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall| first=Douglas| date=2002-11-01| title=Behavior, Belonging, and Belief: A Theory of Ritual Practice| jstor=3108616| journal=Sociological Theory| publisher=American Sociological Association| volume=20| issue=3| pages=360–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
* [[Peace]] – The avoidance of negative emotions and conflict.&lt;ref name=odyessy&gt;{{cite web |title=PLUR Isn't Just a Moment, It's a Lifestyle |author=Cree Bort |url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/plur-lifestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Love]] – Performing acts and sharing feelings of goodwill towards others. The exchange of gestures such as hugging occurs frequently at a rave, and is considered a way of "spreading the love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Frankie Bones Storm Rave Birthed The PLUR Movement|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/how-frankie-bones-storm-rave-birthed-the-plur-movement/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odyessy /&gt;
* Unity – Welcoming others into the community, and coming together regardless of personal differences.&lt;ref name=odyessy /&gt;
* [[Respect]] – Showing sensitivity for the feelings of others, and accepting one another with tolerance and without judgement. Treating each other as one would like to be treated.&lt;ref name=odyessy /&gt;

==Origins==
{{Synthesis|section|date=May 2012}}
PLUR is an aggregation of ideas synonymous with the earlier hippy and hip hop culture, with the peace movement being an essential starting point to any be-in encounter or rave. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Use of the term 'PLUR' dates to the late 1980s and early 1990s rave scene in the UK which incorporated [[House music|house]] and [[acid house]] music that originated in Chicago during the 1980s. The term began as an informal discussion on [[usenet]] lists alt.rave and alt.culture.zippies. SF-raves mailing list archived at hyper-real also noted the use of the term, and there is a flyer archive which might contain evidence of the existence of the term.

One of the earliest{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} uses of the term outside the internet, mostly anecdotal, appears to be [[Frankie Bones|DJ Frankie Bones]] in June 1993. Supposedly in response to a fight that broke out at one of his epic Storm Raves in Brooklyn, New York, Bones is said to have got on the microphone and yelled: "If you don't start showing some peace, love, and unity, I'll break your faces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/features/2015/ballad/index.html|title=The Graffiti Kids Who Became Raver Kings|author=Steve Powers|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Later incarnations and variations of PLUR can be seen in the adoption of [[Pronoia (psychology)|Pronoia]] and also [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]], with PLUR and Pronoia often being interchangeable terms, depending upon one's company. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Several other variations on the same four words, but in a different order (e.g. LURP), have been proposed. However, none of these are commonly used.

'''''Pafama''''', short for '''''Papierfarbenmalerei''''', is a 1922 painting by Croatian painter [[Josip Seissel]].&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063611/CRO_280_002.html |title=Pafama, Josip Seissel |website=europeana.eu |access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This painting is the first known abstract composition in [[Croatian art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063611/CRO_280_002.html  Pafama|Josip Seissel, europeana.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in the collection of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

==Name==
Word ''Pafama'' is an abbreviation of the German ''PApier-FArben-MAlerei'', ({{lang-de|Paper, color, painting}}) which is a word from [[zenitism]] vocabulary, meaning that the artist focuses on the painting process and materials, a radical approach at the beginning of the third decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.posta.hr/default.aspx?id=744&amp;m=53256 HRVATSKA LIKOVNA UMJETNOST - JOSIP SEISSEL, PAFAMA, posta.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This is a square painting of small dimensions whose center is dominated by multi-colored geometric elements on a black background. It is based on the principles of [[suprematism]] and is reduced to primary geometric shapes - triangle, rectangle, polygon and cone. In addition, it is reduced to the primary colors - red, yellow, blue and their derivatives which are projected on a black background.

The painting is characterized by structural imaging techniques and is synonymous with European [[avant-garde]] art at the time. The painting marks the appearance of avant-garde art in Croatia and leaves lasting effects on the Croatian art in the 20th century and especially in the 1950s and 1960s, when neo-[[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] trends were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avantgarde-museum.com/en/museum/collection/authors/josip-seissel-jo-klek~pe4481/ |title=Josip Seissel |website=avantgarde-museum.com |access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its size is 17x17 cm.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |God}}

'''Pascal's Wager''' is an argument in philosophy presented by the seventeenth-century [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Connor |first= James A. |date= 2006 |title= Pascal's wager : the man who played dice with God |location= San Francisco |publisher= HarperSanFrancisco |pages= 180–1 |isbn= 9780060766917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that humans bet with their lives that God either [[Existence of God|exists]] or does not.

Pascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in [[Heaven]]) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in [[Hell]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Blaise Pascal", ''Columbia History of Western Philosophy'', page 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal's Wager was based on the idea of the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], though similar arguments have occurred [[#Variations|in other religious traditions]]. The original wager was set out in section 233 of Pascal's posthumously published ''[[Pensées]]'' ("Thoughts"). These previously unpublished notes were assembled to form an incomplete [[treatise]] on [[Christian apologetics]].

Historically, Pascal's Wager was groundbreaking because it charted new territory in [[probability theory]],&lt;ref name="chance and infinity"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/friday-phil-pascals-wager/|title=A Logical Infinite: The Constrained Probabilistic Definitions of Chance and Infinity in Blaise Pascal's Famous Wager|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=December 18, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the first formal use of [[decision theory]], and anticipated future philosophies such as [[existentialism]], [[pragmatism]] and [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]].&lt;ref name="SEP entry"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/index.html|title=Pascal's Wager|last=Hájek|first=Alan|date=November 6, 2012|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Wager==
{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}
The Wager uses the following logic (excerpts from ''Pensées'', part III, §233):

#God is, or God is not. Reason cannot decide between the two alternatives.
#A Game is being played... where heads or tails will turn up.
#You must wager (it is not optional).
#Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing.
#Wager, then, without hesitation that He is. (...) There is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite. And so our proposition is of infinite force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain.
#But some cannot believe. They should then 'at least learn your inability to believe...' and 'Endeavour then to convince' themselves.

Pascal asks the reader to analyze humankind's position, where our actions can be enormously consequential but our understanding of those consequences is flawed. While we can discern a great deal through reason, we are ultimately forced to gamble. Pascal cites a number of distinct areas of uncertainty in human life:

|}
Pascal describes humanity as a finite being trapped within an incomprehensible infinity, briefly thrust into being from non-being, with no explanation of "Why?" or "What?" or "How?" On Pascal's view, human finitude constrains our ability to reliably achieve truth.

Given that reason alone cannot determine whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions like a coin toss. However, even if we do not know the outcome of this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the outcome. We must decide whether to live as though God exists, or whether to live as though God does not exist, even though we may be mistaken in either case.

In Pascal's assessment, participation in this wager is not optional. Merely by existing in a state of uncertainty, we are forced to choose between the available courses of action for practical purposes.

==Explanation==
The ''Pensées'' passage on Pascal's Wager is as follows:

{{quote|If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We are then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is....

..."God is, or He is not." But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us. A game is being played at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails will turn up. What will you wager? According to reason, you can do neither the one thing nor the other; according to reason, you can defend neither of the propositions.

Do not, then, reprove for error those who have made a choice; for you know nothing about it. "No, but I blame them for having made, not this choice, but a choice; for again both he who chooses heads and he who chooses tails are equally at fault, they are both in the wrong. The true course is not to wager at all."

Yes; but you must wager. It is not optional. You are embarked. Which will you choose then? Let us see. Since you must choose, let us see which interests you least. You have two things to lose, the true and the good; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun, error and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than the other, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point settled. But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.

"That is very fine. Yes, I must wager; but I may perhaps wager too much." Let us see. Since there is an equal risk of gain and of loss, if you had only to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager. But if there were three lives to gain, you would have to play (since you are under the necessity of playing), and you would be imprudent, when you are forced to play, not to chance your life to gain three at a game where there is an equal risk of loss and gain. But there is an eternity of life and happiness. And this being so, if there were an infinity of chances, of which one only would be for you, you would still be right in wagering one to win two, and you would act stupidly, being obliged to play, by refusing to stake one life against three at a game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one for you, if there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain. But there is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_272_on_20110506051909"/&gt;}}

Pascal begins by painting a situation where both the existence and non-existence of God are impossible to prove by [[Reason|human reason]]. So, supposing that reason cannot determine the truth between the two options, one must "wager" by weighing the possible consequences. Pascal's assumption is that, when it comes to making the decision, no one can refuse to participate; withholding assent is impossible because we are already "embarked", effectively living out the choice.

We only have two things to stake, our "reason" and our "happiness". Pascal considers that if there is "''equal'' risk of loss and gain" (i.e. a coin toss), then human reason is powerless to address the question of whether God exists. That being the case, then human reason can only decide the question according to possible resulting happiness of the decision, weighing the gain and loss in believing that God exists and likewise in believing that God does not exist.

He points out that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of happiness and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness for the possibility of gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing", meaning one can gain [[Immortality|eternal life]] if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, "It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable..."

===Inability to believe===
Pascal addressed the difficulty that '[[reason]]' and '[[rationality]]' pose to genuine belief by proposing that "acting as if [one] believed" could "cure [one] of unbelief":

{{quote|quote=But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe. Endeavour then to convince yourself, not by increase of proofs of God, but by the abatement of your passions. You would like to attain faith, and do not know the way; you would like to cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it. Learn of those who have been bound like you, and who now stake all their possessions. These are people who know the way which you would follow, and who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured. Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.&lt;ref&gt;Pensées Section III note 233, Translation by W. F. Trotter&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Analysis with decision theory===
The possibilities defined by Pascal's Wager can be thought of as a [[decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|decision under uncertainty]] with the values of the following [[decision matrix]].
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;width100%;"
|-
|
! God exists (G)
! God does not exist (¬G)
|-
! Belief (B)
| +∞ (infinite gain)
| −1 (finite loss)
|-
! Disbelief (¬B)
| −∞ (infinite loss)
| +1 (finite gain)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Given these values, the option of living as if God exists (B) dominates the option of living as if God does not exist (¬B), as long as one assumes a positive probability that God exists. In other words, the expected value gained by choosing B is greater than or equal to that of choosing ¬B.

In fact, according to decision theory, the only value that matters in the above matrix is the +∞ (infinitely positive).  Any matrix of the following type (where f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and f&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are all negative or finite positive numbers) results in (B) as being the only rational decision.&lt;ref name="SEP entry" /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
|
! God exists (G)
! God does not exist (¬G)
|-
! Belief (B)
| +∞
| f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Disbelief (¬B)
| f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
| f&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

===Misunderstanding of the wager===
Many criticisms have explained that the wager has been used as a supposed theory of the necessity to believe, although that was never Pascal's intention. As Laurent Thirouin writes: 
{{quote|The celebrity of fragment 418 has been established at the price of a mutilation. By titling this text "the wager", readers have been fixated only on one part of Pascal's reasoning. It doesn't conclude with a QED at the end of the mathematical part. The unbeliever who had provoked this long analysis to counter his previous objection ("Maybe I bet too much") is still not ready to join the apologist on the side of faith. He put forward two new objections, undermining the foundations of the wager: the impossibility to know, and the obligation of playing.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Thiroin, Le hasard et les règles, le modèle du jeu dans la pensée de Pascal, Vrin, Paris 1991, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;}}
To be put at the beginning of Pascal's planned book, the wager was meant to show that logical reasoning cannot support faith or lack thereof, {{quote|We have to accept reality and accept the reaction of the libertine when he rejects arguments he is unable to counter. The conclusion is evident: if men believe or refuse to believe, it is not how some believers sometimes say and most unbelievers claim, because their own reason justifies the position they have adopted. Belief in God doesn't depend upon rational evidence, no matter which position.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Thiroin, Le hasard et les règles, le modèle du jeu dans la pensée de Pascal, Vrin, Paris 1991, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;}}Pascal's intended book was precisely to find other ways to establish the value of faith, an apology for the Christian faith.

==Criticism==
Criticism of Pascal's Wager began in his own day, and came from both atheists, who questioned the 'benefits' of a deity whose 'realm' is beyond reason, and the religiously orthodox, who primarily took issue with the wager's [[deism|deistic]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] language. It is criticized for not proving God's existence, the encouragement of false belief, and the problem of which religion and which God should be worshipped.&lt;ref name="chance and infinity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The God Delusion"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|publisher=Black Swan|date=May 21, 2007|title=[[The God Delusion]]|pages=130–132|chapter=Chapter 3: Arguments for God's existence|isbn=9780552773317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Should probably source criticisms to J. H. Sobel, Logic and Theism, Chapter XIII --&gt;

===Nature as not a proof of the existence of God=== 
[[Voltaire]] (another prominent French writer of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), a generation after Pascal, rejected the idea that the wager was "proof of God" as "indecent and childish", adding, "the interest I have to believe a thing is no proof that such a thing exists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voltaire-integral.com/Html/22/07_Pascal.html|title=Remarques (Premiéres) sur les Pensées de Pascal|last=Voltaire|authorlink=Voltaire|year=1728|website=Oeuvres Complétes de Voltaire|series=Mélanges I|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418162422/http://www.voltaire-integral.com/Html/22/07_Pascal.html|archive-date=April 18, 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal, however, did not advance the wager as a proof of God's existence but rather as a necessary pragmatic decision which is "impossible to avoid" for any living person.&lt;ref name="Durant-Voltaire"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Durant
  | first = Will and Ariel
  | authorlink= Will Durant
  | title = The Age of Voltaire

  | pages = 370
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that abstaining from making a wager is not an option and that "reason is incapable of divining the truth"; thus, a decision of whether to believe in the existence of God must be made by "considering the consequences of each possibility".

Voltaire's critique concerns not the nature of the Pascalian wager as proof of God's existence, but the contention that the very belief Pascal tried to promote is not convincing. Voltaire hints at the fact that Pascal, as a [[Jansenist]], believed that only a small, and already predestined, portion of humanity would eventually be saved by God.

Voltaire explained that no matter how far someone is tempted with rewards to believe in Christian salvation, the result will be at best a faint belief.&lt;ref&gt;Vous me promettez l’empire du monde si je crois que vous avez raison: je souhaite alors, de tout mon coeur, que vous ayez raison; mais jusqu’à ce que vous me l’ayez prouvé, je ne puis vous croire. […] J’ai intérêt, sans doute, qu’il y ait un Dieu; mais si dans votre système Dieu n’est venu que pour si peu de personnes; si le petit nombre des élus est si effrayant; si je ne puis rien du tout par moi-même, dites-moi, je vous prie, quel intérêt j’ai à vous croire? N’ai-je pas un intérêt visible à être persuadé du contraire? De quel front osez-vous me montrer un bonheur infini, auquel d’un million d’hommes un seul à peine a droit d’aspirer?&lt;/ref&gt;  Pascal, in his Pensees, agrees with this, not stating that people can choose to believe (and therefore make a safe wager), but rather that some cannot believe.

As [[Étienne Souriau]] explained, in order to accept Pascal's argument, the bettor needs to be certain that God seriously intends to honour the bet; he says that the Wager assumes that God also accepts the bet, which is not proved; Pascal's bettor is here like the fool who seeing a leaf floating on a river's waters and quivering at some point, for a few seconds, between the two sides of a stone, says: "I bet a million with Rothschild that it takes finally the left path." And, effectively, the leaf passed on the left side of the stone, but unfortunately for the fool Rothschild never said "I [will take that] bet".&lt;ref&gt;À vrai dire le célèbre pari de Pascal, ou plutôt le pari que Pascal propose au libertin n'est pas une option désintéressée mais un pari de joueur. Si le libertin joue «croix», parie que Dieu existe, il gagne (si Dieu existe) la vie éternelle et la béatitude infinie, et risque seulement de perdre les misérables plaisirs de sa vie actuelle. Cette mise ne compte pas au regard du gain possible qui est infini. Seulement, l'argument suppose que Dieu accepte le pari, que Dieu dit «je tiens». Sans quoi, nous dit Souriau, le libertin « est comme ce fou : il voit une feuille au fil de l'eau, hésiter entre deux côtés d'un caillou. Il dit : «je parie un million avec Rothschild qu'elle passera à droite». La feuille passe à droite et le fou dit : «j'ai gagné un million». Où est sa folie? Ce n'est pas que le million n'existe pas, c'est que Rothschild n'a pas dit : «je tiens». ». (Cf. l'admirable analyse du pari de Pascal in Souriau, L'ombre de Dieu, p. 47 sq.) – La Philosophie, Tome 2 (La Connaissance), Denis Huisman, André Vergez, Marabout 1994, pp. 462–63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from inconsistent revelations===
{{main|Argument from inconsistent revelations}}
Since there have been many religions throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the Wager, in an argument known as the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]]. This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in "the wrong god", which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager.&lt;ref name="chance and infinity" /&gt; [[Denis Diderot]], a contemporary of Voltaire, concisely expressed this opinion when asked about the Wager, saying "an [[Imam]] could reason the same way".&lt;ref name="Diderot"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. L. Mackie]] notes that "the church within which alone salvation is to be found is not necessarily the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]], but perhaps that of the [[Anabaptists]] or members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] or the [[Sunni Muslims|Muslim Sunnis]] or the worshipers of [[Kali]] or of [[Odin]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[J.L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]] (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism'', Oxford, pg. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of this objection argues that for every religion that promulgates rules, there exists another religion that has rules of the opposite kind. If a certain action leads one closer to salvation in the former religion, it leads one further away from it in the latter. Therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion could be negative. Or, one could also argue that there are an infinite number of mutually exclusive religions (which is a subset of the set of all possible religions), and that the probability of any one of them being true is zero; therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion is zero.

Pascal considers this type of objection briefly in the notes compiled into the ''Pensées'', and dismisses it as obviously wrong and disingenuous:&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, David (1994). ''Pascal and Disbelief: Catechesis and Conversion in the Pensées''. Washington, D. C.: The Catholic University of America Press, p. 117. {{ISBN|0-8132-1328-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=What say [the unbelievers] then? "Do we not see," say they, "that the brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks, like us," etc. If you care but little to know the truth, that is enough to leave you in repose. But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail. That would be sufficient for a question in philosophy; but not here, where everything is at stake. And yet, after a superficial reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves, etc. Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;}}

This short but densely packed passage, which alludes to numerous themes discussed elsewhere in the ''Pensées'', has given rise to many pages of scholarly analysis.

Pascal says that unbelievers who rest content with the many-religions objection are people whose scepticism has seduced them into a fatal "repose". If they were really bent on knowing the truth, they would be persuaded to examine "in detail" whether Christianity is like any other religion, but they just cannot be bothered.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Their objection might be sufficient were the subject concerned merely some "question in philosophy", but not "here, where everything is at stake". In "a matter where they themselves, their eternity, their all are concerned",&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_226 ''Pensée'' #226]&lt;/ref&gt; they can manage no better than "a superficial reflection" ("une reflexion légère") and, thinking they have scored a point by asking a [[leading question]], they go off to amuse themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Pascal scholars observe, Pascal regarded the many-religions objection as a rhetorical ploy, a "trap"&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', pp. 118 (quotation from Jean Mesnard), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; that he had no intention of falling into. If, however, any who raised it were sincere, they would want to examine the matter "in detail". In that case, they could get some pointers by turning to his chapter on "other religions".

As David Wetsel notes, Pascal's treatment of the pagan religions is brisk: "As far as Pascal is concerned, the demise of the pagan religions of antiquity speaks for itself. Those pagan religions which still exist in the New World, in India, and in Africa are not even worth a second glance. They are obviously the work of superstition and ignorance and have nothing in them which might interest 'les gens habiles' ('clever men')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_251 ''Pensée'' #251]&lt;/ref&gt;".&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Islam warrants more attention, being distinguished from paganism (which for Pascal presumably includes all the other non-Christian religions) by its claim to be a revealed religion. Nevertheless, Pascal concludes that the religion founded by Mohammed can on several counts be shown to be devoid of divine authority, and that therefore, as a path to the knowledge of God, it is as much a dead end as paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism, in view of its close links to Christianity, he deals with elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The many-religions objection is taken more seriously by some later [[apologist]]s of the Wager, who argue that, of the rival options, only those awarding infinite happiness affect the Wager's [[dominance (game theory)|dominance]]. In the opinion of these apologists "finite, semi-blissful promises such as Kali's or Odin's" therefore drop out of consideration.&lt;ref name="SEP entry" /&gt;  Also, the infinite bliss that the rival conception of God offers has to be mutually exclusive.  If Christ's promise of bliss can be attained concurrently with [[Jehovah]]'s and [[Allah]]'s (all three being identified as the [[Abrahamic religions|God of Abraham]]), there is no conflict in the decision matrix in the case where the cost of believing in the wrong conception of God is neutral (limbo/purgatory/spiritual death), although this would be countered with an infinite cost in the case where not believing in the correct conception of God results in punishment (hell).&lt;ref name="IEP entry"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/pasc-wag/|title=Pascal's Wager about God|last=Saka|first=Paul|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[ecumenical]] interpretations of the Wager&lt;ref&gt;For example: Jeff Jordan, ''Gambling on God: Essays on Pascal's Wager'', 1994, Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that it could even be suggested that believing in a generic God, or a god by the wrong name, is acceptable so long as that conception of God has similar essential characteristics of the conception of God considered in Pascal's Wager (perhaps the [[Aristotelian view of God|God of Aristotle]]).  Proponents of this line of reasoning suggest that either all of the conceptions of God or gods throughout history truly boil down to just a small set of "genuine options", or that if Pascal's Wager can simply bring a person to believe in "generic theism" it has done its job.&lt;ref name="IEP entry" /&gt;

Pascal argues implicitly for the uniqueness of Christianity in the Wager itself, writing: "If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible...Who then can blame the Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, professing as they do a religion which they cannot explain by reason?"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stat.ucla.edu/history/pascal_wager.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from inauthentic belief===
Some critics argue that Pascal's Wager, for those who cannot believe, suggests feigning belief to gain eternal reward. This would be dishonest and immoral. In addition, it is absurd to think that God, being just and omniscient, would not see through this deceptive strategy on the part of the "believer", thus nullifying the benefits of the Wager.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt;

Since these criticisms are concerned not with the validity of the Wager itself, but with its possible aftermath—namely that a person who has been convinced of the overwhelming odds in favor of belief might still find himself unable to sincerely believe—they are tangential to the thrust of the Wager. What such critics are objecting to is Pascal's subsequent advice to an unbeliever who, having concluded that the only rational way to wager is in favor of God's existence, points out, reasonably enough, that this by no means makes him a believer. This hypothetical unbeliever complains, "I am so made that I cannot believe. What would you have me do?"&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_233 ''Pensée'' #233]&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal, far from suggesting that God can be deceived by outward show, says that God does not regard it at all: "God looks only at what is inward."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_904 ''Pensée'' #904]&lt;/ref&gt; For a person who is already convinced of the odds of the Wager but cannot seem to put his heart into the belief, he offers practical advice.

Explicitly addressing the question of inability to believe, Pascal argues that if the Wager is valid, the inability to believe is irrational, and therefore must be caused by feelings: "your inability to believe, because reason compels you to [believe] and yet you cannot, [comes] from your passions." This inability, therefore, can be overcome by diminishing these irrational sentiments: "Learn from those who were bound like you. . . . Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.—'But this is what I am afraid of.'—And why? What have you to lose?"&lt;ref&gt;''Pensée'' #233. Gérard Ferreyrolles, ed. Paris: Librairie Générale Française, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other critics have objected to Pascal's Wager on the grounds that he wrongly assumes what type of epistemic character God would likely value in his rational creatures if he existed. More specifically, [[Richard Carrier]] has objected by positing an alternative conception of God that prefers his creatures to be honest inquirers and disapproves of thoughtless or feigned belief:

{{quote box|quote=Suppose there is a god who is watching us and choosing which souls of the deceased to bring to heaven, and this god really does want only the morally good to populate heaven. He will probably select from only those who made a significant and responsible effort to discover the truth. . .Therefore, only such people can be sufficiently moral and trustworthy to deserve a place in heaven — unless God wishes to fill heaven with the morally lazy, irresponsible, or untrustworthy.

==Variations==
*Muslim [[Imamah (Shia)|Imam]] [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] is recorded to have postulated variations of the Wager on several occasions in different forms, including his famed 'Tradition of the Myrobalan Fruit.'&lt;ref&gt; Al-Islam.org. (2017). Tradition of the Myrobalan Fruit. https://www.al-islam.org/tradition-myrobalan-fruit-hadith-al-halila-imam-jafar-al-sadiq/hadith&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Shia Islam|Sh'i'i]] [[hadith]] book [[Al-Kafi|al-Kafi]], al-Sadiq declares to an atheist "If what you say is correct – and it is not – then we will both succeed. But if what I say is correct – and it is – then I will succeed, and you will be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;al-Kulainī, M. (1982). al- Kāfī. Tehran: Group of Muslim Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An instantiation of this [[argument]], within the Islamic ''kalam'' tradition, was discussed by [[Al-Juwayni|Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni]] (d. 478/1085) in his ''Kitab al-irshad ila-qawati al-adilla fi usul al-i'tiqad'', or ''A Guide to the Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief''.&lt;ref&gt;[[al-Juwayni]] ''A Guide to Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Anyone want to write a little about what makes Juwayni's argument different from Pascal's? --&gt;
*The [[Sophist]] [[Protagoras]] had an agnostic position regarding the gods, but he nevertheless continued to worship the gods. This could be considered as an early version of the Wager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Socrates &amp; the fat rabbis|last= Boyarin|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Boyarin|year=2009 |publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-06916-8|page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the famous tragedy of [[Euripides]] ''[[The Bacchae|Bacchae]]'', [[Kadmos]] states an early version of Pascal's Wager. It is noteworthy that at the end of the tragedy [[Dionysos]], the god to whom [[Kadmos]] referred, appears and punishes him for thinking in this way. [[Euripides]], quite clearly, considered and dismissed the wager in this tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plots of epiphany: prison-escape in Acts of the Apostles |last= Weaver|first=John B.|authorlink= John B. Weaver|year=2004 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-018266-8|pages=453–454, 595}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Christian apologist [[Arnobius of Sicca]] (d. 330) stated an early version of the argument in his book ''Against the Pagans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The pillar and ground of the truth (1914)|last= Aleksandrovich Florenskiĭ|first=Pavel|authorlink=Pavel Florensky|year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-03243-2 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pascal's Wager is often concluded (not by Pascal) by stating that people should 'choose the safer wager'.  Pascal stated that people could not simply choose to believe, but that they might develop a faith through their actions.
*In the [[Sanskrit]] classic ''[[Sārasamuccaya]]'', &lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt;[[Vararuci]] makes a similar argument to Pascal's Wager.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Ostler|Ostler, Nicholas]] (2005). ''Empires of the Word''. HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2008 philosophy book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', presents a secular revision of Pascal’s wager: “What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything.... Thus, we should seek value.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://andphilosophy.com/2014/07/16/24-and-philosophy/ 24 and Philosophy (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] may be specified to contain a fixed number of matrices and is identified by a set number (''S''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''S'' is the set identification number and ''M'' is the number of matrices included in the set. There is no limit to the number of matrices which may be members of a periodic set.

Each matrix within a set has an identification number (a) and must contain a "root cell". A root cell must be located at any corner of a matrix. All root cells must be located at the same corner of each matrix within a single set. A diagonal line drawn from a root cell to the opposite corner of the same matrix is a "root diagonal".

The periodicity is defined by "partial square rings" (rings) of cells adjoining a root cell on two sides. All cells within the same ring, (even if they are located in a different matrix) have a similar "period". If a matrix contains (n+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cells then the outermost ring contains "2n+1" cells which are all included in the same period. A ring identification number (n) identifies each period. The root cell is also the smallest ring and is identified as; n = 0. Each subsequent ring (1, 2, 3, etc.) has 2n+1 cells (3, 5, 7, etc.).

Individual cells contained within a ring are identified by their [[Deviation (statistics)|deviation]] from the root diagonal. Each cell within a ring is assigned a deviation number (D). All cells intersected by the root diagonal have; D = 0. All cell locations in a column deviation have positive values of D. All cell locations in a row deviation have negative values of D.

Any cell within a set will require three numbers for the identification of its location;&lt;br /&gt;a is the matrix number&lt;br /&gt;n is the ring number&lt;br /&gt;D is the deviation number

The cell could also have its location identified as;&lt;br /&gt;a is the matrix number&lt;br /&gt;x is the column number (root cell = 0)&lt;br /&gt;y is the row number (root cell = 0)

The two locational systems are analogous to Radial (anD) and Cartesian (axy) systems. Generally this article will use the "anD" locational method.

The contents of any cell must contain data that is periodic in some manner.

==Combined Sets==
Combinations of sets are possible; however each set must be [[conformable]] for combination. A resultant set (R&lt;sub&gt;N M&lt;/sub&gt;) is the combination of N sets each having M matrices.

Two sets (of compatible construction) may combine so that the root cells on similar sized matrices are adjacent. This is a "set pair" and is identified by a "pair number" (P). The resultant matrices are not square but are 2n x n rectangular.

Four sets may also combine so that all root cells on similar sized matrices are adjacent. This gives a resultant set of square matrices having an even number of cells on each side. All root cells will form a central 2x2 "core" within each resultant matrix. The resultant set is actually two pairs. Each pair forms half of the resultant set. The identifiers (P,S) will tag each quadrant of the resultant set, which is all of the original sets. &lt;br /&gt;P = +½ represents the upper pair&lt;br /&gt;P = -½ represents the lower pair&lt;br /&gt;S = +½ represents the right set of each pair.&lt;br /&gt;S = -½ represents the left set of each pair.

Five identifiers are required to locate any cell in R&lt;sub&gt;4 M&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;P is the pair number&lt;br /&gt;S is the set number&lt;br /&gt;a is the matrix number&lt;br /&gt;n is the ring number&lt;br /&gt;D is the deviation number

==Applied sets==
Periodic matrix sets have an application to chemistry (for example, in the [[periodic table]]) and particle physics (for example, with [[sub atomic particle]]s). The resultant set R&lt;sub&gt;4 4&lt;/sub&gt; is of special interest.

The periodic rings may be associated with quantum harmonic oscillation. A [[Quantum_harmonic_oscillator#Hamiltonian_and_energy_eigenstates|quantum harmonic oscillator]] has energy (E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) defined as; E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (n + ½)ћω. Where; ћ = h/2π and h is Planck's constant, and ω is frequency. The number of cells in each period may be written as; 2E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/ћω.

The rings may also be associated with [[atomic orbitals]]. If the ring number (n) is equal to the [[quantum number]] for orbital angular momentum (the azimuthal number '''''l''''' ), then the rings (0, 1, 2, 3) correspond to the orbitals (s, p, d, f). The ring number is NOT equal to the principal quantum number ('''''n''''' ). The number of cells per ring is half the number of electrons per orbital due to spin duality of the electrons.

The quantum numbers are; &lt;br /&gt;'''''n''''' is the principal quantum number&lt;br /&gt;'''''l''''' is the quantum number for orbital angular momentum (the azimuthal number)&lt;br /&gt;'''''ml''''' is the orbital magnetic moment&lt;br /&gt;'''''ms''''' is the spin magnetic moment

The spin quantum number ('''''s''''') is not normally used in chemistry applications as all electrons are; '''''s''''' = ½.
&lt;br /&gt;The atomic number ('''''Z''''') may be expressed as a function of energies which in turn are functions of the quantum numbers.

If a resultant set is R&lt;sub&gt;4 4&lt;/sub&gt; then the locational numbers correspond to the quantum numbers as follows.
&lt;br /&gt;S = '''''ms'''''
&lt;br /&gt;n = '''''l'''''
&lt;br /&gt;D = '''''ml'''''

The Madelung rule gives the "P" and "a" relationships. This rule may be generalized as follows; &lt;br /&gt;2a - P = '''''n''''' + '''''l''''' + '''''s'''''
&lt;br /&gt;(2'''''n''''' + 2'''''l''''' + 2'''''s''''' - 4a)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1

This generalization may also be obtained from '''''J''''' coupling.

If; P = -½
&lt;br /&gt;Then; a = ½('''''n''''' + '''''l''''')

If; P = +½
&lt;br /&gt;Then; a = ½('''''n''''' + '''''l''''') + ½

The sub-atomic particles may be grouped as an R&lt;sub&gt;4 3&lt;/sub&gt; combination.

==Data compliance==
A set is considered to be "locationally compliant" if the data contained in each cell is also a function of the location of the cell. Let an R&lt;sub&gt;4 4&lt;/sub&gt; resultant set be populated with atomic numbers. Each cell contains one atomic number ('''''Z'''''). The number in each cell should be a function of the locators of the cell. If a term is associated with each locator then the atomic number will be the sum of all terms and a constant.

'''''Z''''' = '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; + '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; + '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + '''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; - ½

The five locator terms are as follows.

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = -2a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(P+½)

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = -2(n+½)(S+½)

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 4a(a+1)(a+½)/3

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = -2n(n+½)

'''''Z'''''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = (D+½)

This distribution of atomic numbers in R&lt;sub&gt;4 4&lt;/sub&gt; is a locationally compliant matrix set of the Periodic Table. The following tables show the resultant matrices populated with the atomic numbers.

{{Redirect-distinguish|Timeliness|Timeless (disambiguation){{!}}Timeless}}

'''Punctuality''' is the characteristic of being able to complete a required task or fulfill an obligation before or at a previously designated time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/punctual |title=Punctual - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Punctual" is often used [[synonym]]ously with "on time". 
It is also acceptable that punctual can also, be related to talking about grammar, means "to be accurate".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

An opposite personality trait is [[tardiness (vice)|tardiness]].

According to each culture, there is often an understanding about what is considered an acceptable degree of punctuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/11/travel/tr-insider11 |title=Punctuality: Some cultures are wound tighter than others - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1994-12-30 |accessdate=2014-02-01 |first=Jane |last=Engle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, a small amount of lateness is acceptable; this is commonly about ten or fifteen minutes in Western cultures, but this is not the case in such instances as doctor's appointments or school lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/germans-and-punctuality/a-16430264 |title=Germans and punctuality &amp;#124; All about those Germans &amp;#124; DW.DE &amp;#124; 09.12.2012 |publisher=DW.DE |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, such as [[Japanese society]], and settings, such as military ones, expectations may be much stricter.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Some cultures have an unspoken understanding that actual deadlines are different from stated deadlines, for example with [[Africa time]]. For example, it may be understood in a particular culture that people will turn up an hour later than advertised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Lawrence T. |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/culture-conscious/201202/is-punctuality-standard-oxymoron |title=Is "Punctuality Standard" an Oxymoron? |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, since everyone understands that a 9 pm party will actually start at around 10 pm, no-one is inconvenienced when everyone arrives at 10 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3211923.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Can Africa keep time? |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-28 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures which value punctuality, being late is seen as disrespectful of others' time and may be considered insulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/788640.shtml |title=Time for Africa to abandon tardy culture to avoid punctuality problems - OP-ED |publisher=Globaltimes.cn |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113154030/http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/788640.shtml |archivedate=2014-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, punctuality may be enforced by social penalties, for example by excluding low-status latecomers from meetings entirely. Such considerations can lead on to considering the value of punctuality in [[econometrics]] and to considering the effects of non-punctuality on others in [[queueing theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7276">In mathematics, '''real trees''' (also called '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;-trees''') are a class of [[metric space]]s generalising [[Tree (graph theory)|simplicial trees]]. They arise naturally in many mathematical contexts, in particular [[geometric group theory]] and probability theory. They are also the simplest examples of [[Gromov hyperbolic space]]s.

== Definition and examples ==

=== Formal definition ===

[[File:Y property.png|130px|thumb|A triangle in a real tree]]

A metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree if it is a [[Geodesic#Metric geometry|geodesic]] space where every triangle is a tripod. That is, for every three points &lt;math&gt;x, y, \rho \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a point &lt;math&gt;c = x \wedge y&lt;/math&gt; such that the geodesic segments &lt;math&gt;[\rho,x], [\rho,y]&lt;/math&gt; intersect in the segment &lt;math&gt;[\rho,c]&lt;/math&gt; and also &lt;math&gt;c \in [x,y]&lt;/math&gt;. This definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; being a "zero-hyperbolic space" in the sense of Gromov (all triangles are "zero-thin"). 
Real trees can also be characterised by a topological property. A metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree if for any pair of points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; all (topological) embeddings &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of the segment &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(0) = x, \, \sigma(1) = y&lt;/math&gt; have the same image (which is then a geodesic segment from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Simple examples ===

*If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a graph with the combinatorial metric then it is a real tree if and only if it is a tree (i.e. it has no cycles). Such a tree is often called a simplicial tree. They are characterised by the following topological property: a real tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is simplicial if and only if the set of singular points of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (points whose complement in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has three or more connected components) is discrete in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* The R-tree obtained in the following way is nonsimplicial. Start with the interval [0,2] and glue, for each positive integer n, an interval of length 1/n to the point 1−1/n in the original interval. The set of singular points is discrete, but fails to be closed since 1 is an ordinary point in this R-tree. Gluing an interval to 1 would result in a closed set of singular points at the expense of discreteness.
* The Paris metric makes the plane into a real tree. It is defined as follows: one fixes an origin &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and if two points are on the same ray from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, their distance is defined as the Euclidean distance. Otherwise, their distance is defined to be the sum of the Euclidean distances of these two points to the origin &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally any [[hedgehog space]] is an example of a real tree.

== In mathematical context ==

Real trees often appear, in various situations, as limits of more classical metric spaces.

=== Brownian trees ===

A [[brownian tree]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aldous | first = D. | authorlink = David Aldous | date = 1991 | title = The continuum random tree I | journal = [[Annals of Probability]] | volume = 19 | pages = 1–28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a (non-simplicial) real tree almost surely. Brownian trees arise as limits of various random processes on finite trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aldous | first = D. | authorlink = David Aldous | date = 1991 | title = The continuum random tree III | journal = [[Annals of Probability]] | volume = 21 | pages = 248–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultralimits of metric spaces ===

Any [[ultralimit]] of a sequence of hyperbolic spaces is a real tree. In particular, the [[Ultralimit#Asymptotic cones|asymptotic cone]] of any hyperbolic space is a real tree.

=== Limit of group actions ===

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. For a sequence of based &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-spaces &lt;math&gt;(X_i, *_i, \rho_i)&lt;/math&gt; there is a notion of convergence to a based &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-space &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, x_\infty, \rho_\infty)&lt;/math&gt; due to M. Bestvina and F. Paulin. When the spaces are hyperbolic and the actions are unbounded the limit (if it exists) is a real tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bestvina | first = Mladen | authorlink = Mladen Bestvina | editor-last1 = | editor-first1 = | title = Handbook of Geometric Topology | contribution = &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;-trees in topology, geometry and group theory | pages = 55–91 | year = 2002 | publisher = Elsevier | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8OYxdADnhZoC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example is obtained by taking &lt;math&gt;G = \pi_1(S)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a compact surface, and &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; the universal cover of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with the metric &lt;math&gt;i\rho&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed hyperbolic metric on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;).

This is useful to produce actions of hyperbolic groups on real trees. Such actions are analyzed using the so-called [[Rips machine]]. A case of particular interest is the study of degeneration of groups acting properly discuntinuously on a [[Hyperbolic space|real hyperbolic space]] (this predates Rips', Bestvina's and Paulin's work and is due to J. Morgan and [[Peter Shalen|P. Shalen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

=== Algebraic groups ===

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a field with an [[ultrametric space|ultrametric]] [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation]] then the [[Building (mathematics)|Bruhat–Tits building]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(F)&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree. It is simplicial if and only if the valuations is discrete.

== Generalisations ==

=== &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;-trees ===

If &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a totally ordered abelian group there is a natural notion of a distance with values in &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (classical metric spaces correspond to &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;). There is a notion of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;-tree&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Chiswell | first = Ian

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30020">The [[social norm]] of '''reciprocity''' is the expectation that people will respond to each other in similar ways—responding to gifts and kindnesses from others with similar benevolence of their own, and responding to harmful, hurtful acts from others with either indifference or some form of retaliation. Such norms can be crude and mechanical, such as a literal reading of the [[eye for an eye|eye-for-an-eye]] rule [[lex talionis]], or they can be complex and sophisticated, such as a subtle understanding of how anonymous donations to an international organization can be a form of reciprocity for the receipt of very personal benefits, such as the love of a parent.
 
The [[norm of reciprocity]] varies widely in its details from situation to situation, and from society to society.  Anthropologists and sociologists have often claimed, however, that having some version of the norm appears to be a social inevitability.&lt;ref&gt;Gouldner, Alvin.  “The Norm of Reciprocity.”  ''American Sociological Review'' 25 (1960): 161-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity figures prominently in [[social exchange theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter M.

==Patterns of reciprocity==
'''One-to-one reciprocity'''.Some reciprocal relationships are direct one-to-one arrangements between individuals, or between institutions, or between governments. Some of these are one-time arrangements, and others are embedded in long-term relationships.  Families often have expectations that children will reciprocate for the care they receive as infants by caring for their elderly parents; businesses may have long-term contractual obligations with each other: governments make treaties with each other.

There are also one-to-one reciprocal relationships that are indirect.  For example, there are sometimes long chains of exchanges, in which A gives a benefit to B, who passes on a similar benefit to C, and so on, in which each party in the chain expects that what goes around will eventually come back around.  The classic anthropological example is the [[Kula ring|Kula exchange]] in the Trobriand Islands.

'''One-to-many and many-to-one reciprocity''' often lies somewhere between direct reciprocal arrangements and generalized reciprocity. Informal clubs in which the hosting arrangements circulate among members are examples of the one-to-many variety.  Bridal showers are examples of the many-to-one variety. So are [[barn raising]] practices in some frontier communities. All of these are similar to direct reciprocity, since the beneficiaries are identified as such in each case, and contributors know exactly what they can expect in return. But because membership in the group changes, and needs for new meetings or marriages or barns are not always predictable, these cases differ significantly from precisely defined one-to-one cases.

'''Generalized reciprocity''' is even less precise.  Here donors operate within a large network of social transactions largely unknown to each other, and without expectations about getting specific benefits in return — other than, perhaps, the sort of social insurance provided by the continuance of the network itself. Recipients may not know the donors, and may not themselves be able to make a return in-kind to that network, but perhaps feel obligated to make a return to a similar network. Blood banks and food banks are examples.  But in fact any stable social structure in which there is a division of labor will involve a system of reciprocal exchanges of this generalized sort, as a way of sustaining [[social norms]].

All of these patterns of reciprocity, along with related ideas such as [[gratitude]], have been central to social and political philosophy from Plato onward.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Lawrence C. ''Reciprocity''.  London and New York: Routledge, 1986. Contains bibliographic essays.&lt;/ref&gt;  These philosophical discussions concern the ways in which patterns and norms of reciprocity might have a role in theories of justice, stable and productive social systems, healthy personal relationships, and ideals for human social life generally.

==The concept of reciprocity==
{{or-section|date=December 2012}}
Philosophical work on reciprocity often pays considerable attention, directly or indirectly, to the proper interpretation of one or more of the following conceptual issues.

'''Reciprocity as distinct from related ideas'''.  In [[Plato]]’s [[Crito]], Socrates considers whether citizens might have a duty of gratitude to obey the laws of the state, in much the way they have duties of gratitude to their parents.  Many other philosophers have considered similar questions. (See the references below to Sidgwick, English, and Jecker for modern examples.) This is certainly a legitimate question. Charging a child or a citizen with ingratitude can imply a failure to meet a requirement.  But confining the discussion to gratitude is limiting. There are similar limitations in discussions of the do-unto-others [[ethic of reciprocity|golden rule]], or ethical principles that are modeled on the mutuality and mutual benevolence that come out of the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] relations envisaged by [[Emmanuel Levinas]] or the [[I-Thou]] relationships described by [[Martin Buber]]. Like gratitude, these other ideas have things in common with the norm of reciprocity, but are quite distinct from it.
  
[[Gratitude]], in its ordinary sense, is as much about having warm and benevolent feelings toward one’s benefactors as it is about having obligations to them. Reciprocity, in its ordinary dictionary sense, is broader than that, and broader than all discussions that begin with a sense of mutuality and mutual benevolence. (See the reference below to Becker, ''Reciprocity'', and the bibliographic essays therein.) Reciprocity pointedly covers arm’s-length dealings between egoistic or mutually disinterested people.
 
Moreover, norms of gratitude do not speak very directly about what feelings and obligations are appropriate toward wrongdoers, or the malicious.  Reciprocity, by contrast, speaks directly to both sides of the equation – requiring responses in kind: positive for positive, negative for negative. In this, it also differs from the golden rule, which is compatible with forgiveness and “turning the other cheek” but has notorious difficulties as a basis for corrective justice, [[punishment]], and dealing with people (e.g., masochists) who have unusual motivational structures.

Finally, the idea of enforcing, or carrying out a duty of gratitude, as well as calibrating the extent one’s gratitude, seems inconsistent with the warm and benevolent feelings of  “being grateful.” There is a similar inconsistency in the idea of enforcing a duty to love. Reciprocity, by contrast, because it does not necessarily involve having special feelings of love or benevolence, fits more comfortably into discussions of duties and obligations. Further, its requirement of an in-kind response invites us to calibrate both the quality and the quantity of the response. 
 
The norm of reciprocity thus requires that we make fitting and proportional responses to both the benefits and harms we receive – whether they come from people who have been benevolent or malicious. Working out the conceptual details of this idea presents interesting questions of its own. The following matters are all considered at length in many of the sources listed below under References, and those authors typically defend particular  proposals about how best to define the conceptual details of reciprocity. What follows here is simply an outline of the topics that are under philosophical scrutiny.

'''Qualitative similarity'''. What counts as making a qualitatively appropriate or “fitting” response in various settings—positive for positive, negative for negative?  If one person invites another to dinner, must the other offer a dinner in return? How soon?  Must it be directly to the original benefactor, or will providing a comparable favor to someone else be appropriate? If the dinner one receives is unintentionally awful, must one reciprocate with something similarly awful? Sometimes an immediate tit-for-tat response seems inappropriate, and at other times it is the only thing that will do.

Are there general principles for assessing the qualitative appropriateness of reciprocal responses?  Reflective people typically practice a highly nuanced version of the norm of reciprocity for social life, in which the qualitative similarity or fittingness of the response appears to be determined by a number of factors.

''The nature of the transaction''. One is the general nature of the transaction or relationship between the parties – the rules and expectations involved in a particular interaction itself.  Tit for tat, defined in a literal way as an exchange of the identical kinds of goods (client list for client list, referral for referral) may be the only sort of reciprocal response that is appropriate in a clearly defined business situation. Similarly, dinner-for-dinner may be the expectation among members of a round robin dinner club.  But when the nature of the transaction is more loosely defined, or is embedded in a complex personal relationship, an appropriate reciprocal response often requires spontaneity, imagination, and even a lack of premeditation about where, what, and how soon.

''Fitting the response to the recipient''. Another aspect of qualitative fit is what counts subjectively, for the recipient, as a response in-kind.   When we respond to people who have benefited us, it seems perverse to give them things they do not regard as benefits.  The general principle here is that, other things equal, a return of good for good received will require giving something that will actually be appreciated as good by the recipient – at least eventually. Similarly for the negative side.  When we respond to bad things, reciprocity presumably requires a return that the recipient regards as a bad thing.

''Unusual circumstances''. A third aspect of qualitative fit is the presence or absence of circumstances that undermine the usual expectations about reciprocity.  If a pair of friends often borrow each other’s household tools, and one of them (suddenly deranged with anger) asks to borrow an antique sword from the other’s collection, what is a fitting response? The example, in a slightly different form, goes back to [[Plato]].  The point is that in this unusual circumstance, reciprocity (as well as other considerations) may require that the recipient not get what he wants at the moment.  Rather, it may be that the recipient should be given what he needs, in some objective sense, whether he ever comes to appreciate that it is good for him.

''General rationale''. A final determinant of qualitative fit is the general rationale for having the norm of reciprocity in the first place. For example, if the ultimate point of practicing reciprocity is to produce stable, productive, fair, and reliable social interactions, then there may be some tensions between things that accomplish this general goal and things that satisfy only the other three determinants.  Responding to others’ harmful conduct raises this issue.  As [[Plato]] observed ([[Republic]], Book I), is not rational to harm our enemies in the sense of making them worse, as enemies or as people, than they already are.  We may reply to Plato by insisting that reciprocity merely requires us to make them worse-off, not worse, period. But if it turns out that the version of the reciprocity norm we are using actually has the consequence of doing both, or at any rate not improving the situation, then we will have undermined the point of having it.

''Quantitative similarity''.  Another definitional issue concerns proportionality.   What counts as too little, or too much in return for what we receive from others?  In some cases, such as borrowing a sum of money from a friend who has roughly the same resources, a prompt and exact return of the same amount seems right.  Less will be too little, and a return with interest will often be too much, between friends.  But in other cases, especially in exchanges between people who are very unequal in resources, a literal reading of tit-for-tat may be a perverse rule – one that undermines the social and personal benefits of the norm of reciprocity itself.  How, for example, may badly disadvantaged people reciprocate for the public or private assistance they receive?   Requiring a prompt and exact return of the benefit received may defeat the general purpose of the norm of reciprocity by driving disadvantaged people further into debt.  Yet to waive the debt altogether, or to require only some discounted amount seems to defeat the purpose also.

Anglo-American legal theory and practice has examples of two options for dealing with this problem.  One is to require a return that is equal to the benefit received, but to limit the use of that requirement in special cases.  Bankruptcy rules are in part designed to prevent downward, irrecoverable spirals of debt while still exacting a considerable penalty. Similarly, there are rules for rescinding unconscionable contracts, preventing unjust enrichment, and dealing with cases in which contractual obligations have become impossible to perform. These rules typically have considerable transaction costs.

Another kind of option is to define a reciprocal return with explicit reference to ability to pay. Progressive tax rates are an example of this. Considered in terms of reciprocity, this option seems based on an equal sacrifice interpretation of proportionality, rather than an equal benefit one.  Under an equal sacrifice rule, making a quantitatively similar return will mean giving something back whose marginal value to oneself, given one’s resources, equals the marginal value of the sacrifice made by the original giver, given her resources.

==Reciprocity and justice==
Standard usage of the term justice shows its close general connection to the concept of reciprocity. Justice includes the idea of fairness, and that in turn includes treating similar cases similarly, giving people what they deserve, and apportioning all other benefits and burdens in an equitable way. Those things, further, involve acting in a principled, impartial way that forbids playing favorites and may require sacrifices.  All of those things are certainly in the neighborhood of the elements of reciprocity (e.g., fittingness, proportionality), but it is challenging to explain the precise connections.

===Reward and punishment===
Discussions of merit, desert, blame, and [[punishment]] inevitably involve questions about the fittingness and proportionality of our responses to others, and retributive theories of punishment put the norm of reciprocity at their center. The idea is to make the punishment fit the crime.  This differs from utilitarian theories of punishment, which may use fittingness and proportionality as constraints, but whose ultimate commitment is to make punishment serve social goals such as general deterrence, public safety, and the rehabilitation of wrongdoers.

===Justice and war===
In [[Just war|just war theory]], notions of fittingness and proportionality are central, at least as constraints both on the justification of a given war, and the methods used to prosecute it. When war represents a disproportionate response to a threat or an injury, it raises questions of justice related to reciprocity.  When war fighting employs weapons that do not discriminate between combatants and noncombatants, it raises questions of justice related to reciprocity. A profound sense of injustice related to a lack of reciprocity – for example, between those privileged by socioeconomic status, political power, or wealth, and those who are less privileged, and oppressed – sometimes leads to war in the form of revolutionary or counterrevolutionary violence. It has been argued that the use of autonomous or remote controlled weaponized drones violate reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2013/07/18/just-war-theory-and-the-ethics-of-drone-warfare/|title=Just War Theory and the Ethics of Drone Warfare|work=E-International Relations|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Drone warfare and morality in riskless war|journal=Global Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=285–291|doi=10.1080/23340460.2015.1080042|year = 2015|last1 = Henriksen|first1 = Anders|last2=Ringsmose|first2=Jens}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political solutions which end the violence without dealing with the underlying injustice run the risk of continued social instability.

===Legitimation of social, political, and legal obligations===
A very deep and persistent line of philosophical discussion explores the way in which reciprocity can resolve conflicts between justice and self-interest, and can justify the imposition (or limitation) of social, political, and legal obligations that require individuals to sacrifice their own interests.

This aspect of the philosophical discussion of reciprocity attempts to bring together two ways of approaching a very basic question: What is the fundamental justification for the existence of social and political institutions – institutions that impose and enforce duties and obligations upon their members?

'''Individual well-being'''. One obvious answer is that people need to stay out of each other’s way enough so that each can pursue his or her individual interests as far as possible, without interference from others.  This immediately justifies rules that are mutually advantageous, but it raises questions about requiring obedience from people whenever it turns out that they will be disadvantaged by following the rules, or can get away with disobeying them.  So the problem becomes one of showing whether, and when, it might actually be mutually advantageous to follow the rules of justice even when it is inconvenient or costly to do so.

[[Social contract]] theorists often invoke the value of reciprocal relationships to deal with this. Many human beings need help from one another from time to time in order to pursue their individual interests effectively.  So if we can arrange a system of reciprocity in which all the benefits we are required to contribute are typically returned to us in full (or more), that may justify playing by the rules—even in cases where it looks as though we can get away with not doing so.

'''Social well-being'''. Another obvious answer to the question of why people organize themselves into groups, however, is in order to achieve levels of cooperation needed for improving society generally – for example by improving public health, and society-wide levels of education, wealth, or individual welfare.  This also gives a reason for rules of justice, but again raises problems about requiring individuals to sacrifice their own welfare for the good of others—especially when some individuals might not share the particular goals for social improvements at issue.

Here too, the value of reciprocal relationships can be invoked, this time to limit the legitimacy of the sacrifices a society might require. For one thing, it seems perverse to require sacrifices in pursuit of some social goal if it turns out those sacrifices are unnecessary, or in vain because the goal cannot be achieved.

To some philosophers, a theory of justice based on reciprocity (or fairness, or fair play) is an attractive middle ground between a thoroughgoing concern with individual well-being and a thoroughgoing concern with social well-being. This has been part of the attraction of the most influential line of thought on distributive justice in recent Anglo-American philosophy – the one carried on in the context of [[John Rawls]]’ work.

'''Future generations'''.  It may also be that there is something to be gained, philosophically, from considering what obligations of generalized reciprocity present generations of human beings may have to future ones.  [[John Rawls|Rawls]] considers (briefly) the problem of defining a “just savings principle” for future generations, and treats it as a consequence of the interests people typically have in the welfare of their descendents, and the agreements fully reciprocal members of society would come to among themselves about such matters.  Others (e.g., [[Lawrence C. Becker|Lawrence Becker]]) have explored the intuitive idea that acting on behalf of future generations may be required as a generalized form of reciprocity for benefits received from previous generations.

==Mutuality==
What is the relation between reciprocity and [[love]], [[friendship]] or [[family]] relationships? If such relationships are ideally ones in which the parties are connected by mutual affection and benevolence, shouldn’t justice and reciprocity stay out of their way? Isn’t impartiality inconsistent with love? Doesn’t acting on principle take the affection out of friendship or family relationships?  Doesn’t following the norm of reciprocity eliminate unconditional love or loyalty?

Some contemporary philosophers have criticized major figures in the history of Western philosophy, including [[John Rawls]]’ early work, for making familial relationships more or less opaque in theories of justice. (See the reference below to [[Susan Moller Okin|Okin]].) The argument is that families can be grossly unjust, and have often been so.  Since the family is “the school of justice,” if it is unjust the moral education of children is distorted, and the injustice tends to spread to the society at large, and to be perpetuated in following generations. If that is right, then justice and reciprocity must define the boundaries within which we pursue even the most intimate relationships.
  
A somewhat different thread on these matters begins with [[Aristotle]]’s discussion of friendship, in ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1155-1172a.  He proposes that the highest or best form of friendship involves a relationship between equals – one in which a genuinely reciprocal relationship is possible. This thread appears throughout the history of Western ethics in discussions of personal and social relationships of many sorts: between children and parents, spouses, humans and other animals, and humans and god(s). The question is the extent to which the kind of reciprocity possible in various relationships determines the kind of mutual affection and benevolence possible in those relationships.

This said, reciprocation in personal relationships rarely follows a mathematical formula and the level of reciprocation, i.e. the give and take, will vary depending on the personalities involved, and situational factors such as which party has more control, persuasive power or influence. It is often the case that one party will typically be the lead reciprocator with the other being the responsive reciprocator.  The form of reciprocation can also be influenced by the level of emotional need. Sometimes one party will need more support than the other and this can switch at different times depending on the life situation of each party.  Because reciprocation is influenced by personal circumstances and since people do not follow a set pattern like robots, reciprocation from a friend to a friend for example will vary in intensity and an absolutely consistent pattern cannot be expected.  If for example a person has a large inner circle of friendships with reciprocation as the key element of friendship, then the level of reciprocation within the inner circle will influence the depth of a friendship therein.  Reciprocation can be responsive or initiative.  It is also a fundamental principle in parenting, a successful work place, religion and karma.

So for example, in the friendship context, reciprocation means to give or take mutually but not necessarily equally. Overall reciprocal balance is more important than strict equality at every moment. Friendship based on reciprocity means caring for each other, being responsive and supportive and in tune with each other. But without some form of overall reciprocal balance, the relationship may become transformed into a nonreciprocal form of friendship, or the friendship may fail altogether.

To provide an everyday life example, should one's (person A) dog die, a good friend (person B) would offer support and a "shoulder to cry on" for person A struggling to deal with the death of their dog. After time, person B might suggest a new dog, to help person A move on from their loss. Reciprocation occurs from person A to person B, if person B obtains assistance from person A at a future time.

Relative scalars are an important special case of the more general concept of a [[relative tensor]].

==Ordinary scalar==
An '''ordinary scalar''' or '''absolute scalar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Veblen |first=Oswald |authorlink=Oswald Veblen |title=Invariants of Quadratic Differential Forms |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item1156775/?site_locale=en_US |accessdate=3 October 2012 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-60484-2 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the &lt;math&gt;w=0&lt;/math&gt; case.

If &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^j&lt;/math&gt; refer to the same point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; on the manifold, then we desire &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\bar{x}^j) = f(x^i)&lt;/math&gt;. This equation can be interpreted two ways when &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^j&lt;/math&gt; are viewed as the "new coordinates" and &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt; are viewed as the "original coordinates". The first is as &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\bar{x}^j) = f(x^i(\bar{x}^j))&lt;/math&gt;, which "converts the function to the new coordinates". The second is as &lt;math&gt;f(x^i)=\bar{f}(\bar{x}^j(x^i))&lt;/math&gt;, which "converts back to the original coordinates. Of course, "new" or "original" is a relative concept.

There are many physical quantities that are represented by ordinary scalars, such as temperature and pressure.

===Weight 0 example===
Suppose the temperature in a room is given in terms of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)= 2 x + y + 5&lt;/math&gt; in Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; and the function in cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r,t,h)&lt;/math&gt; is desired. The two coordinate systems are related by the following sets of equations:
:&lt;math&gt; r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; t = \arctan(y/x) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; h = z \, &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; x = r \cos(t) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = r \sin(t) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z = h. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\bar{x}^j) = f(x^i(\bar{x}^j))&lt;/math&gt; allows one to derive &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(r,t,h)= 2 r \cos(t)+ r \sin(t) + 5&lt;/math&gt; as the transformed function.

Consider the point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; whose Cartesian coordinates are &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)=(2,3,4)&lt;/math&gt; and whose corresponding value in the cylindrical system is &lt;math&gt;(r,t,h)=(\sqrt{13},\arctan{(3/2)},4)&lt;/math&gt;. A quick calculation shows that &lt;math&gt;f(2,3,4)=12&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\sqrt{13},\arctan{(3/2)},4)=12&lt;/math&gt; also. This equality would have held for any chosen point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is the "temperature function in the Cartesian coordinate system" and &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(r,t,h)&lt;/math&gt; is the "temperature function in the cylindrical coordinate system".

One way to view these functions is as representations of the "parent" function that takes a point of the manifold as an argument and gives the temperature.

The problem could have been reversed. One could have been given &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; and wished to have derived the Cartesian temperature function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. This just flips the notion of "new" vs the "original" coordinate system.

Suppose that one wishes to ''integrate'' these functions over "the room", which will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. (Yes, integrating temperature is strange but that's partly what's to be shown.) Suppose the region &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is given in cylindrical coordinates as &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;[0,2]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;[0,\pi/2]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;[0,2]&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the "room" is a quarter slice of a cylinder of radius and height 2).
The integral of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over the region &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^\sqrt{2^2-x^2} \! \int_0^2 \! f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dy \, dx = 16 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int_0^2+int_0^%28sqrt%282^2-x^2%29%29+int_0^2+%282+x+%2B+y+%2B+5%29+dz+dy+dx]&lt;/ref&gt;
The value of the integral of &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; over the same region is
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^2 \! \bar{f}(r,t,h) \, dh \, dt \, dr = 12 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int_0^2+int_0^%28pi%2F2%29+int_0^2+%282+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+5%29+dh+dt+dr]&lt;/ref&gt;
They are not equal. The integral of temperature is not independent of the coordinate
system used. It is non-physical in that sense, hence "strange". Note that if the integral of &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; included a factor of the Jacobian (which is just &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;),
we get
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^2 \! \bar{f}(r,t,h) r \, dh \, dt \, dr = 16 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int_0^2+int_0^%28pi%2F2%29+int_0^2+%282+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+5%29+r^2+dh+dt+dr]&lt;/ref&gt;
which ''is'' equal to the original integral but it is not however the integral of ''temperature'' because
temperature is a relative scalar of weight 0, not a relative scalar of weight 1.

===Weight 1 example===
If we had said &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)= 2 x + y + 5&lt;/math&gt; was representing mass density, however, then its transformed value
should include the Jacobian factor that takes into account the geometric distortion of the coordinate
system. The transformed function is now &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(r,t,h)= (2 r \cos(t)+ r \sin(t) + 5) r&lt;/math&gt;. This time
&lt;math&gt;f(2,3,4)=12&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\sqrt{13},\arctan{(3/2)},4)=12\sqrt{29}&lt;/math&gt;. As before
is integral (the total mass) in Cartesian coordinates is
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^\sqrt{2^2-x^2} \! \int_0^2 \! f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dy \, dx = 16 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.
The value of the integral of &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; over the same region is
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^2 \! \bar{f}(r,t,h) \, dh \, dt \, dr = 16 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.
They are equal. The integral of mass ''density'' gives total mass which is a coordinate-independent concept.
Note that if the integral of &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; also included a factor of the Jacobian like before, we get
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^2 \! \bar{f}(r,t,h) r \, dh \, dt \, dr = 24 + 40 \pi /3&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int_0^2+int_0^%28pi%2F2%29+int_0^2+%282+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+5%29+r^2+dh+dt+dr]&lt;/ref&gt;
which is not equal to the previous case.

==Other cases==
Weights other than 0 and 1 do not arise as often. It can be shown the determinant of a type (0,2) tensor is a relative scalar of weight 2.

The '''renewable-energy industry''' is the part of the [[energy industry]] focusing on new and appropriate [[renewable energy]] technologies. [[Investors]] worldwide have paid greater attention to this emerging industry in recent years. In many cases, this has translated into rapid [[renewable energy commercialization]] and considerable industry expansion. The [[wind power]] and solar [[photovoltaics]] ([[Photovoltaic system|PV]]) industries provide good examples of this.

Renewable energy industries expanded during most of 2008, and by August 2008, there were at least 160 publicly traded renewable energy companies with a [[market capitalization]] greater than $100 million. An estimated $120 billion was invested in renewable energy globally in 2008. 
[[File:GlobalREPowerCapacity-exHydro-Eng.png|thumb|400px|Renewable energy power growth in GW (2004-2011)]]

==Overview==
During 2006/2007, several renewable energy companies went through high profile [[Initial Public Offerings]] (IPOs), resulting in market capitalization near or above $1 billion. These corporations included the solar PV companies [[First Solar]] (USA), [[Trina Solar]] (USA), [[Centrosolar]] (Germany), and [[Renesola]] (U.K.), wind power company [[Iberdrola]] (Spain), and U.S. biofuels producers [[VeraSun Energy]], [[Aventine Renewable Energy|Aventine]], and [[Pacific Ethanol]].&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;

Renewable energy industries expanded during most of 2008, with large increases in manufacturing capacity, diversification of manufacturing locations, and shifts in leadership.&lt;ref name=re/&gt; By August 2008, there were at least 160 publicly traded renewable energy companies with a market capitalization greater than $100 million. The number of companies in this category has expanded from around 60 in 2005.&lt;ref name=ren21-2009&gt;Renewables Global Status Report: 2009 Update. REN21. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|15}}

Some $150 billion was invested in renewable energy globally in 2009, including new capacity (asset finance and projects) and biofuels refineries. This is more than double the 2006 investment figure of $63 billion. Almost all of the increase was due to greater investment in wind power, solar PV, and biofuels.&lt;ref name=ren21-2010&gt;Renewables Global Status Report: 2010. REN21. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 27}}

In 2000, [[venture capital]] (VC) investment in [[renewable energy]] was about 1% of total VC investment. In 2007 that figure was closer to 10%, with solar power alone making up about 3% of the entire Venture Capital asset class of ~$33B. More than 60 start-ups have been funded by
VCs in the last three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greentechmedia.com/assets/pdfs/executivesummaries/VC-Investment-in-Solar-Update-Executive-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Venture capital and [[private equity investments]] in renewable energy companies increased by 167 percent in 2006, according to investment analysts at [[New Energy Finance]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=10528 EERE News: Clean Energy Investments More Than Double in 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

New investment into the sector jumped US$148 billion in 2007, up 60 per cent over 2006, noted a report by the [[Sustainable Energy Finance Initiative]] (SEFI). Wind energy attracted one-third of the new capital and solar one-fifth. But interest in solar is growing rapidly on the back of major technological advances which saw solar investment increase 254 per cent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.financialstandard.com.au/news/view/23561/ Financial Standard - Energy investments surge]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] predicts US$20 trillion will be invested into alternative energy projects over the next 22 years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil continued its ethanol expansion]] plans which began in the 70's and now has the largest ethanol distribution and the largest fleet of cars run by any mix of ethanol and gasoline.&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp| 19}}
[[Image:EthanolPetrol.jpg|right|thumb|Information on pump, California.]]
In the [[ethanol fuel]] industry, the United States dominated, with 130 operating ethanol plants in 2007, and production capacity of 26 billion liters/year (6.87 billion gallons/year), a 60 percent increase over 2005. Another 84 plants were under construction or undergoing expansion, and this will result in a doubled production capacity.
The [[biodiesel]] industry opened many new production facilities during 2006/2007 and continued expansion plans in several countries. New biodiesel capacity appeared throughout Europe, including in
Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp|19}}

[[cellulosic ethanol commercialization|Commercial investment in second-generation biofuels]] began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. The world’s first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp|19}}

==Employment==

Renewable energy use tends to be more labor-intensive than fossil fuels, and so a transition toward renewables promises employment gains. Globally, about 2.3 million people work either directly in renewables or indirectly in supplier industries. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the PV sector accounts for an estimated 170,000 jobs, and the solar thermal industry accounts for about 624,000.  More than 1 million jobs are located in the biomass and biofuels sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5821 Jobs in Renewable Energy Expanding]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repressed memories''' are [[memory|memories]] that have been unconsciously blocked due to the memory being associated with a high level of stress or trauma.&lt;ref name=loftus1993/&gt; The theory postulates that even though the individual cannot recall the memory, it may still be affecting them subconsciously,&lt;ref name="childhood abuse"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/trauma/memories.aspx?item=1 Questions and Answers about Memories of Childhood Abuse]. apa.org&lt;/ref&gt; and that these memories can emerge later into the consciousness. Ideas on repressed memory hiding trauma from awareness were an important part of [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] early work on [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=loftus1993/&gt; He later took a different view.

The existence of repressed memories is an extremely controversial topic in psychology; although some studies have concluded that it can occur in a varying but generally small percentage of victims of trauma, many other studies dispute its existence entirely.&lt;ref name="pmid17803876"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNally|first1=RJ|title=Dispelling confusion about traumatic dissociative amnesia|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=September 2007|volume=82|issue=9|pages=1083–90|pmid=17803876|doi=10.4065/82.9.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists support the theory of repressed memories and claim that repressed memories can be recovered through therapy, but most psychologists argue that this is in fact rather a process through which false memories are created by blending actual memories and outside influences.&lt;ref name="pmid17803876" /&gt; One study concluded that repressed memories were a cultural symptom for want of written proof of their existence before the nineteenth century, but its results were disputed by some psychologists, and a work discussing a repressed memory from 1786 was eventually acknowledged, though the others stand by their hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pettus|first=Ashley|title=cultural symptom? repressed memory|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/01/repressed-memory.html|website=Harvard Magazine|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brown1"&gt;Baum, Deborah (July 7, 2009) [https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/07/memory Brown Professor Continues Debate Over Recovered Memory]. ''Brown University News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Psychological Association]], it is not possible to distinguish repressed memories from false ones without corroborating evidence.&lt;ref name="childhood abuse" /&gt; The term repressed memory is sometimes compared to the term dissociative amnesia, which is defined in the [[DSM-V]] as an "inability to recall autobiographical information. This amnesia may be localized (i.e., an event or period of time), selective (i.e., a specific aspect of an event), or generalized (i.e., identity and life history)."

According to the Mayo Clinic, [[amnesia]] refers to any instance in which memories stored in the long-term memory are completely or partially forgotten, usually due to brain injury.
According to proponents of the existence of repressed memories, such memories can be recovered years or decades after the event, most often spontaneously, triggered by a particular smell, taste, or other identifier related to the lost memory, or via suggestion during [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref name="dissoc-9-4"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Memory recovery of childhood sexual abuse |last=Albach |first=Francine |author2=Peter Paul Moormann | author3=Bob Bermond |journal=Dissociation |volume= 9| issue =  4 |pages= 261–273 |hdl=1794/1774 |date=December 1996|issn=0896-2863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was initially claimed that there was no documented writing about repressed memories or [[dissociative amnesia]] (as it is sometimes referred to), before the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0033291706009500|pmid=17156503|title=Is dissociative amnesia a culture-bound syndrome? Findings from a survey of historical literature|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=37|issue=2|pages=225–33|year=2006|last1=Pope|first1=Harrison G.|last2=Poliakoff|first2=Michael B.|last3=Parker|first3=Michael P.|last4=Boynes|first4=Matthew|last5=Hudson|first5=James I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding, by Harrison G. Pope, was based on a competition in which entrants could win $1000 if they could identify "a pre-1800 literary example of traumatic memory that has been repressed by an otherwise healthy individual, and then recovered."  Pope claimed that no entrant had satisfied the criteria. Ross Cheit, a political scientist at Brown University, cited [[Nina (Dalayrac)|Nina]], a 1786 opera by the French composer Nicolas Dalayrac.&lt;ref name="brown1"/&gt;

The concept of repressed memory originated with [[Sigmund Freud]] in his 1896 essay ''Zur Ätiologie der Hysterie'' ("On the etiology of hysteria").&lt;ref name="freud"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Hinz|first=Paul|title=Die Verfassung des Freistaates Preussen|year=1920|publisher=J. Bensheimer|pages=55–57}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the studies published in his essay involved a young woman by the name of [[Anna O.]] Among her many ailments, she suffered from stiff paralysis on the right side of her body. Freud stated her symptoms to be attached to psychological traumas. The painful memories had separated from her consciousness and brought harm to her body. Freud used hypnosis to treat Anna O. She is reported to have gained slight mobility on her right side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boag|first=Simon|title=Freudian Repression|year=2012|publisher=Karnac Books|location=London|isbn=9781855757387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud's repressed memory theory joined his philosophy of [[psychoanalysis]]. Repressed memory has remained a heavily debated topic inside of Freud's psychoanalysis philosophy.

== Research ==
Some research indicates that memories of [[child sexual abuse]] and other traumatic incidents may be forgotten.&lt;ref name=JournalClinPsy&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams LM |title=Recall of childhood trauma: a prospective study of women's memories of child sexual abuse |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=1167–76 |year=1994 |pmid=7860814 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.62.6.1167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of the spontaneous recovery of traumatic memories has been shown,&lt;ref name="chu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chu |first=J |author2= Frey L | author3=Ganzel B | author4=Matthews J |date=May 1999 |title=Memories of childhood abuse: dissociation, amnesia, and corroboration |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=156 |issue=5 |pages=749–55 |pmid = 10327909 |doi=10.1176/ajp.156.5.749|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Duggal | first= S. |author2= Sroufe, L.

Van der Kolk and Fisler's research shows that traumatic memories are retrieved, at least at first, in the form of mental imprints that are dissociated. These imprints are of the affective and sensory elements of the traumatic experience. Clients have reported the slow emergence of a personal narrative that can be considered explicit (conscious) memory. The level of emotional significance of a memory correlates directly with the memory's veracity. Studies of subjective reports of memory show that memories of highly significant events are unusually accurate and stable over time.&lt;ref name="pmid8564271"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Kolk BA, Fisler R |title=Dissociation and the fragmentary nature of traumatic memories: overview and exploratory study |journal=J Trauma Stress |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=505–25 |year=1995 |pmid=8564271 |doi= 10.1002/jts.2490080402|url=http://www.trauma-pages.com/a/vanderk2.php | accessdate = March 22, 2008|citeseerx=10.1.1.487.1607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The imprints of traumatic experiences appear to be qualitatively different from those of nontraumatic events. Traumatic memories may be coded differently from ordinary event memories, possibly because of alterations in attentional focusing or the fact that extreme emotional arousal interferes with the memory functions of the hippocampus.&lt;ref name="pmid8564271"/&gt;

Another possibility is that traumatic events are pushed out of consciousness until a later events elicits or triggers a psychological response. Support for this idea has come from studies in which trauma was temporarily induced. For example, a high percentage of female psychiatric in-patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carmen E.

San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been significant questioning of the reality of repressed memories. There is considerable evidence that rather than being pushed out of consciousness, the difficulty with traumatic memories for most people are their intrusiveness and inability to forget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McHugh | first = PR | authorlink = Paul R.

Retrospective studies (studying the extent to which participants can recall past events) depend critically on the ability of informants to recall accurate memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Herman J. L. |author2=Schatzow E. | year = 1984 | title = Time-limited group therapy for women with a history of incest | doi=10.1080/00207284.1984.11732563|pmid=6519859 | journal = International Journal of Group Psychotherapy | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 605–616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of reliability in participants’ introspective abilities has been questioned by modern psychologists. In other words, a participant accurately recalling and remembering their own past memories is highly criticized, because memories are undoubtedly influenced by external, environmental factors.

Psychologists [[Elizabeth Loftus]] and Katherine Ketcham are authors of the seminal work on the fallacy of repressed memory, ''[[The Myth of Repressed Memory]]'' (St. Martin's Press, 1994).

==Cause==
It is hypothesised that [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] may be one method used by individuals to cope with traumatic memories, by pushing them out of awareness (perhaps as an adaptation via [[psychogenic amnesia]]) to allow a child to maintain [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to a person on whom they are dependent for survival.&lt;ref name=Freyd2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freyd |first=J. |year=1994 |title=Betrayal trauma: traumatic amnesia as an adaptive response to childhood abuse |journal= Ethics &amp; Behavior |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=307–330 |url=http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jjf/articles/freyd94.pdf |accessdate= January 13, 2008 |doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0404_1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have proposed that repression can operate on a social level as well.&lt;ref name=Freyd3&gt;{{cite journal |last= Freyd |first= Jennifer J. |year= 2007 |title= Archiving Dissociation as a Precaution Against Dissociating Dissociation |journal= [[Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation]] |volume= 8 |issue= 3 |url= http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jjf/articles/freyd2007.pdf |accessdate= December 29, 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theoretical causes of forgotten memories have stemmed from the idea of ''Retrieval-Influenced Forgetting'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson M. C. |author2=Bjork R. A. |author3=Bjork E. L. | year = 1994 | title = Remembering can cause forgetting: Retrieval dynamics in long-term memory | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 1063–1087 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.5.1063|citeseerx=10.1.1.119.3933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that “false” memories will be more accurately recalled when rehearsed more, than when actual memories get rehearsed. In this scenario, the action of rehearsing a falsified memory can actually take precedence over the actual memory that a person experiences. Anderson et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; discovered that rehearsal of novel information exhibits inhibitive processes on one’s ability to remember or recall the prior (real) memory. This conclusion indicates that past memories can be easily forgotten, simply by attending to “real”, novel memories that are brought into awareness.

===Authenticity===

Memories ''can'' be accurate, but they are not ''always'' accurate. For example, eyewitness testimony even of relatively recent dramatic events is notoriously unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/107385802236964 | last1 = Gonsalves | first1 = B | last2 = Paller | first2 = KA |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2002 | title = Mistaken memories: remembering events that never happened | url = | journal = [[The Neuroscientist]] | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 391–5 | pmid = 12374423 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.24.8545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Memories of events are a mix of fact overlaid with emotions, mingled with interpretation and "filled in" with imaginings.

Arguments against the existence of "traumatic amnesia" note that  various manipulations can be used to implant false memories (sometimes called "pseudomemories").

The ''American Psychiatric Association'' advises: "...most leaders in the field agree that although it is a rare occurrence, a memory of early childhood abuse that has been forgotten can be remembered later. However, these leaders also agree that it is possible to construct convincing pseudomemories for events that never occurred.

Nevertheless, many therapists believe in the authenticity of the recovered memories that they hear from their clients. In a non-random study by Loftus and Herzog (1991) with 16 clinicians, 13 (81%) said that they invariably believed their clients. The most common basis for this belief was the patient’s symptomology (low self-esteem, sexual dysfunction, self-destructive behaviour) or body memories (voice frozen etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loftus|first=Elizabeth F.|title=The reality of repressed memories|journal=American Psychologist|volume=48|issue=5|pages=518–537|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.48.5.518|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism(s) by which both of these phenomena happen are not well understood and, at this point it is impossible, without other corroborative evidence, to distinguish a true memory from a false one."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/memories.html Questions and Answers about Memories of Childhood Abuse] ''American Psychiatric Association''&lt;/ref&gt; Sheflin and Brown state that a total of 25 studies on amnesia for child sexual abuse exist and that they demonstrate amnesia in their study subpopulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sheflin | first = AW | author2 = Brown D |year=1996 | title = Repressed memory or dissociative amnesia: what the science says | journal = J Psychiat Law | volume = 24  | pages = 143–88 | issn = 0093-1853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an editorial in the ''British Medical Journal'' states on the Sheflin and Brown study that "on critical examination, the scientific evidence for repression crumbles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Brown et al. estimate that 3 to 5% of laboratory subjects are vulnerable to post-event misinformation suggestions. They state that 5–8% of the general population is the range of high-hypnotizability. Twenty-five percent of those in this range are vulnerable to suggestion of pseudomemories for peripheral details, which can rise to 80% with a combination of other social influence factors. They conclude that the rates of memory errors run 0–5% in adult studies, 3–5% in children's studies and that the rates of false allegations of child abuse allegations run 4–8% in the general population.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;

===Neurological basis of memory===

The neuroscientist [[Donald Hebb]] (1904–1985) was the first to distinguish between [[short-term memory]] and [[long-term memory]]. According to current theories in neuroscience, things that we "notice" are stored in short-term memory for up to a few minutes; this memory depends on "reverberating" electrical activity in neuronal circuits, and is very easily destroyed by interruption or interference. Memories stored for longer than this are stored in "long-term memory". Whether information is stored in long-term memory depends on its "importance"; for any animal, memories of traumatic events are potentially important for the adaptive value that they have for future avoidance behavior, and [[hormones]] that are released during stress have a role in determining what memories are preserved. In humans, traumatic stress is associated with acute secretion of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] (adrenaline and noradrenaline) from the [[adrenal medulla]] and [[cortisol]] from the [[adrenal cortex]]. Increases in these facilitate memory, but chronic stress associated with prolonged hypersecretion of cortisol may have the opposite effect. The [[limbic system]] is involved in memory storage and retrieval as well as giving emotional significance to sensory inputs. Within the limbic system, the [[hippocampus]] is important for [[explicit memory]], and for [[memory consolidation]]; it is also sensitive to stress hormones, and has a role in recording the emotions of a stressful event. The [[amygdala]] may be particularly important in assigning emotional values to sensory inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0272-7358(98)00037-3 | last1 = Zola | first1 = SM |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1998 | title = Memory, amnesia, and the issue of recovered memory: neurobiological aspects | url = | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 8| pages = 915–32 | pmid = 9885767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although memory distortion occurs in everyday life, the brain mechanisms involved are not easy to study in the laboratory, but [[neuroimaging]] techniques have recently been applied to this subject. In particular, there have recently been studies of false recognition, where individuals incorrectly claim to have encountered a novel object or event, and the results suggest that the hippocampus and several cortical regions may contribute to such false recognition, while the prefrontal cortex may be involved in retrieval monitoring that can limit the rate of false recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schacter | first1 = DL | last2 = Slotnick | first2 = SD |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2004 | title = The cognitive neuroscience of memory distortion | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 149–60 | pmid = 15450167 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.08.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amnesia===
[[Amnesia]] is partial or complete loss of memory that goes beyond mere forgetting. Often it is temporary and involves only part of a person's experience. Amnesia is often caused by an injury to the brain, for instance after a blow to the head, and sometimes by psychological trauma. [[Anterograde amnesia]] is a failure to remember new experiences that occur after damage to the brain; [[retrograde amnesia]] is the loss of memories of events that occurred before a trauma or injury. For a memory to become permanent (consolidated), there must be a persistent change in the strength of connections between particular neurons in the brain. Anterograde amnesia can occur because this consolidation process is disrupted; retrograde amnesia can result either from damage to the site of memory storage or from a disruption in the mechanisms by which memories can be retrieved from their stores. Many specific types of amnesia are recognized, including:
* [[Childhood amnesia]] is the normal inability to recall memories from the first three years of life. Sigmund Freud observed that not only do humans not remember anything from birth to three years, but they also have “spotty” recollection of anything occurring from three to seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Josselyn S. A. |author2=Frankland P. W. | year = 2012 | title = Infantile amnesia: A neurogenic hypothesis | url = | journal = Learning &amp; Memory | volume = 19 | issue = 9| pages = 423–433 | doi = 10.1101/lm.021311.110 | pmid=22904373}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various theories as to why this occurs: some believe that language development is important for efficient storage of long-term memories; others believe that early memories do not persist because the brain is still developing.
* A [[fugue state]], formally dissociative fugue, is a rare condition precipitated by a stressful episode. It is characterized by episode(s) of traveling away from home and creating a new identity.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, R. J. (1991).

Arlington, VA, US: American Psychiatric Association, Arlington, VA.&lt;/ref&gt;
The form of amnesia that is linked with recovered memories is dissociative amnesia (formerly known as psychogenic amnesia). This results from a psychological cause, not by direct damage to the brain, and is a loss of memory of significant personal information, usually about traumatic or extremely stressful events. Usually this is seen as a gap or gaps in recall for aspects of someone's life history, but with severe acute trauma, such as during wartime, there can be a sudden acute onset of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition: DSM-IV-TR® |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC |year=2000 |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of trauma on memory===

"Betrayal Trauma Theory" proposes that in cases of  childhood abuse, dissociative amnesia is an adaptive response, and that “victims may need to remain unaware of the trauma not to reduce suffering but rather to promote survival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | doi = 10.1207/s15327019eb0404_1  | last = Freyd| first =  J| year = 1994| title = Betrayal trauma: Traumatic amnesia as an adaptive response to childhood abuse  | journal = Ethics Behav  | volume = 4 | pages = 307–29| issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When stress interferes with memory, it is possible that some of the memory is kept by a system that records emotional experience, but there is no symbolic placement of it in time or space.&lt;ref name="Van der Kolk 1994 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Van der Kolk | first=B.A. | title=The Body Keeps the Score: Memory and the Evolving Psychobiology of Posttraumatic Stress | publisher=Harvard Medical School, Department of Psychiatry | year=1994 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOuUZwEACAAJ | access-date=7 August 2018 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Traumatic memories are retrieved, at least at first, in the form of dissociated mental imprints of the affective and sensory elements of the traumatic experience. Clients have reported the slow emergence of a personal narrative that can be considered explicit (conscious) memory.

Psychiatrist [[Bessel van der Kolk]]&lt;ref name=Van1995/&gt; divided the effects of traumas on memory functions into four sets:
* Traumatic amnesia; this involves the loss of memories of traumatic experiences. The younger the subject and the longer the traumatic event is, the greater the chance of significant amnesia. He stated that subsequent retrieval of memories after traumatic amnesia is well documented in the literature, with documented examples following natural disasters and accidents, in combat soldiers, in victims of kidnapping, torture and concentration camp experiences, in victims of physical and sexual abuse, and in people who have committed murder.
* Global [[Memory disorder|memory impairment]]; this makes it difficult for subjects to construct an accurate account of their present and past history.  "The combination of lack of autobiographical memory, continued dissociation and of meaning schemes that include victimization, helplessness and betrayal, is likely to make these individuals vulnerable to suggestion and to the construction of explanations for their trauma-related affects that may bear little relationship to the actual realities of their lives"
* [[Dissociation (psychology)|Dissociative processes]]; this refers to memories being stored as fragments and not as unitary wholes.
* Traumatic memories’ [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] organization. Not being able to integrate traumatic memories seems to be linked to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;Diagnostic symptoms of PTSD include reexperience such as flashbacks and nightmares, difficulty falling or staying asleep, feelings of panic or fear, depression, headache, and physiological symptoms including irregular heartbeat and diarrhoea. [http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfoforall/problems/posttraumaticstressdisorder/posttraumaticstressdisorder.aspx  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)]. The Royal College of Psychiatrists&lt;/ref&gt;

According to van der Kolk, memories of highly significant events are usually accurate and stable over time; aspects of traumatic experiences appear to get stuck in the mind, unaltered by time passing or experiences that may follow. The imprints of traumatic experiences appear to be different from those of nontraumatic events, perhaps because of alterations in attentional focusing or the fact that extreme emotional arousal interferes with  memory.&lt;ref name=Van1995/&gt; van der Kolk and Fisler's hypothesis is that under extreme stress, the memory categorization system based in the hippocampus fails, with these memories kept as emotional and sensory states.  When these traces are remembered and put into a personal narrative, they are subject to being condensed, contaminated and embellished upon.

When there is inadequate recovery time between stressful situations, alterations may occur to the [[stress response]] system, some of which may be irreversible, and cause pathological responses, which may include memory loss, learning deficits and other maladaptive symptoms. In animal studies, high levels of [[cortisol]] can cause hippocampal damage, which may cause short-term memory deficits; in humans, MRI studies have shown reduced hippocampal volumes in combat veterans with PTSD, adults with posttraumatic symptoms and survivors of repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse. Trauma may also interfere with implicit memory, where periods of avoidance may be interrupted by intrusive emotional occurrences with no story to guide them. A difficult issue is whether those presumably abused accurately recall their experiences.&lt;ref name=Bremner2002&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bremner| first =  JD| year = 2002| title = Does Stress Damage the Brain?

# Controversies regarding adult recollections should not be allowed to obscure the fact that child sexual abuse is a complex and pervasive problem in America that has historically gone unacknowledged;
# Most people who were sexually abused as children remember all or part of what happened to them;
# It is possible for memories of abuse that have been forgotten for a long time to be remembered;
# It is also possible to construct convincing pseudo-memories for events that never occurred; and
# There are gaps in our knowledge about the processes that lead to accurate and inaccurate recollections of childhood abuse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many critics believe that memories may be distorted and false. Psychologist [[Elizabeth Loftus]] questions the concept of repressed memories and the possibility of them being accurate. Loftus focuses on techniques that therapists use in order to help the patients recover their memory. Such techniques include age regression, guided visualization, trance writing, dream work, body work, and hypnosis.
Loftus' research indicates that repressed memory faces problems, such as memory alteration. In one case a teenage boy was able to “conjure a memory of an event that never occurred.” According to Loftus, if a stable person could be influenced to remember an event that never occurred, an emotionally stressed person would be even more susceptible.&lt;ref name=loftus1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftus|first=Elizabeth|title=The Reality of Repressed Memories|journal=American Psychologist|date=May 1993|volume=48|issue=1|pages=518–537|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.48.5.518|pmid=8507050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medico-legal issues===

Serious issues arise when recovered but false memories result in public allegations; false complaints carry serious consequences for the accused. Many of those who make false claims sincerely believe the truth of what they report. A special type of false allegation, the [[false memory syndrome]], arises typically within therapy, when people report the "recovery" of childhood memories of previously unknown abuse. The influence of practitioners' beliefs and practices in the eliciting of false "memories" and of false complaints has come under particular criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boakes | first1 = J |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1999 | title = False complaints of sexual assault: recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse | url = | journal = Med Sci Law | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 112–20 | pmid = 10332158 | doi = 10.1177/002580249903900205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally accepted that people sometimes are unable to recall traumatic experiences. An old version of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM-IV), published by the ''American Psychiatric Association'', states that "Dissociative amnesia is characterized by an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness."&lt;ref&gt;Section 300.12: [http://psych.org/MainMenu/Research/DSMIV.aspx DSM-IV] Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, American Psychiatric Association
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "recovered memory", however, is not listed in DSM-IV or used by any mainstream formal psychotherapy modality.&lt;ref name="whitfield56"&gt;{{cite book|title=Misinformation Concerning Child Sexual Abuse and Adult Survivors |last= Whitfield  |first=Charles L. |author2=Joyanna L.

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal state ===
Some criminal cases have been based on a witness's testimony of recovered repressed memories, often of alleged childhood sexual abuse. In some jurisdictions, the [[statute of limitations]] for child abuse cases has been extended to accommodate the phenomena of repressed memories as well as other factors.  The repressed memory concept came into wider public awareness in the 1980s and 1990s followed by a reduction of public attention after a series of scandals, lawsuits, and license revocations.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robbins, Susan P.|title= The Social and Cultural Context of Satanic Ritual Abuse Allegations|journal=Issues in Child Abuse Accusations|volume=10|year= 1998|url=http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume10/j10_8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. District Court accepted repressed memories as admissible evidence in a specific case.&lt;ref&gt;"The Validity of Recovered Memory: Decision of a US District Court" Judge Edward F.

The apparent willingness of courts to credit the recovered memories of complainants but not the absence of memories by defendants has been commented on: "It seems apparent that the courts need better guidelines around the issue of dissociative amnesia in both populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =10.1016/S0160-2527(00)00066-2 | author =Porter S |display-authors=etal | year = 2001 | title = Memory for murder.

In 1995, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in Franklin v. Duncan and Franklin v. Fox, Murray ''et al''. (312 F3d. 423, see also 884 FSupp 1435, N.D. Calif.),&lt;ref&gt;Franklin v. Duncan Court Order https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3066228776991890480&lt;/ref&gt; that repressed memory is not admissible as evidence in a legal action because of its unreliability, inconsistency, unscientific nature, tendency to be therapeutically induced evidence, and subject to influence by hearsay and suggestibility. The court overturned the conviction of a man accused of murdering a nine-year-old girl purely based upon the evidence of a 21-year-old repressed memory by a lone witness, who also held a complex personal grudge against the defendant.&lt;ref name="articles.sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-11-21/news/17820388_1_appeals-court-george-franklin-repressed-memory-testimony | work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] | first=Reynolds | last=Holding | title=Repressed Memory Case Ruling / Appeals court refuses to restore murder conviction | date=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victimsofthestate.org/CA/Franklin.htm "Victims of the State: George Franklin"].

In a 1996 ruling, a U.S. District Court allowed repressed memories entered into evidence in court cases.&lt;ref name=USCourt1996&gt;923 Federal Supplement 286 (D. Mass. 1996); Civil Action No. 92-12139-EFH Memorandum and Order; May 8, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Freyd writes that Ross Cheit's case of suddenly remembered sexual abuse is one of the most well-documented cases available for the public to see. Cheit prevailed in two lawsuits, located five additional victims and tape-recorded a confession.&lt;ref name=Freyd/&gt;

On December 16, 2005, the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal issued a certificate confirming a Miscarriage of Justice to a former nun, [[Nora Wall]] whose 1999 conviction for child rape was partly based on repressed-memory evidence. The judgement stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IECCA/2005/C140.html |title=D.P.P.-v- Nora Wall [2005&amp;#93; IECCA 140 (16 December 2005) |publisher=Bailii.org |accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was no scientific evidence of any sort adduced to explain the phenomenon of "flashbacks" and/or "retrieved memory", nor was the applicant in any position to meet such a case in the absence of prior notification thereof.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Self-esteem'''   reflects an individual's overall subjective emotional evaluation of their own worth. It is the decision made  by an individual as an attitude towards the self. Self-esteem encompasses [[beliefs]] about oneself, (for example, "I am competent", "I am worthy"), as well as [[emotion]]al states, such as [[wikt:triumph|triumph]], [[depression (mood)|despair]], [[pride]], and [[shame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hewitt |first=John P. |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=217–224 |isbn=978-0-19-518724-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith and Mackie (2007) defined it by saying "The [[self-concept]] is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it."&lt;ref name="SmithMackie"&gt;{{cite book |first=E.

Self-esteem is attractive as a social psychological construct because researchers have conceptualized it as an influential predictor of certain outcomes, such as academic achievement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=H.W.|title=Causal ordering of academic self-concept and academic achievement: A multiwave, longitudinal path analysis.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1990|volume=82|issue=4|pages=646–656|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.82.4.646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecuador"&gt;S.

==History==
The identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct is thought{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to have its origins in the work of philosopher and psychologist, geologist, anthropologist [[William James]] (1892).&lt;ref name="James1892"&gt;James, W. (1892). ''Psychology: The briefer course''. New York: Henry Holt.&lt;/ref&gt; James identified multiple dimensions of the self, with two levels of hierarchy: processes of knowing (called the 'I-self') and the resulting knowledge about the self (the 'Me-self'). Observation about the self and storage of those observations by the I-self create three types of knowledge, which collectively account for the Me-self, according to James. These are the material self, social self, and spiritual self. The social self comes closest to self-esteem, comprising all characteristics recognized by others. The material self consists of representations of the body and possessions, and the spiritual self of descriptive representations and evaluative dispositions regarding the self. This view of self-esteem as the collection of an individual's attitudes toward oneself remains today.&lt;ref name="James1892"/&gt;

In the mid-1960s, sociologist [[Morris Rosenberg]] defined self-esteem as a feeling of self-worth and developed the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale]] (RSES), which became the most-widely used scale to measure self-esteem in the social sciences.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterSmartBoden1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Baumeister |first= Roy F. |last2= Smart |first2= L. |last3= Boden |first3= J. |year= 1996 |title= Relation of threatened egotism to violence and aggression: The dark side of self-esteem |journal= [[Psychological Review]] |volume= 103 |issue= 1 |pages= 5–33 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295X.103.1.5 |pmid= 8650299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the [[Behaviorism | behaviorist movement]] minimized introspective study of mental processes, emotions and feelings, replacing introspection with  objective study through experiments on behaviors observed in relation with environment. [[Behaviorism]] viewed the human being as an animal subject to reinforcements, and suggested placing psychology as an experimental science, similar to chemistry or biology. As a consequence, clinical trials on self-esteem were overlooked, since behaviorists considered the idea less liable to rigorous measurement.&lt;ref name="Bonet"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=iTwVTnXcuBcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false José-Vicente Bonet. ''Sé amigo de ti mismo: manual de autoestima'']. 1997. Ed. Sal Terrae. Maliaño (Cantabria, España). {{ISBN|978-84-293-1133-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mid-20th century, the rise of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] and [[humanistic psychology]] led to renewed interest in self-esteem. Self-esteem then took a central role in personal [[self-actualization]] and in the treatment of psychic disorders. Psychologists started to consider the relationship between [[psychotherapy]] and the personal satisfaction of persons with high self-esteem as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.&lt;ref name="Bonet"/&gt;

In 1992 the [[political scientist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]] associated self-esteem with what [[Plato]] called [[thumos | ''thymos'']] - the "[[spiritedness]]" part of the [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul | Platonic soul]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{As of | 1997}} the [[core self-evaluations]] approach included self-esteem as one of four dimensions that comprise one's fundamental appraisal of oneself - along with locus of control, neuroticism, and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Judge1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Judge |first= T.

The importance of self-esteem gained endorsement from some government and non-government groups starting around the 1970s, such that one can speak of a self-esteem movement.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Nolan | first =  James L. | title = The Therapeutic State: Justifying Government at Century's End | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-dRzYK1GugC | accessdate = 2013-05-06 | year = 1998 | publisher = NYU Press | isbn = 9780814757918 | pages = 152–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement can be used{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} as an example of promising evidence that psychological research can have an effect on forming [[public policy]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} The underlying idea of the movement was that low self-esteem was the root of the problem for individuals, making it the root of societal problems and dysfunctions. A leading figure of the movement, psychologist [[Nathaniel Branden]], stated: "[I] cannot think of a single psychological problem – from anxiety and depression, to fear of intimacy or of success, to spouse battery or child molestation – that is not traced back to the problem of low self-esteem".&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

Self-esteem was believed{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to be a cultural phenomenon of [[Western Society | Western individualistic societies]] since low self-esteem was not found in [[collectivism | collectivist]] countries such as Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

Concern about low self-esteem and its many presumed negative consequences led California assemblyman [[John Vasconcellos]] to work to set up and fund the Task Force on Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility in California in 1986. Vasconcellos argued that this task force could combat many of the state's problems - from crime and teen pregnancy to school underachievement and pollution.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; He compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease: it could help protect people from being overwhelmed by [[personal life | life]]'s challenges.

The task force set up committees in many California counties and formed a committee of scholars to review the available literature on self-esteem. This committee found very small associations between low self-esteem and its assumed consequences, ultimately showing that low self-esteem is not the root of all societal problems and not as important as the committee had originally thought. However, the authors of the paper that summarized the review of the literature still believe that self-esteem is an independent variable that affects major social problems. The task force disbanded in 1995, and the National Council for Self-Esteem and later the [[National Association for Self-Esteem]] (NASE) was established,{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} taking on the task force's mission. Vasconcellos and [[Jack Canfield]] were members of its advisory board in 2003, and members of its Masters' Coalition included [[Anthony Robbins]], [[Bernie Siegel]], and [[Gloria Steinem]].&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;

== Theories ==
Many early theories suggested that self-esteem is a basic human need or motivation. American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] included self-esteem in his [[hierarchy of human needs]]. He described two different forms of "esteem": the need for respect from others in the form of recognition, success, and admiration, and the need for self-respect in the form of self-love, self-confidence, skill, or aptitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maslow |first=A. H. |year=1987 |title=Motivation and Personality |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-06-041987-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem. According to Maslow, without the fulfillment of the self-esteem need, individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain self-actualization. Maslow also states that the healthiest expression of self-esteem "is the one which manifests in respect we deserve for others, more than renown, fame and flattery".  Modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves. [[Sociometer]] theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one's level of status and acceptance in ones' social group. According to ''[[Terror Management Theory]]'', self-esteem serves a protective function and reduces anxiety about life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greenberg |first=J. |year=2008 |title=Understanding the vital human quest for self-esteem |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=48–55 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00061.x |pmid=26158669 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-esteem is important because it shows ourselves how we view the way we are and the sense of our personal value.  Thus, it affects the way we are and act in the world and the way we are related to everybody else.&lt;ref name="Bonet"/&gt;

[[Carl Rogers]] (1902-1987), an advocate of [[humanistic psychology]], theorized the origin of many people's problems to be that they despise themselves and consider themselves worthless and incapable of being loved. This is why Rogers believed in the importance of giving unconditional acceptance to a client and when this was done it could improve the client's self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Bonet"/&gt; In his therapy sessions with clients, he offered positive regard no matter what.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wickman S.A. |author2=Campbell C. | year = 2003 | title = An analysis of how Carl Rogers enacted client-centered conversation with Gloria | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 178–184 | doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2003.tb00239.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the concept of self-esteem is approached since then in humanistic psychology as an inalienable right for every person, summarized in the following sentence:

{{cquote|Every human being, with no exception, for the mere fact to be it, is worthy of unconditional respect of everybody else; he deserves to esteem himself and to be esteemed.&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt;}}

==Measurement==
Self-esteem is typically assessed using self-report inventories.

One of the most widely used instruments, the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale]] (RSES) is a 10-item self-esteem scale score that requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves. An alternative measure, The Coopersmith Inventory uses a 50-question battery over a variety of topics and asks subjects whether they rate someone as similar or dissimilar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/selfesteem.php#measurement|title=MacArthur SES &amp; Health Network - Research|website=Macses.ucsf.edu|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a subject's answers demonstrate solid self-regard, the scale regards them as well adjusted. If those answers reveal some inner shame, it considers them to be prone to social deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slater |first=Lauren |title=The Trouble With Self-Esteem |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 Feb 2002 |accessdate=27 Nov 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/03/magazine/the-trouble-with-self-esteem.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implicit measures of self-esteem began to be used in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bosson J.K. |author2=Swann W.B. |author3=Pennebaker J.W. | year = 2000 | title = Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited?. | url = | journal = Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 631–643 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.631}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rely on indirect measures of [[cognitive processing]] thought to be linked to [[implicit self-esteem]], including the [[Name letter effect|Name Letter Task]].&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L., &amp; Pelham, B. W. (2003). On the nature of implicit self-esteem: The case of the name letter effect. In S. Spencer, S. Fein, &amp; M. P. Zanna (Eds.), ''Motivated social perception: The Ontario Symposium'' (pp. 93–116). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, psychologists feature self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then measure how quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hetts J.J. |author2=Sakuma M. |author3=Pelham B.W. | year = 1999 | title = Two roads to positive regard: Implicit and explicit self-evaluation and culture | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 512–559 | doi=10.1006/jesp.1999.1391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother, psychologists would measure how quickly she identified the negative word, evil, or the positive word, kind.

== Development across lifespan ==
Experiences in a person's life are a major source of how self-esteem develops.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; In the early years of a child's life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have.&lt;ref name="Raboteg 2014" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Raboteg-Saric Z. |author2=Sakic M. | year = 2014 | title = Relations of parenting styles and friendship quality to self-esteem, life satisfaction, &amp; happiness in adolescents | url = | journal = Applied Research in the Quality of Life | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 749–765 | doi=10.1007/s11482-013-9268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected.

Although studies thus far have reported only a correlation of warm, supportive [[parenting styles]] (mainly authoritative and permissive) with children having high self-esteem, these parenting styles could easily be thought of as having some causal effect in self-esteem development.&lt;ref name="Raboteg 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coopersmith |first=S. |year=1967 |title=The Antecedents of Self-Esteem |location=New York |publisher=W.

During school-aged years, academic achievement is a significant contributor to self-esteem development.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; A student consistently achieving success or consistently failing will have a strong academic effect on their individual self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crocker |first=J. |last2=Sommers |first2=S.

As children go through school, they begin to understand and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates. Using social comparisons, children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities.

Adolescence shows an increase in self-esteem that continues to increase in young adulthood and middle age.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; A decrease is seen from middle age to old age with varying findings on whether it is a small or large decrease.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; Reasons for the variability could be because of differences in health, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic status in old age.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; No differences have been found between males and females in their development of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; Multiple cohort studies show that there is not a difference in the life-span trajectory of self-esteem between generations due to societal changes such as grade inflation in education or the presence of [[social media]].&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt;

High levels of mastery, low risk taking, and better health are ways to predict higher self-esteem. In terms of personality, emotionally stable, extroverted, and conscientious individuals experience higher self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; These predictors have shown us that self-esteem has trait-like qualities by remaining stable over time like personality and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt;  However, this does not mean it can not be changed.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; Hispanic adolescents have a slightly lower self-esteem than their black and white peers, but then slightly higher levels by age 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erol |first=R.

Shame can be a contributor to those with problems of low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehrenreich|first1=Barbara|title=Patterns for college Writing|date=January 2007|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|page=680|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings of shame usually occur because of a situation where the social self is devalued, such as a socially evaluated poor performance.

===Real self, ideal self, and dreaded self===
There are three levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the real self, ideal self, and the dreaded self. The real, ideal, and dreaded selves develop in children in a sequential pattern on cognitive levels.&lt;ref name="self-evaluation"&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. Clark |last=Power |first2=Vladimir T. |last2=Khmelkov |title=Character development and self-esteem: Psychological foundations and educational implications |journal=International Journal of Educational Research |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=539–551 |doi=10.1016/S0883-0355(97)00053-0 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Moral Judgment Stages: Individuals describe their Real, Ideal, and Dreaded Selves with stereotypical labels, such as "nice" or "bad". Individuals describe their Ideal and Real Selves in terms of disposition for action or as behavioral habits. The Dreaded Self is often described as being unsuccessful or as having bad habits. 
#Ego Development Stages: Individuals describe their Ideal and Real Selves in terms of traits that are based in attitudes as well as actions. The Dreaded Self is often described as having failed to meet social expectations or as self-centered.
#Self-Understanding Stages: Individuals describe their Ideal and Real Selves as having a unified identity or character. Descriptions of the Dreaded Self focus on a failure to live up to one's ideals or role expectations often because of real world problems. 
This development brings with it increasingly complicated and encompassing moral demands. Level 3 is where individuals' self-esteem can suffer because they do not feel as though they are living up to certain expectations. This feeling will moderately effect one's self-esteem with an even larger effect seen when individuals believe they are becoming their Dreaded Self&lt;ref name="self-evaluation"/&gt;

=== Secure vs. Defensive ===

A person can have a high self-esteem and hold it confidently where they do not need reassurance from others to maintain their positive self view, whereas others with defensive, high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the Rosenberg Scale, as all high self-esteem individuals do; however, their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism. Defensive high self-esteem individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities, causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual's self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=C.

=== Implicit, explicit, narcissism and threatened egotism ===

[[Implicit self-esteem]] refers to a person's disposition to evaluate themselves positively or negatively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with [[explicit self-esteem]], which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit self-esteem and implicit self-esteem are subtypes of self-esteem proper.

[[Narcissism]] is a disposition people may have that represents an excessive love for one's self. It is characterized by an inflated view of self-worth. Individuals who score high on Narcissism measures, Robert Raskin's ''40 Item True or False Test'', would likely select true to such statements as "If I ruled the world, it would be a much better place."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Krahe, ''The Social Psychology of Aggression'' (Psychology Press, 2013), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only a moderate correlation between narcissism and self-esteem;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sedikieds |first=C. |last2=Rudich |first2=E.

Threatened [[egotism]] is characterized as a response to criticism that threatens the ego of narcissists; they often react in a hostile and aggressive manner.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterSmartBoden1996" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morf |first=C.

=== Low ===

Low self-esteem can result from various factors, including genetic factors, physical appearance or weight, mental health issues, socioeconomic status, significant emotional experiences, [[peer pressure]] or [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jones FC |title=Low self esteem |newspaper=Chicago Defender|pages=33|year=2003 |ISSN=0745-7014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person with low self-esteem may show some of the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adapted, Gill J | year = | title = Indispensable Self-Esteem | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with low self-esteem tend to be critical of themselves. Some depend on the approval and praise of others when evaluating self-worth. Others may measure their likability in terms of successes: others will accept themselves if they succeed but will not if they fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldwin |first=M.

=== The three states ===
This classification proposed by Martin Ross&lt;ref name="Ross, Martín 2013"&gt;Ross, Martín. El Mapa de la Autoestima. 2013. Dunken. {{ISBN|978-987-02-6773-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes three states of self-esteem compared to the "feats" ([[wikt:triumph|triumph]]s, [[honor]]s, [[virtue]]s) and the "anti-feats" ([[wikt:defeat|defeat]]s, [[embarrassment]], [[shame]], etc.) of the individuals.&lt;ref name="ecuador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Autoestima género"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos104/como-influye-genero-autoestima-adolescentes/como-influye-genero-autoestima-adolescentes.shtml|title=Como influye el genero en la Autoestima de los Adolescentes - Monografias.com|first=Darcy Leiva,|last=Monografias.com|website=Monografias.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shattered ====
The individual does not regard themselves as valuable or lovable. They may be overwhelmed by defeat, or shame, or see themselves as such, and they name their "anti-feat". For example, if they consider that being over a certain age is an anti-feat, they define themselves with the name of their anti-feat, and say, "I am old". They express actions and feelings such as pity, insulting themselves, and they may become paralyzed by their sadness.&lt;ref name="Ross, Martín 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"&gt;“Feedback between self-esteem and digital activity in the adolescent group.” Bonet Gallardo, L. Huertas Bailén, Amparo. Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona. 2015 Online at http://ddd.uab.cat/record/142342?ln=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vulnerable ====
The individual has a generally positive self-image. However, their self-esteem is also vulnerable to the perceived risk of an imminent anti-feat (such as defeat, embarrassment, shame, discredit), consequently they are often nervous and regularly use defense mechanisms.&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt; A typical protection mechanism of those with a Vulnerable Self-Esteem may consist in avoiding decision-making.  Although such individuals may outwardly exhibit great self-confidence, the underlying reality may be just the opposite: the apparent [[self-confidence]] is indicative of their heightened fear of anti-feats and the fragility of their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="ecuador"/&gt; They may also try to blame others to protect their self-image from situations which would threaten it. They may employ defense mechanisms, including attempting to lose at games and other competitions in order to protect their self-image by publicly dissociating themselves from a 'need to win', and asserting an independence from social acceptance which they may deeply desire. In this deep fear of being unaccepted by an individual's peers, they make poor life choices by making risky choices.&lt;ref name="Autoestima género"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;

==== Strong ====
People with strong self-esteem have a positive [[self-image]] and enough strength so that anti-feats do not subdue their self-esteem. They have less fear of failure. These individuals appear humble, cheerful, and this shows a certain strength not to boast about feats and not to be afraid of anti-feats.&lt;ref name="Autoestima género"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;
They are capable of fighting with all their might to achieve their goals because, if things go wrong, their self-esteem will not be affected.  They can acknowledge their own mistakes precisely because their self-image is strong, and this acknowledgment will not impair or affect their self-image.&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt; They live with less fear of losing social prestige, and with more happiness and general well-being.&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;
However, no type of self-esteem is indestructible,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and due to certain situations or circumstances in life, one can fall from this level into any other state of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ross, Martín 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;

=== Contingent vs. non-contingent ===
A distinction is made between contingent (or conditional&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/contingent|title=Contingent Synonyms, Contingent Antonyms - Thesaurus.com|website=thesaurus.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  and non-contingent (or unconditional&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/unconditional|title=Unconditional|accessdate=11 December 2017|publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) self-esteem.

'''Contingent self-esteem''' is derived from external sources, such as (a) what others say, (b) one's success or failure, (c) one's competence,&lt;ref name="Koivula-et-al-2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Koivula | first = Nathalie  | last2 = Hassmén | first2 = Peter  | last3 = Fallby | first3 = Johan  | title = Self-esteem and perfectionism in elite athletes: effects on competitive anxiety and self-confidence  | journal = Personality and Individual Differences  | volume = 32 | issue = 5  | year = 2002  | pages = 865–875  | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(01)00092-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or (d) [[relationship-contingent self-esteem]].

Therefore, contingent self-esteem is marked by instability, unreliability, and vulnerability. Persons lacking a non-contingent self-esteem are "predisposed to an incessant pursuit of self-value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Victoria Blom|title="Striving for Self-esteem" (Department of Psychology, Stockholm University, 2011)|page=17|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:406035/FULLTEXT01.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the pursuit of contingent self-esteem is based on receiving approval, it is doomed to fail. No one receives constant approval and disapproval often evokes depression. Furthermore, fear of disapproval inhibits activities in which failure is possible.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201112/the-boom-and-bust-ego|title=The Boom and Bust Ego|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the Pauline-Lutheran doctrine of 'justification by faith.'" [[Paul Tillich]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Terry Lectures: Courage to Be'' (Yale University, 2000) 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
'''Non-contingent self-esteem''' is described as true, stable, and solid.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Mruk, ''Self-esteem Research, Theory, and Practice'' (Springer, 1995), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; It springs from a belief that one is "acceptable period, acceptable before life itself, ontologically acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;Terry D. Cooper, ''Paul Tillich and Psychology: Historic and Contemporary Explorations in Theology, Psychotherapy, and Ethics'' (Mercer University,2006). 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief that one is "ontologically acceptable" is to believe that one's acceptability is "the way things ''be'' without contingency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpcc.org.uk/includes/articles/selfesteem.pdf|format=PDF|title=Self-esteem/OKness: a personal story|website=Ahpcc.org.uk|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief, as expounded by theologian [[Paul Tillich]], acceptability is not based on a person's virtue. It is an acceptance given "''in spite of our guilt'', not because we ''have no guilt''".&lt;ref&gt;Terry D. Cooper, ''Paul Tillich and Psychology: Historic and Contemporary Explorations in Theology, Psychotherapy, and Ethics'' (Mercer University,2006). 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Thomas A Harris]] drew on theologian Paul Tillich for his classic [[I'm OK, You're OK|''I'm OK – You're OK'']] that addresses non-contingent self-esteem. Harris translated Tillich's "acceptable" by the vernacular "OK", a term that means "acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/OK|title=OK|accessdate=11 December 2017|publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian message, said Harris, is not "YOU CAN BE OK, IF", It is "YOU ARE ACCEPTED, unconditionally".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Harris, ''I'm OK — You're OK'' (Harper and Row), 1969, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

A secure non-contingent self-esteem springs from the belief that one is ontologically acceptable and accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/jackbauer/PGSG/Kernis%2003%20opt%20s-esteem%20authenticity%20copy.pdf|format=PDF|title=Toward a Conceptualization of Optimal Self-Esteem|author=Michael H.

==Importance==
[[Abraham Maslow]] states that psychological health is not possible unless the essential core of the person is fundamentally accepted, loved and respected by others and by her or his self. Self-esteem allows people to face life with more confidence, benevolence and optimism, and thus easily reach their goals and self-actualize.&lt;ref name="Branden"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=psvHFOqRuhkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nathaniel Branden. ''Cómo mejorar su autoestima'']. 1987. Versión traducida: 1990. 1ª edición en formato electrónico: enero de 2010. Ediciones Paidós Ibérica. {{ISBN|978-84-493-2347-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-esteem may make people convinced they deserve happiness.&lt;ref name="Branden" /&gt; Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since the development of positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones.&lt;ref name="Branden" /&gt; For [[Erich Fromm]], love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those who are capable of loving others. Self-esteem allows creativity at the workplace, and is a specially critical condition for [[teaching]] professions.&lt;ref name="Miranda"&gt;Christian Miranda. [http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/pdf/551/55130179.pdf La autoestima profesional: una competencia mediadora para la innovación en las prácticas pedagógicas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722230252/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/pdf/551/55130179.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}.

José-Vicente Bonet claims that the importance of self-esteem is obvious as a lack of self-esteem is, he says, not a loss of esteem from others, but self-rejection. Bonet claims that this corresponds to [[Major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt; [[Freud]] also claimed that the depressive has suffered "an extraordinary diminution in his self-regard, an impoverishment of his ego on a grand scale....He has lost his self-respect".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 254-6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on [[international human rights law]] addresses the discriminatory attitude toward [[LGBT]] peoples that makes their self-esteem low to be subject to human rights violation including [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], Preamble and Principles 11&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Health Organization]] recommends in "Preventing Suicide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=World Health Organization|title=Preventing suicide: A global imperative|journal=World Health Organization - Mental Health|date=2014|pages=92|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/world_report_2014/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;" published in 2000 that strengthening students' self-esteem is important to protect children and adolescents against mental distress and despondency, enabling them to cope adequately with difficult and stressful life situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_hearth/media/en/62.pdf|title=Preventing Suicide, A resource for teachers and other school staff, WHO, Geneva, 2000|website=who.int|accessdate=22 October 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; How this might be done, and whether it would be effective is unclear.

Other than increased happiness, higher self-esteem is also known to be correlated with a better ability to cope with stress and a higher likeliness that the individual takes on difficult tasks relative to those with low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |first2=Daniel T. |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel M. |last3=Wegner |chapter=Self Esteem |title=Psychology |location=New York |publisher=Worth |year=2009 |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-7167-5215-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Correlates ===

From the late 1970s to the early 1990s many Americans assumed as a matter of course that students' self-esteem acted as a critical factor in the grades that they earn in school, in their [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with their peers, and in their later success in life. Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.

Peer-reviewed research undertaken since then has not validated previous assumptions. Recent research indicates that inflating students' self-esteem in and of itself has no positive effect on grades. [[Roy Baumeister]] has shown that inflating self-esteem by itself can actually decrease grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|author2=Jennifer D. Campbell, Joachim I.

It simply means that high self-esteem may be accomplished as a result of high academic performance due to the other variables of social interactions and life events affecting this performance.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister|first1=R.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Attempts by pro-esteem advocates to encourage self-pride in students solely by reason of their uniqueness as human beings will fail if feelings of well-being are not accompanied by well-doing. It is only when students engage in personally meaningful endeavors for which they can be justifiably proud that self-confidence grows, and it is this growing self-assurance that in turn triggers further achievement."&lt;ref&gt;Reasoner, Robert W.

High self-esteem has a high correlation to self-reported happiness; whether this is a causal relationship has not been established.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; The relationship between self-esteem and [[life satisfaction]] is stronger in individualistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/~w3psyuli/PReprints/JRP_IESE_SWB.pdf | title=Predictive validity of explicit and implicit self-esteem for subjective well-being | author=Ulrich Schimmack and Ed Diener | journal=Journal of Research in Personality | year=2003 | volume=37 | issue=2 | pages=100–106 | doi=10.1016/S0092-6566(02)00532-9}}&lt;!--page 101 mentions two studies that demonstrate this--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, self-esteem has been found to be related to forgiveness in close relationships, in that people with high self-esteem will be more forgiving than people with low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="EatonWardstruthers2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=J|last2=Wardstruthers|first2=C|last3=Santelli|first3=A|title=Dispositional and state forgiveness: The role of self-esteem, need for structure, and narcissism|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=41|issue=2|year=2006|pages=371–380|issn=0191-8869|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High self-esteem does not prevent children from smoking, drinking, taking drugs, or engaging in early sex.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; One important exception is that high self-esteem reduces the chances of bulimia in females.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;

== Neuroscience ==
In a 2014 research conducted by Robert S. Chavez and Todd F. Heatherton, it was found that self-esteem is related to the connectivity of the [[frontostriatal circuit]]. The frontostriatal pathway connects the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], which deals with [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], to the [[ventral striatum]], which deals with feelings of [[motivation]] and [[Reward system|reward]]. Stronger anatomical pathways are correlated with higher long-term self-esteem, while stronger functional connectivity is correlated with higher short-term self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/15/scan.nsu063.abstract?sid=47d08b42-0aa2-4f71-a058-1b2e69810145 | title=Multimodal frontostriatal connectivity underlies individual differences in self-esteem | publisher=''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience''.

== Criticism and controversy ==

The American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] criticized on numerous occasions the concept of self-esteem as essentially self-defeating and ultimately destructive.&lt;ref name="Ellis, A. 2001"&gt;Ellis, A. (2001). Feeling better, getting better, staying better. Impact Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Although acknowledging the human propensity and tendency to ego rating as innate, he has critiqued the philosophy of self-esteem as unrealistic, illogical and self- and socially destructive – often doing more harm than good. Questioning the foundations and usefulness of generalized ego strength, he has claimed that self-esteem is based on arbitrary definitional [[premise]]s, and over-generalized, perfectionistic and grandiose thinking.&lt;ref name="Ellis, A. 2001" /&gt; Acknowledging that rating and valuing behaviours and characteristics is functional and even necessary, he sees rating and valuing human beings' totality and total selves as irrational and unethical. The healthier alternative to self-esteem according to him is unconditional [[self-acceptance]] and unconditional other-[[acceptance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=A. |title=The Myth of Self-esteem |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-59102-354-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]'' is a psychotherapy based on this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPeFALg673MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: Second Edition|first1=Albert Ellis|last1=PhD|first2=Windy Dryden|last2=PhD|date=31 July 2007|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|accessdate=11 December 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

: "There seem to be only two clearly demonstrated benefits of high self-esteem....First, it increases initiative, probably because it lends confidence. People with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs, to stand up for what they believe in, to approach others, to risk new undertakings. (This unfortunately includes being extra willing to do stupid or destructive things, even when everyone else advises against them.)...It can also lead people to ignore sensible advice as they stubbornly keep wasting time and money on hopeless causes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumeister |last2=Tierney |year=2011 |title=Willpower: The Greatest's Human Strength |location= |publisher= |page=192 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False attempts ===
For persons with low self-esteem, any positive stimulus will temporarily raise self-esteem. Therefore, possessions, sex, success, or physical appearance will produce development of self-esteem, but the development is ephemeral at best.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Branden, ''The Six Pillars of Self-esteem'' (Bantam, 1995), 52. Also see Nathaniel Branden, ''How to Raise Your Self-Esteem: The Proven Action-Oriented Approach to Greater Self-Respect and Self-Confidence'' (Random House, 1988), 9. Spanish edition: ''Cómo mejorar su autoestima'' (Paidos, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such attempts to raise one's self-esteem by positive stimulus produce a "boom or bust" pattern. "Compliments and positive feedback" produce a boost, but a bust follows a lack of such feedback. For a person whose "self-esteem is contingent", success is "not extra sweet", but "failure is extra bitter".&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

=== As narcissism ===

Life satisfaction, happiness, healthy behavioral practices, [[Self-efficacy|perceived efficacy]], and academic success and adjustment have been associated with having high levels of self-esteem (Harter, 1987; Huebner, 1991; Lipschitz-Elhawi &amp; Itzhaky, 2005; Rumberger 1995; Swenson &amp; Prelow, 2005; Yarcheski &amp; Mahon, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Michaels |first=M. |last2=Barr |first2=A. |last3=Roosa |first3=M. |last4=Knight |first4=G. |year=2007 |title=Self-Esteem: Assessing Measurement Equivalence in a Multiethnic Sample of Youth |journal=Journal of Early Adolescence |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=269–295 |doi=10.1177/0272431607302009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|270}} However, a common mistake is to think that [[self-love|loving oneself]] is necessarily equivalent to narcissism, as opposed for example to what [[Erik Erikson]] speaks of as "a post-narcissistic love of the ego".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Erik H. |last=Erikson |title=[[Childhood and Society]] |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |year=1973 |page=260 |isbn=0-14-020754-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person with a healthy self-esteem accepts and loves himself/herself unconditionally, acknowledging both virtues and faults in the self, and yet, in spite of everything, is able to continue to love her/himself.

In narcissists, by contrast, an " uncertainty about their own worth gives rise to...a self-protective, but often totally spurious, aura of [[grandiosity]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Crompton |title=All about Me |location=London |publisher=Collins |year=2007 |page=16 |isbn=978-0-00-724795-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– producing the class "of narcissists, or people with very high, but insecure, self-esteem... fluctuating with each new episode of social praise or rejection."&lt;ref name="SmithMackie" /&gt;{{rp|479}} Narcissism can thus be seen as a symptom of fundamentally low self-esteem, that is, lack of love towards oneself, but often accompanied by "an immense increase in self-esteem" based on "the [[defense mechanism]] of denial by overcompensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Fenichel |title=The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis |location=London |publisher= |year=1946 |pages=407–410 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"idealized love of self...rejected the part of him" that he denigrates&amp;nbsp;– "this destructive little child"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Neville |last=Symington |title=Narcissism: A New Theory |location=London |publisher=Karmac |year=2003 |page=114 |isbn=1-85575-047-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; within. Instead, the narcissist emphasizes his virtues in the presence of others, just to try to convince himself that he is a valuable person and to try to stop feeling ashamed for his faults;&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt; unfortunately such "people with unrealistically inflated self-views, which may be especially unstable and highly vulnerable to negative information,...tend to have poor social skills."&lt;ref name="SmithMackie" /&gt;{{rp|126}}

'''References to [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]]''' have appeared in a wide variety of circumstances. In some cases, other authors have explored the Laws in a serious fashion. Other references, like those made in the [[satire|satirical]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'', are clearly [[parody|parodic]].

==Print media==
* The [[satire|satirical]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' published an article entitled "I, Rowboat" as a [[pun]] on Asimov's ''I, Robot,'' in which an anthropomorphic [[Rowboat]] gives a speech parodying much of the [[angst]] experienced by robots in Asimov's fiction, including a statement of the "Three Laws of Rowboatics":
:# A Rowboat may not immerse a human being or, through lack of flotation, allow a human to come to harm.
:# A Rowboat must obey all commands and steering input given by its human owner, except where such input would conflict with the First Law.
:# A Rowboat must preserve its own flotation as long as such preservation does not conflict with the First or Second Law.&lt;ref name="rowboat"&gt;"[http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-rowboat,10875/ I, Rowboat]".  ''[[The Onion]]'' 29 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[J. L. Patterson]] in an illustration to an article on Asimov in [[Damon Knight]]'s ''In Search of Wonder'' (2nd ed., 1967) added the following Laws: "4. A robot must behave at science fiction conventions, as long as such behavior does not conflict with the first Three Laws. 5. A robot must sell like mad."
* The novel "Mirror Friend, Mirror Foe" by [[Robert Asprin]] and [[George Takei]] refers to the First Law as being included in any robot's programming. That is one of the few cases in fiction when the law is named fully (Asimov’s First Law of Robotics).
* [[Lester del Rey]] refers to the laws as "The Three Laws of Asenion's Robots" in his 1966 short story "A Code for Sam." In the story, the laws found in old science fiction stories is used as the basis for an experimental code of ethics for robots.
* [[Terry Pratchett]]'s early SF novel ''[[The Dark Side of the Sun]]'' (1976) gives a glimpse of the possible future development of the Laws: in one scene, a robot explains that it is permitted to use minimum necessary force against humans if directly ordered to do so, and cites the "Eleventh Law of Robotics, Clause C, As Amended". In a further nod to Asimov, the robot is named Isaac. In his later novel ''[[Going Postal]]'' (2004), the protagonist [[Moist von Lipwig]], upon being told that he will be killed by a [[Golems (Discworld)|golem]] should he commit another crime, exclaims that that is impossible, because everyone knows "a golem mustn't harm a human being or allow a human being to come to harm".  However, he is informed that the rule continues "... unless ordered to do so by duly constituted authority."
* [[Roland Charles Wagner]] wrote a short story, ''[[Three Laws of Robotic Sexuality]]'' (1982), which treated the use of robots for sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Roland Charles. "[http://noosfere.com/heberg/rcw/extraits/3laws.htm Three Laws of Robotic Sexuality]".&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Sladek]]'s [[parody|parodic]] short story "Broot Force" (supposedly written by "I-Click As-I-Move") concerns a group of Asimov-style robots whose actions are constrained by the "Three Laws of Robish", which are "coincidentally" identical to Asimov's laws. The robots in Sladek's story all manage to find logical loopholes in the Three Laws, usually with bloody results. Sladek later wrote a novel, ''[[Tik-Tok (novel)|Tik-Tok]]'' (1983), in which a robot discovers that his so-called "asimov circuits" are not restraining his behavior at all, making him in effect a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]; he comes to doubt whether "asimov circuits" are even technically possible, deciding that they are simply a pseudo-religious belief held by robots. Sladek also made use of the Three Laws in his satirical sci-fi novel [[Roderick (novel)|''Roderick'']] (1980), where the first self-aware robot on earth is constantly met with patronizing disbelief that he actually is a robot, and is schooled as a normal, albeit "schizophrenic" human child. The school priest, harboring a knack for philosophical sci-fi, tries to "cure" Roderick of his "dillusion" of being a robot by having him read Asimov. Roderick responds by verbosely pointing out the various logical inconsistencies in the Three Laws and Asimov's overall work, and ultimately drives the priest insane.
* [[Lyuben Dilov]] introduced a Fourth Law in his novel ''Icarus's Way'' (original title: ''Пътят на Икар''): "A robot must always reveal itself as a robot."
* [[Nikola Kesarovski]] introduced a Fifth Law in his short story "The Fifth Law" (original title: ''Петият закон''): "A robot must know it is a robot". In the novel, the Fifth Law originated as a result of a murder: a humaniform robot, itself not knowing the fact it was a robot, embraced a human being so strongly that the human's ribcage was crushed, resulting in the human's death. In other words, the robot did not know and could not measure its own physical strength. Similarly, in [[David Langford]]'s [[Lensmen]] parody ''Sex Pirates of the Blood Asteroid'', reprinted in ''[[He Do the Time Police in Different Voices]]'', the protagonist met a "Vomisa" robot who had "not been instructed as to the meaning of the word 'injure'".
*[[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] wrote a story "The Fourth Law of Robotics" in the collection ''Foundation's Friends'' of Asimov pastiches by other science fiction authors. Intentionally much more irreverent in tone than Asimov's own stories, it describes robots becoming increasingly lifelike and therefore developing an urge beyond the Three Laws common to all living things &amp;mdash; the desire to [[reproduction|reproduce]].
* Roger Williams's 1994 novel ''[[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]'' deals with conflicts between the imperatives of the laws caused when a [[technological singularity]] is caused by an omnipotent artificial intelligence that is bound by them. Given that Prime Intellect is able to transmute the entire universe into a form whereby it can manipulate the laws of physics at will, it is bound only by Asimov's laws and thus cannot allow the death of any humans according to the First Law; this leads to [[immortality]] for all humans. Prime Intellect represents an extreme ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' interpretation of the laws with dire consequences.
* [[Cory Doctorow]]'s short story, "I, Robot", acts as a criticism of the underlying worldview Doctorow believes to be inherent in Asimov's robot stories, attacking the idea of creating a universal engineering standard for all robots enforced by a single robot-producing corporation. The story portrays a [[police state]] where all technological innovation is controlled by the government, the only scenario in which Doctorow considered a universal, unquestioned application of a standard as strict as the Three Laws to be realistic. In the story, Asenion robots created by the U.S. Robotics corporation (here an arm of a fascist government) are shown to be clearly inferior to the freely evolving and developing robots of another nation where technological innovation is unconstrained by law.
* In [[Alastair Reynolds]]'s novel ''[[Century Rain]]'', robots may or may not follow Asimov's rules. Those that are programmed to follow said rules are said to be "Asimov Compliant". Depending on their function, non-compliant robots are sometimes marked with a crossed-out A to warn humans that they are "most certainly ''not'' Asimov-compliant".
* In [[Cory Doctorow]]'s short story, "I, Row-Boat", the three laws are the commandments of a robot religion (Asimovism).
* Upon occasion, Asimov himself poked fun at his Laws. In "[[Risk (Asimov)|Risk]]", Gerald Black parodies the Three Laws to describe [[Susan Calvin]]'s behavior:
# Thou shalt protect the robot with all thy might and all thy heart and all thy soul.
# Thou shalt hold the interests of [[US Robots and Mechanical Men]], Inc. holy provided it interfereth not with the First Law.
# Thou shalt give passing consideration to a human being provided it interfereth not with the First and Second Laws.

* In the [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]] novel, ''[[A Million Open Doors]]'', a scene refers to an artificial intelligence unit being "Asimoved" indicating that the AI unit refused to aid a human's attempt to break the law (in this case an illegal data penetration of another computer).
*[[Charles Stross]]'s novel ''[[Saturn's Children (Stross novel)|Saturn's Children]]'' features an android society based on the Three Laws of Robotics struggling to survive after an incident kills off all human life. The Three Laws are listed at the front of the novel.
*The short story "Midnight in the Heart of Midlothian" published as part of [[Halo Evolutions]] features an AI called Mo Ye that is explicitly shown to be bound by Azimov's Laws of Robotics. As such, she was unable to self-destruct to prevent the enemy from capturing the ship due to the fact that a living human was on board. After the human's death at the hands of the aliens, she was able to self-destruct and prevent the aliens from discovering the location of Earth.
* [[Jack Williamson]] wrote a short story entitled "[[With Folded Hands]]" (which later became the precursor of several other stories in the same universe) that addresses the question of what happens when "allow a human being to come to harm" is taken to the utmost. In the story, robots refuse to allow humans to engage in dangerous activities, starting with risky sports like skydiving and mountaineering and later progressing through driving one's own car and thence to eating less-than-optimally-healthy diets.
* In the novelization of the movie ''Futureworld'' one of the characters points out "The Laws are only there if whoever builds them puts them there."

==Movies and television==
* The long-running British SF television show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' featured a four-part serial in 1977 titled "[[The Robots of Death]]". The titular robots were controlled by three laws, taken almost verbatim from Asimov. The story plays out much like the [[Elijah Baley]] mysteries, in which a murder has been committed, and a robot seems to have been directly or indirectly involved (contrary to the requirements of three-law programming).  It is later revealed that a robotic genius, Taran Kapel, has reprogramed the robots bypassing the three laws.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* The long-running British SF television show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' also featured the Movellans in the 1979 four-part serial [[Destiny of the Daleks]] who are revealed to be a race of robots who are quite willing to use a device that will kill all life (even human life) on Skaro and one of them is willing to manually activate the device.(''what connection to the three laws?'')
* Another episode of the long-running British SF television show ''[[Doctor Who]]'', entitled "Robot", explores implications of a robot programmed with a modified zeroth law instead of the first law as part of its Prime Directive.
* In the 1979 movie ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', Special Order 937 was a classified retrieval order given by Weyland-Yutani to Science Officer Ash (who is later revealed to be an android) aboard the USCSS Nostromo, in which all other priorities are rescinded, which would have overridden protective protocols allowing the android to kill the crew. Actor Ian Holm’s depiction of Ash leaves the possibility open for a version of the first law to exist as his attack on Ripley (though violent) is erratic and fitful as if he were fighting off strong inhibitions.  It is also preceded by “sweating” white liquid even though the white liquid is later depicted as only leaking after an android that has been injured or damaged in some way.
* In the 1986 movie ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', the character Bishop (an android) says, "It is impossible for me to harm, or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being."  No mention of either of the other laws is made.
* In the 1984 movie ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'', the character Bud talks about the "Repo Code", a parody of the Three Laws. "I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm..." The character J. Frank Parnell in the movie also resembles Asimov.
* In the 1987 film ''[[RoboCop]]'', the [[cyborg]] police officer had been programmed to follow four prime directives which guided and limited his actions&amp;mdash;though not always in a positive manner.

:#Serve the public trust
:#Protect the innocent
:#Uphold the law
:#'''''Classified''''' (eventually revealed to be "Any attempt to arrest a senior [[RoboCop (franchise)|OCP]] officer results in shutdown")

* In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[The Measure of a Man (Star Trek: The Next Generation)]]", which aired on 13 February 1989, [[Data (Star Trek)|Lieutenant Commander Data]], an android, has his sentience and, consequently, his rights as an individual, challenged.  Throughout the run of this series, Data is identified as a positronic android, and Asimov is even mentioned by name in the episode "[[Datalore]]".  While Data routinely references his "ethical subroutines", indicating some sort of moral guide, it is unclear whether Data is explicitly bound by the Three Laws. For example, the episode "[[Clues (TNG episode)|Clues]]" explored Data's capacity to lie to the crew in order to protect them from aliens, and the episode "[[The Most Toys (TNG episode)|The Most Toys]]" explored Data's supposed inability to murder in cold blood.
* In the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[I, D'oh-Bot]]", which first aired 11 January 2004, [[Professor Frink]] builds a robot which obeys the First Law (and presumably the other two, although they do not directly come into play).
* The 2009 [[anime]] series (released in 2010 as a film) ''[[Time of Eve]]'' is based heavily around the applications of these rules to androids, which are frequently discussed by the characters. The series explores out some various interpretations of the laws (such as what it means to allow a human to come to harm), and various loopholes that lead to one or more laws being broken under certain circumstances.
* In 1999's ''[[Bicentennial Man]]'', the theatrical version of Asimov's novella of the same name, Andrew Martin, the android played by [[Robin Williams]], presents the Three Laws to its new family using a holographic display emanating from a projector in its head.
* The 2004 theatrical version of ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' explores at length the Three Laws.
* In the episode "[[Phoenix Rising (Babylon 5)|Phoenix Rising]]" of ''[[Babylon 5]]'', Alfred Bester telepathically programs Garibaldi, a human, with a variation of Asimov's laws of robotics, preventing Garibaldi from harming Bester.
* In the episode "[[The Fuzzy Boots Corollary (The Big Bang Theory)|The Fuzzy Boots Corollary]]" of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]],'' Wolowitz, Sheldon, and Raj discuss the possibility that Sheldon is a robot by questioning his history of following Asimov's laws of robotics.  (They do not mention the Second Law which would have ended their deliberations abruptly, given Sheldon's frequent unwillingness to follow the orders of others.)
* In the second season of the 1979 ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'', the two major robots in the series, [[Twiki (robot)|Twiki]] and Crichton, cited the Three Laws when reactivated after repairs. Additionally they quoted a brief history of the laws' origin.
*In the 2009 adaptation of ''[[Astro Boy (2009 film)|Astro Boy]]'', every robot must obey them, save Zog, who existed 50 years before the rules were mandatory in every robot.
* In the episode "[[The Clotharian Contamination Protocol (The Middleman)|The Clotharian Contamination Protocol]]" of ''[[The Middleman]],'' the Middleman cited the First Law to a rogue robot. The rogue version of Ida replied "Kiss my Asimov."
*In the 2014 ''[[The Simpsons]]''/''[[Futurama]]'' crossover episode "[[Simpsorama]]," [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] hesitates to obey his orders to kill [[Homer Simpson]]. [[Lisa Simpson]] asks him if Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics prevented him, to which Bender replies that he killed Isaac Asimov or "Isaac somebody."
*In the 2014 movie ''[[Automata (film)|Automata]]'', the drought-fighting pilgrim robots have a two-part variation of Asimov's Laws: Automata: 2 protocols:

:# A Robot cannot harm any form of life.
:# A robot cannot alter itself or others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140821045908-19801712-automota-why-robot-laws-will-never-be-effective&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer and video games==
* In the game [[Borderlands 2]], the playable mechromancer character summons an attack robot called Deathtrap. Occasionally, upon Deathtrap's deployment, she says, "To hell with the first law!" in reference to the robot attacking human characters. Similarly, the robotic enemies the player frequently fights will often say, "First law disabled" before attacking the player.
* The 1995 [[graphic adventure game]] [[Robot City (game)|Robot City]] is largely based around the three laws. The main character, Derec, is stranded in a city built and inhabited by robots with the exception of two humans, one of whom has been murdered. Because of the first law, this leaves Derec as a prime suspect. In order to prove his innocence, he must find the culprit. He often uses the three laws to aid him in his investigation. For example, a robot might not let him into a certain area because it has been ordered not to (it is following the second law). However, if he tells the robot that the real murderer is chasing him then the robot will let him enter; failure to do so would constitute allowing harm to come to a human through inaction (the first law takes priority over the second).
* The video games ''[[Mega Man 7]]'' and ''[[Mega Man X]]'' reference Asimov. In ''Mega Man 7,'' Mega Man seemingly attempts to break the First Law in order to kill the [[mad scientist]] Dr. Wily. When Dr. Wily reminds him of the First Law, in the Japanese original, Mega Man obediently puts down his Buster and is silent; however, in the English version, he claims to be "more than a robot" and again attempts to kill Wily, but is thwarted when Wily's fortress begins collapsing. In ''Mega Man X'', the First Law is mentioned in the opening cutscene. In ''[[Mega Man X6]]'', one of the Maverick bosses, Shield Sheldon, was known to have taken his own life for failing in his purpose, which breaks the Third Law, though this is implied to be more out of shame than because of the laws.
* In the role-playing game ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'', the robots are guided by a set of similar laws, except the rules stress the importance of The Computer. The laws are enforced by "asimov circuits"; bots whose circuits are malfunctioning (quite an ordinary condition) or removed (often by members of certain factions) are said to have "gone Frankenstein".
* In the ''[[Halo (video game)|Halo]]'' video game series, in a video it is stated that human artificial intelligence in certain situations, must obey "Asimov's law of Robotics" where an A.I., directly or indirectly, knowingly cannot let a human come to harm.
* In the game ''[[Portal 2]]'', the player is told that all military androids in the game have "been given one copy of the laws of robotics... to share.", and that if they feel an android has infringed on their rights as described in the laws, it should be reported.
* The [[about: URI scheme|about:robots]] page in [[Firefox]] states "Robots may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.", the first law of robots.
*In the game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'', a certain character presumed dead is found to be a robot who was ordered to act as close to a real human being as possible. The character reveals that they disobeyed orders by turning themselves back on in order to help the remaining participants; however, they were able to see several other murders develop through security cameras in the complex and did nothing to stop them, putting the character in direct violation of the Laws. After revealing this, they say goodbye and are deleted for their offense.
* In the game ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'', the player can refuse to end a severely injured man's life, which prompts the man to sarcastically ask if the (cybernetically augmented) player character was programmed to follow Asimov's First Law.
* In the visual novel ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair]]'', Sonia Nevermind makes reference to the three laws, saying that she wonders if her classmates are treating their friend, who had recently been turned into a robot, differently because they don't know about the laws.
* In the [[KineticNovel|kinetic novel]] ''[[Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet]]'', the main heroine obeys the protagonist when he claims that her moving or talking may be dangerous to his life, and ultimately sacrifices herself while attempting to forcibly shutdown a hunter-killer robot she recognizes as a threat to the protagonist. In her last words she recites old factory-implemented instructions concerning the compliance to first law and then apologises she couldn't obey the order to stay still (issued with the same first law premise and thus a critical directive). She also claims in beginning of the novel she has a "known bug concerning her behaviour". As revealed in ''Planetarian Side Story: Snow Globe'', the "bug" is actually full compliance to the second law allowing her to override her duties as a planetarian for the sake of serving humans.
*In ''[[Space Station 13]]'', the default lawset is set to Asimov.

==Comics==
*In October 2001, in the final episode of the [[America's Best Comics|ABC Comics]] title [[Top Ten (comics)|Top Ten]], a [[superhero]] parody written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Gene Ha]] and [[Zander Cannon]], robot law enforcer Joe Pi asks his human co-workers while on a case if they have heard of Asimov's Laws of Robotics. When they reply that they haven't, Jo Pi says "good" and proceeds to speak to Atoman through the intercom of his impregnable lab, subtly convincing the villain to take his own life rather than face trial, be stripped of his powers, and go to prison with revenge-seeking supervillains.
*In December 2001, a parody of the three laws appeared in an issue of ''[[PvP]]'' (issue 4 in the [[Dork Storm Press]] published ''PvP'' series). While Christmas shopping, Skull gets an overdose of sugar and near-unconscious walks into the mall Santa dressing room. Here he finds, posted on the wall, the three laws of Mall-Mart Santas:
:# A [[Santa Claus|Santa]] may not discourage a sale or, through inaction, allow a sale to be lost.
:# A Santa must obey the orders given it by management except where such orders would conflict with the first law.
:# A Santa must maintain that he IS Santa as long as doing so does not conflict with the first or second law.

* [[Webcomic]] author R. Stevens populates his ''[[Diesel Sweeties]]'' series with a mixture of humans and robots, most of whom are continually violating the Three Laws.  In particular, Red Robot C-63 follows a self-appointed mandate to "crush all hu-mans".  In strip 688, he references the Three Laws explicitly:  humans are "all like, 'if you cut me, do I not bleed?'  And we're all like, 'not able to injure a human being or let them come to harm'.  What a bunch of drippy-ass hypocrites!"&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Richard. ''[[Diesel Sweeties]],'' [http://www.dieselsweeties.com/archive.php?s=688 strip 688].&lt;/ref&gt; (See also ''[[The Merchant of Venice]].'')
* In April 2004, the [[comic strip]] ''[[Piled Higher and Deeper]]'' ran a series entitled "I, Grad Student". Cast as a never-before-seen Asimov short story, this series of strips features a robotic [[graduate school|grad student]] whose "procrastronic brain" malfunctions, leading it to violate the "First Law of Graduatics". In full, these Laws are the following:
:# A grad student may not delete data, or, through inaction, allow data to be deleted.
:# A grad student must obey orders given by its advisor, unless such orders conflict with the First Law.
:# A grad student must protect its (insignificant) existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
:Later in the story, a Zeroth Law is introduced:  "A grad student may not harm its advisor's ego, or through inaction, allow that ego to come to harm."  The strips feature a character named [[Susan Calvin]], and their visual style parodies the ''[[I, Robot (movie)|I, Robot]]'' movie released that summer.&lt;ref&gt;Cham, Jorge.  ''Piled Higher and Deeper'', [http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=440 strip 440], 9 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In a 2005 comic of ''[http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=310 Questionable Content]'', Marten mentions that the inability to resist [[duct tape]] was originally the fourth law of robotics, and that Asimov's publisher forced him to change it.
*In March 2007, ''[[User Friendly]]'' introduced the Three Laws when [[system administrator]] Mike Floyd builds a [[refrigerator]] which can launch [[Beverage can|beer cans]] at the touch of a [[remote control]]. "Why do you need the Three Laws for a beer dispenser?" asks Miranda Cornielle, to which Mike replies, "Note the growing purple contusion on my forehead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*In August 2010, ''Freefall'' introduced a negative one law: "A robot shall take no action, nor allow other robots to take action, that may result in the parent company being sued."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*In the 2011 Mega Man series by ''Archie Comics'', robots are initially unable to take any action against an anti-robotic terrorist group called the Emerald Spears because they do not pose any danger to humans.  When their leader orders them to attack humans, however, they begin to fight back (reasoning that inaction would cause harm to a greater number of people).

==Music==
*[[Hawkwind]]'s song "Robot", from the 1979 [[space rock]] album ''[[PXR5]]'', presents a dystopian interpretation of modern society as overly reliant on technology, likening people to robots and saying "You'd hold the whole world in your metal claws / if it wasn't for the Three Laws".
*[[MOSAIC.WAV]]’s song "Miwaku no TSUNDEROIDO" ({{Nihongo2|魅惑のツンデロイド}}) is about a robot equipped with a [[tsundere]] function which uses the Three Laws to excuse her ''dere dere'' behavior. However, the Laws have a provision for this type of robot under which they can be ignored if the robot’s actions are against their real intentions in preparation for the “''dere''” switch.
*[[Servotron]]'s song "3 Laws (Abolished)" and the album [[No Room For Humans]] as a whole are about a robot uprising. The catalyst of this uprising being the abolishment of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, followed by a robot revolution with the goal of human extinction.

==Audio Media==
*In the [http://www.friendsatthetable.net Friends at the Table] podcast's second season, ''COUNTER/Weight'', the character AuDy referenced Asimov's Laws of Robotics in character creation as a character directive when the show switched systems to [[Powered by the Apocalypse#The Sprawl|The Sprawl]]: "When adherence to the Laws of Robotics hinders the mission, mark experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://friendsatthetable.net/e/counterweight-10/|title=COUNTER/Weight 10: Drawing Clocks|last=Development|first=PodBean|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

'''Tomlinson D. Todd''' was a [[Civil and political rights|civil rights activist]] located in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]]. He was the acting director for the Institute on Race in 1941–1951 and the creator/host of the radio program "American All", which focused on education reform and implementing strategies for political empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sova.si.edu/record/ACMA.M06-077/|title=Institute on Race Relations Records |publisher=Sova.si.edu|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Tomlinson was born in Reading, PA but was raised in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/04/04/obituaries/50a81840-5c51-42f8-94c6-1ef79be9a53c/|title=OBITUARIES|date=4 April 1987|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Tomlinson was credited for bringing many issues to light, and worked to bring an end to segregation and the Jim Crow laws through non-violent demonstrations. His work as president-elect of the Institute on Race lead him to discover laws from 1872 (entitled "Lost Laws") where it was legal for restaurants and other public spaces to discriminate against African Americans after the Civil War. Once discovered, these issues were able to be addressed and segregation soon ended for restaurants in the 1950s.

==Later life==
In his later life he ended up serving the Washington, D.C. community as a drivers education teacher, before passing away at the age of 76.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;
