The '''2011 India–Pakistan border skirmish''' was a series of incidents which took place during the months of July and August 2011 across the [[Line of Control]] in [[Kupwara District]] and [[Neelam Valley]]. Both countries gave different accounts of the incident, each accusing the other of initiating the hostilities.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-14746985|title=Kashmir border deaths spark India and Pakistan row|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="et"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/243324/loc-three-pakistani-soldiers-die-in-attack-by-indian-forces/|title=LoC: Three Pakistani soldiers died in attack by Indian forces|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=1 September 2011|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Operation-Ginger-Tit-for-tat-across-the-Line-of-Control/article15477494.ece|title=Operation Ginger: Tit-for-tat across the Line of Control|last=Singh|first=Vijaita|date=2016-10-09|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-06-06|last2=Amp|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|last3=Joseph|first3=Josy|last4=Singh|first4=Vijaita|last5=Amp|last6=Joseph|first6=Josy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==

=== Indian version ===
India sources claimed that Pakistani [[Border Action Team]] (BAT) attacked a remote Indian Army post located at Gugaldhar ridge, Kupwara district on 30 July 2011. The post was manned by soldiers of the [[Rajput Regiment|19 Rajput Regiment]] and [[Kumaon Regiment|20 Kumaon Regiment]], the latter in the process of replacing the former. During the attack, the Pakistani forces beheaded two soldiers of the 20 Kumaon and took back the heads with them. A soldier of the 19 Rajput succumbed to his injuries in the hospital. A few days later, Indian army also discovered a video clip of the severed heads from a Pakistani militant who was killed while crossing into [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/operation-ginger-when-indian-forces-crossed-the-line-of-control-in-2011/|title=Operation Ginger: When Indian Forces Crossed the Line of Control in 2011|last=Diplomat|first=Ankit Panda, The|work=The Diplomat|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation, Operation Ginger was planned by the Indian Army which a plan to conduct an ambush on the Pakistan Army post of Police Chowki using multiple teams. Seven, physical and aerial, reconnaissance missions were conducted and three Pakistani Army posts were identified as vulnerable. These posts included Police Chowki, a post at  Jor, Hifazat and Lashdat lodging point. The Para commandos crossed over the LoC at 10pm on 29 August and reached their targets at 3am on 30 August, a day before Eid. The first team of commandos laid claymore mines preparing for an ambush and targeting four Pakistani soldiers, including a JCO, at 7am. One of the Pakistani soldiers was injured and fell into a stream while the other three soldiers were beheaded by the Indian commandos. Indian soldiers booby trapped the dead bodies with IEDs. Two Pakistani soldiers from the post rushed towards the ambush site after hearing the explosions but were killed by a second team of Indian soldiers. Two other Pakistani soldiers attacked the second team but were killed by a third team of Indian soldiers. At 7.45am, the Indian soldiers started to head back to the LoC. As they were retreating, they saw another group of Pakistani soldiers heading towards the ambush site. They heard loud explosions which indicated that the IEDs had been triggered and estimated that two to three additional Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the blast. The last team reached back on the Indian side by 2.30pm on 30 August. During exfiltration, an Indian soldier blew his finger when he accidentally fell on a mine. The Indian team carried back with them three severed heads, three AK47 rifles and other weapons as trophies. Initially the heads were photographed and buried but, later, one of the senior generals in the Indian Army, asked them to burn the heads and throw away the ashes so as to leave no DNA evidence. Indians claimed that during the 45 minute operation, at least eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and a further 2 to 3 Pakistani soldiers may have been fatally injured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Officially, Indian Army spokesman maintained that that the incident started when Pakistan made an infiltration bid in the Keran Sector of Kupwara District, [[Jammu and Kashmir]] on 30 August which was foiled by Indian security forces. During this an Indian Army JCO was also killed. He further claimed that there were two unprovoked firing incidents By the Pakistani Army, One on 31 August at around 8pm and another on 1 September at around 11am.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pak-troops-violate-ceasefire-twice-three-soldiers-killed/article2417251.ece|title=Pak troops violate ceasefire twice, three soldiers killed|date=2011-09-01|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-06-06|others=PTI|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

=== Pakistani version ===
Pakistan claimed that the fighting started when Indian forces opened fire on a Pakistani checkpoint based on the [[Line of Control]] in the [[Neelam Valley]] of [[Azad Kashmir]]. The Pakistan Army spokesperson dubbed the attack as unprovoked and said that three soldiers of the irregular Mujahid Battalion were killed. He further claimed that the soldiers came under fire when they were moving from one post to another.&lt;ref name="et" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hXrPbp-kVOUaDsx_1TB9_Dhqvu9Q?docId=CNG.4059a4a82371e59484c58692e9c532a7.381|title=Three Pakistan soldiers dead in India border firing|work=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

'''Ahmed Tawfik Taymour Pasha''' (1871&amp;ndash;1930) was an Egyptian writer and historian. Taymour Pasha was born on 6 November 1871 in [[Cairo]] to a family of the Egyptian elite, his father [[Isma'il Taymur]] being of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] origin and his mother of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=|first=|year=|title=أحمد تيمور باشا.. مصحح أغلاط لسان العرب|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/encyclopedia/icons/2016/9/22/%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%AD-%D8%A3%D8%BA%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B7-%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|quote=ولد أحمد توفيق بن إسماعيل بن محمد كاشف تيمور عام 1871 في العاصمة المصرية القاهرة لأب كردي وأم تركية.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works and Life ==
[[File:Karagoez-davul-Hacivat-zurna.jpg|right|thumb|Hacivat (left) and Karagöz (right) in the [[Karagöz and Hacivat]] shadow play]]

[[Isma'il Taymur]] was a member of the royal entourage of the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]], which was of Albanian origin.&lt;ref name="sis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldschmidt|first=Arthur|year=2000|title=Biographical dictionary of modern Egypt|place=|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|page=211|isbn=1-55587-229-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The family's [[Turkish people|Turco]]-[[Circassians|Circassian]] background was common among the Egyptian elite.

Ahmed was educated by his elder sister, [[Aisha Taymur]]  (1840–1902), a social activist, [[poet]] and [[novelist]],  active in the field of [[women's rights]] and her husband [[Muhammad Tawfiq]].&lt;ref name="sis"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.sis.gov.eg/vr/figures/english/html/Aisha.htm| title = Aisha Taymur| publisher =Egyptian State Information Service|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321015646/http://www.sis.gov.eg/vr/figures/english/html/Aisha.htm | archivedate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some years, he was a student at the French School, but did not finish it with a degree. He stead home, where he learned Turkish and Persian. Before he reached his 20th birthday, he began his career as a writer. His house became a meeting place for many cultured men of his time who discussed literature, modern sciences and politics.

He was widowed early when his wife died of [[measles]], and he left his family's house in Cairo to the nearby countryside. He focused on the education of his two sons, Muhammad and Mahmoud Taymur, who gained fame as a playwright and, in the case of [[Mahmoud Taymur]], as a novelist. As a wealthy scholar and bibliophile he encouraged their literary pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;''McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama: An International Reference Work in 5 Volumes'', Band 1
Stanley Hochman VNR AG, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Aisha had been influenced by the Ottoman age notion of 'pure [[aesthetics]]'. Ahmed's outlook was more on the search of a renewed [[Islamic Golden Age|Arab Golden Age]], which was common among Egyptian intellectuals after the 1882 [[History of Egypt under the British|British Rule in Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Essays in Arabic Literary Biography: 1850–1950'', Roger M. A. Allen, Joseph Edmund Lowry, Devin J. Stewart&lt;/ref&gt; He however as a man of "many letters" pioneered the study of folklore and folkart, including the [[Shadow play#The Ottoman Shadow Play and its Turkish descendants|shadow play]] tradition, that had spread during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Arabic Writing Today: Drama Maḥmūd Manzalāwī American Research Center in Egypt, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Taymour Pasha wrote among others, the following six books in Arabic:
* A'lam al-muhandisin fi 'l-Islam –Eminent Geometers, (Architects and Artists) in Islam (أعلام المهندسين في الإسلام)
* al-Amthal al-'ammiyya – Colloquial Proverbs (الأمثال العامية)

'''Alfred Marston Tozzer''' (4 July 1877 &amp;ndash; 5 October 1954) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]], [[archaeology|archaeologist]], [[linguistics|linguist]], and educator.  His principal area of interest was [[Mesoamerica]]n, especially [[Maya civilization|Maya]], studies.&lt;ref&gt;The source for this article (unless otherwise noted) is Philip Phillips, “Alfred Marsten Tozzer 1877-1954,” ''American Antiquity'', 21:1 (Jul. 1955): 72-80. See also David A. Browman and Stephen Williams, ''Anthropology at Harvard: A Biographical History'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Peabody Museum Press, 2013), 302-05.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the husband of Margaret Castle Tozzer &lt;ref&gt;"Many Interesting Weddings and Engagements," ''New York Times'' 2 Feb. 1913: X3; "Dr. Alfred Tozzer, Anthropologist, 77," ''New York Times'' 6 Oct. 1954: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and father of figure skating champion [[Joan Tozzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Fine Figures |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760703,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |work= |publisher= [[Time Magazine]] |date= 1939-01-30 |accessdate=2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early studies and career==
Alfred Tozzer was born in [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]], [[Massachusetts]] to Samuel Clarence (1846-1908) and Caroline (née Marston, 1847-1926) Tozzer, and graduated in Anthropology from [[Harvard University]] in 1900. That summer he entered field as an assistant to Harvard’s [[Roland Dixon]] to study American Indian languages of California. The following year he collected linguistic and ethnographic data on the [[Navajo people|Navajo]]s living near [[Pueblo Bonito]] in New Mexico. From these experiences he published his first paper, which he presented at the Thirteenth [[International Congress of Americanists]] held in New York in 1902.

In December 1901, he won appointment as a Traveling Fellow for the [[Archeological Institute of America]]. He spent several seasons in Yucatán conducting fieldwork among the Maya. He began at the Hacienda Chichen, owned by U.S. Consul to Yucatán [[Edward Herbert Thompson|Edward H. Thompson]], a large plantation that included the ancient city of [[Chichen Itza]]. There he studied the Maya language and traveled the countryside collecting folk tales and oral histories. During one of his seasons at Chichen Itza he helped Thompson dredge the [[Cenote#Cenotes and the Maya|Cenote Sagrado]]; at the end of another, he carried artifacts to the Peabody Museum in his luggage.&lt;ref&gt;Mary McVicker, Adela Breton: A Victorian Artist Amid Mexico's Ruins (University of New Mexico Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, Tozzer traveled to [[Campeche]] and [[Chiapas]] to conduct research among the Lacandon Maya, and lived for several weeks in a small settlement on [[Lake Pethá]], witnessing and even participating in their ceremonies. He returned there during the 1904 season, and wrote his PhD dissertation comparing the ceremonies of the Lacondone Maya with the Yucatecan Maya.&lt;ref&gt;His dissertation was published in 1907 by the AIA as A Comparative Study of the Maya and the Lacandones.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1904, he studied at [[Columbia University]] under [[Franz Boas]] and [[Adolph Bandelier]]. He spent one more season in Yucatán, Campeche and Chiapas, before settling at Harvard in the fall of 1905 as an assistant professor of anthropology.

==Transition to archaeologist==
From the beginning of his professional career, Tozzer began to shift more to archaeology and away from ethnography. During his seasons at Chichen, he assisted [[Adela Breton]] with her copies of reliefs, and Thompson who was making paper molds. During his time with the Lacandons he discovered and explored ruins that today share the name of the Rio [[List of Maya Sites#T|Tzendales]]. In the summer of 1907, he joined Dixon, [[Alfred Kidder]] and [[Sylvanus Morley]] on a purely archaeological expedition to Rito de los Frijoles in New Mexico (today part of [[Bandelier National Monument]]).

In 1910 he took a leave of absence from Harvard to lead his first expedition to the ruins of [[Tikal]] and [[Nakum]] on behalf of the university’s [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;This resulted in two publications, “Preliminary study of the prehistoric ruins of Tikal, Guatemala, Report of the Peabody Museum Expedition, 1909-1910” (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Memoirs of the Peabody Museum 5, No. 2:93-135, 1910) and “A Preliminary Study of the Prehistoric Ruins of Nakum, Guatemala, Report of the Peabody Museum Expedition, 1909-1910” (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Memoirs of the Peabody Museum 5, No. 2:144-201, 1913).&lt;/ref&gt; On this trip Tozzer discovered the ruins of [[Holmul]].

In 1914 Tozzer took another leave of absence to succeed Boas as director of the [[International School of American Archaeology]] in Mexico. He arrived in [[Veracruz]] in time to witness the US Navy shelling of the city. He oversaw excavation of [[Santiago Ahuitzotla]]. Once his term as director expired, he never ventured into the field again.&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Lothrop, “Alfred Marston Tozzer 1876-1954” (American Anthropologist, 57:614-618, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tozzer eventually returned to Harvard where he would spend the remainder of his professional career, except for stints in the military. He served as a captain in the Air Service from 1917 to 1918. He served as a major in the Reserves from 1918 to 1929. During World War II, he served as director of the Honolulu office of the Office of Strategic Services from 1943 to 1945.

==Later career==
Tozzer returned from World War I to his post as associate professor at Harvard. Within three years he was a full professor and chairman of the Division of Anthropology.

In 1922, Tozzer won appointment to the Academic Board at [[Radcliffe College]], and later become a trustee in 1928. He served on Harvard’s Administrative Board from 1928 until his retirement in 1948.

Tozzer published several important works in Maya studies, among them, A Grammar of the Maya language (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Papers of the Peabody Museum, 1921), and an annotated translation of Bishop Diego de Landa’s (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Papers of the Peabody Museum, 1941). His magnum opus, Chichen Itza and its Cenote of Sacrifice (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Memoirs of the Peabody Museum, 1957), was published after his death in 1954. A massive volume with hundreds of illustrations, “It covers every aspect of Chichen Itza: its history, religious cults, arts, and industries as well as contacts with other regions,” noted S.K. Lothrop in his obituary of Tozzer. “It concentrates in a single volume the learning acquired in half a century.”&lt;ref&gt;Lothrop, Tozzer&lt;/ref&gt;

Tozzer was elected by his peers to two consecutive terms as president of the [[American Anthropological Association]] beginning in 1928. In 1942 he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].

In 1974 the Peabody Museum renamed its library after Tozzer, who was active in building the library's collection and in its management from 1935 to his retirement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">The '''Blatnica-Mikulčice horizon''' is an early medieval [[archaeological horizon]] of metalwork.{{sfn|Barford|2001|p = 109}} It emerged in the regions north of the [[Middle Danube]]{{spaced ndash}}in present-day [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]{{spaced ndash}}following the fall of the [[Avar Khaganate]] in the early 9th century.{{sfn|Urbańczyk|2005|p = 145}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 130}} The most featuring "Blatnica-Mikulčice" finds are swords with exquisite decorations from graves of male warriors.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p = 130}}

The name of the horizon is derived from the archeological localities in [[Blatnica, Slovakia|Blatnica]] ([[Slovakia]]) and [[Mikulčice]] ([[Czech Republic]]).  The artifacts (allegedly) from Blatnica were unearthed already in the 19th century and contained forgings of the late Avar type, forgings of the local provenance and a Carolinian sword. Even if it was in doubt whether all of them are from the same depot and really from Blatnica, most archeologists adopted a theory that they are from the same "ducal" grave. In the 1930s, a Hungarian archeologist [[Nándor Fettich]] dated artifacts to the turnover of the 8th/9th century assuming their common origin and synthetic style.{{sfn|Chorvátová}} His dating was accepted also by the Czechoslovak experts. In te 1960s, a Czech archeologist [[Josef Poulík]] associated some of new findings in Mikulčice with those from Blatnica and a further research of old Slavonic stronghold in [[Pobedim]] ([[Darina Bialeková]]) contributed to the establishment of the term.{{sfn|Chorvátová}}

The concept of Blatnica-Miklučice horizon belonged for a long time to cornerstones of the Czechoslovak archeology and influenced dating of several early settlements in Czech and Slovak republic, but also in other Central-European countries. Although the term is still in use, it is target of serious criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ungerman|first=Šimon|date=2011|title=Tzv. blatnicko-mikulčický horizont a jeho vliv na chronologii raného středověku|url=https://www.academia.edu/3133370/Tzv._blatnicko-mikul%C4%8Dick%C3%BD_horizont_a_jeho_vliv_na_chronologii_ran%C3%A9ho_st%C5%99edov%C4%9Bku_Der_sog._Blatnica-Mikul%C4%8Dice-Horizont_und_sein_Einfluss_auf_die_Chronologie_des_Fr%C3%BChmittelalters_|journal=Karolínska kultúra a Slovensko.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2160">'''Bonincontro Morigia''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 14th century) was an historical writer from [[Monza]] in northern [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilcittadinomb.it/stories/Monza/390271/|title=Tradotto il Chronicon di Morigia: la storia di Monza, fino al 1300|last=Rosella|date=March 4, 2011|publisher=Il Cittadino di Monza e Brianza|language=Italian|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
[[File:MORIGIA.JPG|thumb|right|The street dedicated to Morigia in the historical center of [[Monza]]]]
Born in Monza around 1295, he was a member of an important [[Ghibelline]] family of that city. He took an active part in the political struggles of his time, siding with the party of the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]], lords of Milan. He was also a member of the Council of the Twelve which administered the city, and on one occasion was ambassador to [[Venice]].

He is however noted as an historian.

== Main Works ==
The main work of Morigia is the ''Chronicon Modoetiense'', a history of Monza from its origins to his own day.

Morigia is the first author known to report the legend that the Latin name of Monza ("Modoetia") derives from a vision in a dream by Queen [[Theodelinda]]: a dove (symbol of the [[Holy Spirit]]) is said to have told her to found her capital on the site, bearing in it a scroll inscribed with the word "Modo" ("Now"), to which she responded "Etiam" ("Yes"). This legend inspired some of the [[fresco]]es in [[Monza Cathedral]] by the [[Zavattari]] brothers.

He was also the first biographer of Saint [[Gerardo dei Tintori]], hospitaller and patron saint of Monza together with [[Saint John the Baptist]]. The life of Gerardo is included in the Chronicon Modoetiense, where Morigia also lists a number of miracles attributed to the saint, of one of which Morigia claims to have been an eyewitness.

==Biography==

By the end of his life, he had become a familiar sight in colonial [[Sydney]], dressed in a succession of military and naval uniforms that had been given to him.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;McCarthy, F.D.

Bungaree first came to prominence in 1798, when he accompanied [[Matthew Flinders]] on a coastal survey as an interpreter, guide and negotiator with local indigenous groups.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He later accompanied Flinders on his circumnavigation of Australia between 1801 and 1803 in the {{HMS|Investigator|1798|2}}.&lt;ref name="Pollon"/&gt; Flinders was the cartographer of the first complete map of Australia, filling in the gaps from previous cartographic expeditions, and was the most prominent advocate for naming the continent "Australia". Flinders noted that Bungaree was "a worthy and brave fellow" who, on multiple occasions, saved the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Flinders, ''A Voyage to Terra Australis,'' 1814.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bungaree continued his association with exploratory voyages when he accompanied [[Phillip Parker King]] to north-western Australia in 1817 in the {{HMS|Mermaid|1817|2}}.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

In 1815, Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] dubbed Bungaree "Chief of the Broken Bay Tribe" and presented him with {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land on George’s Head.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He also received a [[Aboriginal Breastplate|breastplate]] inscribed "BOONGAREE - Chief of the Broken Bay Tribe - 1815".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/659579866|title=Sydney's Aboriginal past : investigating the archaeological and historical records|last=1942-|first=Attenbrow, Val,|date=1 January 2010|publisher=UNSW Press|year=|isbn=9781742231167|location=|pages=61|oclc=659579866|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bungaree was also known by the titles "King of Port Jackson" and "King of the Blacks".&lt;ref name="Barani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pollon"/&gt; Bungaree spent the rest of his life ceremonially welcoming visitors to Australia, educating people about Aboriginal culture (especially boomerang throwing), and soliciting tribute, especially from ships visiting Sydney. In 1828, he and his clan moved to the Governor's Domain, and were given rations, with Bungaree described as 'in the last stages of human infirmity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/bungaree |title = Bungaree |author = Keith Vincent Smith |date = 2011 |work = Dictionary of Sydney |publisher = Dictionary of Sydney Trust |accessdate = 5 December 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120327184059/http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/bungaree |archivedate = 27 March 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island]] on 24 November 1830 and was buried in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pollon"/&gt;  Obituaries of him were carried in the ''[[Sydney Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2196620 |title=DEATH OF KING BOONGARIE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (NSW : 1803 - 1842)]] |location=NSW |date=27 November 1830 |accessdate=5 November 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Australian (1824 newspaper)|The Australian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

[[Boongaree Island]], located off the  [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] coast of [[Western Australia]], was named after him by King in 1820.  The suburb of [[Bongaree]], [[Queensland]], is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5218">'''Daniel Albert Baugh''' (born 10 July 1931 in [[Philadelphia]]) is "seen as the definitive historian of [British] naval administration."&lt;ref&gt;Eugene L. Rasor, ''English/British Naval History to 1815''.  Westport, CT: Praeger, 2004. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Baugh has defined his own contribution in explaining "My research field is mainly England, 1660-1840. By studying administration chiefly in terms of administrative problems, I hope to improve our understanding of both the nature of society and the development of government.".&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors'' (Gale, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1982 he focused his attention on maritime, naval and geopolitical history.

==Early life and education==
The son of [[Albert Croll Baugh]] (born 1891), a professor of English Literature, and his wife Nita Scudder Baugh, Daniel Baugh attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1953. In 1954, he was commissioned in the [[United States Navy]] and served for three years, rising to the rank of [[lieutenant]]. In 1955, he married Carol Allen Baugh, and together they had three children. Before completing his naval service in 1957 he earned his [[Master of Arts]] degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Moving on to Cambridge University, Baugh earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1961 with his thesis, completed under the supervision of [[John Ehrman]], on British naval administration in [[War of Jenkins's Ear|the War of 1739-48]].

==Academic career==
In 1961, [[Princeton University]] appointed Baugh to history instructor, and in 1964, assistant professor of history . In 1969, the [[Cornell University Department of History]] appointed him associate professor and he remained at Cornell until his retirement.

Baugh received a [[Social Science Research Council]] Grant in 1966-67, a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] fellowship in 1977-78 and a fellowship at the Shelby Cullom Davis Center, Princeton University, 1982-83.

In 2011, the [[National Maritime Museum, Greenwich]] awarded him its [[Caird Medal]] in recognition of his distinguished career of scholarship on eighteenth century British naval history.

Icke was a [[BBC]] television sports presenter and spokesman for the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]] when, he claims, a [[psychic]] told him, in 1990, that he had been placed on Earth for a purpose and would begin to receive messages from the spirit world.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103&gt;Michael Barkun, ''A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA103 103].&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he announced that he was a "Son of the Godhead",&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt; and that the world would soon be devastated by [[Tsunami|tidal waves]] and [[earthquakes]], a prediction he repeated on the BBC's primetime show ''[[Wogan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', London: Warner Books, 1993, 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ronson, ''Them: Adventures with Extremists'', London: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001, 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt; The show changed his life, turning him from a respected household name into someone who was laughed at whenever he appeared in public.&lt;ref name="Channel 5 12 Dec 2006 00:02:20"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcQzOZmJykk "David Icke: Was He Right?"], [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], 12 December 2006, from 00:02:20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 11 years he wrote ''The Robots' Rebellion'' (1994), ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995), ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999), and ''Children of the Matrix'' (2001), where he developed his worldview of [[New Age]] conspiracism.&lt;ref&gt;For the four books over seven years, Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA103 103].&lt;/ref&gt; His endorsement of the [[antisemitic]] forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' in ''The Robots' Rebellion'', and in ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', led his publisher to refuse to publish his books, which were [[Self-publishing|self-published]] thereafter.&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt; Icke has gone on to lecture around the world, frequently selling out venues, and his books have been translated into eleven languages.&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011/&gt; 

At the heart of Icke's theories lies the idea that [[the universe]] is made up of "vibrational" energy, and consists of an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of [[Multiverse|dimensions]] that share the same space.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biggest26&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that an [[Interdimensional hypothesis|inter-dimensional]] race of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilian]] beings called the [[Archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]] (or [[Anunnaki]]), have hijacked the [[Earth]], and that a [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] human/Archon [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] race of [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifting]] reptilians, also known as the "[[#reptoid|Babylonian Brotherhood]]", the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati]], or the '[[Global elite|elite]]', manipulate global events to keep humans in a constant state of fear, so the Archons can feed off the 'negative energy' this creates.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p82&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 19–25, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims many prominent figures belong to the Babylonian Brotherhood, and are propelling [[Human beings|humanity]] towards an [[Orwellian]] global [[Fascism|fascist]] state, or [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]; a [[post-truth]] era where [[freedom of speech]] is ended.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103/&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil20May2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Henry Widdas |title=Being 'red-pilled' by David Icke has never been so entertaining...and terrifying |url=https://www.lep.co.uk/whats-on/theatre/being-red-pilled-by-david-icke-has-never-been-so-entertaining-and-terrifying-1-9120860 |website=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] |accessdate=15 June 2018 |date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icke believes that the only way this 'Archontic' influence can be defeated is by humanity waking up to 'the truth', and filling their hearts with [[love]].&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt; Critics have accused Icke of being a [[Holocaust denier]] and his "reptilians" and other theories of being antisemitic, claims he denies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lizard conspiracist David Icke not wanted in Berlin|url=http://www.dw.com/en/lizard-conspiracist-david-icke-not-wanted-in-berlin/a-37693384|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Henry|last=Widdas|title=Icke: Reports of my madness have been greatly exaggerated|url=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/politics/icke-reports-of-my-madness-have-been-greatly-exaggerated-1-9253395|accessdate=9 August 2018|work=Lancashire Post|date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Family and education===
The middle son of three boys born seven years apart, Icke was born in [[Leicester General Hospital]] to Beric Vaughan Icke and Barbara J. Icke, née Cooke, who were married in Leicester in 1951. Beric had wanted to be a doctor, but the family had no money, so he joined the [[Royal Air Force]] as a medical orderly.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a [[British Empire Medal]] for gallantry in 1943 after an aircraft crashed into the [[Chipping Warden]] air base in Northamptonshire. Along with a [[squadron leader]], Beric ran into the burning aircraft, without protective clothing, and saved the life of a crew member who was trapped inside.{{refn|group=n|1479714 Leading Aircraftman Beric Vaughan Icke, Royal Air Force, ''[[The London Gazette]]'', 14 May 1943:{{pb}} "One night in March, 1943, an aircraft crashed on a Royal Air Force station and immediately burst into flames. Squadron Leader Moore (the duty medical officer) saw the accident and, accompanied by [[Leading Aircraftman]] Icke, a medical orderly, proceeded to the scene. Squadron Leader Moore directed the removal of the rear gunner, who was dazed and sitting amongst the burning wreckage, to a place of safety. The aircraft was now enveloped in flames and ammunition was exploding. Nevertheless, despite the intense heat and the danger from exploding oxygen bottles this officer and airman entered the burning wreckage in an attempt to rescue another member of the crew who was pinned down. Without any protective clothing they lifted aside the burning wreckage and, with great difficulty, succeeded in extricating the injured man. Squadron Leader Moore rendered first aid to the rescued man. Squadron Leader Moore sustained burns to his chest and hands in carrying out the operation. This officer and airman both displayed courage and devotion to duty in keeping with the highest traditions of the Royal Air Force.{{pb}}"Acting Squadron Leader Frederick Thomas Moore, B.S., F.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (23417), Reserve of Air Force Officers, was awarded the MBE for his part in this action."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080302090432/http://www.rafweb.org/BEM_Holders2.htm "1479714 Leading Aircraftman Beric Vaughan Icke, Royal Air Force"], ''The London Gazette'', 14 May 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the war Beric became a clerk in the [[Gents' of Leicester|Gents]] clock factory. The family lived in a [[terraced house]] on Lead Street in the centre of [[Leicester]],&lt;ref name=Icke1993pp29,33/&gt; an area that was demolished in the mid-1950s as part of the city's [[slum clearance]].&lt;ref name=Hewitt2013p153&gt;Ned Newitt, ''The Slums of Leicester'', JMD Media Ltd, 2013, 153 (for demolition, 159–160).&lt;/ref&gt; When Icke was three, in around 1955, they moved to the Goodwood estate, one of the [[council estate]]s the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]] built. "To say we were skint," he wrote in 1993, "is like saying it is a little chilly at the North Pole."&lt;ref name=Icke1993pp29,33&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 29, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He recalls having to hide under a window or chair when the council man came for the rent; after knocking, the rent man would walk around the house peering through windows. His mother never explained that it was about the rent; she just told Icke to hide. He wrote in 2003 that he still gets a fright when someone knocks on the door.&lt;ref name=Icke2003p2&gt;David Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', Ryde: Bridge of Love Publications, 2003, 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Always a loner, he spent hours playing with toy trains, preferring to cross the street rather than speak to anyone. He attended Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous and shy to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before he passed out. The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father disagreed.&lt;ref name=Light36&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 36, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Icke2003p2/&gt;

Icke made no effort at school, but when he was nine, he was chosen for the junior school's third-year football team. It was the first time he had succeeded at anything, and he came to see football as his way out of poverty. He played in goal, which he wrote suited the loner in him and gave him a sense of living on the edge between hero and villain.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing his [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus exam]] in 1963, he was sent to the city's Crown Hills Secondary Modern (rather than the local [[grammar school]]), where he was given a trial for the Leicester Boys Under-Fourteen team.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 44, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He left school at 15 after being talent-spotted by [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], who signed him up in 1967 as their youth team's goalkeeper. He also played for [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]]'s reserve team and [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], on loan from Coventry.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 54, 58 (for Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] in his left knee, which spread to the right knee, ankles, elbows, wrists and hands, stopped him from making a career out of football. Despite often being in agony during training, he managed to play part-time for [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], including in the first team when they were in the [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth]], and later in the [[Football League Third Division|third]], division of the English [[The Football League|Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt; He was earning up to £33 a week.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2012, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1973, at the age of 21, the pain in his joints became so severe that he was forced to retire.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First marriage===
Icke met his first wife, Linda Atherton, in May 1971 at a dance at the Chesford Grange Hotel near [[Leamington Spa]]; she was working as a van driver for a garage. Shortly after they met, Icke had another of the huge rows he had started having with his father—always a domineering man, his father was upset that Icke's arthritis was interfering with his football career—so he packed his bags and left home. He moved into a bedsit and worked in a travel agency, travelling to Hereford twice a week in the evenings to play football.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Atherton were married on 30 September that year, four months after they met.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter was born in March 1975, followed by one son in December 1981 and another in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 82, 96, 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in 2001 but remained good friends, and Atherton continued to work as Icke's business manager.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 139–140, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism, sports broadcasting===

The loss of Icke's position with Hereford meant that he and his wife had to sell their home, and for several weeks they lived apart, each moving in with their parents. In 1973 Icke found a job as a reporter with the weekly ''Leicester Advertiser'', through a contact who was a sports editor at the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 72, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved on to the Leicester News Agency, and through it did some work for [[BBC Radio Leicester]] as its football reporter,&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt; then worked his way up through the ''Loughborough Monitor'', the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'' and [[Free Radio Birmingham|BRMB Radio]] in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 79, 81, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked for two months in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1976, helping with the national football team. It was supposed to be a longer-term position, but he missed his wife and new daughter and decided not to return after his first holiday back to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; BRMB gave him his job back, after which he successfully applied to ''[[Midlands Today]]'' at the BBC's [[Pebble Mill Studios]] in Birmingham, a job that included on-air appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest stories he covered there was the murder of [[Bridgewater Four|Carl Bridgewater]], the paperboy who was shot during a robbery in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Icke became a sports presenter for the BBC's national programme, ''[[Newsnight]]'', which had begun the previous year. Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week. In the middle of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]'', at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 93–95, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He also published his first book that year, ''It's a Tough Game, Son!'', about how to break into football.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke and his family moved in 1982 to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with ''Grandstand'' was short lived – he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared not to like him – but he continued working for [[BBC Sport]] until 1990, often on [[bowls]] and [[snooker]] programmes, and at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; He was by then a household name, but a career in television began to lose its appeal; he wrote that he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1990, his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (also known as the "poll tax"), a local tax introduced that year by [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government. He ultimately paid it, but his announcement that he was willing to go to prison rather than pay prompted the BBC, by charter an impartial public-service broadcaster, to distance itself from him.&lt;ref&gt;"Protester David Icke finally pays community charge," ''The Guardian'', 14 November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedy20March1991&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |authorlink=Maev Kennedy|title=Icke resigns Green Speaker and parliamentary roles |work=The Guardian |date=20 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual awakening==
===Green Party, Betty Shine===
[[File:Ryde, Isle of Wight, down to the sea.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Icke moved to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1982.]]
Icke had begun to flirt with [[alternative medicine]] and New Age philosophies in the 1980s, in an effort to relieve his arthritis, and this encouraged his interest in Green politics. Within six months of joining the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]], he was given a position as one of its four [[principal speaker]]s, positions created in lieu of a single leader.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Truth Vibrations'', London: Gateway, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

His second book, ''It Doesn't Have To Be Like This'', an outline of his views on the environment, was published in 1989, and he was regularly invited to high-profile events. That year he discussed animal rights during a televised debate at the [[Royal Institution]], alongside [[Tom Regan]], [[Mary Warnock]] and [[Germaine Greer]],&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [http://www.all-creatures.org/articles/video-flv-human.html "Does the Animal Kingdom need a Bill of Rights?"], Royal Institute of Great Britain, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990 his name appeared on advertisements for a children's charity, along with [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Woody Allen]] and other celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;''Weekend Guardian'', 22–23 September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his successful media career, Icke wrote that 1989 was a time of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said he began to feel a presence around him.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Days of Decision'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: "If there is anybody here, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!" Days later, in a [[Newsagent's shop|newsagent's]] in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was ''Mind to Mind'' (1989) by [[Betty Shine]], a psychic healer in [[Brighton]]. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Phantom Self'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2016, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110619122640/http://davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=1 "Biography 1"], davidickebooks.co.uk, accessed 8 June 2011 ([https://www.webcitation.org/66tnkaCvp?url=http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=1 archived]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/jan/12/features.sportmonthly "The 10 worst decisions in the history of sport"], ''The Observer'', 12 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Truth Vibrations'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke visited Shine four times. During the third meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke claims to have felt something like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world.&lt;ref&gt;Kay 2011, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David G. Robertson, "David Icke’s Reptilian Thesis and the Development of New Age Theodicy," ''International Journal for the Study of New Religions'', 4(1), 2013 (27–47), 33. {{doi|10.1558/ijsnr.v4i1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icke had been sent to heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilised by having oil taken from under the seabed.&lt;ref name=bio1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio2&gt;For the date and predictions, [http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=6 "Biography 2"], davidickebooks.co.uk, accessed 12 December 2010 ([https://www.webcitation.org/66tnr47yM?url=http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act%3DviewDoc%26docId%3D6 archived]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke 2016, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1991, Icke visited a pre-[[Inca]] [[Sillustani]] burial ground near [[Puno]], [[Peru]], where he says he felt drawn to a particular circle of waist-high stones. As he stood in the circle, he had two thoughts: that people would be talking about this in 100 years, and that it would be over when it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] (a term from Hindu [[yoga]]) activating his [[chakra]]s, or energy centres, triggering a [[Higher consciousness|higher level of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 12–13, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103/&gt;

===Turquoise period===
[[File:Sillustani Archaeological Site (7640965048).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=photograph|Icke's turquoise period followed an experience by a burial site in [[Sillustani]], Peru, in 1991.]]
There followed what Icke called his "turquoise period". He had been [[Mediumship|channelling]] for some time, he wrote, and had received a message through [[automatic writing]] that he was a "Son of the Godhead", interpreting "Godhead" as the "Infinite Mind".&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 190, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; He began to wear only [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], often a turquoise [[shell suit]], a colour he saw as a conduit for positive energy.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001&gt;Jon Ronson, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/17/features.weekend "Beset by lizards (part one)"]; [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/17/features.weekend1 "Beset by lizards (part two)"], ''The Guardian'', 17 March 2001, edited extracts from Jon Ronson, ''Them: Adventures with Extremists''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also started working on his third book, and the first of his New-Age period, ''The Truth Vibrations''.

In August 1990, before his visit to Peru, Icke had met Deborah Shaw, an English psychic living in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. When he returned from Peru they began a relationship, with the apparent blessing of Icke's wife. In March 1991 Shaw began living with the couple, a short-lived arrangement that the press called the "turquoise triangle". Shaw changed her name to Mari Shawsun, while Icke's wife became Michaela, which she said was an aspect of the [[Archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].&lt;ref name=Taylor1997&gt;Sam Taylor, "So I was in this bar with the son of God&amp;nbsp;...," ''The Observer'', 20 April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship with Shaw led to the birth of a daughter in December 1991, although she and Icke had stopped seeing each other by then. Icke wrote in 1993 that he decided not to visit his daughter and had seen her only once, at the request of Shaw. Icke's wife gave birth to the couple's second son in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 223, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press conference===
In March 1991, Icke resigned from the Green Party during a party conference, telling them he was about to be at the centre of "tremendous and increasing controversy", and winning a standing ovation from delegates after the announcement.&lt;ref name=Kennedy20March1991/&gt; A week later, shortly after his father died, Icke and his wife, Linda Atherton, along with their daughter and Deborah Shaw, held a press conference to announce that Icke was a son of the Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 188 for his father; 192–193 for the press conference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; He told reporters the world was going to end in 1997. It would be preceded by a hurricane around the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[New Orleans]], eruptions in [[Cuba]], disruption in China, a hurricane in Derry, and an earthquake on the [[Isle of Arran]].  The information was being given to them by voices and [[automatic writing]], he said. [[Los Angeles]] would become an island, [[New Zealand]] would disappear, and the cliffs of Kent would be under water by Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;John Ezard, "'Son and daughter of God' predict apocalypse is nigh," ''The Guardian'', 28 March 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wogan'' interview===
The headlines attracted requests for interviews from [[Nicky Campbell]]'s [[BBC Radio One]] programme, for [[Terry Wogan]]'s prime-time ''[[Wogan]]'' show, and [[Fern Britton]]'s ITV chat show.&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p131&gt;Robertson 2016, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wogan'' interview, on 29 April 1991, was the most damaging.

Wogan introduced the 1991 segment with "The world as we know it is about to end". Amid laughter from the audience, Icke prevaricated when asked if he was the son of God, replying that Jesus would have been laughed at too, and repeating that Britain would soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes. Without these, "the Earth will cease to exist". When Icke said laughter was the best way to remove negativity, Wogan replied of the audience: "But they're laughing ''at'' you. They're not laughing with you."&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p131/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronson 2001, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/david-icke-terry-wogan-interview/ "The day David Icke told Terry Wogan 'I'm the son of God'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 29 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interview proved devastating for Icke. The BBC was criticised for allowing it to go ahead; Des Christy of ''The Guardian'' called it a "media crucifixion".&lt;ref name=Christy&gt;Des Christy, "Crucifixion, courtesy of the BBC," ''The Guardian'', 6 May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke disappeared from public life for a time.&lt;ref name="Channel 5 12 Dec 2006 00:02:20"/&gt; In May 1991, police were called to the couple's home after a crowd of over 100 youths gathered outside, chanting "[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|We want the Messiah]]" and "Give us a sign, David".&lt;ref&gt;"Icke taunted," ''The Times'', 27 May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke told [[Jon Ronson]] in 2001:

{{quote|
"One of my very greatest fears as a child was being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People come up to you in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into "Icke's a nutter." I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule."&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronson 2001, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006 Wogan re-interviewed Icke for a special 'Now &amp; Then' series. Wogan apologised for his conduct in the earlier 1991 interview.&lt;ref name="Robertson2"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David G. Robertson |title=UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age |date=25 February 2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1474253208 |pages=147 |edition=First |language=English |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and lecturing==
===Publishing===
The ''Wogan'' interview separated Icke from his own previous life, he wrote in 2003, although he considered it the making of him in the end, giving him the courage to develop his ideas without caring what anyone thought.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 14, 17, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''The Truth Vibrations'', inspired by his experience in Peru, was published in May 1991, and he continued to write, turning himself into a popular author and speaker.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt;

Between 1992 and 1994, he wrote five books, all published by mainstream publishers, four in 1993. ''Love Changes Everything'' (1992), influenced by the "channelling" work of Deborah Shaw, is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] work about the origin of the planet, in which Icke writes with admiration about Jesus. ''Days of Decision'' (1993) is an 86-page summary of his interviews after the 1991 press conference; it questions the [[historicity of Jesus]] but accepts the existence of the Christ spirit. Icke's autobiography, ''In the Light of Experience'', was published the same year,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, pp. 133–135.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''Heal the World: A Do-It-Yourself Guide to Personal and Planetary Transformation'' (1993).

====''The Robots' Rebellion''====
[[File:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|1alt=cartoon|In his 2001 documentary about Icke, Jon Ronson cited this cartoon, "Rothschild" (1898), by [[Charles Lucien Léandre|Charles Léandre]], arguing that Jews have long been depicted as lizard-like creatures out to control the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ronson (Channel 4) 2001, 06:12 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Icke's fifth book of that period, ''The Robots' Rebellion'' (1994), published by Gateway, attracted allegations that his work was [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]. According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], the book contains "all the familiar beliefs and paranoid clichés" of the US conspiracists and militia.&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity'', New York University Press, 2003, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; It claims that a plan for world domination by a shadowy cabal, perhaps extraterrestrial, was laid out in ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (c. 1897). 

''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' is a notorious antisemitic [[literary forgery]], probably written under the direction of the [[Okhrana|Russian secret police]] in Paris, that purported to reveal a conspiracy by the Jewish people to achieve global domination. It was exposed as a forgery in 1920 by [[Lucien Wolf]] and the following year by [[Philip Graves]] in ''The Times''.&lt;ref name=Barkunprotocols&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA50 50], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA145 145–146].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007058 "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"] ([https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007244 timeline]), United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Once exposed, [[Michael Barkun]] argues, it disappeared from mainstream discourse, until interest in it was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Barkun49&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA50 50], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA145 145–146].&lt;/ref&gt; Its use was spread further by conspiracy groups on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Juliane Wetzel, "''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' on the internet: How radical political groups are networked via antisemitic conspiracy theories," in Esther Webman (ed.), ''The Global Impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Century-Old Myth'', New York: Routledge, 2012 (147–160), 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Barkun states that Icke's reliance on the ''Protocols'' in ''The Robots' Rebellion'' is "the first of a number of instances in which Icke moves into the dangerous terrain of anti-Semitism".&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Norman Simms, "Anti-Semitism: A Psychopathological Disease," in Jerry S. Piven, Chris Boyd, Henry W. Lawton (eds.),  ''Judaism and Genocide: Psychological Undercurrents of History'', Volume IV, Lincoln, NE: Writers Club Press, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eFFsEYvBEZgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA30 30ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke took both the extraterrestrial angle and the focus on the ''Protocols'' from ''Behold a Pale Horse'' (1991) by [[Milton William Cooper]], who was associated with the American militia movement; chapter 15 of Cooper's book reproduces the ''Protocols'' in full.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Cooper: Ed Vulliamy, Bruce Dirks, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1997/nov/03/mcveigh.usa "New trial may solve riddle of Oklahoma bombing"], ''The Guardian'', 3 November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Robots' Rebellion'' refers repeatedly to the ''Protocols'', calling them the ''Illuminati protocols'', and defining ''Illuminati'' as the "Brotherhood elite at the top of the pyramid of secret societies world-wide". Icke adds that the ''Protocols'' were not the work of the Jewish people, but of [[Zionism|Zionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Robots' Rebellion'', London: Gateway, 1992, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Honigsbaum&gt;Mark Honigsbaum, [https://web.archive.org/web/19990428140350/http://www2.ca.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/british/combat-18/press/evening-standard.052695 "The Dark Side of David Icke"], ''London Evening Standard'', 26 May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Robots' Rebellion'' was greeted with dismay by the Green Party's executive. Despite the controversy over the press conference and the ''Wogan'' interview, they had allowed Icke to address the party's annual conference in 1992—a decision that led one of its principal speakers, [[Sara Parkin]], to resign—but after the publication of ''The Robot's Rebellion'' they moved to ban him.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/greens-bar-icke-1448269.html "Greens bar Icke"], ''The Independent'', 12 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vivek Chaudhary, "Greens see red at 'Son of God's anti-Semitism'," ''The Guardian'', 12 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Goodwin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130602074558/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4678912.html "Icke factor could thwart Greens' serious message"], ''The Independent'', 29 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.

===Self-Publishing===
{{Rquote|right|&lt;small&gt;Why do we play a part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the [[Second World War]]? How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, free copies of the [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', are given to schools to indoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events. And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history.&lt;/small&gt;|''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995)&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt;}}
Icke's next manuscript, ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995), contained a chapter questioning aspects of the Holocaust, which caused a rift with his publisher, Gateway.&lt;ref name=Honigsbaum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biggestsecret/andtruthfreebook/truthfree07.htm "Chapter Seven: Master races"], ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', Ryde: Bridge of Love Publications, 1995, 127–146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=off&gt;Will Offley, [http://www.publiceye.org/Icke/Ickequotes.htm "Selected Quotes Of David Icke"], Political Research Associates, 23 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

After borrowing £15,000 from a friend, Icke set up Bridge of Love Publications, later called David Icke Books. He self-published ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', and all his work thereafter. Icke wrote in 2004 that ''And the Truth'' was one of his proudest achievements.&lt;ref name=IckeTruthintro&gt;Icke, ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', Introduction to 21st century edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt; 

According to Lewis and Kahn, Icke set about consolidating all conspiracy theories into one project with unlimited explanatory power. His books sold 140,000 copies between 1998 and 2011, at a value of over £2 million.&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011/&gt; Thirty thousand copies of ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999) were in print months after publication, according to Icke,&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA106 106].&lt;/ref&gt; and it was reprinted six times between 1999 and 2006. His 2002 book, ''Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster'', became a long-standing top-five bestseller in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75/&gt; By 2006, his website was getting 600,000 hits a week, and by 2011 his books had been translated into 11 languages.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011/&gt;

===Lecturing===
[[File:David Icke, 7 June 2013 (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Icke speaking in June 2013]]
Icke became known, in particular, for his lengthy lectures. By 2006, he had lectured in at least 25 countries, attracting audiences of several thousand each time.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt; He lectured for seven hours to 2,500 people at the [[Brixton Academy]], London, in 2008,&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250650/ "David Icke: ''Beyond the Cutting Edge'' (2008)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same year addressed the [[University of Oxford]]'s debating society, the [[Oxford Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Evans, [http://www.newstatesman.com/life-and-society/2008/03/icke-world-conspiracy "Interview: David Icke"], ''New Statesman'', 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Marre, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/7days/story/0,,2243708,00.html "Pendennis"], ''The Observer'', 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCwAcJ78a8A "David Icke Live at the Oxford Union Debating Society"], produced by Linda Atherton, Commonage, February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His book tour for ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' (2010) included a sell-out talk to 2,100 in [[New York City|New York]] and £83,000 worth of ticket sales in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. In October 2012, he delivered a 10-hour lecture to 6,000 people at London's [[Wembley Arena]].&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011&gt;Harriet Alexander, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/8933565/David-Icke-would-you-believe-it.html "David Icke – would you believe it?"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For London, Susie Mesure, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/david-icke-is-not-the-messiah-or-even-that-naughty-but-boy-can-he-drone-on-8229433.html "David Icke is not the Messiah. Or even that naughty. But boy, can he drone on"], ''The Independent'', 27 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage, politics, television===
In 1997, Icke met his second wife, Pamela Leigh Richards, in [[Jamaica]]. He and Linda Atherton divorced in 2001,&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139-140&gt;Robertson 2016, 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; and he and Richards were married the same year.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt; However, the couple separated in 2008 and divorced in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke stood for parliament in the [[Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008|2008 by-election]] for [[Haltemprice and Howden (UK Parliament constituency)|Haltemprice and Howden]] (an [[East Yorkshire]] constituency), on the issue of "Big Brother—The Big Picture". He came 12th out of 26 candidates, with 110 votes (0.46%), resulting in a lost [[Deposit (politics)|deposit]].&lt;ref name="Robertson2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7501046.stm "Haltemprice and Howden: Result in full"], BBC News, 11 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wainwright, Allegra Stratton and agencies, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/11/haltemprice.byelections1 "Haltemprice and Howden byelection: Davis sees off Loonies and claims victory in 42-day detention battle"], ''The Guardian'', 11 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that he was standing because "if we don't face this now we are going to have some serious explaining to do when we are asked by our children and grandchildren what we were doing when the global fascist state was installed. 'I was watching ''[[EastEnders]]'', dear' will not be good enough."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120213180350/http://www.votewise.co.uk/index.php?pg=show&amp;c=1076&amp;eid=MP0003-0&amp;this=1076 "David ICKE stood for the None (No Party)"], VoteWise, accessed 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Naughton, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4226273.ece "Reptilians beware – David Icke is back!"], ''The Times'', 27 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Icke launched an internet television station, [[The People's Voice (internet TV station)|The People's Voice]], broadcast from London. He founded the station after crowdsourcing over £300,000 and worked for it as a volunteer until March 2014. As of that year, the station had stopped broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Jivanda, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/david-icke-launches-internet-tv-station-the-people-s-voice-8962731.html "David Icke launches internet TV station The People's Voice"], ''The Independent'', 25 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeoplesvoice.tv/ ''The People's Voice 2.0''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518144619/http%3A//thepeoplesvoice.tv/ |date=18 May 2016 }}, thepeoplesvoice.tv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTPVchannel ''The People's Voice''], YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key ideas==
===Overview===
Icke combines New Age philosophical discussion about the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and [[paedophilia|paedophiles]]. He argues in favour of [[reincarnation]]; a collective consciousness that has [[intentionality]]; [[modal realism]] (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] (that good and bad thoughts can attract experiences).&lt;ref&gt;For law of attraction, Icke, ''Children of the Matrix'', 291ff, and ''The Biggest Secret'', 30–40. For other possible worlds, Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

In ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999), he introduced the idea that many prominent figures derive from the [[Anunnaki]], a reptilian race from the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco constellation]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' (2012), he identified the [[Moon]] (and later [[Saturn]]) as the source of [[holographic]] experiences, broadcast by the reptiles, that humanity interprets as reality.&lt;ref name=Icke2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt; David Icke also thinks that [[global warming|climate change]] is a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/dec/06/more-terrifying-than-trump-the-booming-conspiracy-culture-of-climate-science-denial|title=More terrifying than Trump? The booming conspiracy culture of climate science denial|year=2016|newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Readfearn|first1=Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinite dimensions===
Icke believes that the universe is made up of "vibrational" energy, and consists of an infinite number of dimensions that share the same space, just like television and radio frequencies, and that some people can tune their consciousness to other wavelengths.&lt;ref name=Biggest26&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH"&gt;{{cite web |author1=James Ward |title=Mocked prophet: what is David Icke's appeal? |url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4797/mocked-prophet-what-is-david-ickes-appeal |website=New Humanist |accessdate=15 June 2018 |date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated in an interview with [[The Guardian]] that:

{{cquote|
Our five senses can access only a tiny frequency range, like a radio tuned to one station. In the space you are occupying now are all the radio and television stations broadcasting to your area. You can't see them and they can't see each other because they are on different wavelengths. But move your radio dial and suddenly there they are, one after the other. It is the same with the reality we experience here as 'life'. What we call the 'world' and the 'universe' is only one frequency range in an infinite number sharing the same space.&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006/&gt;
}}

Icke believes that time is an illusion; there is no past, or future, and only the "infinite now" is real, and that humans are an aspect of consciousness, or infinite awareness, which he describes as "all that there is, has been, and ever can be".&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

===Reptoid hypothesis{{anchor|reptoid}}===
{{further|New World Order (conspiracy theory)}}
[[File:Draco Hevelius.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=drawing|The [[Draco (constellation)|Draco constellation]] from ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia'' (1690)  by [[Johannes Hevelius]]. Icke's "reptoid hypothesis" posits that humanity is ruled by descendants of reptilians from Draco.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA105 105].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Icke proposes that an inter-dimensional race of reptilian beings called the [[Archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]], have hijacked the earth, and are stopping humanity from realising its true potential.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt; He claims they are the same beings as; the [[Anunnaki]] [[deities]] from the [[Babylonia]]n creation myth, the ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', and the fallen angels, or [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]], who mated with human women in the [[Biblical apocrypha]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 19–25, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Archons--&gt; Icke believes that a genetically modified human/Archon hybrid race of shape-shifting reptilians, known as the "Babylonian Brotherhood", or the [[Illuminati]], manipulate global events to keep humans in a constant state of fear, so the Archons can feed off the 'negative energy' this creates.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 52ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999), Icke identified the Brotherhood as descendants of reptilians from the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], and said that they live in caverns inside the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 140ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Icke said in an interview:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
"When you get back into the ancient world, you find this recurring theme of a union between a non-human race and humans—creating a hybrid race."

"From 1998, I started coming across people who told me they had seen people change into a non-human form. It's an age-old phenomenon known as shape-shifting. The basic form is like a scaly humanoid, with reptilian rather than humanoid eyes."&lt;ref name="Scotsman2006"&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/the-royal-family-are-bloodsucking-alien-lizards-david-icke-1-1103954 "The Royal Family are bloodsucking alien lizards – David Icke"], ''The Scotsman'', 30 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Icke claims the first reptilian-human breeding programmes took place 200,000–300,000 years ago (perhaps creating [[Adam]]),&lt;ref name=Icke1999p40/&gt; and the third (and latest) 7,000 years ago. Icke claims the hybrids of the third programme, which are more Anunnaki than human, currently control the world. He writes in ''The Biggest Secret'' that: "The Brotherhood which controls the world today is the modern expression of the Babylonian Brotherhood of reptile-[[Aryan]] priests and 'royalty'". Icke states that they came together in [[Sumer]] after [[Genesis flood narrative|'the flood']], but originated in the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Icke1999p52&gt;Icke, ''Biggest Secret'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Icke1999p43&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining that when he uses the term "Aryan" he is referring to "the white race."&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke states that the reptilians not only come from another planet, but also from another dimension, the lower level of the fourth dimension (the "lower [[Astral plane|astral dimension]]"), the one nearest the physical world.&lt;ref name=Biggest26/&gt; It is from this dimensions that they control the planet, although just as fourth-dimensional reptilians control us, they in turn are controlled by a fifth dimension.&lt;ref name=Biggest26&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Barkun argues that Icke's introduction of different dimensions allowed him to skip awkward questions about how the reptilians got here.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106/&gt; 

Icke believes that the only way this 'Archontic' influence can be defeated is by humanity waking up to 'the truth', and filling their hearts with love.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

Icke briefly introduced his [[Ancient astronaut hypothesis|ancient-astronaut hypothesis]] in ''The Robot's Rebellion'' (1994), citing [[Milton William Cooper|Bill Cooper]]'s ''Behold a Pale Horse'' (1991), and expanded it in ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995), citing Barbara Marciniak's ''Bringers of the Dawn'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Barbara Marciniak wrote that ''Bringers of the Dawn'' was a [[Mediumship|channelled]] book dictated from the [[Pleiades in folklore and literature|Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Marciniak, ''Bringers of the Dawn'', Rochester: Bear &amp; Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robertson writes that Icke's reptilian idea is adapted from [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s ''The 12th Planet'' (1976), combined with material from [[Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa|Credo Mutwa]], a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] healer.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2013, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Sitchin suggested that the Anunnaki came to Earth for its precious metals. Icke has said that they came for what he refers to as 'mono-atomic gold', which he claims, can increase the capacity of the [[nervous system]] ten thousandfold, and that after ingesting it, the Anunnaki can process vast amounts of information, speed up trans-dimensional travel, and [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] from reptilian to human.&lt;ref name=Icke1999p30&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p81&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Kahn argue that Icke is using [[allegory]] to depict the alien, and alienating, nature of global capitalism.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p82/&gt; Icke has said he is not using allegory.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2003, the reptilian bloodline is claimed to encompassed 43 American presidents, three British and two Canadian prime ministers, several Sumerian kings and Egyptian pharaohs, and a smattering of celebrities. Key bloodlines include the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]]s, [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]]s, various European aristocratic families, the establishment families of the Eastern United States, and the British [[House of Windsor]].&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104/&gt; Icke confirmed to [[Andrew Neil]] in May 2016 that he believes the British Royal Family are shape-shifting lizards.&lt;ref name=Neil20May2016&gt;Andrew Neil, [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36339298 "David Icke on 9/11 and lizards in Buckingham Palace theories"], ''This Week'', BBC (video), 20 May 2016, 00:04:02.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] in 2001 as "seriously reptilian",&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104/&gt; and said he had seen [[Ted Heath]]'s eyes turn black while the two waited for a Sky News interview in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/22/broadcasting.observermagazine "This much I know"], interviewed by Ben Mitchell, ''The Observer'', 22 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006&gt;Paul Doyle, [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/feb/17/smalltalk.sportinterviews "David Icke"], ''The Guardian'', 17 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brotherhood aims and institutions====
At the apex of the Babylonian Brotherhood stand the Global Elite, and at the top of the Global Elite are what Icke refers to as the 'Prison Wardens'. Icke claims the goal of the Brotherhood, or their "Great Work of Ages", is a microchipped population, a world government, and a global [[Orwellian]] [[Fascism|fascist]] state, or [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]], which he claims will be a [[post-truth]] era where [[freedom of speech]] is ended.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103/&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil20May2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA104 104].&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke believes that the "Brotherhood" use human anxiety as energy, and that the Archons keep humanity trapped in a "five sense reality", so they can feed off the negative energy created by fear and hate.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p82&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming the more of these emotions that can be stimulated the more energy the reptilians have to work with, Icke wrote in 1999: "Thus we have the encouragement of wars, human genocide, the mass slaughter of animals, sexual perversions which create highly charged negative energy, and black magic ritual and sacrifice which takes place on a scale that will stagger those who have not studied the subject."&lt;ref name=Icke1999p40&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke proposes that human sacrifice 'to the gods' in the ancient world was for the benefit of the reptilians, especially sacrifice of children, because "at the moment of death by sacrifice a form of adrenalin surges through the body, accumulating at the base of the brain and is, apparently more potent in children", claiming "this is what the reptilians and their crossbreeds want". Icke suggests that these sacrifices continue to this day.&lt;ref name=Icke1999p40&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims the reptilians and their hybrid bloodlines engage in [[pedophilia]] and [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is claimed that the Brotherhood either created, or controls; the [[United Nations]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Round Table (club)|Round Table]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Chatham House]], [[Club of Rome]], [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]], [[Trilateral Commission]] and [[Bilderberg Group]], as well as the media, military, [[CIA]], [[MI6]], [[Mossad]], science, religion, and the [[Internet]], with witting or unwitting support from the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Children of the Matrix'', 339.

==== Controversy of antisemitism ====

David Icke has been accused of antisemitism on numerous occasions. After Icke's talk in Vancouver on Sept. 2 2017, the Canadian Jewish News called Icke "a controversial conspiracy theorist, anti-Semite and Holocaust denier" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gindin |first1=Matthew |title=Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theorist David Icke Gives Talk in Vancouver |url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/anti-semitic-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-gives-talk-vancouver |website=[[The Canadian Jewish News]] | publisher=The Canadian Jewish News |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following complaints from the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] in 2000, Icke was briefly detained by immigration officials in Canada where he was booked for a speaking tour,&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001/&gt; and his books were removed from [[Indigo Books]], a Canadian chain. Several stops on the tour were cancelled by the venues, as was a lecture in London.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Kraft, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301204725/http://www.cjnews.com/pastIssues/99/oct7-99/front2.htm "New Age speaker set to talk in Toronto"], ''The Canadian Jewish News'', 7 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Cowley, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5116145.html "The Icke Files"], ''The Independent on Sunday'', 1 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Two venues in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], cancelled live events scheduled to be hosted by Icke in 2017 following accusations of antisemitism. The Maritim hotel did not give a reason for the cancellation, but The Carl Benz Arena stated on its [[Facebook]] page that it was due to the "contentious nature and the contradictory statements, which for us as a politically neutral event venue do not give a clear picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lizard conspiracist David Icke not wanted in Berlin|url=http://www.dw.com/en/lizard-conspiracist-david-icke-not-wanted-in-berlin/a-37693384|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An event to be held at [[Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] was also cancelled in 2017, with the venue stating it was due to Icke's "objectionable views."&lt;ref name="GuardianManU"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Jamie |title=Manchester United cancel David Icke show at Old Trafford after backlash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/17/manchester-united-cancel-david-icke-show-at-old-trafford-social-media-backlash |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=11 June 2018|date=2017-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Icke repeatedly denies he is an anti-Semite and many of the people Icke has publicly named as reptilian are not Jewish. In 2001, when questioned by [[Jon Ronson]], Icke declared that the Protocols of Zion is evidence not of a Jewish plot, but of a reptilian plot. Icke also stated: "the families in positions of great financial power obsessively interbreed with each other. But I'm not talking about one earth race, Jewish or non-Jewish. I'm talking about a genetic network that operates through all races, this bloodline being a fusion of human and reptilian genes....let me make myself clear - this does not in any way relate to an earth race." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ronson |first1=Jon| authorlink=Jon Ronson |title=Beset by Lizards |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/17/features.weekend |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate= 6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His message is consistent over time.  However, he tends to refer to the reptilian plot as the "unseen".  After Icke's 2018 talk in Southport, UK, [[Michael Marshall (skeptic)|Michael Marshall]] reported:

{{quote|
"The appearance of the ‘unseen’ in the Middle East 6,000 years ago seems to be no coincidence, and it’s little wonder that Icke’s work is so often accused of anti-Semitism. However, if we were to accept that Icke himself does not hold such views, and that his work is merely co-opted by groups who undeniably are anti-Semitic, we also have to acknowledge that Icke often does his case no favours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Michael | authorlink=Michael Marshall (skeptic) |title=David Icke Live: What I Learned From Spending Four Hours With The World's Most Famous Conspiracy Theorist |url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/05/david-icke-live-what-i-learned-from-spending-four-hours-with-the-worlds-most-famous-conspiracy-theorist/ |website=Gizmodo - UK |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Problem–reaction–solution===
Icke uses the phrase 'problem–reaction–solution' to explain how he believes the Illuminati agenda advances. They guide the population in the direction they desire by creating false problems, which then creates a reaction from the target population, which then allows them to give their desired solution to the problem they created.&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139&gt;Robertson 2016, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He also refers to this process as "order out of chaos".&lt;ref name=IckeNov152009&gt;David Icke, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101206225716/http://www.newsforthesoul.com/icke-2.htm "Problem-reaction-solution"], ''News for the Soul'', accessed 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents and issues Icke attributes to the Illuminati, or 'Global Elite', include the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], [[Dunblane school massacre|Dunblane]], [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]], [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11]] (which Icke believes was an '[[False flag|inside job]]' to provide an excuse to advance an agenda of [[regime change]] across the world), [[7/7]], [[global warming]], [[Chemtrail conspiracy theory|chemtrails]], [[water fluoridation]], the death of [[Princess Diana]], the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Agenda 21]].&lt;ref name="Scotsman2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For 9/11, Icke, ''Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For global warming and Agenda 21, Icke, ''Phantom Self'', 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LEP911"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Henry Widdas |title=David Icke: My unanswered 9/11 questions |url=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/opinion/david-icke-my-unanswered-9-11-questions-1-9196768 |website=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] |accessdate=19 June 2018 |language=English |date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents then allow them to respond in whatever way they intended to act in the first place.&lt;ref name=IckeNov152009&gt;David Icke, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101206225716/http://www.newsforthesoul.com/icke-2.htm "Problem-reaction-solution"], ''News for the Soul'', accessed 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the methods Icke claims they use is creating fake opposites, or what he calls "opposames", such as the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] of World War II, which he believes were used to provoke the creation of the [[European Union]] and the state of [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139&gt;Robertson 2016, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke argues that to ensure the outcome they want, they have to control both sides.&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled" /&gt; He believes that the [[President of the United States|US presidents]] [[George W. Bush]], [[Barack Obama]] and [[Donald Trump]] are part of a false [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] political divide. Despite the presidency belonging to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] then the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], then going back to the Republicans, Icke claims they are all pushing the same agenda of regime change in the [[Middle East]], a goal which was set out in the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] in a document called [[The Project for the New American Century]].&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled" /&gt; Icke claims that this [[Hegelian Dialectic|dialectic]] allows the Illuminati to gradually move societies toward [[totalitarianism]] without challenge, a process he refers to as the "totalitarian tiptoe".&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139/&gt;

In ''Tales From The Time Loop'' (2003), Icke argues that the Illuminati create religious, racial, ethnic and sexual division to [[divide and rule]] humanity but believes that the many can only be controlled by the few if they allow themselves to be, and that the power the Illuminati have is the power the people give away to them.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Icke |title=Tales from the Time Loop: The Most Comprehensive Expose of the Global Conspiracy Ever Written and All You Need to Know to be Truly Free |date=30 September 2003 |publisher=Bridge of Love |isbn=978-0953881048 |page=447 |edition=First |language=0953881040}} &lt;/ref&gt; Writing: "Divide and rule is the bottom line of all dictatorships...Arab is turned against Jew, black against white, Right against Left. Unplugging from the Matrix means refusing to recognise these illusory fault lines. We are all One. I refuse to see a Jew as different from an Arab and vice versa. They are both expressions of the One and need to be observed and treated the same, none more or less important than the other. I refuse to see black people in terms that I would not see white, nor to see the ‘Left’ as I would not see the ‘Right’. How could it be any different, except when we believe the illusion of division is real? If we do that, the Matrix has us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Icke |title=Tales from the Time Loop: The Most Comprehensive Expose of the Global Conspiracy Ever Written and All You Need to Know to be Truly Free |date=30 September 2003 |publisher=Bridge of Love |isbn=978-0953881048 |page=447 |edition=First |language=0953881040}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Icke's solution is peaceful [[non-compliance]], which he believes will disempower 'the elite'.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Dresses===
[[File:Red Dress Programmes by Neil Hague.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing|Image by Neil Hague from Icke's ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth'' (2005), showing [[Queen Elizabeth II]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] as ''Red Dresses'', the highest level of the Brotherhood.]]
In ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth'' (2005), Icke introduces his three categories of people. The Brotherhood are "interactive software programs", or "Red Dresses". They lack consciousness and free will, and their human bodies are holographic veils.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth: ''Everything'' Else is Illusion'', Wildwood, MO: Bridge of Love Publications, 2005, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; A second group, the "[[sheeple]]" (the vast majority of humanity), are conscious, but do as they are told and are the Brotherhood's main energy source. They include the "repeaters", people in positions of influence who repeat what other people tell them; he cites doctors, teachers and journalists as examples.&lt;ref name=Love78/&gt;

The third and smallest group are those who see through the illusion; they are usually dubbed dangerous or mad. The Red Dress genetic lines interbreed obsessively to make sure their bloodlines are not weakened by the second or third levels of consciousness, because consciousness can rewrite the software.&lt;ref name=Love78&gt;Icke, ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth'', 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Channel52006&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcQzOZmJykk "David Icke: Was He Right?"], [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], 12 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saturn–Moon Matrix===
The Moon Matrix is introduced in ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' (2010), in which Icke suggests that the Earth and collective human mind are manipulated from the Moon, a [[hollow moon|spacecraft]] and inter-dimensional portal controlled by the reptilians. The Moon Matrix is a broadcast from that spacecraft to the human body–computer, specifically to the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]] of the brain, which gives us our sense of reality: "We are living in a dreamworld within a dreamworld—a Matrix within the virtual-reality universe—and it is being broadcast from the Moon. Unless people force themselves to become fully conscious, their minds are the Moon's mind."&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2010, 618, 627, 632.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Liam O'Brien |title=Prize-winning author Alice Walker gives support to David Icke on Desert Island Discs |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/prize-winning-author-alice-walker-gives-support-to-david-icke-on-desert-island-discs-8622648.html |website=Independent |accessdate=19 June 2018 |language=English |date=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is further explored in Icke's ''Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From'' (2012), where he introduces the concept of the "Saturn–Moon Matrix". In this more recent conceptualization, the rings of Saturn (which Icke believes were artificially created by reptilian spacecraft) are the ultimate source of the signal, while the Moon functions as an amplifier.&lt;ref name=Icke2012&gt;David Icke, ''Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2012.&lt;!--page number--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that frequencies broadcast from the [[Saturn's hexagon|hexagonal storm on Saturn]] are amplified through the hollow structure of our artificial moon keeping humanity trapped in a holographic projection.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

Icke states in ''And the truth shall set you free'' (1996):{{quote|why do we play a part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the Second World War? How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, free copies of the Spielberg film, Schindler's List, are given to schools to indoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events. And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history.&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt;}}

Icke claims that the antisemitic forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' is genuine, explaining in ''And the truth shall set you free'': {{quote|I strongly believe that a small Jewish clique which has contempt for the mass of Jewish people worked with non-Jews to create the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the Second World War....They then dominated the Versailles Peace Conference and created the circumstances which made the Second World War inevitable.

Icke claims that Jews themselves are to blame for antisemitism (a classic Nazi claim that can be traced to [[Adolf Hitler]]): {{quote|Thought patterns in the collective Jewish mind have repeatedly created that physical reality of oppression, prejudice and racism which matches the pattern—the expectation—programmed into their collective psyche.

[[Political Research Associates]] described Icke's politics as "a mishmash of most of the dominant themes of contemporary neofascism, mixed in with a smattering of topics culled from the U.S. militia movement."  He opposes [[gun control]], and claims that many [[mass shooting]]s were orchestrated in order to increase public opposition to guns. He accuses the U.S. government of carrying out the [[Oklahoma City bombing]].&lt;ref name=holocaust&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publiceye.org/Icke/IckeBackgrounder.htm |title=David Icke And The Politics Of Madness Where The New Age Meets The Third Reich |last=Offley |first=Will |publisher=[[Political Research Associates]] |date=29 February 2000|accessdate=2 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He endorses or recommends antisemitic and [[far-right]] publications such as ''[[The Spotlight|Spotlight]]'' and ''On Target'', the magazine of the [[white supremacist]] group the "[[British League of Rights]]", and he has been closely associated with antisemitic "New Age" periodicals such as ''[[Nexus (magazine)|Nexus]]'' and ''Rainbow Ark'', a "New Age" magazine financed by far-right activists and affiliated with the neo-Nazi [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].&lt;ref name=nazi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rainbow Ark magazine |url=https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Rainbow_Ark_magazine |publisher=[[Center for Media and Democracy]] |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neo-Nazi terrorist group Combat 18 promotes Icke's lectures in its internal journal ''Putsch''; at one such event, the journal states approvingly, Icke {{quote|spoke of "the sheep" and how the Zionist-operated government, sorry, "Illuminati", uses them for its own ends.

David G. Robertson in his book, ''UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age'', stated that Icke was not anti-Semitic. Saying that in order to believe that when Icke said reptilians he really meant Jews, was just easier for some to accept than that he literally means extraterrestrial reptilians control world politics. Pointing out that in order to believe the accusations of antisemitism you must ignore numerous things. Such as, the many high profile people he names as reptilian who are not Jewish, a point which was also made by [[Jon Ronson]] in his 2001 documentary ''Secret Rulers Of The World''. You must also ignore the frequent statements by Icke that he is speaking literally and not metaphorically. And you must ignore the fact he identifies the supposedly reptilian ruling elite as '[[Aryan]]' in several places, which specifically contradicts the idea that reptilian is code for 'Jew'. Also noting that Icke denounces racism calling it "the ultimate idiocy"&lt;ref name="Robertson1" /&gt;

[[Michael Barkun]] has described Icke's position as New Age [[conspiracism]], writing that Icke is the most fluent of the genre,&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA98 98]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA103 103ff], 163.&lt;/ref&gt; describing his work as "improvisational [[millennialism]]", with an end-of-history scenario involving a final battle between good and evil. Barkun defines improvisional [[millennialism]] as an "act of [[bricolage]]": because everything is connected in the conspiracist world view, every source can be mined for links.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA10 10–11], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA107 107–108], 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Add that 9/11 made conspiracism and therefore Icke more popular--&gt; Barkun argues that Icke has actively tried to cultivate the radical right stating that "There is no fuller explication of [their] beliefs about ruling elites than Icke's." He also notes that Icke regards Christian patriots as the only Americans who understand the "New World Order".&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA106 106], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA108 108].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA107 107].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Icke spoke to a conference in [[Reno, Nevada]], alongside opponents of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]], including Kirk Lyons, a lawyer who has represented the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106/&gt; But it has been pointed out that Icke has never been a member of any right wing group, and has criticised them.&lt;ref name="Robertson1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David G. Robertson |title=UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age |date=25 February 2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1474253208 |pages=150–151 |edition=First |language=English |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying on [[Douglas Kellner]]'s distinction between clinical [[paranoia]] and a "critical paranoia" that confronts power, Richard Kahn and Tyson Lewis argue that Icke displays elements of both, and that his reptilian hypothesis and "postmodern metanarrative" may be [[Allegory|allegorical]], a [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftian]] [[satire]] used to give ordinary people a narrative with which to question what they see around them and to alert them to the alleged emergence of a global fascist state.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 73ff, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyson Lewis, Richard Kahn, "The Reptoid Hypothesis: Utopian and Dystopian Representational Motifs in David Icke's Alien Conspiracy Theory," ''Utopian Studies'', 16(1), Spring 2005 (45–74), 52, 55–56. {{jstor|20718709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 88ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to Icke's prominence, public figures are regularly asked whether they are lizards. An [[Official Information Act 1982|Official Information Act]] request was filed in New Zealand in 2008 to ask this of [[John Key]], the then prime minister, and Facebook's [[Mark Zuckerberg]] was asked the same during a Q&amp;A in 2016. (Both men said they were not lizards. Key added that he had taken the unusual step of consulting not only a doctor but a vet.)&lt;ref&gt;Ben Guarino, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/15/i-am-not-a-lizard-mark-zuckerberg-is-latest-celebrity-asked-about-reptilian-conspiracy/ "‘I am not a lizard’: Mark Zuckerberg is latest celebrity asked about reptilian conspiracy"], ''The Washington Post'', 15 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 survey in the United States by [[Public Policy Polling]], 4% believed that "'lizard people' control our societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/04/conspiracy-theory-poll-results-.html "Conspiracy Theory Poll Results"], Public Policy Polling, 2 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harris, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/02/americans-obama-anti-christ-conspiracy-theories "One in four Americans think Obama may be the antichrist, survey says"], ''The Guardian'', 2 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olga Oksman, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/07/conspiracy-theory-paranoia-aliens-illuminati-beyonce-vaccines-cliven-bundy-jfk "Conspiracy craze: why 12 million Americans believe alien lizards rule us"], ''The Guardian'', 7 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Ward states that "In some ways, you could say [Icke's] been vindicated. For years he has claimed that people operating at the highest levels of the establishment were members of secret paedophile networks, claims that now routinely appear on the front pages of our newspapers. Many of the people at the centre of these stories were even specifically named by Icke in print years ago." Except that, "even on this issue Icke’s credibility is compromised by his habit of naming more or less everyone and claiming they are all part of the same network. Inevitably, he’s going to be right once in a while – after all, if you throw enough shit at a stopped clock, some of it will stick. And throw shit he does." Adding that, Icke's underlying message is positive, which "might hint at why it appeals to some": as Icke said at Wembley in 2012, "If we want a world of love and peace, we have to be loving and peaceful with everyone, even people we don't like."&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

'''Dragutin "Dragiša" Lapčević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Драгутин "Драгиша" Лапчевић}}; 1867–1939) was a Serbian politician, journalist, and historian. He was one of the founders, alongside [[Dimitrije Tucović]], of the [[Serbian Social Democratic Party (1903-1918)|Serbian Social Democratic Party]] (existed 1903-1918), that supported a [[Balkan Federation]] during the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. He was a staunch opposer of [[Greater Serbia]].

==Life==
Dragiša was born in Užice in 1867. The family moved to Požega when Lapčević was the age of three or four. There he completed his grammar school education, after which he continued to educate himself by attending lectures in political science and economics and reading smuggled socialist material into the Kingdom of Serbia at a time when Anti-Socialist Laws were instituted. Initially, he worked as an unskilled laborer, first in a bakery and in a mechanic shop. Later, he was appointed as a municipal clerk. There he gained a reputation as a brilliant public speaker and was elected as municipal opposition president in 1893, but the Serbian government annulled it.&lt;ref name="republika"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yurope.com/zines/republika/arhiva/99/222/222_28.html |title=Dragisa Lapcevic |publisher=Yurope.com |date= |accessdate = 1. 4. 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by [[Svetozar Marković]],  he supported the ideas of [[Karl Kautsky]] and opposed those of [[Georgi Plekhanov]].

He was considered the most important Serbian theoretician of the Marxist labour movement after the death of its founders, and it may well be said that he was its most representative member as an anti-Bolshevik. In him were very clearly incorporated both the revolutionary and the reactionary aspects of that movement.

In polemics with the left wing of the party, headed by [[Dimitrije Tucović]], Lapčević often adopted centrist and right-opportunist positions. From 1905 to 1908 and again from 1912 to 1919, he was a deputy in the Skupština (Assembly), where he won a great international  reputation by voting against war budgets ahead of the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–13 and [[World War I]], advocating a [[Balkan Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GgZNvUDRYt8C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Balkan+Federation%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=21#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Balkan%20Federation%22&amp;f=false |title=William English Walling, The Socialists and the War |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate = 1. 4. 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war period, he refused to join the Bolsheviks. He was an opponent of Bolshevik influence in the workers' movement of the then Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yurope.com/zines/republika/arhiva/2002/288-289/288-289_11.html |title=Socijaldemokratska tradicija Srbije |publisher=Yurope.com |date= |accessdate = 1. 4. 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 20 to 23 April 1919, delegates from Social democratic parties of Serbia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Vojvodina, Montenegro, Croatia-Slavonia and Macedonia met to found the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia which immediately joined the [[Communist International]] against the advice of Lapčević. At the organization's Second Congress held in [[Vukovar]] from 20 to 24 June 1920, the less radically inclined centrist faction led by Dragiša Lapčević and Žarko Topalović was expelled. In 1921 Dragiša Lapčević was one of the organizers of the reformist Socialist Party of Yugoslavia. In the early 1920s, Lapčević left politics and withdrew from the workers' movement, not wanting to take further part in the polemics of the opposing parties.

He was the author of many works on ethnology and the history of the economy and the workers’ movement in Serbia, among them The History of Socialism in Serbia (1922).

'''Erwin Heinz Ackerknecht''' (1 June 1906 in [[Stettin]] – 18 November 1988 in [[Zurich]]) was an active and influential [[Trotskyist]] in the 1930s who had to flee Germany in 1933 after [[Hitler]]’s rise to power. It was in the United States, the country that granted him citizenship, that Ackerknecht became an influential historian of medicine. He wrote groundbreaking works on the social and ecological dimensions of disease and was a forerunner of contemporary trends in social and [[cultural history]]. He became the first Chair in the history of medicine at the [[University of Wisconsin]]; the second such position in the United States.&lt;ref name=BoHM&gt;Rosenberg, Charles E., "Erwin H. Ackerknecht, Social Medicine, and the History of Medicine", ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'', Volume 81, Number 3, Fall 2007, pp. 511–532&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Erwin H. Ackerknecht 1931.jpg|thumb|Erwin H. Ackerknecht, 1931]]
Erwin Heinz Ackerknecht was born in [[Stettin]], now called [[Szczecin]]. His father, Dr. Erin Julius Ackerknecht, was a renowned librarian, author, literary critic and professor of literary history. He studied [[medicine]] (and sporadically economics, history of literature and arts) eventually graduating from the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1931 with a dissertation on a study of [[Germany|German]] medical reform in 1848.  Throughout his studies Ackerknecht was affiliated with communist student groups in [[Freiburg]], [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]]; in 1926 he joined the KJVT (Kommunistisher Jugendverband Deutschlands; Communist Youth Federation of Germany) and then the KPD (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands; [[Communist Party of Germany]]). As a student he was known as the leader of the KoStyFra (Kommunistische Studentenfraktion; Communist Student's Fraction). Together with [[Robert Soblen]] and [[Otto Schüssler]] he founded in 1928 a small oppositional group at [[Leipzig]] called the Bolschewistische Einheit (Bolshevik Unity). He was also affiliated with the Lenin League. In March 1934, Ackerknecht became one of the founding members of the United Left Opposition. Meanwhile, he was expelled from the KPD. After having moved from Leipzig to Berlin, he became a member of the 'political committee' of the Left Opposition of the KPD, the "Bolshevists-Leninists, the official German branch of the International Left Opposition led by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his son [[Lev Sedov]]. Ackerknecht closely co-operated with Sedov, Grylewicz and other prominent activists of the Trotskyist movement and became a co-editor and staff writer of the LO using the pseudonym ''Bauer''.&lt;ref name="trotskyana.net"&gt;Wolfgang and Petra Lubitz, "Erwin H. Ackerknecht, bio-bibliographical sketch", ''Lubitz Trotsyananet'', 2004, http://www.trotskyana.net/Trotskyists/Bio-Bibliographies/bio-bibliographies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Nazis seized power in Germany, Ackerknecht, now one of the central figures of German Trotskyism, went
underground. He fled Germany in June 1933, spent a short time in [[Czechoslovakia]] and paid visit to [[Leon Trotsky]] in exile in [[Turkey]]. He eventually broke with [[Trotskyism]] and [[Marxism]] and turned his back to political activism. However, his opposition against [[Nazism]] and right wing politics of all kinds remained unrelenting. While in exile in [[Paris]] he earned his living as a translator and began to study [[ethnography]] at the [[Musée de l'Homme]] with [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], and [[Paul Rivet]]. He graduated from the [[Sorbonne]] shortly before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. He joined the [[France|French]] army and eventually fled to southern France where he waited for several months for his American visa. He arrived in [[New York City]] in July 1941 together with his second wife.&lt;ref name="trotskyana.net"/&gt;

He was first employed as a fellow in the history of medicine at [[Johns Hopkins University]] while working as assistant curator at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He was then offered a position as the [[University of Wisconsin]]'s first Chair in the history of medicine. His ''A short history of medicine'', was published in 1955 but the most active years of his academic life was when he moved to the [[University of Zurich]] (Switzerland), a position he kept until his retirement in 1971.&lt;ref name="trotskyana.net"/&gt;

==Work==
His most influential work was published in the 1940s and 1960s. His major contributions, namely on ethnomedicine, on the reconstruction of the Paris Clinical School, on the ecologically oriented study of nineteenth-century malaria, on a 'behavioral' approach to medical history, on the generally neglected history of therapeutics, and situating medical knowledge in a broad context, have become so intellectually assimilated that they have become 'invisible'.&lt;ref name=BoHM /&gt;

'''François de Bas''' (10 September 1840 &amp;ndash;  22 February 1931) was a Dutch general and military historian. He almost single-handedly founded the military-history section of the Dutch General Staff. He co-authored major historical works on the [[Dutch States Army]] and the Campaign of 1815, which climaxed with the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. The latter work is still the authoritative source on the Dutch-Belgian role in that battle, because it contains copies of after-battle reports of Dutch officers who participated in the battle, the originals of which were lost in a [[Royal Air Force]] bombardment of the Dutch Army archives in 1945.&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton-Williams|first=David|title=Waterloo.

==Life==
De Bas was born in [[The Hague]], the son of Willem Jacobus de Bas, [[Heerlijkheid#The heer|Heer]] of Barwoutswaarder en Bekenes, and Johanna Maria Köhler. He married  Maria Cornelia Wilhelmina Vinkhuyzen on 26 August 1863. They had five surviving children.&lt;ref name=Zwitzer&gt;{{cite web|last=Zwitzer|first=H.L.|title=Bas, François de (1840-1931)|url=http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn3/bas|work=Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland 3|year=1989|location=Den Haag|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After boarding school (the academy of  Guillaume Alexander Burnier in The Hague), De Bas entered the [[Koninklijke Militaire Academie|Royal Dutch Military Academy]] in [[Breda]] as a [[cadet]] of Horse on 4 September 1856. He received a commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in the Third Regiment of [[Dragoon]]s on 1 July 1860. After only four years he was made a [[first lieutenant]] in the Dutch General Staff. In 1868 he was one of four young officers who were admitted to the first class in the Dutch [[Staff college]], from which he graduated, first in the class, in 1872. The same year he was promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]] of Horse in the Second Regiment of [[Hussar]]s. In 1873 he joined the General Staff again as a captain. He served as a professor at the Staff College from 1878 till 1885. In the latter year he was promoted to [[major]] and reassigned to his old cavalry regiment, where he soon received a promotion to [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name=Zwitzer /&gt;

However, soon after that promotion his career was cut short by a scandal in his regiment. His daughter was "seduced" by a fellow officer, a young second lieutenant, and the two young people were forced to marry. In the social circumstances of the Dutch army of the time the scandal also reflected on the father and he was no longer considered worthy of advancement. For that reason he asked to be put on non-active status in August, 1890.&lt;ref name=Zwitzer /&gt;

However, this setback prompted him to embark on a second career, that would bring him much more renown. As a student at the Staff College he had been seconded in 1870 to [[Lieutenant General]] [[Willem Jan Knoop]], the ''doyen'' of Dutch military historians at the time. Knoop had made the suggestion in 1858 to the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] to collect the Dutch military archives and make them available for publication. Though the Academy advised favorably on this project at the time it would take until the 1890s before the plan came to fruition. De Bas became the person to implement the project.&lt;ref name=Zwitzer /&gt;

His qualification for the task was that he already had made a name for himself as a military historian with his biography of [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]] and the wider military history surrounding that general's career (which encompassed the Battle of Waterloo and the [[Belgian Revolution]]). In 1890 De Bas proposed to the Minister for War,  J.W. Bergansius, the founding of a military-history section in the General Staff. Though this proposal was not followed at the time, the Minister gave him a commission to start collecting sources on Dutch military history.&lt;ref name=Zwitzer /&gt;

In 1895 De Bas, still a lieutenant colonel, was formally retired at his own request, but given the titular rank of [[colonel]]. In 1897 he was made director of the Military Archives of the General Staff. He had already received a temporary commission at the Archives of the Dutch royal house in 1892. In the latter function he negotiated in 1900 with the head of the [[House of Nassau]], [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], on behalf of [[Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Queen Emma of the Netherlands]] about the right of the descendants of her daughter, [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], who was about to marry [[Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], to keep using the Nassau name.&lt;ref name=Zwitzer /&gt;

As director of the Military Archives he regularly published the sources he had uncovered. He also (after negotiations with the Belgian government) co-authored a history of the Dutch and Belgian troops in the [[Battle of Quatre-Bras]] and that of Waterloo in four volumes with the colonel of the Belgian General Staff, [[Jacques, count of 'tSerclaes de Wommersom]] that was published in 1908/9. The work may be seen as an attempt to redress the often disparaging account given in especially Anglophone historical works, like the ones by [[William Siborne]] and his son [[Henry Taylor Siborne]], and the British historians that based themselves on their sources, of the conduct of the Dutch and Belgian troops and their commanding officers at those battles.&lt;ref name=Hamilton /&gt;{{rp|19–30}} His efforts in this respect brought him the promotion to titulary [[Major General]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=Zwitzer /&gt;

In 1908 he was joined at the military-history section of the General Staff by lieutenant-colonel (ret.) F.J.G. ten Raa, who had already collected most of the material for a standard work on the history of the Dutch States Army (the army of the [[Dutch Republic]]). The first volume of this work was published in 1911 and De Bas used his position as head of the military-history section to have himself named as co-author of this book, though it was virtually entirely written by Ten Raa. However, this kind of arrangement was not unheard of in academic circles at the time. Ten Raa was recognized as sole author of volumes 6 and 7 in 1940, and 1950, respectively.&lt;ref name=Zwitzer /&gt;

De Bas was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1913. He remained at the military-history section till bad health forced him to resign in 1927, almost 87 years old at the time. He died in 1931 in The Hague.&lt;ref name=Zwitzer /&gt;

'''Gerson David Cohen''' (August 26, 1924 – August 15, 1991) was a Jewish historian, a Conservative [[rabbi]], and the Chancellor of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] from 1972–86.  He was born in New York in 1924. He was especially known for ordaining the first female rabbi in Conservative Judaism in 1985.&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/19/nyregion/gerson-d-cohen-is-dead-at-66-ex-chancellor-of-jewish-seminary.html|title=Gerson D.

'''Hispanismo''' or '''Hispanicism''' is an [[ideology]], [[school of thought]] and [[historiography|historiographic current]] centered on [[Spain|Spanish]] heritage. In [[Hispanic America]] it is similar but unlike most times to [[indigenismo]].&lt;ref name=Montoya1998&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montoya Iriarte |first=Urpi |date=1998 |title=Hispanismo e Indigenismo: o dualismo cultural no pensamento social peruano (1900-1930).

In the case of [[Hispanic America]] these cultural roots are Spanish and indigenous. An important detail is that in hispanismo the Spanish roots are implicitly more important than the indigenous roots. Hispanismo consist of Hispanic American countries building upon their "own heritage" which would be the same as Spanish heritage.&lt;ref name=Gong&gt;{{cite book |last=Góngora |first=Alvaro |last2=de la Taille |first2=Alexandrine|last3=Vial |first3=Gonzalo |author-link3=Gonzalo Vial Correa |date= |title=Jaime Eyzaguirre en su tiempo |url= |language=Spanish |location= |publisher=Zig-Zag |pages=224–225 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|''Because of that the Spaniard is not yet another element in the ethnic conglomerate. He is the decisive factor, the only one that could attract them all... Because of this any attempt to forget the Spanish name in these lands and oppose to him a hyperbolic renewed value of the indigenous, would go straight to attack the lifeblood that unite our peoples. Anything worthy that the ancient civilizations could have had at the moment of decadence when they faced the Spanish conquest was saved and defended by the Spaniards themselves who took with them just in time the instrument of writing, unknown to the indigenous peoples, to perpetuate the history and the traditions of the conquered ones. Whatever the Spaniards destroyed was not comparable with what they contributed with in terms of culture.''| [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rojas Mix |first=Miguel |date=1991 |title=Los cien nombres de América: eso que descubrió Colón |url= |location= |publisher=Editorial de la Universidad de Costa Rica |page=186 |isbn=84-264-1209-2 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Hispanistas==
The ranks of notable supporters of hispanismo include Chilean historian [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]], who rejected liberal historiography in favor of [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] hispanismo.&lt;ref name=Historia&gt;{{Cite journal| url   = http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-656.html

{{History of Australia}}
The '''history wars''' in Australia are an ongoing public debate over the interpretation of the history of the [[Australian history#British settlement and colonisation|British colonisation of Australia]] and development of contemporary Australian society (particularly with regard to the impact on [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]]).

The Australian debate often concerns the extent to which the history of European colonisation post-1788 and government administration since Federation in 1901 may be characterised as having been:

*a relatively minor conflict between European colonists and [[Indigenous Australians]], and generally lacking in events that might be termed 'invasion', 'warfare', '[[guerrilla warfare]]', 'conquest' or '[[genocide]]', and generally marked instead by humane intent by government authorities, with damage to indigenous people largely attributable to unintended factors (such as the spread of new diseases) rather than to malicious policies; or
*an invasion marked by violent conflict at the frontier, guerrilla warfare (or other forms of [[warfare]]) between Europeans and Aboriginal people, involving frequent or significant massacres of Aboriginal peoples engaged in defending their traditional tribal lands; a situation which can be said to have developed either nationally, or in certain areas, into something like a war of 'extermination' or something which accords with the term genocide as a consequence of British [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] involving continued dispossession, [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], ill treatment and [[cultural genocide]].

The history wars also relates to broader themes concerning [[national identity]], as well as [[Historiography|methodological questions]] concerning the historian and the craft of researching and writing history, including issues such as the value and reliability of written records (of the authorities and settlers) and the [[oral tradition]] (of the Indigenous Australians), along with the political or similar [[ideological]] biases of those who interpret them.  One theme is how British or multicultural Australian identity has been in history and today.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Meaney,  "Britishness and Australian identity: The problem of nationalism in Australian history and historiography," ''Australian Historical Studies''  32.116 (2001): 76-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Gare, "Britishness in recent Australian historiography." ''Historical Journal'' 43#4 (2000): 1145-1155.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time the history wars were in play, professional history seemed in decline, and popular writers began reclaiming the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Drusilla Modjeska|title=The Best Australian Essays 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UBV5f0LThoC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2006|publisher=Black Inc.|pages=100–1|isbn=9781863952781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 Professor [[Bill Stanner|W. E. H. "Bill" Stanner]], an Australian [[anthropology|anthropologist]], coined the term the "Great Australian Silence" in a [[Boyer Lectures|Boyer Lecture]] entitled "After the Dreaming",&lt;ref name=Stanner-198-248&gt;Stanner pp. 198-248&lt;/ref&gt; where he argued that the writing of [[History of Australia|Australian history]] was incomplete. He asserted that Australian national history as documented up to that point had largely been presented in a positive light, but that [[Indigenous Australians]] had been virtually ignored. He saw this as a structural and deliberate process to omit "several hundred thousand Aboriginal people who lived and died between 1788 and 1938 ... (who were but) ... negative facts of history and ... were in no way consequential for the modern period".&lt;ref&gt;Stanner, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; A new strand of Australian [[historiography]] subsequently emerged which gave much greater attention to the negative experiences of Indigenous Australians during the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)|British settlement of Australia]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, historians such as [[Manning Clark]] and [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] published work which they saw as correcting a selective historiography that had misrepresented or ignored Indigenous Australian history.  The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] argued in the literary and political journal ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' in 1993 that the telling of Australian history had moved from an unduly positive rendition (the "Three Cheers View") to an unduly negative view (The "[[#Black armband debate|'black armband']]") and Australian commentators and politicians have continued to debate this subject.

Interpretations of Aboriginal history became part of the wider political debate sometimes called the ''[[#History wars and culture wars|'culture wars']]'' during the tenure of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government from 1996–2007, with the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] publicly championing the views of some of those associated with ''Quadrant''.&lt;ref name="Manne11/08"&gt; [http://www.themonthly.com.au/tm/node/1293 [[Robert Manne]], "What is Rudd’s Agenda?", ''[[The Monthly]]'', November 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; This debate extended into a [[#National Museum of Australia controversy|controversy]] over the way history was presented in the [[National Museum of Australia]] and in [[high school]] history curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Guy Rundle writes: |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/28/1915-and-all-that-history-in-a-holding-pattern/ |title=1915 and all that: History in a holding pattern – Crikey |publisher=Crikey.com.au |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Justine Ferrari, Education writer |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |title=History curriculum author defies his critics to find bias |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also migrated into the general Australian media, with regular opinion pieces being published in major [[broadsheet]]s such as ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. [[Marcia Langton]] has referred to much of this wider debate as 'war porn'&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard J. War porn. ''Journal of Visual Culture'', Vol. 5, No. 1, 86-88 (2006) {{doi|10.1177/147041290600500107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an 'intellectual dead end'.&lt;ref name="Langton" &gt;Langton M. Essay: Trapped in the aboriginal reality show.  ''Griffith Review 2007'', 19:Re-imagining Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Australian Prime Ministers, Paul Keating and John Howard, were major participants in the "wars". According to the analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library of Dr Mark McKenna,&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title=M. McKenna, (1997). "Different Perspectives on Black Armband History: Research Paper 5 1997-98". Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Keating]] (1991–1996) was believed by [[John Howard]] (1996–2007) to portray Australia pre-[[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] movement from its historical support for the Monarchy and the [[White Australia policy]] by arguing that it was the Conservative Australian Parties who had been barriers to national progress and excessively loyal to the British Empire. He accused Britain of having abandoned Australia during World War II. Keating was a staunch advocate of a symbolic apology to indigenous people for the misdeeds of past governments, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] (drafted with the assistance of historian [[Don Watson]]). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 [[Bringing Them Home]] Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary [[Motion of Reconciliation]] describing treatment of Aboriginal people as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian history, but he did not make a Parliamentary apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title=The History of Apologies Down Under [Thinking Faith - the online journal of the British Jesuits&amp;#93; |publisher=Thinkingfaith.org |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archivedate=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard argued that an apology was inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt" and said that "practical" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to British origins: including deference for [[ANZAC Day]], the [[Australian Flag]] and the [[Monarchy in Australia]], while Howard was a supporter of these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Kim Beazley]], Keating never traveled to [[Gallipoli]] for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as "misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html |title=A nation reborn at Anzac Cove?

In 2006, John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Quadrant'' that "Political Correctness" was dead in Australia but: "we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities"; and in 2006, ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' Political Editor [[Peter Hartcher]] reported that Opposition foreign affairs spokesman [[Kevin Rudd]] was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that "John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars ... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |title=PM's culture wars a fraud: Rudd - National |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 28 October 2006|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Howard government in the Australian Federal election of 2007, and its replacement by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor government]] altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an official apology to the ''[[Stolen Generation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/australia.text/index.html |title=Full text of Australia's apology to Aboriginal people |publisher=CNN.com |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bi-partisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html |title=Brendan Nelson's sorry speech - National |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127074319/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html |archivedate=27 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Keating, Rudd supported an Australian Republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd declared support for the [[Australian flag]] and supported the commemoration of [[ANZAC Day]] and expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder [[Robert Menzies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912154538/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-12 |title=Paul Keating 'utterly wrong' to reject Gallipoli identity, says Kevin Rudd |publisher=The Australian |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/is-rudd-having-a-bob-each-way/2007/04/12/1175971263000.html |title=Is Rudd having a Bob each way? - Opinion |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 October 2004 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the change of government and the passage, with support from all parties, of a Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile argued: "the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars |title=End of the culture wars &amp;#124; Richard Nile Blog, ''The Australian'' |publisher=Blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au |date=28 November 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309215605/http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars/ |archivedate=9 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a view contested by others, including conservative commentator [[Janet Albrechtsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22908896-7583,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212124342/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C25197%2C22908896-7583%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 December 2007 |title=The Australian |date=12 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an intention to reengage in the history wars was indicated by then-Federal Opposition member [[Christopher Pyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julia Baird |url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?&amp;docID=SMH130427114V71OBPNC |title=Don't dismiss nation's blemishes |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2013-04-27 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black armband / white blindfold debate==
The black armband debate concerns whether or not accounts of Australian history gravitate towards an overly negative or an overly positive point of view. The ''black armband view of [[History of Australia|history]]'' was a phrase first used by Australian [[historian]] [[Geoffrey Blainey]] in his 1993 ''Sir [[John Latham (jurist)|John Latham]] Memorial Lecture'' to describe views of history which, he believed, posited that "much of [pre-multicultural] Australian history had been a disgrace" and which focused mainly on the treatment of minority groups (especially Aboriginal people). This he contrasted with the '' 'Three Cheers' '' view, according to which: "nearly everything that came after [the convict era] was believed to be pretty good". Blainey argued that both such accounts of Australian history were inaccurate: "The Black Armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm M. McKenna, (10 November 1997), Research Paper 5 1997-98: "Different Perspectives on Black Armband History, Parliament of Australia, Parliamentary Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm |date=4 April 2009 }} "To some extent my generation was reared on the Three Cheers view of history. This patriotic view of our past had a long run. It saw Australian history as largely a success. While the convict era was a source of shame or unease, nearly everything that came after was believed to be pretty good. There is a rival view, which I call the Black Armband view of history. In recent years it has assailed the optimistic view of history. The black armbands were quietly worn in official circles in 1988. The multicultural folk busily preached their message that until they arrived much of Australian history was a disgrace. The past treatment of Aboriginal people, of Chinese, of Kanakas, of non-British migrants, of women, the very old, the very young, and the poor was singled out, sometimes legitimately, sometimes not. My friend and undergraduate teacher Manning Clark, who was almost the official historian in 1988, had done much to spread the gloomy view and also the compassionate view with his powerful prose and Old Testament phrases.

The Black Armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced."&lt;/ref&gt;

The lecture was subsequently published in the political and literary journal, ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'',&lt;ref name = "QuadrantBlainey1993"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]], 'Drawing Up a Balance Sheet of Our History', in [[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]], vol.37 ( 7-8), July/August 1993&lt;/ref&gt; which at the time was edited by [[Robert Manne]] and is now edited by [[Keith Windschuttle]], two of the leading "history warriors", albeit on opposing sides of the debate. The phrase then began to be used by some commentators [[pejorative]]ly to describe historians viewed as writing excessively critical Australian [[history of Australia|history]] "while wearing a black [[armband]]" of "mourning and grieving, or [[shame]]". New interpretations of Australia's history since 1788 were contested for focussing almost exclusively on official and unofficial [[imperialism]], [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], ill treatment, [[colonialism|colonial]] dispossession and [[cultural genocide]] and ignoring positive aspects of Australia's history.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; [[Manning Clark]] was named by Blainey in his 1993 speech as having "done much to spread the gloomy view and also the compassionate view with his powerful prose and Old Testament phrases".&lt;ref name = "QuadrantBlainey1993"/&gt; &lt;!--this ref given as cited in McKenna--&gt;

The [[Howard Government]]'s responses to the question of how to recount Australian history were initially formulated in the context of [[Paul Keating]]'s characterisation of the subject. [[John Howard]] argued in a 1996 [[Sir Robert Menzies Lecture]] that the "balance sheet of Australian history" had come to be misrepresented:
{{quote|The 'black armband' view of our history reflects a belief that most Australian history since 1788 has been little more than a disgraceful story of imperialism, exploitation, racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination. ... I believe that the balance sheet of our history is one of heroic achievement and that we have achieved much more as a nation of which we can be proud than of which we should be ashamed. In saying that I do not exclude or ignore specific aspects of our past where we are rightly held to account. Injustices were done in Australia and no-one should obscure or minimise them. ... But ... our priority should ... [be] to commit to a practical program of action that will remove the enduring legacies of disadvantage.&lt;ref name="1996MenziesLecture"&gt;John Howard. [http://www.menzieslecture.org/1996.html The Liberal Tradition: The Beliefs and Values Which Guide the Federal Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727080235/http://www.menzieslecture.org/1996.html |date=27 July 2011 }}, 1996 Sir Robert Menzies Lecture. Sir Robert Menzies Lecture Trust. Retrieved 16 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2009, Howard's successor [[Kevin Rudd]] also called for moving away from a ''black-arm view'':

{{quote|Time to leave behind us the polarisation that began to infect our every discussion of our nation's past. To go beyond the so-called "black arm" view that refused to confront some hard truths about our past, as if our forebears were all men and women of absolute nobility, without spot or blemish. But time, too, to go beyond the view that we should only celebrate the reformers, the renegades and revolutionaries, thus neglecting or even deriding the great stories of our explorers, of our pioneers, and of our entrepreneurs. Any truthful reflection of our nation's past is that these are all part of the rich fabric of our remarkable story&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2009/s2669063.htm |title=PM - PM calls for end to 'history wars' 27/08/2009 |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=27 August 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Stephen Muecke]], currently Professor of Writing at the [[University of New South Wales]], contributed to the debate by arguing that black armband events bring people together in common remembrance and cited [[Anzac Day]] as an example; while Aboriginal lawyer [[Noel Pearson]] argued that whilst there was much that is worth preserving in the cultural heritage of non-Aboriginal Australia, "To say that ordinary Australians who are part of the national community today do not have any connection with the shameful aspects of our past is at odds with our exhortations that they have connections to the prideful bits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rp/1997-98/98rp05.htm#ORIGINS |title=Australian Parliamentary Library - Research Paper 5 1997-98 |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1997-98/98rp05.htm |archivedate=4 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of the ''{{'}}white blindfold{{'}}'' view of [[History of Australia|history]] entered the debate as a pejorative counter-response to the notion of the "black armband school".&lt;ref name=white-blindfold&gt;[[Anna Clark (historian)|Clark, Anna]].

In his book ''Why Weren't We Told?'' in 1999, [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] referred to [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|Stanner]]'s "Great Australian Silence", and to "a 'mental block' which prevented Australians from coming to terms with the past".&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (1999), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the silence about [[Australian frontier wars|Australia's history of frontier violence]] in much of the twentieth century stands in stark contrast with the openness with which violence was admitted and discussed in the nineteenth. Reynolds quotes many excerpts from the press, including an article written in the ''[[Townsville]] Herald'' in Queensland as late as 1907, by a "pioneer" who described his part in a massacre. Reynolds commented that violence against Aboriginals, far from being hushed up or denied, was openly talked about.

The nature of the debate began to change in 1999 with the publication of a book ''Massacre Myth'' by journalist, [[Rod Moran]], who examined the 1926 [[Forrest River massacre]] in Western Australia. Moran concluded that the massacre was a myth inspired by the false claims of a missionary (possibly as a result of mental health issues).&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Rod (1999) ''Massacre myth: an investigation into allegations concerning the mass murder of Aboriginal people at Forrest River, 1926'' Bassendean, W.A. Access Press. {{ISBN|0-86445-124-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal historian of the Forrest River massacre, Neville Green, describes the massacre as probable but not able to be proven in court.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Neville: "The evidence for The Forrest River Massacre". ''Quadrant'', 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Windschuttle]], an Australian historian, said that reviewing Moran's book inspired his own examination of the wider historical record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyline.com/UNSW%20debate.htm |title=The Sydney Line |publisher=The Sydney Line |date=29 May 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223082820/http://www.sydneyline.com/UNSW%20debate.htm |archivedate=23 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Windschuttle argues that much of Australian Aboriginal history, particularly as written since the late 1970s, was based on the use of questionable or unreliable evidence and on deliberate misrepresentation and fabrication of historical evidence. He based his conclusions on his examination of the evidence cited in previous historical accounts and reported incidences of non-existent documents being cited, misquoting and misleadingly selective quoting from documents and of documents being cited as evidence that certain events took place when his examination concluded that they do not support those claims. Windschuttle reported his conclusions in a number of articles published in Quadrant and in 2002, he published a book, ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History'', Volume 1, Van Diemen’s Land 1803-1847, which focussed on Tasmanian colonial history.

Historian Geoffrey Blainey argued in a 2003 book review of Fabrication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/nativefiction-1774 |title=Native fiction by Geoffrey Blainey |publisher=The New Criterion |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the number of instances when the source documents do not support the claims made and the fact that the divergences overwhelmingly tend to purport claims of violent conflict and massacres indicates that this is not a matter of mere error but bias.

The debate had therefore changed from an argument over whether there was an excessive focus on negative aspects of Australian history to one over to what extent, if at all, Australian Aboriginal history had been based on questionable evidence or had been falsified or fabricated and whether this had exaggerated the extent of violence against Aboriginal people. Particular historians and histories that are challenged include [[Lyndall Ryan]] and [[Henry A. Reynolds|Henry Reynolds]] and the histories of massacres, particularly in [[Tasmania]] but also elsewhere in Australia.

==Genocide debate==&lt;!-- The redirect [[Australian genocide debate]] links to this section--&gt;
{{See also|Genocide definitions}}
The case for using the term "Australian genocide" rests on evidence from various sources that people argue proves some form of genocide. People cite the [[list of massacres of indigenous Australians]] by white settlers, mainly in the 19th century (cf. ''Blood on the Wattle'' by Bruce Elder or ''Frontier History Revisited'' by Robert Orsted-Jensen); only a few massacres were documented, and the evidence is strong that evidence of massacres was generally covered by secrecy and there are powerful signs that documents had been destroyed. Evidence is solid that Queensland's Native Police produced diaries, collision reports and monthly and quarterly enumerations of 'patrols' and 'collisions' with indigenous people, and that all of this material was stored in the Queensland police department. However, not one single sheet of information of this kind which is today available at the Queensland State archive originate from files delivered by the police department, the material left comes solely from other government offices. Only human interference can produce a total loss of the vast Native Police Force records once stored in the Queensland Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;see Orsted-Jensen, R: 'Frontier History Revisited', page 253pp (Appendix B 'The Lost Native Police Reports')&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have pointed to the dramatic reduction in the Tasmanian Aboriginal population in the 19th century and the forced removal of generations of Aboriginal children from their parents during the 20th century as evidence of genocide. The evidence includes documentation of the wish, and sometimes intention, of a significant proportion of late 19th-century and early 20th-century white Australians to see the Aboriginal "race" eliminated. Documents include published letters to the editors of high-circulation newspapers. Certainly this was the case in Queensland, in terms of indigenous people the most populated section of Australia and certainly the colony with the most violent frontier. In June 1866 Sir [[Robert Herbert]] summing up his experience after little more than five years as the first Premier of this colony wrote:

{{quote|Every method of dealing with these very dangerous savages has been tried, and I believe no more satisfactory system can be devised than that under which the people of Queensland endeavour to deal with a difficulty which it is feared can never terminate except with the gradual disappearance of the unimprovable race.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Knox: ''The Queensland Years of Robert Herbert, Premier'' St Lucia QUP 1977, page 236.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mentioned "system", for which Herbert was among the people personal responsible, was the so-called "[[Native Police]] system" which typically went about "dispersing" any sign of indigenous resistance at the frontier by use of deadly early morning attacks on Aboriginal camps. This semi-military force was allowed to go about its business, typically instigating large scale deadly retaliation without prior investigating of alleged crime. They generally took no prisoners at the frontier and there are no signs that they ever enforced any other "law" than "might is right". It was a force designed more in the manner of the recent times phenomenon known as the "death-squad" and the secrecy of its operations was ensured by the remoteness of its operations, added a system that denied the evidence from "blacks" while the force itself was instructed to ensure that there would always be only one white witness, the officer in charge of each detachment. Recently the first ever attempt to scientifically calculate the amount of Aboriginal people killed in encounters with the Native Police indicates that numbers may exceed 45,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Evans, Raymond &amp; Ørsted–Jensen, Robert: 'I Cannot Say the Numbers that Were Killed': Assessing Violent Mortality on the Queensland Frontier" (paper at AHA 9 July 2014 at University of Queensland) publisher Social Science Research Network&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "useless race" was commonly expressed in Queensland such as in 1877 when an editorial in the leading journal noted that,

{{quote|The desire for progressive advancement and substantial prosperity is, after all, stronger than sentimental dislike to the extinction of a savage and useless race.&lt;ref&gt;Queenslander 7 October 1876, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Classifying Aboriginal people as a useless or unimprovable race was common. Comprehensively debating the native police and the frontier in public in 1880 in the columns of the ''Queenslander'' (the weekly edition of the colony's leading journal), one could read the following statements from yet another prominent settler,

{{quote|And being a useless race, what does it matter what they suffer any more than the distinguished philanthropist who writes in this behalf cares for the wounded half dead pigeon he tortures at his shooting matches.&lt;ref&gt;''Queenslander'' 8 May 1880, page 594-95&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Remarks which were followed up in October of that years by [[Boyd Dunlop Morehead]], one of the leading landholders, manager of the Scottish Australian Investment Co.'s ''Bowen Downs'' in 1866-81 and a future Premier, could be heard making the following acknowledgement in a parliamentary speech, saying, yes settlers in the past did go

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;out, and in their pioneering had, of necessity, to use extreme measures to the inhabitants of the soil. The aboriginal, no doubt, had been shot down; no one denied it ... this race was being worked off the face of the earth. That that was so everyone knew, and that it must be so, none would deny ... For his own part he did not believe that the aboriginal race was worth preserving. If there were no aboriginals it would be a very good thing&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Assembly on 21 October 1880, speech by the member for Mitchell, grazier, businessman, later Premier &amp; Colonial Secretary of Queensland.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the introduction of the word "genocide" in the 1940s by [[Raphael Lemkin]], Lemkin himself and most comparative scholars of genocide and many general historians, such as [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], [[Ward Churchill]], [[Leo Kuper]] and [[Jared Diamond]], basing their analysis on previously published histories, present the extinction of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people as a text book example of a genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Reynolds, "Genocide in Tasmania?", in A. Dirk Moses (ed.) ''Genocide and settler society: frontier violence and stolen indigenous children in Australian history'', Berghahn Books, 2004 p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian historian of genocide, [[Ben Kiernan]], in his recent history of the concept and practice, ''Blood and soil: a world history of genocide and extermination from Sparta to Darfur'' (2007), treats the Australian evidence over the first century of colonization as an example of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kiernan, "Genocidal Violence in Nineteenth-Century Australia", in his ''Blood and soil: a world history of genocide and extermination from Sparta to Darfur'' Yale University Press, 2007, pp. 249-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among scholars specializing in Australian history much recent debate has focused on whether indeed what happened to groups of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] people, and especially the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal people]], during the European colonisation of Australia can be classified as genocide. According to Mark Levene, most Australian experts are now "considerably more circumspect".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Levene, ''Genocide in the Age of the Nation State: The rise of the West and the coming of genocide'', I.

Tauris, 2005 {{ISBN|1-84511-057-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84511-057-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3PsLXeDflfMC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=tasmania+genocide+Reynolds&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 p.344 footnote 105]&lt;/ref&gt; In the specific instance of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people, [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]], who takes events in other regions of colonial Australia as marked by "genocidal moments",&lt;ref&gt;Henry Reynolds, ''The Question of Genocide in Australia's History'' (2001), cited in Ann Curthoys, ''Genocide in Tasmania: The History of an Idea'', in A.

However, in practice the events on the ground that lead to their virtual extinction worked out.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5zHAGNPTkqIC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=Tasmanian+Genocide Henry Reynolds, "Genocide in Tasmania?"] in A.

While calling for "a more robust exchange between genocide and Tasmanian historical scholarship",{{sfn|Curthoys|2008|p=247}} her own view is that the Tasmanian instance constitutes a "case for genocide, though not of state planning, mass killing, or extinction".{{sfn|Curthoys|2008|p=230}}

Much of the debate on whether European colonisation of Australia resulted in genocide, centres on whether "the term 'genocide' only applies to cases of deliberate mass killings of Aboriginal people by European settlers, or ... might also apply to instances in which many Aboriginal people were killed by the reckless or unintended actions and omissions of settlers".&lt;ref name=Australian-debate-on-genocide&gt;[http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page#arti "Debates on Genocide - Part One Debates on 'Genocide' in Australian History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112193203/http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page |date=12 January 2016 }}, Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training&lt;/ref&gt; Historians such as Tony Barta argue that for the victim group it matters little if they were wiped out as part of a planned attack.

[[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] points out that European colonists and their descendants frequently use expressions that included "extermination", "extinction", and "extirpation" when discussing the treatment of Aboriginal people during the colonial period, and as in his opinion genocide "can take many forms, not all of them violent".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page#arti "Debates on Genocide - Part One Debates on "Genocide" in Australian History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112193203/http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page |date=12 January 2016 }}, Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training. citing Reynolds, ''An Indelible Stain?

== Controversy over smallpox in Australia ==

The arrival of [[smallpox]] in Australia is of uncertain origin and is a major theme in the history wars. The lack of immunity among Aboriginal Australians to this introduced disease saw it inflict a devastating toll on the Aboriginal population. Though the [[First Fleet]] itself did not arrive with any known carriers of the disease, the observation of an epidemic among the Aboriginal population of Sydney around 16 months after the British arrived has led to speculation that the Fleet itself brought this disease to Australia. Some historians have suggested that the disease may have been either released by accident or theft of medicine stores or perhaps been deliberately employed as a form of "[[germ warfare]]" against indigenous Australians. [[Inoculation]] was thus commonly practised by surgeons decades before 1796 and the process of [[smallpox vaccination]] was introduced by [[Edward Jenner]]. Dried scab was commonly stored in glass containers as part of a surgeons remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin, Noel: ''Our Original Aggression'', Sydney 1983, p19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early speculation on the origins of the disease is recorded in the writing of a [[First Fleet]] Captain of Marines, [[Watkin Tench]], who noted an "extraordinary calamity" among the Aboriginal people of Sydney, beginning in April 1789. Repeated accounts of dead bodies marked with pustules consistent with smallpox began being reported around [[Sydney Harbour]] around this time. Tench wrote that the colonists' observations had led them to suppose that smallpox was not known in [[New South Wales]] and as no [[First Fleet]]ers had suffered from the disease, its sudden existence among the Aboriginal people was "inexplicable". Tench speculated as to whether the disease might be indigenous to the country; or whether it had been brought to the colony by the French expedition of [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Lapérouse]] a year before; traversed the continent from the West where Europeans had previously landed; brought by expedition of [[James Cook]]; or indeed by the first British settlers at Sydney. "Our surgeons brought out varioulous matter in bottles", he wrote, "but to infer that it was produced from this cause were a supposition so wild as to be unworthy of consideration".&lt;ref&gt;Watkin Tench; ''1788: Edited and Introduced by Tim Flannery"; The Text Publishing Company; Melbourne; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, and despite the lack of certainty over how or when the disease reached Australia, there has been a history war regarding the way that smallpox arrived in Australia, especially whether it was deliberately used as a crude [[biological weapon]] against indigenous peoples.

Medical scientists such as Sir [[Edward Stirling]] and Sir [[John Burton Cleland|John Cleland]] published a number of books and articles between 1911 and 1966 suggesting that smallpox arrived in Northern Australia from an Asian source.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

A rival theory, that smallpox was introduced to NSW in 1789 by British settlers, was put forward in 1914 by the director of the [[Australian Quarantine Service]], Dr [[John Cumpston|J.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;L. Cumpston]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1908"&gt;Cumpston, JHL "The History of Small-Pox in Australia 1788–1908", Government Printer (1914) Melb.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Professor [[Noel Butlin]], an economic historian, suggested: "it is possible and, in 1789, likely, that infection of the Aboriginal people was a deliberate extermination act". Historians David Day and Henry Reynolds repeated Butlin’s claims and in 2001 Reynolds wrote: "one possibility is that the epidemic was deliberately or accidentally let loose by someone in the settlement at Sydney Cove. Not surprisingly this is a highly contentious proposition. If true, it would clearly fall within the ambit of the Genocide Convention".&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, published by Allen &amp; Unwin, 2006, p125.&lt;/ref&gt; Butlin argued that while Macassan fishermen could possibly 'have landed the virus on the Australian mainland at some stage their ability to do so was limited'.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin: ''Our Original Aggression'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt; It is furthermore highly unlikely, he argued, that this virus should have been brought down from the Gulf of Carpentaria to coincidence with the first major outbreak "just fifteen months after the landing of the first fleet". Besides the time factor connected to Macassans, 'over seven or eight weeks (or more)', the type of vessels, the limited potential for contact between Aboriginal people and fishermen, and the fact of clothing as carrier and virus is destroyed or seriously reduced in contact with salt water, makes the Macassan theory highly unlikely, he argued. Indeed, infected 'Macassans would be either dead or fully recovered long before reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin: Our Original Aggression, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas transfer somehow, theft accident or the like, from scab originally stored in glass containers carried by just one of the seven medical officers on the first fleet seems the most likely cause.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin: ''Our Original Aggression'', p.19-20 &amp; 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. C. Macknight|C.&amp;nbsp;C. Macknight]] (1986) an authority on the centuries-old [[Makassar#Contact with Australia|interaction between indigenous Australians and the people of Makassar]] (later part of Indonesia), revived the theory that smallpox was introduced to Australia by [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan mariners visiting Arnhem Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Macknight, C.&amp;nbsp;C. "Macassans and the Aboriginal past" in ''Archaeologia Oceania'' | publication-date=1986 | volume=21 | pages=69–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian virologist [[Frank Fenner]] (1988) – who in 1977–80 led the successful [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) campaign to eradicate smallpox and was the principal author of a 1988 WHO report, ''Smallpox and its Eradication'' – pointed out that no cases of smallpox were reported amongst convicts, sailors, military personnel, or free settlers, on the First Fleet.&lt;ref name= Fenner1/&gt; The virus was also not reported among British or Aboriginal people at Port Jackson over the following 15 months. It was, therefore, unlikely that a person suffering from smallpox and travelling with the First Fleet had caused the 1789 outbreak.

While there were cases of smallpox in Macassar during 1789, there are no reports of it occurring prior to that period. However, [[History of smallpox#Island South East Asia|smallpox had long been present in island South East Asia]] – possibly as early the [[4th century]] according to Frank Fenner.&lt;ref&gt;Fenner, cited by Victor T. King, 1998, ''Environmental Challenges in South-East Asia'', London/New York, Routledge, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; There were outbreaks of smallpox in Indonesia throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;King, ''Environmental Challenges in South-East Asia'', pp. 78–79; M. C. Ricklefs, 1993, ''A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1200'', Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 72, 85, and; Atsushi Ōta, 2006, ''Changes of Regime and Social Dynamics in West Java: Society, State and the Outer World of Banten, 1750-1830'', Leiden, Brill, pp. 79, 109, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; These included, for example, major epidemics in the [[Sultanate of Tidore]] (in the Moluccas) during the 1720s, the [[Sultanate of Banjar]] (South Kalimantan), in 1734, 1750–51, 1764–65 and 1778–79;  and in southern [[Sumatra]] during the 1750s, the 1770s, and in 1786. Macassans had contact with these areas both directly and indirectly (through foreign traders and invaders).

[[David Day (historian)|David Day]] (2001) reiterated Butlin's argument and suggested that members of Sydney's garrison of [[Royal Marines]] may have attempted to use smallpox as a biological weapon in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;David Day, ''Claiming a Continent A New History of Australia'', HarperCollins, Sydney, 2001, p. 42f.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, however, John Connor stated that Day's theory was "unsustainable".&lt;ref&gt;John Connor, ''The Australian Frontier Wars, 1788-1838'', UNSW Press, 2002, p29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 book, ''Invisible Invaders'', historian [[Judy Campbell (historian)|Judy Campbell]] &amp;ndash; advised by Fenner &amp;ndash; reviewed reports of disease amongst Aboriginal people from 1780–1880, including the smallpox epidemics of 1789-90, the 1830s and the 1860s. Campbell argues that the evidence, including that contained in these reports shows that, while many diseases such as tuberculosis ''were'' introduced by British colonists, this was not so for smallpox and that the speculations of British responsibility made by other historians were based on tenuous evidence, largely on the mere coincidence that the 1789-90 epidemic was first observed afflicting the Aboriginal people not long after the establishment of the first British settlement. Campbell argues instead that the north-south route of transmission of the 1860s epidemics (which is generally agreed), also applied in the earlier ones. Campbell noted that the fleets of fast Macassan fishing vessels, propelled by monsoonal winds, reached Australia after being at sea for as little as ten to fifteen days, well within the incubation period of smallpox. The numbers of people travelling in the fleets were large enough to sustain smallpox for extended periods of time without it ‘burning out’.  The Macassans spent up to six months fishing along the northern Australian coastline and Aboriginal people had "day-to-day contact with the islanders. Aboriginals visited the praus and the camps the visitors set up on shore, they talked and traded…" &lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes that Butlin, writing in 1983, "did not recognize that Aboriginals were "great travellers", who spread infection over long distances…." and that smallpox was spread through their extensive social and trading contacts as well as by Aboriginal people fleeing from the disease.&lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 61, 181&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell also cited British historian [[Charles Wilson (historian)|Charles Wilson]], who cited "medical microbiology" in disagreeing with Butlin about the origins of the 1789 outbreak, and "doubted his estimates of its demographic impact", as well as "First Fleet historian [[Alan Frost]] [who] also disagreed with Butlin’s views".&lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, p 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Warren]] (2007) claimed that Fenner did not address the issue of [[variolous material]] brought in bottles by the First Fleet, for use as an inoculant.&lt;ref&gt;Warren C., "Could First Fleet smallpox infect Aborigines? - A note", ''Aboriginal History 31'', pp. 152-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren argued that, even if the variolous material was degraded, it could still infect susceptible people. Smallpox spread by the inhalation of airborne droplets of virus in situations of personal contact or by contact with blankets, clothing or other objects that an infected person had recently used.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Dr Josephine, ''The Original Australians'', pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;  This material was carried by First Fleet surgeons for inoculation purposes. Warren also suggested that Frost's view was based on a false premise: that the First Fleet's stocks of virus were sterilised by summer heat.

Craig Mear (2008) and Michael J. Bennett (2009) have disputed Campbell's hypothesis that smallpox was introduced to Australia in 1789 through contact between Aboriginal people and mariners from Makassar.&lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 55, 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Mear, [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/ockhamsrazor/stories/2009/2557307.htm The origin of the smallpox outbreak in Sydney in 1789].

Macknight re-entered the debate in 2011, declaring: "The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Macassan] [[Trepanging|trepang]]ers on the north coast and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there."&lt;ref&gt;Macknight, Campbell "The view from Marege’: Australian knowledge of Macassar and the impact of the trepang industry across two centuries " in ''Aboriginal History'' | publication-date=2011 | volume=35 | pages=121–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Carmody, a professor of medicine, put forward an alternative theory (2013) suggesting that the 1789 epidemic may have been [[chickenpox]] rather than smallpox. Carmody pointed out that chickenpox could have taken a severe toll on a population with little hereditary or acquired immunological resistance.  With regard to smallpox, Carmody said: "There is absolutely no evidence to support any of the theories and some of them are fanciful and far-fetched." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/chickenpox-blamed-for-aboriginal-deaths-20130807-2rh3m.html |title=Chickenpox blamed for Aboriginal deaths |publisher=Canberratimes.com.au |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://caepr.anu.edu.au/Seminars/13/Seminar-Topics%E2%80%94Series-2/07_8_Seminar.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202101013/http://caepr.anu.edu.au/Seminars/13/Seminar-Topics%E2%80%94Series-2/07_8_Seminar.php |archive-date=2 February 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Christopher Warren rejected suggestions that chickenpox has caused the 1789 epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}} ''Journal of Australian Studies'' http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2013.849750#preview at endnote 3 of ''Smallpox at Sydney Cove - Who, When, Why?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}} [http://www.rusinsw.org.au/Papers/2014AU05.pdf ''United Service''], Journal of the Royal United Services Institute of New South Wales, vol. 65 (1), March 2014, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren (2014) subsequently rejected the theory that the 1789 epidemic had originated from Macassar.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher: "Smallpox outbreak of Sydney's past" ''Ockhams Razor'' ABC Radio National, 2014.

==Stolen Generations debate==
{{main article|Stolen Generations}}
Despite the lengthy and detailed findings set out in the 1997 ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report into the [[Stolen Generation]], which documented the removal of Aboriginal children from their families by Australian State and Federal government agencies and [[Christian Church|church]] missions, the nature and extent of the removals have been disputed within Australia, with some commentators questioning the findings contained in the report and asserting that the Stolen Generation has been exaggerated. Sir [[Ronald Wilson]], former President of the [[Australian Human Rights Commission|Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission]] and a Commissioner on the Inquiry, has stated that none of the more than 500 witnesses who appeared before the Inquiry were cross-examined. This has been the basis of criticism by the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] Government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s148775.htm Stolen Generations], ''Background Briefing'', [[ABC Radio National]], broadcast 2 July 2000. Retrieved 19 February 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318133617/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s148775.htm |date=18 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the anthropologist [[Ron Brunton]] in a booklet&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, R. "Betraying the victims: The ‘Stolen Generations’ Report", in IPA Backgrounder Vol. 10/1, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Institute of Public Affairs]] that was criticised in turn by the lawyer [[Hal Wootten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/1998/44.html |last=Wootten |first=H |author-link=Hal Wootten |title=Ron Brunton and Bringing Them Home}} (1998) 4(12) Indigenous Law Bulletin 4.&lt;/ref&gt; An Australian Federal Government submission has questioned the conduct of the Commission which produced the report, arguing that the Commission failed to critically appraise or test the claims on which it based the report and failed to distinguish between those separated from their families "with and without consent, and with and without good reason". Not only has the number of children removed from their parents been questioned, but also the intent and effects of the government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/issues/aborigines/2000-govt-submission-on-stolen-generations-summary.doc |title=House of Representatives Members – 45th Parliament 2016- |accessdate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043345/http://www.australianpolitics.com/issues/aborigines/2000-govt-submission-on-stolen-generations-summary.doc |archivedate=16 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics, such as [[Andrew Bolt]], have questioned the very existence of the Stolen Generation. Bolt stated that it is a "preposterous and obscene" myth and that there was actually no policy in any state or territory at any time for the systematic removal of "half-caste" Aboriginal children. [[Robert Manne]] responded that Bolt did not address the documentary evidence demonstrating the existence of the Stolen Generations and that this is a clear case of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical]] [[denialism]].&lt;ref name=RM-The-Age&gt;Manne, Robert [http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/the-cruelty-of-denial/2006/09/08/1157222325367.html The cruelty of denial], [[The Age]], 9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt then challenged Manne to produce ten cases in which the evidence justified the claim that children were "stolen" as opposed to having been removed for reasons such as neglect, abuse, abandonment, etc. He argued that Manne did not respond and that this was an indication of unreliability of the claim that there was policy of systematic removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan |first=Kelly |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19610693-25717,00.html |title=Be a Manne and name just 10 &amp;#124; Herald Sun |publisher=News.com.au |date=28 June 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Manne stated that he supplied a documented list of 250 names&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/the-cruelty-of-denial/2006/09/08/1157222325367.html?page=1 |title=The cruelty of denial - Robert Manne - Opinion |publisher=theage.com.au |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Manne |authorlink=Robert Manne |title=The Stolen Generations - a documentary collection |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/Documents/stolen.pdf |work=[[The Monthly]] |date=3 September 2005 |accessdate=29 December 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt stated that prior to a debate, Manne provided him with a list of 12 names that he was able to show during the debate was "a list of people abandoned, saved from abuse or voluntarily given up by their parents"; and that during the actual debate, Manne produced a list of 250 names without any details or documentation as to their circumstances. Bolt also stated that he was subsequently able to identify and ascertain the history of some of those on the list and was unable to find a case where there was evidence to justify the term ‘stolen’. He stated that one of the names on the list of allegedly stolen children was 13-year-old Dolly, taken into the care of the State after being "found seven months pregnant and penniless, working for nothing on a station".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/that_debate_last_night/ |title=That debate last night &amp;#124; Herald Sun Andrew Bolt Blog |publisher=Blogs.news.com.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolt/Manne debate is a fair sample of the adversarial debating style in the area.  There is focus on individual examples as evidence for or against the existence of a policy, and little or no analysis of other documentary evidence such as legislative databases showing how the legal basis for removal varied over time and between jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/indigenous/ |title=Australian Indigenous Law Library |publisher=AustLII |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or testimony from those who were called on to implement the policies,&lt;ref&gt;''Many Voices: Reflections on Experiences of Indigenous Child Separation'' National Library of Australia Oral History Project, 2002. http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2002/nov02/article3.html&lt;/ref&gt; which was also recorded in the ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report. A recent review of legal cases claims it is difficult for [[Stolen Generation]] claimants to challenge what was written about their situation at the time of removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buti |first=A |title=The Stolen generation and litigation revisited |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2008/13.html#Heading522}} (2008) 32(2) Melbourne University Law Review 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bringing Them Home|report]] also identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children, or when parents were told by government officials that their children had died, even though this was not the case.

The new Australian Government elected in 2007 issued an Apology similar to those that State Governments had issued at or about the time of the ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report ten years earlier. On 13 February 2008, [[Kevin Rudd]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]] moved a formal apology in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]],&lt;ref name="apology5694"&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Representatives Official Hansard|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/chamber/hansardr/2008-02-13/toc_pdf/5694-9.pdf|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=14 February 2016|format=PDF|date=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167}} which was moved concurrently by the Leader of the Government in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

==Windschuttle's ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History''==
In 2002, historian Keith Windschuttle, in his book ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803-1847'', questions the [[historiography|historical evidence]] used to identify the number of Aboriginal people deliberately killed during European colonisation, especially focusing on the [[Black War]] in Tasmania. He argues that there is credible evidence for the violent deaths of only 118 Tasmanian Aboriginal people, as having been directly killed by the British, although there were undoubtedly an unquantifiable number of other deaths for which no evidence exists. He argues that the Tasmanian Aboriginal population was devastated by a lethal cocktail of introduced diseases to which they had little or no resistance due to their isolation from the mainland and the rest of humanity for thousands of years. The deaths and infertility caused by these introduced diseases, combined with the deaths from what violent conflict there was, rapidly decimated the relatively small Aboriginal population. Windschuttle also examined the nature of those violent episodes that did occur and concluded that there is no credible evidence of warfare over territory. Windschuttle argues that the primary source of conflict between the British and the Aboriginal people was raids by Aboriginal people, often involving violent attacks on settlers, to acquire goods (such as blankets, metal implements and 'exotic' foods) from the British. With this and with a detailed examination of footnotes in and evidence cited by the earlier historical works, he criticises the claims by historians such as [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] and Professor [[Lyndall Ryan]] that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement. Particular historians and histories that are challenged include Henry Reynolds and the histories of [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]], particularly in [[Tasmania]] (such as in the [[Cape Grim massacre]]) but also elsewhere in Australia. Windschuttle's claims are based upon the argument that the 'orthodox' view of Australian history were founded on hearsay or the misleading use of evidence by historians.

Windschuttle argues that, in order to advance the ‘deliberate genocide’ argument, Reynolds has misused source documentation, including that from British colonist sources, by quoting out of context. In particular, he accuses Reynolds of selectively quoting from responses to an 1830 survey in Tasmania in that Reynolds quoted only from those responses that could be construed as advocating "extermination", "extinction", and "extirpation" and failed to mention other responses to the survey, which indicated that a majority of respondents rejected genocide, were sympathetic to the plight of the Aboriginal people, feared that conflict arising from Aboriginal attacks upon settlers would result in the extinction of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people and advocated the adoption of courses of action to prevent this happening.&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle, pp. 326-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Windschuttle's claims and research have been disputed by some historians, in ''Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History'', an anthology including contributions from [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] and Professor [[Lyndall Ryan]], edited and introduced by [[Robert Manne]], professor of politics at [[La Trobe University]]. This anthology has itself been the subject of examination by [[Melbourne]] businessman, freelance writer and [[Objectivist movement|Objectivist]] John Dawson, in ''Washout: On the academic response to The Fabrication of Aboriginal History'', which argues that "Whitewash" leaves Windschuttle's claims and research unrefuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawson |first=John |date=May 2004 |title=The Catches of Whitewash |url=http://quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=777 |journal=Quadrant |volume=XLVIII |issue=5 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908060311/https://www.quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=777 |archivedate=8 September 2007 |pages= |doi= |access-date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Contra Windschuttle",  an article published in the conservative publication ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', S.G. Foster examined some of the evidence that Windschuttle presented on one issue, Stanner's notion of the "Great Australian Silence". In Foster’s opinion, the evidence produced by Windschuttle did not prove his case that the "Great Australian Silence" was largely a myth. Windschuttle argues that, in the years prior to Stanner’s 1968 Boyer lecture, Australian historians had not been silent on the Aboriginal people although, in most cases, the historians’ "discussions were not to Stanner’s taste" and the Aboriginal people "might not have been treated in the way Reynolds and his colleagues would have liked".&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle, pp. 408, 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Foster argues that Windschuttle is "merciless with those who get their facts wrong" and that the fact that Windschuttle has also made a mistake&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle wrote that a particular text was not used at the University of Sydney or the University of New South Wales when Foster states that it was: S.G. Foster, Contra Windschuttle&lt;/ref&gt; means that he did not meet the criteria that he used to assess 'orthodox historians' he was arguing against and whom he accused of deliberately and extensively misrepresenting, misquoting, exaggerating and fabricating evidence relating to the level and nature of violent conflict between Aboriginal people and white settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=S.

At the time of the publication of ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One'' it was announced that a second volume, to be published in 2003, would cover claims of frontier violence in New South Wales and Queensland, and a third, in 2004, would cover Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/24/1037697982065.html |title=Our history, not rewritten but put right - smh.com.au |accessdate=6 March 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=25 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 9 February 2008, however, it was announced that the second volume, anticipated to be published later in 2008, would be entitled ''The Fabrication of Australian History, Volume 2: The "Stolen Generations"'' and would address the issue of the removal of Aboriginal children (the "[[stolen generations]]") from their families in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Imre Salusinszky |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23183633-5013404,00.html |title=Imre Salusinszky, Aboriginal 'genocide' claim denied, '&amp;#39;The Australian'&amp;#39;, 9&amp;nbsp;February 2008 |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stuart Macintyre's ''The History Wars''==
In 2003 Australian historian [[Stuart Macintyre]] published ''The History Wars'', written with Anna Clark.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre S, Clark A. ''The History Wars''.  Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-522-85091-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a study of the background of, and arguments surrounding, recent developments in Australian historiography, and concluded that the History Wars had done damage to the nature of objective [[Australian history]]. At the launch of his book, historian [[Stuart Macintyre]] emphasised the political dimension of these arguments&lt;ref&gt;Who plays Stalin in our History Wars? ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 17 September 2003 [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/16/1063625030438.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and said the Australian debate took its cue from the [[Enola Gay]] controversy in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lehigh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/enola/ |title=History on Trial website-Enola Gay Controversy |publisher=Digital.lib.lehigh.edu |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was launched by former Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]], who took the opportunity to criticise conservative views of Australian history, and those who hold them (such as the then Prime Minister [[John Howard]]), saying that they suffered from "a failure of imagination", and said that ''The History Wars'' "rolls out the canvas of this debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/05/1062549021882.html |title=Keating's 'History Wars' - OpinionWebDiaryArchive2003 |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date= 5 September 2003|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macintyre's critics, such as Greg Melluish (History Lecturer at the [[University of Wollongong]]), responded to the book by declaring that Macintyre was a partisan history warrior himself, and that "its primary arguments are derived from the pro-Communist polemics of the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/summer03-04/polsumm0304-7.htm |title=Policy |publisher=Cis.org.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013130222/http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/summer03-04/polsumm0304-7.htm |archivedate=13 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Windschuttle said that Macintyre attempted to "caricature the history debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s938399.htm |title=Lateline - 03/09/2003: Authors in history debate .

==National Museum of Australia controversy==
In 2001, writing in ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', a [[Conservatism|conservative]] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quadrant.org.au/about-us/| title=About Us|accessdate=3 February 2016|work = Quadrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;  historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] argued that the then-new [[National Museum of Australia]] (NMA) was marred by "[[political correctness]]" and did not present a balanced view of the nation's history.&lt;ref&gt;How not to run a museum: People's history at the postmodern museum. reproduced at {{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyline.com/National%20Museum.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820050424/http://www.sydneyline.com/National%20Museum.htm |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the [[Howard Government]] commissioned a review of the NMA. A potentially controversial issue was in assessing how well the NMA met the criterion that displays should: "Cover darker historical episodes, and with a gravity that opens the possibility of collective self-accounting. The role here is in helping the nation to examine fully its own past, and the dynamic of its history—with truthfulness, sobriety and balance. This extends into covering present-day controversial issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/review/review_report_20030715/files/552/ReviewReport20030715.pdf |title=dcit10442_text |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328123706/http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/review/review_report_20030715/files/552/ReviewReport20030715.pdf |archivedate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the report concluded that there was no systemic bias, it recommended that there be more recognition in the exhibits of European achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/about_us/ips/review-of-exhibitions-and-public-programs |title=Review of Exhibitions and Public Programs, 2003 |publisher=National Museum of Australia |date= |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The report drew the ire of some historians in Australia, who claimed that it was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to politicise the museum and move it more towards a position which [[Geoffrey Blainey]] called the 'three cheers' view of [[History of Australia|Australian history]], rather than the '[[#Black armband debate|black armband]]' view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s902872.htm |title=Lateline - 15/07/2003: Museum review attracts historians ire . Australian Broadcasting Corp |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 columnist [[Miranda Devine]] described some of the [[Braille]] messages encoded on the external structure of the NMA, including "sorry" and "forgive us our genocide" and how they had been covered over by aluminium discs in 2001, and stated that under the new Director "what he calls the 'black T-shirt' view of [[Culture of Australia|Australian culture]]" is being replaced by "systematically reworking the collections, with attention to 'scrupulous historical accuracy'".&lt;ref name="DevineApr06"&gt;{{cite news | last = Devine | first = Miranda | authorlink = Miranda Devine  | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/miranda-devine/the-embedded-messages-that-adorn-museum/2006/04/01/1143441377890.html | title = Opinion: Disclosed at last, the embedded messages that adorn museum | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate =11 June 2006 | date=2 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the current approach at the NMA is the Bells Falls Gorge Interactive display, which presents Windschuttles's view of an alleged massacre alongside other views and contemporary documents and displays of weapons relating to [[Australian frontier wars#New South Wales|colonial conflict around Bathurst in 1824]] and invites visitors to make up their own minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/education-kids/classroom_learning/multimedia/interactives/bells_falls_gorge |title=Bells Falls Gorge interactive display |publisher=National Museum of Australia |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of New South Wales controversy==
Publication in 2016 of "Indigenous Terminology" guidelines&lt;ref&gt;"Indigenous Terminology" University of New South Wales ; https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/indigenous-terminology
&lt;/ref&gt; for the teaching and writing of history by the [[University of New South Wales]] created a brief media uproar.&lt;ref&gt;''Invasion of the history rewriters'', Daily Telegraph 30 March 2016; http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/invasion-of-the-history-rewriters/news-story/d18774ad2553314898261298cef4e17d&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the advised language changes, they recommended "settlement" be replaced by "invasion", "colonisation" or "occupation". They also deemed that the generally accepted anthropological assumption&lt;ref&gt;Ried, James ''‘Invaded’ not settled: UNSW rewrites history'' The New Daily 30 March 2016; http://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2016/03/30/invaded-settled-unsw-rewrite-australian-history/&lt;/ref&gt; that "Aboriginal people have lived in Australia for 40,000 years" should be dropped for "... since the beginning of the Dreaming/s" as it "reflects the beliefs of many Indigenous Australians that they have always been in Australia, from the beginning of time" and because "many Indigenous Australians see this sort of measurement and quantifying as inappropriate." While some commentators considered the guidelines appropriate,&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Paul ''It's not 'politically correct' to say Australia was invaded, it's history'', The Guardian'' (Australia) 30 March 2016; https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/mar/30/its-not-politically-correct-to-say-australia-was-invaded-its-history&lt;/ref&gt; others categorised them as political correctness that was an anathema to learning and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Chris ''Australian university accused of 'rewriting history' over British invasion language'', The Telegraph (London) 30 March 2016; https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/12207016/Australian-university-accused-of-rewriting-history-over-British-invasion-language.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History wars and culture wars==
The "history wars" are widely viewed, by external observers and participants on both sides as similar to the "[[culture war]]" underway in the United States. William D. Rubinstein, writing for the conservative British think tank the [[Social Affairs Unit]], refers to the history wars as "the Culture War down under".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubinstein |first=William D. |url=http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/001055.php |title=Web Review: The Culture Wars Down Under: Keith Windschuttle, the Aboriginal people, and the Left - Part Two |publisher=The Social Affairs Unit |date=8 August 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the debate including [[Keith Windschuttle]] and [[Robert Manne]] are frequently described as "culture warriors" for their respective points of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/pms-contempt-for-abc/2006/06/16/1149964738584.html |title=PM's contempt for ABC - Opinion |publisher=theage.com.au |date=16 June 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010 | location=Melbourne |first=Robert |last=Manne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/15/1149964674485.html |title=ABC gets a culture warrior - National |publisher=theage.com.au |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010 | location=Melbourne |first1=Michelle |last1=Grattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jaime Zuzarte Cortesão''' (29 April 1884 - 14 August 1960) was a Portuguese doctor, politician, historian and an author.

==Biography==
Cortesão was born in Ançã near Cantanhede.  Later he studied at the [[University of Porto]] for his medical studies.  In 1919, he was director of the [[Portuguese National Library|National Library]] in Lisbon. In 1921, he wrote several articles in the review ''[[Atlantida (review)|Atlantida]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Silvana Fernandes Lopes|title=Atlantida" Magazine: elementary education in Portugal and Brazil in the early decades of the twentieth century|journal=Rev. Lusófona de Educaçãol|date=2012|issue=20|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1645-72502012000100010&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=i|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the periodical ''Seara Nova''.  In 1919, he was officer of the [[Order of Saint Jacob of the Sword|Order of St. Jacob of the Sword]]. As he was a democrat and a republican, he was one of the first leaders of counter-rebellion in Porto in 1927 against the Fascist regime, [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]],  He was sent into exile into France and in 1940 into Brazil.  Later, he returned to Portugal in 1957 where he died in 1960.

He was posthumously awarded the Grand Officer of the Order of Freedom and the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Prince Henry the Navigator]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2645">'''Jean-Baptiste Honoré Raymond Capefigue''' (1801 – December 1872) was a French historian and [[biographer]].

He was born in [[Marseille]], France.  At the age of twenty he went to Paris to study law, but soon switched to journalism. He became editor of the ''Quotidienne'', and was afterwards connected, either as editor or leading contributor, with the ''Temps'', the ''Messager des Chambres'', the ''Revolution de 1848'' and other papers.

During the ascendancy of the [[House of Bourbon]], he held a post in the foreign office, to which is due the royalism of some of his newspaper articles. Indeed, all Capefigue's works are influenced by his legitimist politics; he believed in the [[Divine Right of Kings]] and non-resistance, and found polite words even for the profligacy of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and the worthlessness of his mistresses.

He wrote biographies of [[Catherine de' Medici]] and [[Marie de Medici]], [[Anne of Austria]], [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], [[Catherine II of Russia]], [[Elizabeth I of England]], [[Diana of Poitiers]] and [[Agnès Sorel]]—for he delighted in passing from "queens of the right hand" to "queens of the left."

His historical works, besides histories of the Jews from the fall of the [[Maccabees]] to the author's time, of the first four centuries of the Christian church, and of European diplomatists, extend over the whole range of French history. He died at Paris.

The general catalogue of printed books for the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] contains no fewer than seventy-seven works (145 volumes) published by Capefigue during forty years. Of these only the ''Histoire de Philipp-Auguste'' (4 vols., 1829) and the ''Histoire de la réforme, de la ligue et du règne de Henri IV'' (8 vols., 1834–1835) perhaps deserve still to be remembered.

Capefigue was hasty, and although he had access to an exceptionally large number of sources of information, including the state papers, his accuracy and judgment are doubtful.

'''Jean Stengers''' (1922 &amp;ndash; 15 August 2002) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] historian.

A precocious and brilliant student, Stengers entered the [[Free University of Brussels]] in 1939, at the age of 17.  He published his first scholarly article two years later in the ''[[Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire]]'' (Belgian review of philology and history).  In 1948, he presented his doctoral thesis under the direction of Professor Bonenfant on the historical bases of the national sentiments of Belgium.

"From this time," said the historian Ginette Kurgan, "the astonishing eclecticism of his interests is manifest, reinforced by a rigour of approach stimulated by his training as a medievalist."  From 1949 he taught colonial history as assistant to  professor Franz Van Kalken, and in 1951 he took over Van Kalken's entire curriculum in modern history.

Stengers was promoted to ''professeur ordinaire'' in 1954.  He helped found the Institute of the History of Christianity, and in 1967 succeeded [[Guillaume Jacquemyns]] as director of the seminar of contemporary history.  Though his interests were wide-ranging, his scholarly reputation was built on his treatment of the Belgian colonial history.  His work ''Congo, Mythes et réalités'' was published in 1989.

He was the father of the historian of science and epistemologist [[Isabelle Stengers]].

'''John Colville''' (c. 1540–1605), [[Scotland|Scottish]] clergyman, judge, politician and author, was the son of Robert Colville of [[Cleish]], in [[Kinross]].

Educated at the [[University of St Andrews]], he became a [[Presbyterian]] [[Minister of religion|minister]], but occupied himself chiefly with political intrigue, sending secret information to the [[English government]] concerning [[Scottish affairs]]. He joined the party of the [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie|Earl of Gowrie]], and took part in the [[Raid of Ruthven]] in 1582. In 1587 he for a short time occupied a seat on the judicial bench, and was [[burgh commissioner]] for [[Stirling (Parliament of Scotland constituency)|Stirling]] in the [[Parliament of Scotland]].

In December 1591 he was implicated in the [[Francis Stewart Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]]'s attack on [[Holyrood Palace]], and was outlawed with the earl. He retired abroad, and is said to have joined the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]]. He died in Paris in 1605.

Colville was the author of several works, including an [[Oratio Funebris]] on [[Elizabeth I of England]], and some political and religious controversial essays. He is said to be the author also of ''The Historie and Life of [[James I of England|King James the Sext]]'' (edited by T. Thompson for the [[Bannatyne Club]], Edinburgh, 1825).

''Colville's Original Letters, 1582–1603'', published by the [[Bannatyne Club]] in 1858, contains a biographical memoir by the editor, [[David Laing (Scottish antiquary)|David Laing]].

'''Lake Tyers Mission''' also known as ‘Bung Yarnda’ was an Aboriginal mission established in 1863 on the shore of Lake Tyers in Victoria‘s [[Gippsland]] region as a centralised place for Aboriginal people from around Victoria.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

==History==

The Lake Tyers Mission Station was established by the Church of England missionary Reverend John Bulmer in 1863 following decades of conflict between the [Kurnai]] people and white settlers in Gippsland. Bulmer had previously sought to establish a mission south of [[Buchan, Victoria|Buchan]] in 1861, but moved south to the coast with the few Aboriginal survivors of the conflict. The chosen site was on a peninsula, with a lake on each side, known to traditional owners as Bung Yarnda. In the early twentieth century, Aboriginal people from a number of other Victorian missions, including Ramahyuck, Condah and [[Coranderrk]], were relocated to Lake Tyers. The [[Ramahyuck Mission]] (established in 1863 by Reverend [[Friedrich Hagenauer]] on the Avon River near [[Lake Wellington]]) was closed in 1908 and the Ganai survivors from west and central Gippsland were moved to Lake Tyers. The [[Ebenezer Mission]] was closed in 1904 due to low numbers and in the following twenty years many Wergaia people from north-western Victoria were forcibly moved to Lake Tyers.&lt;ref name="Clark1996"&gt;Ian D. Clark, pp12, ''Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803-1859'', Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-85575-281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Tyers was taken over by the Victorian Government in 1908.

In 1916 the [[Government of Victoria]] decided to concentrate Aboriginal people from across Victoria at Lake Tyers,&lt;ref name="Clark1996" /&gt; with the [[Aboriginal Protection Board]] establishing a policy in 1917 to concentrate all 'full-blood' and 'half-caste' Aboriginal people on the Lake Tyers Station. In 1957 the Board for the Protection of Aborigines was abolished, and in the 1960s the Victorian Government decided to try to close the settlement, and assimilate residents into the general community. Some were moved to distant parts of the state, but not necessarily their traditional lands.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-21/lake-tyers-history-piece/5170896 A brief history of the Lake Tyers Aboriginal community, By Jeff Waters, ABC Radio, 21 Dec 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests in the 1950s and 60s for an independent, Aboriginal run farming cooperative at Lake Tyers received support and assistance from the [[Aborigines Advancement League]] in Melbourne. [[Douglas Nicholls|Pastor Sir Doug Nicholls]] campaigned on their behalf, but when the Board moved to close Lake Tyers, Nichols resigned his position in protest.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; In 1965, however, the mission was declared a Permanent Reserve.

In 1970 the ''Aboriginal Lands Act 1970'' was passed by the [[Parliament of Victoria]], handing ownership of [[Framlingham, Victoria|Framlingham]] in western Victoria to an Aboriginal trust on 1 July 1971. Along with Lake Tyers, Framlingham was the last reserve to close in Victoria. In 1971 the remaining Lake Tyers residents, then only numbering a couple of hundred, were granted freehold title of the remaining {{convert|237|ha|km2}} as part of a self-governing community under the Lake Tyers Aboriginal Trust, with each adult and child receiving a parcel of shares.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

The Aborigines Advancement League had previously expressed concern for the loss of Aboriginal land in 1948, when it told the government that ''land titles of Lake Tyers must be transferred with due precaution in the matter of safeguard to prevent any attempted dispossession of the Aborigines and mixed bloods by any person''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indigenousrights.net.au/land_rights/lake_tyers,_1962-70/early_history_of_lake_tyers Australian Aborigines' League, Terms of Reference for an Enquiry, 4 March 1948, Council for Aboriginal Rights (Vic.) Papers, MS 12913/8/1, State Library of Victoria]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Laurie Moffatt explained as spokesman for Lake Tyers residents:

:''We do not want to see Lake Tyers finally sold to the white man in the same way as Ramahyuck, Condah, Ebenezer Mission and Coranderrk Reserves have been sold. All these have been hostels for the aborigines in my lifetime and have been sold to the white man to cultivate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Argus'', 28 January 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Administration==

An administrator (Simon Wallace-Smith of Deloitte) was appointed by the government to run the trust in 2003. However, the remaining shareholders objected and in 2011 they staged a two-week blockade of the site, camping at the settlement's gate and refusing access to all government officials. Wallace-Smith was escorted back in by police.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

'''''Law in Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory''''' is a 1976 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, Unger uses the rise and decline of the [[rule of law]] as a vehicle to explore certain problems in [[social theory]]. According to Unger, problems that were central concerns of classical social theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]—the problems of explanation, order, and modernity—remain unsolved. Unger contends that the failure of classical social theory to solve these dilemmas can be traced to the way in which it asserted its independence from the ancient political philosophers, namely in its denial of a supra-historical human nature and in its insistence upon the contrast of [[fact-value distinction|fact and value]]. Unger argues that a radical reorientation of social theory is needed to solve the problems it faces. "To carry out its own program," Unger writes, social theory must destroy itself."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=8}} The rise and decline of the rule of law, and the dilemmas of social theory, converge in the need to be able to compare and criticize different forms of society, in order to be able to more effectively submit the organization of society to the human will.

==Overview==

===Chapter 1: The Predicament of Social Theory===

Unger opens ''Law in Modern Society'' by connecting the study of law to the unsolved problems of social theory. Social theory is the tradition originating in the writings of [[Montesquieu]] and culminating with the work of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]].{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=1-3}} In Unger's view, classic social theory as represented by these thinkers is marked by an insistence on the distinction between fact and value, description and evaluation, and also by a denial of a unitary human nature. Unger contrasts classic social theory with the political philosophy of the ancients, who did not recognize as sharp a distinction between fact and value, and maintained that there is a universal human nature that exists in all times and places.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=3-5}}

The study of law affords a vantage point from which to explore three unsolved problems of social theory, according to Unger. The first, the '''problem of method''', is that the prevailing methodological approaches to social study are inadequate. The rationalist approach (as seen in the works of economists) and the historicist approach (which accepts the function of cause and effect but not logical entailment) both invite deterministic social explanations. Unger contends that we need a third method, one that is generalizing, and yet also open to rich historical particularity while not falling into deterministic explanations.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=8-23}}

The second problem is the '''problem of social order'''. How do we account for the existence of a social order? Classical social theory is represented by a struggle between the doctrines of instrumentalism (or private interest) versus legitimacy (or consensus). The legitimacy approach sees rules as manifestations of the shared values of a group. The instrumentalist approach sees society as made up of many divergent individual wills, and rules serve the instrumental purpose of helping the members of society achieve their privately chosen aims in the long run.  Utilitarianism is an example of an instrumentalist approach. According to Unger, we need to go beyond the partial truths expressed in each doctrine.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=23-37}}

The third unsolved problem of social theory is '''the problem of modernity'''. What marks the experience of modernity? What is its place in world history? What is the relationship between ideology and actuality in modern life? Our social theory must be able to reconcile the subjective experience of society with its objective meaning. As history transpires, new puzzles are added to the experience of studying modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=37-40}} A large part of the problem of modernity is the difficulty of comparing modern forms of social life: modern Western society with its forbears, and different forms of contemporary society (traditional, revolutionary socialist, postliberal) among themselves.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=41-42}}

The program of classic social theory has value, according to Unger—namely in allowing us to study human beings as they are rather than as they ought to be, and in helping us to inquire into how each society shapes conduct and consciousness of its members. These classical social theorists sought to create a body of objective knowledge of society that would not be at the mercy of metaphysical speculation or political controversy, and up to a point, they succeeded.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=266-267}} But Unger concludes that the problems of social theory cannot be resolved unless the truths of classic social theory are reconciled with the insights of older political philosophy.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=43}} We need a general doctrine of human nature.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=40-43}}

===Chapter 2: Law and the Forms of Society===

In this chapter Unger addresses the varieties of law and explores the conditions under which each of them develops. '''Customary/interactional''' law is neither public nor positive, and consists of implicit standards of conduct, not formulated rules. Under a system of customary and interactional law, customs are characteristically inarticulate.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=49-50}} '''Bureaucratic/regulatory''' law is public and positive, and emerges with the division of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=50-52}} A '''legal order''' is a legal system that is committed to being general and autonomous, in addition to being public and positive.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=52-54}}

From this discussion, he draws conclusions about the issue of social order as it relates to the development of law. Unger explains how disintegration of community is accompanied by a trend toward increasing specialization in a society's division of labor, a trend that is responsible for the separation of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=63}} This process erodes the basis for an inclusive set of shared beliefs.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=61-62}} The legal order emerges with interest group pluralism,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=66-76}} as well as reliance on higher divine or universal law as standard for justifying and criticizing a state's positive law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=76-86}}  The rule of law is a response to the decline of order in society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=127-133}} But when the belief in higher law declines, the legal order is threatened. In contemporary history, the natural rights synthesis that underlies the legal order ideal has been undone, with the result that the coherence of the rule of law ideal is compromised.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=84-86}}

===Chapter 3: Law and Modernity===

In this chapter, Unger traces the rise and decline of the rule of law in society. He begins by setting out a preliminary framework for the comparison of societies, and uses this framework to examine tribal society, liberal society, and aristocratic society. Unger's inquiry into these types of society revolves around three questions: What is the nature of the contrast between insiders and outsiders? How are insiders drawn together in significant groups and what is the quality of their encounters with strangers? And, finally, how individuals conceive of the place of the ideal—do they have a concept of the right or the good that transcends the natural or social world?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=137-140}}

Unger concludes that tribal society displays the starkest possible contrast between insiders and outsiders; outsiders are not regarded as human beings with whom the insiders share anything significant in common. There is a paucity of significant groups in tribal society. And there is little conception of a good or right that towers over the immanent reality of daily life or the natural world. The important insight, for Unger, is that tribal society is an extremely cohesive social world, where there is deep agreement about fundamental social questions, profound distrust of strangers, and no recognition of overarching ideals against which the quotidian life or nature can be compared.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=140-143}}

At the other extreme, liberal society is one in which the contrast between insiders and outsiders is softened by the fact that each individual belongs to a large number of significant groups. Because members of liberal society become accustomed to other people being both insiders and outsiders in different contexts, the hostility of tribal society for the stranger is replaced, in liberal society, by ideals of impersonal respect and formal equality. People will abide by relatively stable standards of social order because it is to their advantage to do so, not because they observe identical conceptions of the true and the good. In liberal society, a concept of the right and the good transcends the reality of daily life and the natural world.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=143-147}}

Unger views aristocratic society as a synthesis of tribal and liberal societies. Aristocratic society unites universalism and particularism. In aristocratic society, significant social groups are experienced as steps on a hierarchic ladder. Each individual belongs to a specific group, his estate, which confers on him a range of entitlements and obligations and predetermine his outlook on the world. These strata are sharply divided from each other and are decisive in determining the quality of the individual's life. Aristocratic society's view of the relationship between the ideal and the actual occupies an intermediate position between the views of tribal and liberal society. In aristocratic society, there is an intense oscillation between a tendency to sanctify existing social arrangements and the tendency to oppose them to a higher heavenly perfection.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=147-153}}

Having set out a rudimentary grammar for the comparison of societies, Unger traces the emergence and decline of the liberal state and the rule of law{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=134}} (which Unger describes as the soul of liberal society{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=192}}).

Liberal society developed out of aristocratic society, namely the society of estates (Standestaat), which was an intermediary system between feudal society and the modern liberal state.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=155-156}} The law of the Standestaat was a forerunner to the modern legal system, and consisted of an area of royal discretion (matters falling under the prince's prerogative to keep the peace) and a higher law (matters pertaining to the privileges and obligations of estates of the realm).{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=158-160}} The elements that make up a modern legal order—positiveness, publicity, generality and autonomy—were not present,{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=160}} but as the formerly neat line between royal prerogatives and the law of estates faded away, the prince was increasingly held to standards of generality and autonomy, and estate privileges acquired a public and positive character.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=162-163}} The confinement of royal power by the fundamental law of the Standestaat was supported by a belief in a God-given natural order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}}

The liberal state—with its multiplicity of significant groups, the disappearance of a sharp distinction between insiders and outsiders, and a stark division between the ideal and the actual—faced two questions with increasing urgency: how can there be consensus without widespread agreement about the good,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=169-170}} and how can we distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of power in the face of dissolving hierarchy and moral confusion?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=172-173}} The rule of law, which attempted to guarantee the impersonality of power, was a way of dealing with these urgent questions.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=176-178}}

The rule of law has two major premises—that the most significant forms of power can be concentrated in government, and that power can be effectively constrained by rules. But Unger contends that these premises are largely fictitious.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=178-179}} They are undermined by the awareness that individuals are most vulnerable to hierarchies of the family, the workplace, and the market that are largely beyond the reach of the legal system, and also that rules can never make power truly impersonal and impartial—administrators and judges will always decide among competing sets of beliefs in rendering a decision.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=179-181}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, the very assumptions of the rule of law ideal appear to be falsified by the reality of life in liberal society ... The state, a supposedly neutral overseer of social conflict, is forever caught up in the antagonism of private interests and made the tool of one faction or another. Thus, in seeking to discipline and to justify the exercise of power, men are condemned to pursue an objective they are forbidden to reach. And this repeated disappointment accentuates still further the gap between the vision of the ideal and the experience of actuality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=181}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The contradictions and paradoxes of liberal society, by undermining the rule of law and the ideals it represents, ultimately give rise to what Unger calls postliberal society. Postliberal society is marked by overt intervention by the government in areas previously regarded as beyond the reach of state action, and a gradual approximation of state and society. The state's pretense of being a neutral guardian of the social order is abandoned.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-193}} These trends are reflected in the rise of open-ended clauses in legislation, administration, and adjudication, and a concern with substantive justice over formal justice.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-200}} The effacement of the boundary between state and society, called corporatism, leads to the rise of state institutions that rival the state in their power.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=200-203}} Unger argues that these welfare state institutions are an assault on the legal order, while the corporatist tendencies in postliberal society undermine bureaucratic law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=200}} The danger of these tendencies, Unger contends, is demonstrated by the Weimar Republic, in which the decline of the rule of law in favor of a welfare corporate state set the stage for terror and inhumanity of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=216-220}}

Unger concludes his examination of law and modernity by looking at two varieties of the modern state—the traditionalist state{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=224-231}} and the revolutionary socialist{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=231-234}}—then considering two possibilities for the development of law in the future. Seeing similar tensions within traditionalist and revolutionary socialist societies,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=234-235}} Unger points out that the liberal state is only a special case of modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}} He concludes that there's no more reason to think that societies will converge toward similarity rather than grow in their differences.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=237}}

The future of the rule of law, Unger suggests, could take two forms. The first, pessimistic, possibility he imagines is a scenario in which the progression of custom, bureaucracy, and rule of law revolves in a circle, and the postliberal decline of the rule of law would lead to the return of custom as the exclusive instrument of the social order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=238-239}} There would be a relapse of a tribalism that sanctifies the existing order of the group as an irrevocable decree of nature. The second possibility Unger imagines is an optimistic scenario, which Unger describes as a spiral in which "individual freedom could be rescued from the demise of the rule of law."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=239}} On this model, society defeats inequality to such an extent that people place greater confidence in collective choices, not suspecting them as a product of the interests of dominant groups.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=239-240}} The increasing equality of society would make possible a greater consensus about the immanent order of society and help refine further the meaning of equality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=240}}

===Chapter 4: The Predicament of Social Theory Revisited===

In this final chapter, Unger returns to the questions of the methodology of social theory with which he opened the book.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=243-245}} For each of the unsolved problems of social theory—the problem of method, the problem of social order, and the problem of modernity—Unger concludes that the theoretical problems of social theory require a political solution.

For the problem of method, Unger offers the interpretive method as an alternative to the rationalist and historicist approaches favored by classical social theorists. The interpretive method, which emphasizes the embeddedness of action in belief and the way social phenomena cluster into meaningful totalities, avoids the tendency of rationalist and historicist methods to fall into deterministic accounts of human activity, while also offering the prospect of reconciling the demands of subjectivity and objectivity in social explanation. But the possibility of reconciling subjectivity and objectivity in social theory ultimately is premised on a belief in the unity of the human spirit, and in order to be achieved, we would need a community of experience, understanding and value to come into existence. For this reason, to solve the problem of method completely requires a political solution.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=245-262}}

For the second persistent problem of social theory, the problem of social order, Unger sees the crux of this problem in the divergence between the doctrines of legitimacy/consensus and instrumentalism/private interest. These views offer completely different accounts of the basis for order in society. Unger allows that instrumentalism is more effective in explaining liberal society, while consensus theory comes closer in explaining tribal and hierarchical societies.
Social study of law suggests a response to our puzzlement over the basis of order in society. It puts the controversy between the doctrines of private interest and consensus, and hence between the instrumental and noninstrumental view of rules, in perspective. But once again, a political solution is called for to deal with the divergence between instrumentalism and consensus theories: the crisis of order will only be fully resolved once it reconciles individual freedom with community cohesion, and the sense of immanent order with possibility of community cohesion.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=262-265}}

Addressing the final unsolved problem of social theory, the problem of modernity, Unger concludes that we must reject the approaches offered by both liberalism, which views society as an association of individuals with conflicting ends and whose security and freedom are guaranteed by the rule of law, and Marxism, which sees society as a structure of class domination whose true character is hidden by the prevailing ideology. Unger argues we must focus on the interplay between belief and experience, consciousness and organization, in the study of modernity. This interplay takes new forms as history unfolds. The political problem presented by modernity—a problem confronted by postliberal, traditionalist, and revolutionary socialist societies—is the problem of reconciling freedom and community. Harmonizing the sense of latent order in society with the capacity to let will remake social arrangements is the key to reconciling freedom and community.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=265-266}}

==Reception==

[[Talcott Parsons]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Law &amp; Society Review]]'', and offered qualified praise for Unger's work. "The book is important because it contains one of the sharpest and clearest statements of the problem of what the author calls the place of a legal system in a total and complex society."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=145}} However, Parsons contends that Unger erroneously claims that law as a social phenomenon is restricted to its interpenetration with the state. Parsons also "disagree[s] with [Unger's] characterization of the legal system as ''part of the structure of modern societies''."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}} Parsons concludes: "His is both an important and a good book, but it does not give the reader a
competent and comprehensive appraisal of the issues which contemporary legal and 'social' theory need to confront in their mutual pursuit of an understanding of legal systems."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}}

Manning J. Dauer reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'', describing the book as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;an able work arguing for a new synthesis in social sciences and in legal theory. The argument that traditionalistic aspects now need modifying is well presented. The rule of law is an important concept, but it has to be adapted to more individualistic judgments as the social sciences impinge on traditionalistic interpretations. Might he consider John Rawls's attempt to define Social Justice? Unger points out the need and the difficulties; the method whereby this will be achieved is still in process, but the dilemma presented to the social sciences is well stated.{{sfn|Dauer|1977|p=1106}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

German sociologist Klaus Eder considered ''Law in Modern Society'' alongside [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]]'s ''The Behavior of Law''. Eder considered Unger's argument in detail, and concluded that Unger offered a promising research program for a sociological study of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This model of the evolution of law is an interesting working hypothesis, which may be especially fruitful for the analysis of changes in modern law. [Unger's] book is ... neither more nor less than a research program, probably a fruitful one, for the sociological study of law on two levels: a synchronic structural description of forms of normative order and a diachronic social-historical analysis of the factors that produce structural transformations of law.{{sfn|Eder|1977|p=142-143}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James B. Stewart|James Stewart]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Journal of Economic Issues]]'', writing that "this book should be read by those seeking to escape the limitations of existing social theory and particularly neoclassical economics. In particular, Unger's emphasis on the need to undertake cross-cultural analyses and his careful delineation of alternative concepts of law provide a useful guide for further developments in institutional economics."{{sfn|Stewart|1976|pp=990-991}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neil T. Duxbury wrote a retrospective assessment of ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Modern Law Review]]''. Duxbury acknowledges Unger's commitment to "straddle the frontiers of social theory" in both ''[[Knowledge and Politics]]'' and ''Law in Modern Society'', calling this persistence in addressing the most difficult questions of social theory a "defining feature of the book." However, Duxbury finds fault with the book, contending that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger's notion of post-liberalism is awash with over-generalised arguments. Contrary to his own suggestions, there appears to be no reason why the corporatist tendency within post-liberalism should result not only in a move towards the establishment of substantive justice, but also in the maintenance of the liberal tendency towards formal justice.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=673}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duxbury concludes that Unger's work operates at such a vague and abstract level of generality, that his work might be invalidated by empirical evidence left unexplored by Unger:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger has continued to develop his 'modernist' position with a conceptual vagueness which suggests not so much that he should be criticised for theorising at a selected level of abstraction, but rather that, so long as he continues to operate at this level, he will always, if only potentially, be open to the charge of failing to pay sufficient attention to the empirical evidence on offer-evidence which may sometimes invalidate the conceptualisations to which he ascribes.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=679}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alfred P. Rubin offered high praise for ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''Perspective'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible to do justice to this book in a short review. The evolution of society from status to contract and back to status has been noted by many other writers, but Professor Unger's framework for social analysis is in large part original, accessible only to sophisticated scholars, and possibly seminal.{{sfn|Rubin|1976|p=114}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18290">'''Li Guangbi''' (李光弼) (708 – August 15, 764&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&amp;dyna=%AD%F0&amp;king=%A5N%A9v&amp;reign=%BCs%BCw&amp;yy=2&amp;ycanzi=&amp;mm=7&amp;dd=14&amp;dcanzi= 兩千年中西曆轉換&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), formally '''Prince Wumu of Linhuai''' (臨淮武穆王), was a general of the [[History of China|Chinese]] dynasty [[Tang dynasty]], of ethnic [[Khitan people|Khitan]] ancestry, who was instrumental in Tang's suppression of the [[Anshi Rebellion]].

== Background ==
Li Guangbi was born in 708, during the second reign of [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]].  His father, Li Kailuo (李楷洛), was a general of [[Khitan people|Khitan]] ancestry, whose achievements during the ''Kaiyuan'' era (713–741) of Emperor Zhongzong's nephew [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] eventually led to his creation as the Duke of Ji Commandery.  Li Guangbi's mother was Lady Li.

Li Guangbi was said to be careful in his behavior when young.  He was capable in horsemanship and archery, and also studied the ''[[Book of Han]]''.  He started his army service when young, and was said to be decisive, strict, and full of strategies.  After his father died, he inherited the title of the Duke of Ji, and was praised for not entering his wife's room (i.e., abstaining from sexual relations) during the observation of the mourning period.

At the start of Emperor Xuanzong's ''Tianbao'' era (742-756), Li Guangbi became the discipline officer at [[Shuofang]] Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern [[Yinchuan]], [[Ningxia]]).  In 746, the military governor (''[[jiedushi]]'') of Shuofang and Hexi (河西, headquartered in modern [[Wuwei, Gansu]]) Circuits, [[Wang Zhongsi]], made him a commanding general for Hexi Circuit, as well as the commander of Chishui Base (赤水軍, in modern Wuwei).  Li and [[Geshu Han]] became the two key generals under Wang, while he was in command of Shuofang and Hexi.  Wang often commented, "One day, Li Guangbi will have my command," and Li gained a reputation for being a good general.  In 747, Li unsuccessfully tried to stop Wang from interfering with a campaign against the [[Tibetan Empire]] commanded by the general Dong Yanguang (董延光), and when Dong failed, Wang was removed from his post.  In 749, he was made the deputy military governor of Hexi, serving under Geshu, and was created the title of Duke of Su Commandery in his own right.  In 752, was made the deputy protectorate general at Chanyu (單于, in modern [[Hohhot]], [[Inner Mongolia]]).  In 755, [[An Sishun]], then the military governor of Shuofang, requested him as deputy.  An was impressed by him and wanted to give a daughter to him in marriage, but Li declined and feigned an illness in order to resign and return to the capital [[Chang'an]] under Geshu's assistance.

== During Anshi Rebellion ==
In winter 755, [[An Lushan]], the military governor of Fanyang Circuit (范陽, headquartered in modern [[Beijing]]), rebelled, and quickly proceeded south toward the Tang eastern capital [[Luoyang]].  Emperor Xuanzong recalled An Sishun, who was An Lushan's cousin, to Chang'an, and gave the military governorship of Shuofang to [[Guo Ziyi]].  He also asked Guo's recommendation on whom to entrust Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern [[Taiyuan]], [[Shanxi]]), and Guo recommended Li Guangbi.  In spring 756, Emperor Xuanzong made Li the military governor of Hedong and had him and Guo advance from Shuofang east, intending to capture An Lushan's territory north of the [[Yellow River]].  Li quickly advanced and captured most of Changshan Commandery (常山, roughly modern [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]).  When An's general [[Shi Siming]] counterattacked, Guo rendezvoused with him and together, they fought Shi off, and subsequently, they cut off the communications between Luoyang (which An had captured and where he had declared himself emperor of a new state of [[Yan (Anshi)|Yan]]) and Fanyang.  An, fearing that his army's morale would be destroyed, considered leaving Luoyang and returning north to battle Li and Guo himself.

Meanwhile, though, another Yan army, commanded by his general Cui Qianyou (崔乾祐), approached [[Tong Pass]], defended by Geshu Han, and was pretending to be weak in order to draw an attack from Geshu.  Geshu, Li, and Guo all recommended to Emperor Xuanzong that the forces under him continue to hold at Tong Pass and not attack Cui, while waiting for Li and Guo to capture Fanyang first to destroy Yan forces' morale.  However, the [[chancellor of the Tang dynasty|chancellor]] [[Yang Guozhong]], fearing that Geshu's intentions were actually to start a coup and overthrow him, recommended that Emperor Xuanzong order Geshu to attack Cui.  Emperor Xuanzong did so over Geshu's objections, and Geshu was defeated by Cui, who captured Geshu and then Tong Pass.  He then approached Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to abandon it and flee to [[Chengdu]] and Emperor Xuanzong's [[crown prince]] [[Emperor Suzong of Tang|Li Heng]] to flee to [[Lingwu]] (the headquarters of Shuofang), where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong).

Meanwhile, Li and Guo heard only of the news that Tong Pass had fallen, but did not know what had happened afterwards, and they decided to withdraw back west of the [[Taihang Mountains]].  Later, when Emperor Suzong sent emissaries to call them to Lingwu, they went to Lingwu.  Emperor Suzong gave him the additional honorary chancellor&lt;ref&gt;As Li Guangbi never assumed the responsibilities of chancellor at the central imperial administration, he was not usually considered an actual chancellor by traditional historians.  See, e.g., ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/table/form02.htm vol. 62] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922174032/http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/table/form02.htm |date=2008-09-22 }} [table of chancellors, part 2].&lt;/ref&gt; title of ''Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi'' (同中書門下平章事) and had him return to [[Taiyuan]] (the headquarters of Hedong) with 5,000 soldiers, leaving the rest of his soldiers at Lingwu in anticipation of a campaign to recapture Chang'an.  When Li arrived at Taiyuan, he, who was angry that the official Cui Zhong (崔眾) had disrespected the prior military governor Wang Chengye (王承業) when relieving Wang, found an excuse to kill Cui, and this shocked the army, causing the entire army to be fearful of him.

In spring 757, Shi, knowing that Li had left most of his troops at Lingwu and believing that Taiyuan's defenses were weak, took 100,000 men to Taiyuan and put it under siege.  Li, however, defended the city capably and repeatedly repelled assaults on the city's defenses.  Around the same time, An Lushan was assassinated and succeeded by his son [[An Qingxu]], who ordered Shi to return to Fanyang and leave Cai Xide (蔡希德) to continue to siege Taiyuan, although Li was then able to defeat Cai, forcing Cai to lift the siege and retreat.  After this victory, Emperor Suzong created him the Duke of Wei, and later changed the title to Duke of Zheng.  Around the new year 758, after Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an from Yan forces, he gave Li the title of ''Sikong'' (司空), one of the [[Three Excellencies]].

Meanwhile, Tang and [[Huige]] forces had also captured Luoyang, forcing An Qingxu to flee to [[Ye, China|Yecheng]], but most of his generals submitted to Tang, leaving him only with control of the region around Yecheng.  Shi, in control of Fanyang and surrounding regions, also submitted to Tang, and was made a Tang general.  However, Li believed that Shi would eventually rebel again anyway, and persuaded Emperor Suzong to have Shi's associate Wu Cheng'en (烏承恩) assassinate him and take over the region himself.  When Shi realized this, he killed Wu and submitted a petition demanding that Emperor Suzong kill Li.  Emperor Suzong disavowed any knowledge on his part or Li's and tried to placate Shi, but Shi then rebelled again.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Song dynasty]] historian [[Hu Sanxing]], however, doubted that Emperor Suzong and Li actually were plotting to kill Shi, pointing out that there were a number of implausibilities in the alleged plot by Wu -- including an alleged order from Li that, after Wu succeeds, he should execute all of Shi's main generals.  He thus believed that Shi made up the plot as an excuse to rebel and forged the order to get the other generals to go along with him.  See ''[[Bo Yang]] Edition of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', vol. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fall 758, Li went to Chang'an to visit Emperor Suzong and was given the additional title of ''Shizhong'' (侍中) as honorary chancellor.  Soon thereafter, he and several other key commanders, including Guo, Lu Jiong (魯炅), Li Huan (李奐), Xu Shuji (許叔冀), [[Li Siye]], Ji Guangchen (季廣琛), Cui Guangyuan (崔光遠), [[Li Zhongchen|Dong Qin]], and Wang Sili (王思禮), rendezvoused at Yecheng to put An Qingxu under siege.  Because both Li Guangbi and Guo had great contributions, Emperor Suzong did not make either of them the overall commander of the forces, but commissioned the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] [[Yu Chao'en]] to serve as the surveyor of the troops.  During the siege, Li Guangbi suggested launching an all-out assault on Yecheng's defenses, but Yu opposed, and such an assault was not carried out.

Faced with a siege that he could not fight out of, An Qingxu sought aid from Shi Siming, who led an army south from Fanyang and engaged Tang forces in spring 759, and during the middle of the battle, both Tang forces and Shi's forces panicked and scattered—with most of Tang forces completely scattering and pillaging the surrounding areas before fleeing back to their own circuits, with the exception of Li Guangbi and Wang, who were able to gather their forces and withdraw.  In fall 759, with Yu blaming Guo for the collapse, Emperor Suzong transferred the command of the Shuofang troops that Guo commanded to Li Guangbi.  With Guo's command style being far more relaxed than Li Guangbi's strict style, the Shuofang army was initially displeased, and the general Zhang Yongji (張用濟) considered forcibly ejecting Li Guangbi and demanding Guo's restoration; when Li Guangbi found out, he arrested and executed Zhang.  Li Guangbi was also made the deputy supreme commander of the armed forces and in effect in command of the entire Tang army command structure, as the supreme commander was Emperor Suzong's son Li Xi (李係) the Prince of Zhao, whose title was honorary.

Soon thereafter, Shi, who had killed An Qingxu and declared himself the new emperor of Yan, advanced south.  Li Guangbi, judging that Luoyang was not defendable, ordered that Luoyang be evacuated, instead taking position in the Heyang (河陽) area, near Luoyang.  Shi entered Luoyang, but subsequently with Li Guangbi defending Heyang, was unable to advance for some time toward Chang'an, as Li Guangbi repeatedly defeated his attacking forces, and was continuing to bog Li Guangbi's forces down in the Heyang region.  In spring 760, Emperor Suzong gave Li Guangbi the honorary chancellor title of ''Zhongshu Ling'' (中書令) and the title of ''Taiwei'' (太尉), also one of the [[Three Excellencies]].

By spring 761, however, Yu and [[Pugu Huai'en]], now in command of the Shuofang forces, were advocating that a campaign be launched to recapture Luoyang, and despite Li Guangbi's opposition, Emperor Suzong ordered Li Guangbi to attack Luoyang.  Li Guangbi, despite his reluctance, thus advanced toward Chang'an with Pugu, Yu, and Wei Boyu (衛伯玉).  He and Pugu, however, disagreed in regards to camp formation, with him wanting to put the camp in the hills and Pugu wanting to do so in the plains.  Yan forces thus took advantage and launched a major attack on them, thoroughly routing Tang forces.  All of the Tang generals, including Li Guangbi, Pugu, Yu, and Wei all fled.  Li Baoyu (李抱玉), whom Li Guangbi had left at Heyang, also abandoned Heyang, and Heyang fell into Yan hands.  (Soon after the Yan victory, however, Shi was assassinated and succeeded by his own son [[Shi Chaoyi]], and Yan forces were unable to take advantage of the victory over Tang forces.)  Li Guangbi requested a demotion, and he was demoted to the honorary title of ''Kaifu Yitong Sansi'' (開府儀同三司) and the honorary chancellor of title of ''Shizhong'', and was made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern [[Yuncheng, Shanxi|Yuncheng]], [[Shanxi]]), but almost immediately again made ''Taiwei'' again and made the deputy supreme commander, but only of the Henan region (i.e., area south of the Yellow River).  Emperor Suzong also had him take over the commands of the expeditionary forces from the [[Huai River]] and [[Yangtze River]] region, taking up position at Linhuai (臨淮, in modern [[Huai'an]], [[Jiangsu]]), with Shi Chaoyi seeking to expand toward the southeast.  Once he arrived at his post, Li Guangbi was able to lift the siege that Yan forces were putting on [[Songzhou]], stopping Yan advances in the region.  Moreover, several Tang generals who had been staying in the region and not reporting to their proper posts—Tian Shengong (田神功), Shang Heng (尚衡), and Yin Zhongqing (殷仲卿), fearing LI Guangbi, soon reported to their posts.  Emperor Suzong created Li Guangbi the Prince of Linhuai.  Li Guangbi himself took up position at Xu Prefecture (徐州, roughly modern [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]) and made it his headquarters.  He also sent an army to defeat the rebellion of Yuan Chao (袁晁), who had captured Tai Prefecture (臺州, roughly modern [[Taizhou, Zhejiang]]) and surrounding prefectures.

In winter 762, by which time Emperor Suzong had died and had been succeeded by his son [[Emperor Daizong of Tang|Emperor Daizong]], with Tang forces converging on Luoyang to try to recapture it from Shi Chaoyi, Li Guangbi headed toward Luoyang, with Pugu and Huige forces heading east as well, joined by the generals Guo Ying'ai (郭英乂) and Li Baoyu.  The joint Tang and Huige forces defeated Shi Chaoyi, forcing him to abandon Luoyang and flee north.  Shi Chaoyi committed suicide in flight in spring 763, ending the Anshi Rebellion.

== After Anshi Rebellion ==
Meanwhile, though, because Li Guangbi feared false accusations from Yu Chao'en and another eunuch, [[Cheng Yuanzhen]], he was refusing to visit Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Daizong.  His fears grew after another general, Lai Tian (來瑱), was ordered to commit suicide due to Cheng's accusations.  Even when Tibetan forces attacked Chang'an in fall 763, causing Emperor Daizong to briefly abandon Chang'an, Li Guangbi refused to come to the aid of the emperor.  In order to try to please Li Guangbi, Emperor Daizong had Li Guangbi's stepmother, to whom he was very devoted, brought to Chang'an and treated with great respect, while giving Li Guangbi's brother Li Guangjin (李光進) partial command of the imperial guards and creating Li Guangjin the Duke of Liang, but these actions did not affect Li Guangbi.  When Emperor Daizong put him in charge of Luoyang in summer 764, he declined to go to Luoyang, but continued to stay in Xu Prefecture.

Li Guangbi had been well known for his military discipline, but after he repeatedly declined to follow imperial directives, his reputation fell, and many subordinate generals in the region began to disobey Li Guangbi as well, causing him to be embarrassed.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷223|vol. 223]].&lt;/ref&gt;  He grew ill and died in fall 764.  His casket was returned to Chang'an and buried with great honors.

The [[Song dynasty]] historian [[Ouyang Xiu]], in his ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', commented about Li Guangbi:&lt;ref&gt;''New Book of Tang'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/136.htm vol. 136] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226122326/http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/136.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Li Guangbi was of barbarian ancestry, but was calm and capable in defense.  When An Lushan rebelled, he took military command, and his strategies could not be rivaled.  His rewards and punishments were fair and quick, and his soldiers fought hard under him.  This are the characters like the great generals of ancient days.  He did not visit his wife's bedchambers during mourning period for his father, and even when he became duke and prince he served his stepmother with great piety.  He was also well-versed in [[Ban Gu]]'s ''Book of Han''.  He was no ordinary military man.  Yet, fearing accusations, he could not stay faithful, and because of this fear became subject to great suspicions.  He sought to be secure, yet put himself in danger.  This is like the saying, "One knows how to make strategies for others but not for himself."  When he fought earnestly for the empire, the entire realm was impressed with him.  When he began to disobey orders, those like Tian Shengong disobeyed him as well, causing him to die in embarrassment.  How can this not be a negative example for those with accomplishments?  Alas, while LI Guangbi died in humiliation due to his failure to give up authority, but it was true that false accusations lead to great apprehension.  It was an unfortunate time.}}

'''Mehmet Fuat Köprülü''' (December 5, 1890 &amp;ndash; June 28, 1966), also known as '''Köprülüzade Mehmed Fuad''', was a highly influential [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[Turkology|turkologist]], [[Professor|scholar]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey|Deputy Prime Minister]] of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]].  A descendent of the illustrious noble [[Köprülü family]], whose influence in shaping [[History of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman history]] between 1656 and 1683 surpassed even that of the [[Ottoman dynasty|House of Osman]], Fuat Köprülü was a key figure in the intersection of scholarship and politics in early 20th century Turkey.  As a historian and public intellectual, his books, articles, essays and poems forged a “canon of Turkish culture and national identity” that provided the newly formed Republic of Turkey with scholarly sources of Turkishness.&lt;ref&gt;Basaran, Alpasan.  Fuat Koprulu: The Historian and Modern National Identity in Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkey, 1905-1924.  Nashville: Vanderbilt University, unpublished thesis, May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

=== Childhood and Education ===
Fuat Köprülü was born in the city of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] in 1890 as Köprülüzade Mehmed Fuad.  His paternal grandfather, Ahmet Ziya Bey, was the former ambassador to Bucharest, and Ahmet Ziya Bey was son of the former head of the Imperial Chancery of State (Divan-i Humayun Beylikcisi), Köprülüzade Arif Bey. Köprülüzade Arif Bey descended from the Köprülüs of the 17th century, an exceptional dynasty of [[Grand vizier|Grand Viziers]] whose reforms and conquests delayed the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Fuat Köprülü was named after the first Grand Vizier of the Köprülü Era, [[Köprülü Mehmed Pasha]].

Fuat Köprülü received his formal education at ''[[Hagia Sophia|Ayasofya]] Rusdiyesi'' and ''Mercan Idadisi'', both formed by Ottoman authorities to modernize and reform the [[Ottoman education system]]. In 1905, while a student at ''Mercan Idadisi'' and only 15 years old, the magazine ''Musavver Terakki'' published three poems by Fuat Köprülü. By the time he entered the [[Istanbul University School of Law]] at the age of 17, Fuat Köprülü already had an excellent command of [[French language|French]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]. His first book, ''Hayat-i Fikriyye'' (The Intellectual Life), was published when he was 19 years old. After three years of study, Fuat Köprülü abandoned the School of Law because of the poor quality of instruction, saying that diploma was “not worth the loss of time it would entail.”&lt;ref&gt;Basaran, Alpasan.  Fuat Koprulu: The Historian and Modern National Identity in Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkey, 1905-1924.  Nashville: Vanderbilt University, unpublished thesis, May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Making of a Nationalist Intellectual ===
[[File:Mehmet fuat koprulu.jpg|thumb|185px|An image of Mehmet Fuat Köprülü in his early days]]
From 1910 to 1913, Fuat Köprülü taught Turkish language and literature at various high schools in Istanbul, including the prestigious [[Galatasaray High School]].  Fuat Köprülü initially opposed the literary movement known as New Language, which sought to simplify the Turkish language, and wrote articles for the ''Servet-i Funun'' magazine using a literary style comprehensible only to the most learned of Ottoman intellectuals.  Fuat Köprülü changed his writing style and politics during the [[Balkan Wars]].  On February 6, 1913, the day after the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] army attacked the Ottoman lines in the outskirts of Istanbul, ''Turk Yurdu'' magazine, a bastion of simplified Turkish prose and [[Turkish nationalism]], published the first of many popular and patriotic essays by the 23-year-old Fuat Köprülü: “Umit ve Azim” (Hope and Determination), “Hicret Matemleri” (Mourning Migration), “Turk’un Duasi” (A Turk’s Prayer), and “Turkluk, Islamlik, Osmanlilik” (Turkishness, Islamness, Ottomanness).&lt;ref&gt;Basaran, Alpasan.  Fuat Koprulu: The Historian and Modern National Identity in Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkey, 1905-1924.  Nashville: Vanderbilt University, unpublished thesis, May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of 1913, Fuat Köprülü published his seminal and widely lauded academic article, “Turk Edebiyati Tarihinde Usul” (The Method in Turkish Literary History), in ''Bilgi Mecmuasi''. He argued that historians should not only research kings, [[vizier]]s, commanders and scholars, but ordinary people as well. Fuat Köprülü believed that in addition to public and official records, historians should also study art, archeology, literature, language, folklore and oral traditions. His plea for historians to study social history was so unique and ahead of its time that the Annales School in France, famous for embracing a similar approach in the journal ''Annales d’histoire economique et sociale'', did not emerge until 1929, a full 16 years after the publication of "Turk Edebiyati Tarihinde Usul". One month after the publication of the article, Fuat Köprülü was appointed Professor of the History of Turkish Literature at [[Istanbul University]].  He was only 23 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Basaran, Alpasan.  Fuat Koprulu: The Historian and Modern National Identity in Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkey, 1905-1924.  Nashville: Vanderbilt University, unpublished thesis, May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuat Köprülü continued his scholarly research and academic publications through the years, eventually culminating in his magnum opus, ''Turk Edebiyatinda Ilk Mutasavviflar'' (First Mystics in Turkish Literature), in 1918, a book that focused on two Turkish [[Sufism|mystics]] and folk poets, [[Ahmad Yasawi|Ahmet Yesevi]] and [[Yunus Emre]].  His ''Turk Edebiyati Tarihi'' (History of Turkish Literature), published in 1920, was another seminal book that traced the history of [[Turkish literature]] through millennia.  In 1923, at the age of 33, Fuat Köprülü was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Literature at Istanbul University.  In a short book entitled ''Turkiye Tarihi'' (The History of Turkey) published that same year, he reviewed the [[History of the Turkic peoples|history of Turks]] from ancient Central Asia to the modern Ottoman Empire, continuing the approach he pioneered in his study of Turkish literature.&lt;ref&gt;Basaran, Alpasan.  Fuat Koprulu: The Historian and Modern National Identity in Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkey, 1905-1924.  Nashville: Vanderbilt University, unpublished thesis, May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with Mustafa Kemal Ataturk ===
On December 6, 1923, President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk sent a handwritten letter to Fuat Köprülü to congratulate him on the publication of ''Turkiye Tarihi'', writing: "The works coming from your research will be among the most valuable of contributions toward the nation and the Republic.  Together with those who are thirsty for an abundance of knowledge, I will be hoping for further publications, sir."&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Basaran, Alpaslan.  Fuat Koprulu: The Historian and Modern National Identity in Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkey, 1905-1924.  Nashville: Vanderbilt University, unpublished thesis, May 2004.  Original text from Kopruluzade Mehmed Fuad, “Bir Hatira,” [A Memory] Belleten, vol. 3, No. 10 (April 1, 1939), 277.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after receiving the letter of congratulations, Fuat Köprülü was appointed Undersecretary to the Minister of Education at the request of President Atatürk and remained in this post for eight months.  In addition, Fuat Köprülü was appointed the Director of the Turcology Institute, established on the orders of President Atatürk, and began publishing ''Turkiyat Mecmuasi'' (The Turcology Journal).&lt;ref&gt;Basaran, Alpasan.  Fuat Koprulu: The Historian and Modern National Identity in Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkey, 1905-1924.  Nashville: Vanderbilt University, unpublished thesis, May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Recognition ===
[[File: Fuat Koprulu MSB.jpg|thumb|155px|right|Another image of Mehmet Fuat Köprülü in the 1930s]]
Fuat Köprülü won numerous international accolades for his scholarship as well.  The Soviet Academy of Sciences granted him a corresponding membership in 1925.  The University of Heidelberg honored him with an honorary degree in 1927.  The University of Athens and the University of Paris (Sorbonne) granted him honorary doctorates in 1937 and 1939, respectively.  In fact, most European Oriental societies made him a corresponding or honorary member, as did the American Oriental Society in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Basaran, Alpasan.  Fuat Koprulu: The Historian and Modern National Identity in Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkey, 1905-1924.  Nashville: Vanderbilt University, unpublished thesis, May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Fuat Köprülü became a professor ordinarius, a title denoting a professor of the highest rank in Turkey.  In 1935, he delivered a series of influential lectures at the University of Paris (Sorbonne) on the origins of the Ottoman Empire.  Fuat Köprülü argued that ethnic Turks formed the Ottoman Empire using Seljuk and Ilhanid administrative traditions, and he discredited the prevailing view among Western scholars that the Ottoman Empire was formed by a race of predominantly Greek and Slavic converts to Islam.

=== Later Political Life ===
In 1935, at the request of President Atatürk, Fuat Köprülü joined the single party regime in the Turkish Parliament as a Kars deputy, and was elected again in 1939 and 1943.  In 1945, as calls to establish a multiparty democracy increased after World War II, Fuat Köprülü joined the opposition and was dismissed from the ruling party along with Adnan Menderes and Refik Koraltan.  In 1946, Menderes, Koraltan and Köprülü, together with Celal Bayar, formed the Democratic Party.  Fuat Köprülü became the Minister of Foreign Affairs when the Democratic Party came to power in the 1950 elections, and he served in this post until 1956.  Fuat Köprülü also briefly served as Deputy Prime Minister in 1955.  On September 6, 1957, Fuat Köprülü resigned from the Democratic Party after disagreeing with the authoritarian tendencies displayed by the party leadership.

=== Death ===
Fuat Köprülü died on June 28, 1966.

'''National liberation''' has been a theme within [[Marxism]], and especially after the influence of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s advocacy of [[anti-imperialism]] and [[self-determination]] of all peoples became prevalent in [[Communism|communist]] movements, especially in advocating freedom from colonial rule in the [[Third World]]. National liberation has been promoted by Marxists out of an international-socialist perspective rather than a bourgeois-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] perspective.&lt;ref name="Eagleton217"&gt;Terry Eagleton: ''Why Marx Was Right''. Yale University Press, 2011, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon rising to power, Lenin and the [[Bolshevik]] government in Russia declared that all peoples had the right to self-determination. While Lenin was critical of nationalism, he claimed that the cause of national liberation was not a matter of [[chauvinism]], but a matter of radical [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="Eagleton217"/&gt;

'''Neil deGrasse Tyson''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|s}}; born October 5, 1958) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], author, and [[science communication|science communicator]]. Since 1996, he has been the [[Frederick P. Rose]] Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City. The center is part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.

Tyson studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1991 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral research associate at [[Princeton University]]. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, some of which were later published in his books ''[[Death by Black Hole]]'' (2007) and ''[[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]]'' (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in ''Star Date'' magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name "Merlin". Material from the column appeared in his books ''Merlin's Tour of the Universe'' (1998) and ''Just Visiting This Planet'' (1998). Tyson served on a [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry|2001 government commission]] on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and on the 2004 [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy|Moon, Mars and Beyond]] commission.

== Career ==
[[File:Tyson &amp; students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]], [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]], and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Powerplay: On the Move". ''Black Enterprise'' '''27''' (1): 58. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_the_sky_is_not_the_limit/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Sky Is Not the Limit |last=deGrasse Tyson |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson |series=Point of Inquiry |number= |format=podcast |publisher= |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [[street grid]] in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [[Stonehenge]] monument in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8631317/Sun-to-strike-New-York-streets-in-Manhattanhenge.html |title=Sun to strike New York streets in 'Manhattanhenge' |date=July 11, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320231400/http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |deadurl=yes |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |website=The Great Courses |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |archivedate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, U.S. President [[George W.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [[Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet |first=Neil deGrasse |last=Tyson |page=194 |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=W.W.

In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', which he co-hosted with comedian [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KEIB|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and [[Leighann Lord]] instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[GZA]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://startalkradio.net/ |title=StarTalk Radio Show |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Phi Theta Kappa Honors Seminar Series |url=http://austincc.collegiatelink.net/organization/ptk/calendar/details/109382 |publisher=Austing Community College |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show ''StarTalk''. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the [[Nerdist YouTube Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOir4aMu0vYI Nerdist Channel Sneak Peek] (March 27, 2012) from YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the [[White House Student Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/students-are-stars-white-house-film-festival-n40846 |title=Students Are Stars at White House Film Festival |publisher=NBC News |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he helped revive Carl Sagan's ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' television series, presenting ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel.

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance The Perimeter of Ignorance] from Tyson's website&lt;/ref&gt; and "Holy Wars",&lt;ref name="HolyWars" /&gt; both appearing in ''Natural History'' magazine and the 2006 ''Beyond Belief'' workshop. In an interview with comedian [[Paul Mecurio]], Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mecurio |first1=Paul |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |url=https://soundcloud.com/paul-mecurio-show/neil-degrasse-tyson |website=The Paul Mecurio Show |publisher=Alive and Social |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [[intelligent design]] limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="HolyWars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: "The Perimeter of Ignorance" |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a question session at the [[University at Buffalo]] if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhOm6N4-I0&amp;feature=channel |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: God and Science |id=Quote starts at ~55 seconds |publisher=University at Buffalo YouTube channel |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale McGowan [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXKDLP_PyEQC&amp;q=tyson#v=snippet&amp;q=tyson&amp;f=false Atheism For Dummies]; {{ISBN|978-1118509203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} In an interview with ''[[Big Think]]'', Tyson said, "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Neil explains his views on youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos |publisher=Big Think on YouTube |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the same interview with ''Big Think'', Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." – again within a week – and I said, "What's up with that?" so I said "Alright, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, okay "Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/neil-degrasse-tyson |title=TSN: Called by the Universe |website=The Science Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins at Howard University (2) - September 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|Tyson in conversation with [[Richard Dawkins]] at Howard University, 2010]]

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [[Massimo Pigliucci]] asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe."  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [[Richard Dawkins]]: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there."&lt;ref name="Rationally Speaking podcast"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Interview with Massimo Pigliucci and Julia Galef |url=http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs103-neil-degrasse-tyson-on-why-he-doesnt-call-himself-an-a.html |website=Rationally Speaking podcast |accessdate=April 11, 2014 |date=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has spoken about philosophy on numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of ''[[The Nerdist Podcast]]'', he stated that philosophy is "useless" and that a philosophy major "can really mess you up",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-neil-degrasse-tyson-returns-again/ |title=Nerdist Podcast: Neil deGrasse Tyson Returns Again |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Nerdist Podcast]] |last=Levine |first=Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was met with disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |title=Dear Neil deGrasse Tyson, don't be foolish about philosophy |date=June 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Chicago Now]] |last=Wall |first=James Kirk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806031740/http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |archivedate=August 6, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson Slammed For Dismissing Philosophy As 'Useless' |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[io9]] |last=Dvorsky |first=George |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328062312/http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |archivedate=March 28, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/ |title=The one thing Neil deGrasse Tyson got wrong |date=June 7, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |last=Neumann |first=Steve |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000625/http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/n|dead-url=no |archivedate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine |title=Why Neil deGrasse Tyson is a philistine |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |website=[[The Week]] |last=Linker |first=Damon |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416145135/http://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine|dead-url=no |archivedate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Massimo Pigliucci]] later criticized him for "dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson and the Value of Philosophy |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci|dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421104308/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |archivedate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and social justice ===
In an undated interview at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] burst from the sun on a local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtMWvJiFR9E |title=A Story About Race – Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=March 1, 2013 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2008/05/16/pursuing-a-science-career |title=Pursuing a Science Career |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, at a conference at the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was, "...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society." He continued: "My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM National Academy of Sciences conference], YouTube accessed October 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Grantland]]'', Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level". In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message". He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-conversation-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-about-cosmos-race-and-celebrity |title=A Conversation With Neil deGrasse Tyson About 'Cosmos,' Race, and Celebrity " |author=Rembert Browne |website=Grantland|date=2014-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===
[[File:Bill Nye, Barack Obama and Neil deGrasse Tyson selfie 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|Tyson, [[Bill Nye]] and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] take a [[selfie]] at the [[White House]], 2014]]
Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".&lt;ref name="buffalo2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o |publisher=University at Buffalo Communications |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."&lt;ref name="buffalo2010" /&gt;

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="tysontranscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=4 Dec 2012 |date=7 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tysontranscript_video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony-video |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony (Video) |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, [[Penny4NASA]], a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,&lt;ref name="space-advocates-2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us – Space Advocates |url=http://www.spaceadvocates.com/about |publisher=Space Advocates |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.&lt;ref name="penny4nasa-whywefight"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why We Fight |url=http://www.penny4nasa.org/why-we-fight |publisher=Penny4NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Space Chronicles|Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier]]'' Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting [[Exploration of Mars|humans to Mars]], will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the [[United States Federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/neil-degrasse-tyson-how-space-exploration-can-make-america-great-again/253989/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: How Space Exploration Can Make America Great Again |first=Chris |last=Heller |website=theatlantic.com |publisher=The Atlantic |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal rights ===
Tyson collaborated with the organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) on a [[public service announcement]] that stated, "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that kindness is a virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Interview With PETA |url=http://www.peta.org/features/Dr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also granted PETA an interview in which he discussed the concept of intelligence (both of human and other animals), the failure of humans to heretofore communicate meaningfully with other animals, and the need of humans to be [[Empathy|empathetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Exclusive PETA Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL6hj6xLE8w&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peta.org%2Ffeatures%2FDr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx&amp;feature=player_embedded |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/05/peta-neil-degrasse-tyson-peta_n_912491.html |title=Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson Featured In PETA Ad |journal=Huffington Post |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/worlds-sexiest-astrophysicist-neil-degrasse-tyson-in-peta-ad-video.html |title="World's Sexiest" Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson In PETA Ad (Video)) |publisher=Treehugger |date=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |author=Kessler, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15310">'''NetOps''' is defined as the operational framework consisting of three essential tasks, [[Situation awareness|Situational Awareness (SA)]], and [[Command and Control|Command &amp; Control (C2)]] that the Commander (CDR) of US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), in coordination with DoD and Global NetOps Community, employs to '''''operate, manage and defend''''' the [[Global Information Grid]] (GIG) to ensure [[information superiority]] for the United States.&lt;ref name=conops&gt;Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for Global Information Grid (GIG) NetOps Version 3, dated August 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8410.02 defines NetOps as the DoD-wide operational, organizational, and technical capabilities for operating and defending the Global Information Grid. NetOps includes, but is not limited to, enterprise management, net assurance, and content management. NetOps provides Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) with GIG Situational Awareness to make informed Command and Control decisions. GIG SA is gained through the operational and technical integration of enterprise management and defense actions and activities across all levels of command (strategic, operational and expeditionary forces).&lt;ref name=dodi&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/841002p.pdf DoDI 8410.02, NetOps for the Global Information Grid (GIG), dated December 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gig ov1.jpg|thumb|The GIG includes any DoD system, equipment, software, or service that transmits, stores, or processes DoD information, and any other associated services necessary to achieve information superiority.]]
The three essential tasks are as follows:
* GIG Enterprise Management (GEM) 
* GIG Net Assurance (GNA)
* GIG Content Management (GCM)&lt;ref name=dodi&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/841002p.pdf DoDI 8410.02 NetOps for the Global Information Grid (GIG), dated December 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The synergy achieved by each integrated relationship between any two of the essential tasks (GEM, GNA, and GCM) produces the following NetOps desired effects in support of the overall goal of NetOps which is to provide the right information to the edge:

* Assured System and Network Availability
* Assured Information Protection  
* Assured Information Delivery&lt;ref name=conops&gt;Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for Global Information Grid (GIG) NetOps Version 3, dated August 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

The element of NetOps known as Situational Awareness (SA), is the primary ability to improve the quality and timeliness of collaborative decision-making.  To be effective, much of the SA must be shared in near-real-time by the decision-makers who have the ability to take this information, conduct critical analysis and act on those decisions with regards to employment, protection and defense of the GIG.  

This shared Situational Awareness is derived from common reporting requirements using functionally standardized management tools and common data information exchange formats across the Defense Department. These capabilities collect (or receive), and fuse (enterprise management, network defense and configuration management) data in a real time or near real-time fashion to produce defined views of the mission critical GIG information of concern to a commander or NetOps center.

The DoD NetOps Community strives to obtain common visibility of network resources so that these can be manage, anticipate and mitigate problems, ensuring uninterrupted availability and protection of the GIG and provide for graceful degradation, self-healing, failover, diversity, and elimination of critical failure points.   Through effective visibility, the NetOps community endeavors to attain the three goals of NetOps: Assured System and Network Availability, Assured Information Protection and Assured Information Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cert.mil/ JTF-GNO Website, December 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323125238/http://www.cert.mil/ |date=2007-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint Task Force Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO)==
{{Main|Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations}}
JTF-GNO directs the operation and defense of the GIG to assure timely and secure Net-Centric capabilities across strategic, operational, and expeditionary boundaries in support of full spectrum warfighting, intelligence, and business missions for the Defense Department.
&lt;ref name=stratcom&gt;[http://www.stratcom.mil/ United States Strategic Command Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1998, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] recognized a growing cyber threat and in response created the Joint Task Force — Computer Network Defense (JTF-CND), which achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) on 30 December 1998 and Full Operational Capability (FOC) by June 1999. 

In the fall of 2000, in accordance with [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] doctrine, JTF-CND became the Joint Task Force — Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). In October 2002, the new Unified Command Plan (UCP), Change 2, re-aligned JTF-CNO under the [[STRATCOM|United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM)]].

The JTF-CNO began its largest and most comprehensive transformation in April 2004 when the Commander of [[STRATCOM|US Strategic Command]] approved the Joint Concept of Operations for [[Global Information Grid|GIG]] Network Operations. This “NetOps CONOPS” provided the common framework and command and control structure to conduct the USSTRATCOM Unified Command Plan (UCP) - assigned mission of Global Network Operations (NETOPS), combining the disciplines of Enterprise Systems (EM) and Network Management (NM), Computer Network Defense (CND), and Information Dissemination Management (IDM). 

The [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] signed a delegation of authority letter on 18 June 2004, designating the Director, [[Defense Information Systems Agency|DISA]] as the new Commander of the [[Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations]]. With this designation, the new command assumed the responsibility for directing the operation and defense of the [[Global Information Grid|GIG]]. 

This transformation enhanced the [[Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations|JTF GNO's]] mission and objectives in achieving the Joint Vision 2020 Objective Force and the evolving concept of Net-Centricity.

As new concepts such as [[Network-centric warfare]] and Joint Vision 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/jv2010/jv2010.pdf Joint Vision 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; arrived in the mid 1990s, it become clear that the center of gravity for U.S. military warfighting capability was shifting towards the network.  A corresponding capability was required to move beyond managing the network as a back-office system into a domain of warfighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oft.osd.mil/initiatives/ncw/docs/NCW_Origins_and_Future.doc Network-Centric Warfare: Its Origin and Future, By Vice Admiral Arthur K. Cebrowski, U.S. Navy, and John J. Garstka, ''Proceedings'', January 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

NetOps was originally developed under the leadership of then [[United States Pacific Command]] J6 [[Brigadier General]] James Bryan during the stand-up of the [[Commander United States Pacific Fleet|USCINCPAC]] Theater C4I Coordination Center (TCCC) at [[Camp H. M. Smith]], Hawaii in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iac.dtic.mil/iatac/download/Vol3_No4.pdf IA Newsletter, Volume 3, Number 4, USPACOM Theater Network Operations, Ensuring Information Superiority for the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt;  The TCCC initiative was constructed of two distinct components - the technology that formed the vision of the [[Global Information Grid|GIG]] and the NetOps initiative; and the partnerships that made it a reality.

Through its working relationships with [[Defense Information Systems Agency|DISA]], the Service Components, Sub-Unified Commands, JTFs, other CINC TCCC's, and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|Joint Staff]], [[Commander United States Pacific Fleet|USCINCPAC]] TCCC made the initial strides towards achieving Information Superiority and true enterprise-level processes.  The [[Commander United States Pacific Fleet|USCINCPAC]] TCCC was a pilot program for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) NetOps concept.  The NetOps concept began with the development of the architectural framework for NetOps, and a [[Commander United States Pacific Fleet|USCINCPAC]] developed [[Concept of Operations|Concept of Operations (CONOPS)]] outlining the key players and their roles and responsibilities necessary to develop the NetOps construct in the Pacific Theater. &lt;ref&gt;[http://iac.dtic.mil/iatac/download/Vol4_No4.pdf IA Newsletter, Volume 4, Number 4, Partnership's - The Key to Success for Pacific Theater Network Operations (NetOps)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original NetOps construct consisted of Network Management (NM), Information Assurance (IA), and Information Dissemination Management (IDM).  Today the construct has evolved into GIG Enterprise Management (GEM), GIG Net Assurance(GNA), and GIG Content Management which roughly equates to the intent of the original NetOps concept.&lt;ref name=dodi&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/841002p.pdf DoDI 8410.02, NetOps for the Global Information Grid (GIG), dated December 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==NetOps Vision==

“We must change the paradigm in which we talk and think about the network; we must ‘fight’ rather than ‘manage’ the network and operators must see themselves as engaged at all times, ensuring the health and operation of this critical weapons system.”  [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[United States Secretary of Defense]] (2001 - 2006)

"The US government and the US military must become still more joint, more agile, more decentralized, more networked, and better arranged to share information and coordinate actions."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/01/rummy-on-ncw.html Secretary Rumsfeld speaking at a NetCentric Warfare Conference (NCW) 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[United States Secretary of Defense]] (2001 - 2006)

“This version of the NetOps CONOPS documents the lessons learned by [[Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations]] and the NetOps community through operations, exercises, and other events.  We will continue to work with the NetOps Community as we translate the concepts set forth in this document into doctrine, policy and joint tactics, techniques, and procedures that strengthen the operations and defense of the Global Information Grid in support of warfighter business and intelligence operations.” [[General James E. Cartwright]], Commander, [[United States Strategic Command]](2004- August 2007)&lt;ref name=conops&gt;Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for Global Information Grid (GIG) NetOps Version 3, dated August 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Strategic Vision for the [[Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations|JTF GNO]] is to lead an adaptive force that assures the availability, delivery, and protection of the [[Global Information Grid]].  The NetOps framework, effects, and organizational relationships described herein formulate a foundation for the operational future of the GIG, but these will not happen automatically, nor will they occur without significant effort from the entire NetOps Community. Attaining the vision will require cooperation, innovation, and execution from all mission partners and everyone who touches the GIG.” (From ''"[[Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations]] Strategic Plan, An Adaptive Force Ensuring Information Delivery"'', February 2006.  The adaptive force assures availability, delivery and protection of infrastructure, systems, and information.) LtGen Charles E. Croom, Commander, [[Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations|JTF GNO]].&lt;ref&gt;JTF GNO Strategic Plan, An Adaptive Force Ensuring Information Delivery, February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Mission==

[[Image:Seal of the United States Strategic Command.svg|thumb|left|The Unified Command Plan (UCP) assigns the Cyber Mission to Commander, US Strategic Command.  NetOps falls under the Cyber-Umbrella as a construct to "operate and defend the GIG."]]

The NetOps mission is to operate and defend the [[Global Information Grid|GIG]].  Unlike many missions with a defined completion date, NetOps has been established as a standing Joint Force mission necessitating dedicated leadership and resources to execute.

NetOps provides assured NetCentric services to the DoD in support of full spectrum of warfighting operations, intelligence, and business missions throughout the [[Global Information Grid|GIG]] enterprises, seamlessly, end-to-end.   An objective of NetCentric services is to quickly get information to decision makers, with adequate context, to make better decisions affecting the mission and to project their decisions forward to their forces for action.  

If the decision maker is not getting the needed net-centric services, the GIG NetOps community must collaboratively determine who must take action and how information flow can be optimized.  This requires NetOps personnel to have a shared SA as well as the technologies, procedures, and collaborative organizational structures to rapidly assess and respond to system and network degradations, outages, or changes in operational priorities.  All functions required to most effectively support GIG operations will be holistically managed. &lt;ref name=conops&gt;[Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for Global Information Grid (GIG) NetOps Version 3, dated August 4, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of NetOps will be measured in terms of availability and reliability of net-centric services, across all domains, in adherence to agreed-upon service levels and policies.  The method for service assurance in a NetCentric collaborative environment is to establish operational thresholds, compliance monitoring, and a clear understanding of the capabilities between enterprise service/resource providers and consumers through Service Level Agreements (SLAs).  

Proper instrumentation of the [[Global Information Grid|GIG]] will enable monitoring of adherence to these SLAs, as well as enable timely decision-making, service prioritization, resource allocation, root cause, and mission impact assessment.  Subsequent TTPs and SLAs will be formalized with appropriate implementation policies to enforce compliance.&lt;ref name=conops&gt;[Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for Global Information Grid (GIG) NetOps Version 3, dated August 4, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicolas Chorier Académie des Dames.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1757 [[Latin language|Latin]] edition of ''The School of Women'']]
'''Nicolas Chorier''' (September 1, 1612 – August 14, 1692) was a French lawyer, writer, and historian. He is known especially for his historical works on [[Dauphiné]], as well as his [[Erotic literature|erotic dialogue]] called ''The School of Women, or The Seven Flirtatious Encounters of Aloisia'' ({{lang-fr|link=no|L'Academie des dames, ou les Sept entretiens galants d'Aloisia}}).

He was born at [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], in present-day [[Isère]]. He practised as a lawyer in [[Grenoble]] and then as a [[prosecutor]] for King Louis XIV. His works on Dauphiné remain an important source for historians to this day. He died at Grenoble in his eightieth year.

==The School of Women==
''The School of Women'' first appeared as a work in [[Latin language|Latin]] entitled ''Aloisiae Sigaeae, Toletanae, Satyra sotadica de arcanis Amoris et Veneris''. This manuscript claimed that it was originally written in Spanish by [[Luisa Sigea de Velasco]], an erudite poet and maid of honor at the court of [[Lisbon]] and was then translated into Latin by Jean or [[Johannes Meursius]], a [[humanism|humanist]] professor teaching history in [[Leiden]], Holland  since 1610. The attribution to Sigea was a lie and Meursius' involvement was a complete fabrication. The manuscript circulated through the [[libertine]] community at the beginning of the eighteenth century and was known in Latin under many different titles. It was translated into French many times, including one translation by [[Jean Terrasson]] in 1750, and was also translated into English.

The book is written in the form of a series of dialogues with Tullia, a twenty-six-year-old Italian woman, the wife of Callias, who is charged with the sexual initiation of her young cousin, Ottavia, to whom she declares, "Your mother asked me to reveal to you the most mysterious secrets of the bridal bed and to teach you what you must be with your husband, which your husband will also be, touching these small things which so strongly inflame men's passion. This night, so that I can teach you above all in a freer language, we will sleep together in my bed, which I would like to be able to say will have been the softest of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'s lace."&lt;ref&gt;In French, "Ta mère m'a demandé de te découvrir les secrets les plus mystérieux du lit nuptial et de t'apprendre ce que tu dois être avec ton mari, ce que ton mari sera aussi, touchant ces petites choses pour lesquelles s'enflamment si fort les hommes. Cette nuit, pour que je puisse t'endoctriner sur tout d'une langue plus libre, nous coucherons ensemble dans mon lit, dont je voudrais pouvoir dire qu'il aura été la plus douce lice de Vénus."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Sri Lanka}}
The '''Polonnaruwa period''' was a period in the history of Sri Lanka of the [[Kingdom of Polonnaruwa]] from 1056 to 1236. The period begins after the  [[Chola conquest of Anuradhapura]].

The [[Kingdom of Polonnaruwa]] was the second major [[Sinhalese People|Sinhalese]] kingdom of Sri Lanka. It lasted from 1055 under [[Vijayabahu I]] until 1212 under the rule of [[Lilavati of Sri Lanka|Lilavati]]. The Kingdom of Polonnaruwa came after the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom]], which was invaded by [[Chola]] forces under [[Rajaraja I]]. It also followed the [[Kingdom of Ruhuna]], in which the Sinhalese Kings ruled during Chola occupation.

[[Vijayabahu I of Sri Lanka|Vijayabahu I]] (1055–1110), recaptured the whole Island and established [[Polonnaruwa]] as the new capital. King Vijayabahu married a second queen from the [[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga]] ([[Orissa, India|Orissa]]) Royal Family, and had a son, [[Vikramabâhu I of Sri Lanka|Vikramabâhu I]], and a daughter, [[Ratnavali]]. His sister, [[Mitta of Sri Lanka|Mitta]], married a [[Pandya]] Prince who had three sons. His eldest son, Manabharana, married Ratnavali. Their son was [[Parākramabāhu I of Sri Lanka|Parākramabāhu I]] (1153–1186) Grandson of Vijayabahu I, Prince of [[Sinhala people|Sinhala]]-[[Pandyan]]-[[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga]] descent, son of Manabharana and Vijayabahu’s sister, Mitta. He was a very powerful king who was noted for his engineering,&lt;ref&gt;Broheir, R. L. (1937) ''Ancient Irrigation Works in Ceylon''. 3 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; naval power, art, culture, Sinhala inscriptions, and even a Tamil edict in Uruthota ([[Kayts]]). The [[Chulavamsa]] was written by Dharmakirthi, updating the [[Mahavamsa]] to include Parakramabahu.

Reginald Macan, pages 422–425&lt;/ref&gt; He was only the second [[layman]] Master of the College after [[Anthony Gate]], Master from 1584–1597.

Reginald Macan was originally from [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], and retained his Irish accent until the 1890s. He was an undergraduate at University College, Oxford, and then a "[[Student (Christ Church)|Student]]" (the equivalent of a [[Fellow (college)|Fellow]]) of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] after obtaining his degree.&lt;ref name="bickerton"&gt;Bickerton, Fred, ''Fred of Oxford''. London: Evans Brothers Limited, 1953, pages 131–133.&lt;/ref&gt; He came back to University College as a Fellow and Tutor in 1884 until becoming Master of the College. He retired in 1923.

Macan had a reputation as a heretic early in his career, but delivered addresses in the chapel at University College at least annually.
Like his predecessor as Master, [[James Franck Bright|J. Frank Bright]], he was nicknamed the "Mugger" by students.

Macan applied archaeological discoveries to the study of ancient history. He produced a major set of books on [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/herodotusfourth00macagoog Herodotus: the fourth, fifth, and sixth books]'', [[Internet Archive]]. (Originally published by [[Macmillan &amp; Co.]], 1895.)&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote ''A History of [[Persia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/historyofpersia02sykeuoft/historyofpersia02sykeuoft_djvu.txt A History of Persia]'', [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, Reginald Macan visited [[New York City|New York]] and spoke at the [[Sphinx Club (New York)|Sphinx Club]] about [[Rhodes Scholar]]s at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D02E4D8103FE633A25755C1A9649D946296D6CF Rhodes Scholar's Sneer: American Called Oxford "a God-Forsaken Place," Dr. Macan Says], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 16 December 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hairstyle fashion in [[Rome]] was ever changing, and particularly in the Roman [[Roman Empire|Imperial Period]] there were a number of different ways to style hair. As with clothes, there were several hairstyles that were limited to certain people in ancient society. Styles are so distinctive they allow scholars today to create a chronology of Roman portraiture and art; we are able to date pictures of the empresses on coins, or identify busts depending on their hairstyles.

==Significance==
[[File:Villa dei Misteri IX - 1.jpg|thumb|A young woman sits while a servant fixes her hair with the help of a [[cupid]], who holds up a [[mirror]] to offer a reflection, detail of a [[fresco]] from the [[Villa of the Mysteries]], [[Pompeii]], c. 50 BC]]
Much like today, hair for the Romans was as much an expression of personal identity as clothes. Hairstyles were determined by a number of factors, namely gender, age, social status, wealth and profession. A woman's hairstyle expressed her individuality in the ancient Roman World. How one dressed one's hair was an indication of a person's status and role in society.

Hair was a very erotic area of the female body for the Romans, and attractiveness of a woman was tied to the presentation of her hair. As a result, it was seen as appropriate for a woman to spend time on her hair in order to create a flattering appearance. Hairdressing and its necessary accompaniment, mirror gazing, were seen as distinctly feminine activities. Lengthy grooming sessions for women were tolerated, despite writers such as Tertullian and Pliny commenting on their abhorrence for time and energy women dedicate to their hair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf04/anf04-07.htm#P419_87976 Tertullian., De Culti Feminarum,2:7]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the numerous depictions of women hairdressing and mirror-gazing in tomb reliefs and portraiture is a testament to how much hairdressing was seen as part of the female domain.&lt;ref&gt;Kampman (1981), 149–52&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than just attractiveness, hairstyling was the leisure pursuit of the cultured, elegant female. Hair was seen as much as an indication of wealth and social status as it was of taste and fashion. But unlike modern-day hairstyles, comfort and naturalism for the Romans took a back-seat to hairstyles that displayed the wearer's wealth to a maximum. In other words, having a complex and unnatural hairstyle would be preferred to a simple one, because it would illustrate the wealth of the wearer in being able to afford to take the time to style their hair.&lt;ref name="Bartman 2001, 6"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=%22Elizabeth+Bartman%22&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dau%253A%2522Elizabeth%2BBartman%2522%26wc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=26&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle Bartman (2001), 6]&lt;/ref&gt; For women to have a fashionable hairstyle showed they were part of the elegant Roman culture.

A 'natural' style was associated with barbarians, who the Romans believed had neither the money nor the culture to create these styles. "Natural" showed a lack of culture, and grooming of the hair went hand-in-hand with being part of a sophisticated civilization. The association with barbarians was why Roman men kept their hair cut short.&lt;ref name="Bartman 2001, 6"/&gt; It was the job of slave hairdressers, called ''Ornatrices'', to create their master's hairstyle new each day, as well as pulling out any grey hairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5LiIJEU4bE8C&amp;dq=daily+life+in+ancient+rome+carcopino&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8iYGS5bLBpDgswPNypTACQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Carcopino (1973), 167]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from society, hair was used symbolically to mark rites of passage; for instance, loosened hair was common at a funeral, and the ''seni crines'' was the hairstyle worn by brides and [[Vestal Virgin]]s; divided and plaited into six braids, and in the case of the bride, it was parted with a spear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=%22Elizabeth+Bartman%22&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dau%253A%2522Elizabeth%2BBartman%2522%26wc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=26&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle Bartman (2001), 4]&lt;/ref&gt; A bride’s hair was parted with a ''hasta recurva'' or ''hasta caelibaris'', a bent iron spearhead and crowned with flowers. In addition to ceremonies hairstyle defined the age of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Roman Wedding Clothing|url = http://www.tribunesandtriumphs.org/roman-clothing/roman-wedding-clothing.htm|website = www.tribunesandtriumphs.org|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked difference in hair acceptable for preadolescent girls and sexually mature women. Preadolescent girls would often have long hair cascading down the back where as women would have equally long hair but it would be controlled through wrapping and braiding.

==Headgear==

===Veils===

Perhaps due to its erotic association, hair was often linked with Roman ideas of female modesty and honour. We know that veils were important in this case, as they protected (or encouraged according to [[Seneca the Elder]]) against solicitations by men.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Elder., Controversiae 2.7.6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palla (garment)|''palla'']] was the mark of a married, respectable woman. It was a piece of cloth wrapped around the body with one end over the shoulder. There is significant evidence for the ''palla'' being draped over the back of the head as a veil.&lt;ref&gt;Olson (2008), 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''palla'' supposedly signified the dignity and sexual modesty of a married woman, but due to its encumbering nature as a veil, there has been much debate whether it was only worn in public by the aristocracy, or if at all by working women of lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Fantham (2008), 166-7; Olsen (2008), 33-6 both offer discussion on this&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vittae'' were woollen fillets that bound a married woman's hair. They were another indication of a wife's modesty and purity and were seen as part of the clothing and presentation of a matron.&lt;ref&gt;Olson (2008), 36&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vittae'' could be inset with precious stones, or in the case of the [[Flamen Dialis|''Flaminicae'']], they would be purple in colour.

===Wigs===
[[File:Fresco showing a woman looking in a mirror as she dresses (or undresses) her hair, from the Villa of Arianna at Stabiae (Castellammare di Stabia), Naples National Archaeological Museum (17392924485).jpg|thumb|Fresco showing a woman looking in a mirror as she dresses (or undresses) her hair, from the Villa of Arianna at [[Stabiae]] (Castellammare di Stabia), 1st century AD]]

Due to the nature of hair and the relatively wet climate in the upper reaches of the Roman Empire, there are very few examples of wigs that survive to this day. Women wore wigs whether they were bald or not. So too did men, Emperor [[Otho]] wore a wig, as did [[Domitian]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius., Life of Otho, 12 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132%3Alife%3Dotho%3Achapter%3D12]; Morgan (1997), 214&lt;/ref&gt; Wigs allowed women to better achieve the kind of 'tall' styles that particularly punctuated the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] and Trajanic eras (e.g. the periods of 69–96 and 98–117 CE). So tall were these hairstyles, that ancient writer [[Juvenal]] likens them to multi-storey buildings.

{{Quote|So important is the business of beautification; so numerous are the tiers and storeys piled one upon another on her head!|Juvenal|''Satires''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm Juvenal., Satire Book 6, 58-9]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wigs were made from human hair; [[blonde]] hair from Germany and black from India were particularly prized, especially if the hair came from the head of a person from a conquered civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, Amores, 1:14:45-6 [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.03.0016;layout=;query=toc;loc=1.14.1]; Bartman (2001), 14 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=%22Elizabeth+Bartman%22&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dau%253A%2522Elizabeth%2BBartman%2522%26wc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=26&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle]&lt;/ref&gt; The blond hair of various [[Germanic peoples]] symbolized the spoils of war. In cases where wigs were used to hide baldness, a natural look was preferred, therefore a wig with a hair colour similar to the wearer's original was worn. But in instances where a wig was worn for the purpose of showing off, naturalism did not play much of a part. Obviously fake wigs were preferred, sometimes intertwined with two contrasting hair colours with blonde hair from Germany and black from India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=%22Elizabeth+Bartman%22&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dau%253A%2522Elizabeth%2BBartman%2522%26wc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=26&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle Bartman (2001), 14]&lt;/ref&gt; Gold dust also gave the appearance of blond hair and enhanced already blond hair. Emperor [[Lucius Verus]] (r. 161 – 169 AD), who had natural blond hair, was said to sprinkle gold dust on his head to make himself even blonder.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grant (1994). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1KTVnjWiEo0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Antonines:+The+Roman+Empire+in+Transition&amp;sig=2TEUrhub3pzEwFeEKDQPItxqmEo#PPA27,M1 The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transition]''. London &amp; New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-10754-7}}, pp 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

A convenience of wigs used by Romans is that they could be directly pinned onto the head of the wearer, meaning a style could be achieved much faster than if it had been done with the wearer's own hair. Further, it would lessen the inconvenience of having to grow one's own hair too long. It has been suggested that the necessary length to be able to create these hairstyles daily would be well below the shoulder, perhaps to the waist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=%22Elizabeth+Bartman%22&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dau%253A%2522Elizabeth%2BBartman%2522%26wc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=26&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle Olson (2008), 71; Bartman (2001), 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two types of wig in Roman times: the full wig, called the ''capillamentum'', and the half wig, called the ''galerus''.&lt;ref&gt;Olson (2008), 74&lt;/ref&gt; The ''galerus'' could be in the form of a fillet of woolen hair used as padding to build an elaborate style, or as a toupee on the back or front of the head. Toupees were attached by pins, or by sewing the it onto a piece of leather and attaching it as a wig. Further, glue could be used to affix it to the scalp or alternatively, as a bust from the British Museum illustrates, the toupee could be braided into the existing hair.&lt;ref&gt;Bust of Matidia, London, The British Museum 1805.7-3.96; Bartman (2001), 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Stephens]] is an amateur archaeologist and hairdresser who has reconstructed some of the hairstyles of ancient Rome, attempting to prove that they were not done with wigs, as commonly believed, but with the person's own hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pesta |first=Abigail |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324900204578286272195339456 |title=On Pins and Needles: Stylist Turns Ancient Hairdo Debate on Its Head |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2013-02-06 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detachable marble wigs===

[[Bust (sculpture)|Busts]] themselves could have detachable wigs. There have been many suggestions as to why some busts have been created with detachable wigs and some without. Perhaps the main reason was to keep the bust looking up-to-date. It would have been too expensive to commission a new bust every time hair fashion changed, so a mix-and-match bust would have been preferable for women with less money.&lt;ref name="Kleiner and Matheson 1996, 174"&gt;Kleiner and Matheson (1996), 174&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps another reason was to accommodate the [[Syrian]] ritual of anointing the skull of the bust with oil.&lt;ref name="Kleiner and Matheson 1996, 174"/&gt;

Or further, in cases where the bust was a funerary commission, it can be safely assumed that the subject of the bust would not have had an opportunity to sit for another portrait after their death.&lt;ref&gt;Fittschen and Zanker (1983), 105&lt;/ref&gt; Hence why a detachable wig for a bust would certainly be useful. Although exactly how these marble wigs were attached is unknown, the likely difficulty of changing the 'wigs' effectively would have probably put many women off choosing a detachable and reattachable bust in the first place.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=%22Elizabeth+Bartman%22&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dau%253A%2522Elizabeth%2BBartman%2522%26wc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=26&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle Bartman (2001), 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools of the trade ==

=== Dyes ===

Dying hair was popular among women, although the frequency that hair was coloured often made it weaker. Tertullian discusses how hair dye burnt the scalp and was harmful for the head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf04/anf04-07.htm#P419_87976 Tertullian, De Culti Feminarum, 2:6]&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial dyes could be applied through powders, gels and bleach. [[Henna]], a temporary dye, or even animal fat, could be applied to make the hair more manageable.&lt;ref&gt;Bartman (2001), 12 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324 Hair and the Artifice of Roman Female Adornment]{{doi|10.2307/507324}}; Allason-Jones (1989), 133-7&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from henna, more common permanent dyes were based on natural substances and perhaps more unorthodox mixtures. To prevent graying some Romans wore a paste at night made from herbs and earthworms and pigeon dung was used to lighten hair. For example, to dye hair black, [[Pliny the Elder]] suggests applying leeches that have rotted in red wine for 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;layout=;query=toc;loc=32.47 Pliny the Elder., Natural History, 32:23]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dying hair red requires a mixture of animal fat and beechwood ashes&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;layout=;query=toc;loc=32.47 Pliny the Elder., Natural History, 28:51]&lt;/ref&gt; whilst dying hair gold required saffron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf04/anf04-07.htm#P419_87976 Tertullian, De Culti Feminarum, 2:6:1]&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid gives plenty more examples for dyes, such as herbs and saffron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ovid/lboo/lboo60.htm Ovid., Ars Amatoria, 3:158-64]&lt;/ref&gt; To cure diseases such as hair loss, Pliny suggests the application of a sow's gall bladder, mixed with bull's urine, or of the ashes of an ass's genitals, or other mixtures such as the ashes of a deer's antlers mixed with wine.

=== Curling irons, pins and hairnets ===

The ''calamistrum'' was the name for the Roman [[curling iron]]. It consisted of a hollow metal outer cylinder and a smaller solid cylinder inside it. The hair would be wrapped around the solid cylinder and inserted into the metal outer. The metal outer would be heated in a fire, making the hair curly. It has been reported that because of the frequency and temperature that hair was curled at, thinning and damaged hair was common amongst women.&lt;ref&gt;Olson (2008), 73&lt;/ref&gt;

While gel and henna, as mentioned above, were used to manage hair, hairnets and pins were in common usage too. Poorer women would have used wooden pins, while the aristocracy used gold, ivory, crystal, silver or painted bone. The pins were decorated with carvings of the gods, or beads and pendants.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner and Matheson (1996), 162; Olson (2008), 75-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles over time==
Roman hairstyles changed, but there were several constant hairstyles that were used continuously, such as the ''tutulus'', or the bun. The beehive, helmet, hairbouquet or pillbox are modern day names given to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] hairstyles.

===Tutulus===

The ''tutulus'' was originally an [[Etruscan society|Etruscan]] style worn commonly in the late 6th and early 5th century BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = World of Roman Costume|last = Sebesta|first = Judith Lynn|publisher = University of Wisconsin|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Madison|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a hairstyle worn primarily by the ''materfamilias'', the mother of the family.&lt;ref name="Olson 2008, 39"&gt;Olson (2008), 39&lt;/ref&gt; It remained in constant use even when fashion changed. To achieve it, the hair was divided and piled high and shaped into a bun, after which it was tied with purple fillets of wool. By the end, the hair would be conical in shape. It was also the hairstyle worn by the ''flaminicae''.&lt;ref name="Olson 2008, 39"/&gt;

===Republican period and Augustan era styles===

The Republican period and the ''nodus'' style was particularly common. In Imperial iconography the nodus coiffure was associated predominately with the women of Augustus' household. The ''nodus'' style saw the hair parted in three, with the hair from the sides of the head tied in a bun at the back while the middle section is looped back on itself, creating an effect not unlike the (comparably modern) [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|Pompadour]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroma.org/images/raia_images/julia.jpg][http://www.vroma.org/images/mcmanus_images/matrona_vatican1.jpg Examples of the Nodus style]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livia]], wife of [[Augustus]], and [[Octavia Minor|Octavia]], sister of Augustus, particularly favoured the ''nodus'' style, both continuing to use it well into the Imperial Period.&lt;ref&gt;Further examples of the Nodus [http://www.vroma.org/images/mcmanus_images/octavia_aureus.jpg] and [http://www.vroma.org/images/mcmanus_images/julia_similar.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other styles in the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] era were designed to be simple, with hair parted in two and tied in a bun at the back. This was perhaps done in order to juxtapose Roman modesty against [[Cleopatra]] and her flamboyance.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner and Matheson (1996), 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flavian and Antonine hairstyles===
[[File:KAS843-vibia-matidia-back.jpg|thumbnail|Portrait of a Roman woman, Flavian period Rome, Musei Capitolini]]Flavian and Antonine hairstyles differed greatly between men and women in real life and in the physical appearance of hair for male and female sculptures. In ancient Rome hair was a major determinant of a woman's physical attractiveness, women preferred to be presented as young, and beautiful. Therefore, female sculptures were known to have dramatic curls carved with strong [[chiaroscuro]] effects. On the other hand, most men in the Flavian period of late first century CE have their hair trimmed short on the crown like the portrait of [[Domitian]] for example (pictured) that implied an active role in society, while a woman's connoted passivity.

[[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] and [[Nervan-Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] hairstyles are perhaps the most famous, and extravagant, of Imperial Rome's styles. During this time the aristocratic women’s style became the most flamboyant. The styles were lofty, with masses of shaped curls and braids. The high arching crowns on the front were made using fillets of wool and toupees, and could be attached to the back of the head as well as the front. Typically, as in the case of the famous Fonseca Bust (pictured), this particular hairstyle appears to have been popular during the Flavian period. The hair was combed into two parts; the front section was combed forwards and built with curls, while the back was plaited and coiled into an elaborate bun.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=%22Elizabeth+Bartman%22&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dau%253A%2522Elizabeth%2BBartman%2522%26wc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=26&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle Bartman (2001), 18]&lt;/ref&gt; This fashion was described by the writer Juvenal as the hairstyles that made women appear tall from the front but quite the opposite from the back.

The later Antonine Period saw curls at the front of the head brought to a lower level than the Flavian Period. The braids coiled at the back of the head were brought further forward, instead often resting on the top of the head. Another style of the Antonine period saw the hair separated into rivets and tied at the back&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Examples of the Antonine styles [http://www.vroma.org/images/raia_images/woman_head3b.jpg] and riveted [http://www.vroma.org/images/raia_images/woman_bust2.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, whether Roman portraits faithfully translate the actual hairstyles worn by the sitters is problematic because of the scarcity of surviving hair which leaves little basis of comparison. The second problem is the physical accuracy of the Roman portraits itself. However, as a result of the many sculptures that have some reference to hair, ethnographers and anthropologists have recognized hair to play a key role in identifying gender and determining societies in which individuals belonged.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Severan dynasty===

[[Julia Domna]], wife of [[Septimius Severus]], had a particularly notable hairstyle. Julia Domna was the wig's most influential patron. She wore a heavy, globular wig with simple finger-sized waves with a simple center parting. Julia Domna was the daughter of a high-ranking priest from [[Syria]], and it has been suggested that her style was indicative of her foreign origins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=%22Elizabeth+Bartman%22&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dau%253A%2522Elizabeth%2BBartman%2522%26wc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=26&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle Bartman (2001), 17]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being from the East, she adopted a wig to project a familiar Roman guise and particularly in order to imitate her predecessor, Faustina the Younger.&lt;ref name="Bartman 2001, 17-8" /&gt; In 2012 [[Janet Stephens]]'s video ''Julia Domna: Forensic Hairdressing'', a recreation of a later hairstyle of the Roman empress, was presented at the [[Archaeological Institute of America]]’s annual meeting in Philadelphia.[[File:Bust of Domitian (loan from Capitoline Museums) - Glyptothek - Munich - Germany 2017 (2).jpg|thumbnail|Bust of Domitian]]Foreign women often wore their hair differently from Roman women, and women from [[Palmyra]] typically wore their hair waved in a simple center-parting, accompanied by diadems and turbans according to local customs. Women from the East were not known to commonly wear wigs, preferring to create elaborate hairstyles from their own hair instead.&lt;ref name="Bartman 2001, 17-8"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/507324?&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=%22Elizabeth+Bartman%22&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dau%253A%2522Elizabeth%2BBartman%2522%26wc%3Don&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=26&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle Bartman (2001), 17-8]&lt;/ref&gt; As time progressed, Severan hairstyles switched from the finger-waved center parting style, to one with more curls and ringlets at the front and back of the head, often accompanied by a wig.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroma.org/images/scaife_images/092b.jpg Example of Severan style, finger waves underneath Palla]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Men's hairstyles ==
[[File:Villa del casale 13.jpg|thumb|250px|Boys with short-cropped [[Blond|fair hair]] hunting rabbit in a [[mosaic]] from the [[Villa Romana del Casale]], [[Roman Sicily]], 4th century AD]]
Roman hairstyles for men would change throughout ancient times. While men’s hair may have required no less daily attention than women’s, the styling as well as the social response it engendered were radically different. Lengthy grooming sessions for men would be looked at as taboo. Throughout the period as well, women’s hair was carved according to different techniques based on the sex. For example, one of the primary features that is seen in many women but never in men is long hair divided by a center part. It is apparent men never wore this, since there is no biological difference in hair between sexes this is a practice determined solely by culture. Eyebrows of both sexes were tended to be treated in the same manner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Artifice of Roman Female Adornment.|last = Bartman|first = Elizabeth|date = |journal = American Journal of Archaeology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early times, it is most likely Roman men wore their hair long. With the introduction of barbers called ''tonsors'' in about 300 BCE it became customary to wear hair short. In Ancient Rome, household slaves would perform hairdressing functions for wealthy men. However, men who lacked access to private hairdressing and shaving services or those who preferred a more social atmosphere went to a barbershop (''tonstrina''). Barbershops were places of social gatherings and a young man’s first shave was often even celebrated as a passage to manhood in the community. The barbers usually shaved the customers faces with iron razors and applied an aftershave with ointments that may have contained spider webs. Trimming a head of hair and shaving would be the rule in Rome in the second century BCE. Roman men who wore beards would not be admitted into the senate unless they shaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History|last = Sherrow|first = Victoria|publisher = Greenwood|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Westport, CT|pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient Rome it was desirable for men to have a full head of hair. This was a problem for Julius Caesar. Being bald was considered a deformity at the time, so Caesar went to great pains to hiding his thinning hair. And because of it he used to comb his thin locks forward over the crown of his head. Suetonius wrote: "His baldness was something that greatly bothered him." Caesar was allowed by the Senate to wear a laurel crown with which he was able to mask his receding hairline.

During the Roman times it is easy to know how the emperors wore their hair. For example, one constant feature of Augustus's portraits is his hairstyle, with its distinctive forked locks of hair on his forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/8212/unknown-maker-portrait-head-of-augustus-roman-25-1-bc/|title = Portrait Head of Augustus|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2017|website = Getty Museum|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor was most often looked at as the trendsetter during these times. This is shown by the emperor Nero (54–68 CE) who adopted elaborate hairstyles with curls and even had sideburns. Men began to curl their hair more and Nero started the trend. Following in the Flavian period most men have hair trimmed short on the crown and lacking strong plasticity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the next few decades a straight hair cut with forehead bangs was popular with Trajanic men. Another trend that was started by Emperor Hadrian (117–138 CE). He was the first emperor to wear a beard, and after him many of the emperors continued the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.tribunesandtriumphs.org/roman-clothing/roman-hairstyles.htm|title = Roman Hairstyles|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2017|website = Tribunes and Triumphs|publisher = |last = Alchin|first = Linda}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has usually been seen as a mark of his devotion to Greece and Greek culture. One literary source, the ''Historia Augusta'', claims that Hadrian wore a beard to hide blemishes on his face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = British Museum - Hadrian – the image of a ruler|url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/leaders_and_rulers/hadrian/the_image_of_a_ruler.aspx|website = www.britishmuseum.org|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Prize==
The December 1968 issue of the Review carried a brief obituary of Professor T. S. Ashton (1889-1968) by A. H. John and a flier announcing the intention to establish the Prize, initially endowed by Mrs Ashton with the sum of £500. Further donations were sought from EHS members and an initial prize suggested of £50, to be awarded annually. The Prize was formally announced in the April 1970 issue of the Review. In 1981, the value of the Prize was raised to £150, with the intention of making an award every other year. The value was raised to its current value of £750 in 1998.

Note: The Economic History Society's archives at the [[London School of Economics]] include a file, 'Correspondence relating to the TS Ashton Prize, 1971-82.'

* 28th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian texts describe [[electric fish]]. They refer to them as the "Thunderer of the [[Nile]]", and described them as the "protectors" of all other fish.&lt;ref name="moller"&gt;{{citation|title=Review: Electric Fish|first=Peter|last=Moller|journal=BioScience|volume=41|issue=11|date=December 1991|pages=794–6 [794]|doi=10.2307/1311732|jstor=1311732|last2=Kramer|first2=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] observes that rubbing fur on various substances, such as [[amber]], would cause an attraction between the two, which is now known to be caused by [[static electricity]]. He noted that the amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair and that if the amber was rubbed sufficiently a spark would jump.

* 3rd century BC &amp;mdash; The [[Baghdad Battery]] is dated from this period. It resembles a [[galvanic cell]] and is believed by some to have been used for [[electroplating]], although there is no common consensus on the purpose of these devices nor whether they were, indeed, even electrical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2804257.stm |first=Arran |last=Frood  |title=Riddle of 'Baghdad's batteries' |newspaper=BBC News |date=27 February 2003 |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1st century BC &amp;mdash; Pliny in his Natural History records the story of a shepherd Magnes who discovered the magnetic properties of some iron stones, "''it is said, made this discovery, when, upon taking his herds to pasture, he found that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrel of his staff adhered to the ground.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.dedication |author=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |chapter=Dedication|series=Perseus Collection: Greek and Roman Materials|publisher=Department of the Classics, Tufts University |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 130 AD. &amp;mdash; [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] (in his work ''Optics'') wrote about the properties of [[light]] including: [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], and [[color]] and tabulated [[angle]]s of [[refraction]] for several media
* 8th century AD &amp;mdash; Electric fish are reported by [[Islamic geography|Arabic naturalists]] and [[Islamic medicine|physicians]].&lt;ref name="moller"/&gt;

* 14th century AD &amp;mdash; Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of [[lightning]], and [[electricity]] from any other source, is to be attributed to the [[Arabs]], who before the 15th century had the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for lightning (''raad'') applied to the [[electric ray]].&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana"&gt;''The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]; a library of universal knowledge'' (1918), [[New York City|New York]]: Encyclopedia Americana Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1550 &amp;mdash; [[Gerolamo Cardano]] writes about electricity in ''De Subtilitate'' distinguishing, perhaps for the first time, between electrical and magnetic forces.

==17th century==
* 1600 &amp;mdash; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] publishes ''De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure'' ("On the Magnet and Magnetic bodies, and on that Great Magnet the Earth"), Europe's then current standard on electricity and magnetism. He experimented with and noted the different character of electrical and magnetic forces. In addition to known ancient Greeks' observations of the electrical properties of rubbed amber, he experimented with a needle balanced on a pivot, and found that the needle was non-directionally affected by many materials such as alum, arsenic, hard resin, [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], glass, gum-mastic, mica, rock-salt, sealing wax, slags, sulfur, and precious stones such as amethyst, [[beryl]], diamond, opal, and sapphire. He noted that electrical charge could be stored by covering the body with a non-conducting substance such as silk. He described the method of artificially magnetizing iron. His [[terrella]] (little earth), a sphere cut from a lodestone on a metal lathe, modeled the earth as a lodestone (magnetic iron ore) and demonstrated that every lodestone has fixed poles, and how to find them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=2 |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeII/chap18.html |chapter=Part IV.

He experimented with such physical models in an attempt to explain problems in [[navigation]] due varying properties of the [[magnetic compass]] with respect to their location on the earth, such as [[magnetic declination]] and magnetic inclination. His experiments explained the [[Dip circle|dipping of the needle]] by the magnetic attraction of the earth, and were used to predict where the vertical dip would be found. Such magnetic inclination was described as early as the 11th century by [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' and further investigated in 1581 by retired mariner and [[Compasssmith|compass maker]] [[Robert Norman]], as described in his pamphlet, ''The Newe Attractive.'' The gilbert, a unit of [[magnetomotive force]] or [[magnetic potential]], was named in his honor.

This has been described as the beginning of electrical communication.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=David H.|last2=Clark|first2=Stephen P.H.|title=Newton's tyranny : the suppressed scientific discoveries of Stephen Gray and John Flamsteed|date=2001|publisher=Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9780716747017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} This was also the first distinction between the roles of conductors and insulators (names applied by [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desaguliers]], mathematician and [[Royal Society]] member, who stated that Gray "has made greater variety of electrical experiments than all the philosophers of this and the last age.")&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} Georges-Louis LeSage built a [[electrical telegraph|static electricity telegraph]] in 1774, based upon the same principles discovered by Gray.
* 1732 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] Shows that all objects, except metals, animals, and liquids, can be electrified by rubbing them and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an electrostatic generators
* 1734 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay|Charles François de Cisternay DuFay]] (inspired by Gray's work to perform electrical experiments) dispels the effluvia theory by his paper in Volume 38 of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,'' describing his discovery of the distinction between two kinds of electricity: "resinous," produced by rubbing bodies such as amber, copal, or [[Lac|gum-lac]] with silk or paper, and "vitreous," by rubbing bodies as glass, rock crystal, or precious stones with hair or wool. He also posited the principle of mutual attraction for unlike forms and the repelling of like forms and that "from this principle one may with ease deduce the explanation of a great number of other phenomena." The terms resinous and vitreous were later replaced with the terms "positive" and "negative" by [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] and Benjamin Franklin.
* 1737 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] and [[Francis Hauksbee the younger]]{{fact|date=May 2013}} independently discover two kinds of frictional electricity: one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin (later identified as positive and negative electrical charges).
* 1740 &amp;mdash; [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], in ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', explains the process of [[refraction]].
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of Leiden (Leyden) independently discovers the [[Leyden jar|Leyden (Leiden) jar]], a primitive [[capacitor]] or "condenser" (term coined by Volta in 1782, derived from the Italian ''condensatore''), with which the transient electrical energy generated by current friction machines could now be stored. He and his student Andreas Cunaeus used a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed. He charged the jar by touching a wire leading from the electrical machine with one hand while holding the outside of the jar with the other. The energy could be discharged by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally his hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. He also found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on a table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with one hand and touching the wire connected to the electrical machine with the other.
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] of independently invents the capacitor: a glass jar coated inside and out with metal. The inner coating was connected to a rod that passed through the lid and ended in a metal sphere. By having this thin layer of glass insulation (a [[dielectric]]) between two large, closely spaced plates, von Kleist found the energy density could be increased dramatically compared with the situation with no insulator. [[Daniel Gralath]] improved the design and was also the first to combine several jars to form a battery strong enough to kill birds and small animals upon discharge.
* 1746 &amp;mdash; [[Leonhard Euler]] develops the wave theory of light refraction and dispersion
* 1747 &amp;mdash; [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], while experimenting with a Leyden jar, observes that a discharge of static electricity causes [[electric current]] to flow and develops the concept of an electrical potential ([[voltage]]).
* 1752 &amp;mdash; [[Benjamin Franklin]] establishes the link between lightning and electricity by the flying a kite into a thunderstorm and transferring some of the charge into a Leyden jar and showed that its properties were the same as charge produced by an electrical machine. He is credited with utilizing the concepts of positive and negative charge in the explanation of then known electrical phenomenon. He theorized that there was an electrical fluid (which he proposed could be the [[Luminiferous ether#The history of light and aether|luminiferous ether]], which was used by others before and after him, to explain the [[Light#Wave_theor|wave theory of light]]) that was part of all material and all intervening space. The charge of any object would be neutral if the concentration of this fluid were the same both inside and outside of the body, positive if the object contained an excess of this fluid, and negative if there were a deficit. In 1749 he had documented the similar properties of lightning and electricity, such as that both an [[electric spark]] and a lightning flash produced [[light]] and sound, could kill animals, cause fires, melt metal, destroy or reverse the polarity of magnetism, and flowed through conductors and could be concentrated at sharp points. He was later able to apply the property of concentrating at sharp points by his invention of the lightning rod, for which he intentionally did not profit. He also investigated the Leyden jar, proving that the charge was stored on the glass and not in the water, as others had assumed.
* 1753 &amp;mdash; C. M. (of Scotland, possibly Charles Morrison, of Greenock or Charles Marshall, of Aberdeen)  proposes in the 17 February edition of Scots Magazine, an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet and each connected to electrostatic machines.

* 1791 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers galvanic electricity and [[bioelectricity]] through experiments following an observation that touching exposed muscles in frogs' legs with a scalpel which had been close to a static electrical machine caused them to jump. He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the [[Battery (electricity)|galvanic battery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=3|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeIII/chap46.html |chapter=VII.

* 1799 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]], following Galvani's discovery of galvanic electricity, creates a [[voltaic pile|voltaic cell]] producing an electric current by the chemical action of several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs "piled" and separated by cloth or cardboard which had been soaked brine (salt water) or acid to increase conductivity. In '''1800''' he demonstrates the production of light from a glowing wire conducting electricity. This was followed in 1801 by his construction of the first [[electric battery]], by utilizing multiple voltaic cells. Prior to his major discoveries, in a letter of praise to the Royal Society 1793, Volta reported Luigi Galvani's experiments of the 1780s as the "most beautiful and important discoveries," regarding them as the foundation of future discoveries. Volta's inventions led to revolutionary changes with this method of the production of inexpensive, controlled electric current vs. existing frictional machines and Leyden jars. The electric battery became standard equipment in every experimental laboratory and heralded an age of practical applications of electricity.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} The unit [[volt]] is named for his contributions.

* 1818 &amp;mdash; [[Siméon Poisson]] predicts the [[Arago spot|Poisson-Arago bright spot]] at the center of the shadow of a circular opaque obstacle
* 1818 &amp;mdash; [[François Jean Dominique Arago]] verifies the existence of the Poisson-Arago  bright spot
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], Danish physicist and chemist, unites the separate sciences of electricity and magnetism. He develops an experiment in which he notices a compass needle is deflected from [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]] when an electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off, convincing him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a live wire just as light and heat do, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. He also observes that the movement of the compass-needle to one side or the other depends upon the direction of the current. Following intensive investigations, he published his findings, proving that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[oersted]] unit of magnetic induction is named for his contributions.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]], professor of mathematics at the Ecole Polytechnique, a short time after learning of Ørsted's discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, conducts experiments and publishes a paper in ''[[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]]'' attempting to give a combined theory of electricity and magnetism. He shows that a coil of wire carrying a current behaves like an ordinary magnet and suggests that electromagnetism might be used in telegraphy. He mathematically develops [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]] describing the magnetic force between two electric currents. His mathematical theory explains known electromagnetic phenomena and predicts new ones. His laws of electrodynamics include the facts that parallel conductors currying current in the same direction attract and those carrying currents in the opposite directions repel one another. One of the first to develop electrical measuring techniques, he built an instrument utilizing a free-moving needle to measure the flow of electricity, contributing to the development of the [[galvanometer]]. In '''1821''', he proposed a telegraphy system utilizing one wire per "galvanometer" to indicate each letter, and reported experimenting successfully with such a system. However, in '''1824''', [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] reported its maximum distance was only 200 feet, and so was impractical.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In '''1826''' he publishes the ''Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience'' containing a mathematical derivation of the electrodynamic force law. Following Faraday's discovery of  electromagnetic induction in 1831, Ampère agreed that Faraday deserved full credit for the discovery.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger]], German chemist, physicist, and professor, builds the first sensitive galvanometer, wrapping a coil of wire around a graduated compass, an acceptable instrument for actual measurement as well as detection of small amounts of electric current, naming it after Luigi Galvani.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]] announces his theory of electrodynamics, predicting the force that one current exerts upon another.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] discovers the [[thermoelectric effect]].
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] derives a mathematical demonstration that polarization can be explained only if light is ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin Fresnel]] phenomenologically explains optical activity by introducing circular birefringence
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[William Sturgeon]], founder of the first English Electric Journal, ''Annals of Electricity'', found that an iron core inside a helical coil of wire connected to a battery greatly increased the resulting magnetic field, thus making possible the more powerful [[electromagnet]]s utilizing a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] core. Sturgeon also bent the iron core into a U-shape to bring the poles closer together, thus concentrating the magnetic field lines. These discoveries followed Ampère's discovery that electricity passing through a coiled wire produced a magnetic force and that of [[François Arago|Dominique François Jean Arago]] finding that an iron bar is magnetized by putting it inside the coil of current-carrying wire, but Arago had not observed the increased strength of the resulting field while the bar was being magnetized.
* 1826 &amp;mdash; [[Georg Simon Ohm]] states his [[Ohm's law]] of [[electrical resistance]] in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, and also published in his landmark pamphlet ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet'' in '''1827'''. The unit [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (Ω) of electrical resistance has been named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/ohmlawexperiments.html |title=Georg Simon Ohm: The Discovery of Ohm's Law |publisher=Juliantrubin.com |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1829 &amp; 1830 &amp;mdash; [[Francesco Zantedeschi]] publishes papers on the production of electric currents in closed circuits by the approach and withdrawal of a magnet, thereby anticipating Michael Faraday's classical experiments of 1831.
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] began experiments leading to his discovery of the law of [[electromagnetic induction]], though the discovery may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi. His breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary electric current was induced in the other coil. He then found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, or vice versa, an electric current also flowed in the wire. He then used this principle to construct the [[Dynamo|electric dynamo]], the first electric power generator. He proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor, but did not complete that work. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields. That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which were to dominate the 19th century. His demonstrations that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field,  mathematically modeled by [[Faraday's law of induction]], would subsequently become one of [[Maxwell's equations]]. These consequently evolved into the generalization of [[Field (physics)|field theory]].
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Macedonio Melloni]] uses a [[thermopile]] to detect infrared radiation
* 1832 &amp;mdash; [[Pavel Schilling|Baron Pavel L'vovitch Schilling]] (Paul Schilling) creates the first electromagnetic telegraph, consisting of a single-needle system in which a code was used to indicate the characters. Only months later, Göttingen professors [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] constructed a telegraph that was working two years before Schilling could put his into practice. Schilling demonstrated the long-distance transmission of signals between two different rooms of his apartment and was the first to put into practice a binary system of signal transmission.
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] states [[Lenz's law]]: if an increasing (or decreasing) magnetic flux induces an [[Electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]], the resulting current will oppose a further increase (or decrease) in magnetic flux, i.e., that an induced current in a closed conducting loop will appear in such a direction that it opposes the change that produced it. Lenz's law is one consequence of the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. If a magnet moves towards a closed loop, then the induced current in the loop creates a field that exerts a force opposing the motion of the magnet. Lenz's law can be derived from [[Faraday's law of induction]] by noting the negative sign on the right side of the equation. He also independently discovered [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]] in '''1842'''; to honor his efforts, Russian physicists refer to it as the "Joule-Lenz law."
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] announces his law of [[Electrochemical_equivalent#Electrochemical_equivalents|electrochemical equivalents]]
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] determines the direction of the induced [[electromotive force]] (emf) and [[Electric current|current]] resulting from [[electromagnetic induction]]. [[Lenz's law]] provides a physical interpretation of the choice of sign in [[Faraday's law of induction]] (1831), indicating that the induced emf and the change in flux have opposite signs.
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Jean-Charles Peltier]] discovers the [[Peltier effect]]: heating by an electric current at the junction of two different metals.
* 1835 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Henry]] invents the [[relay|electric relay]], which is an electrical switch by which the change of a weak current through the windings of an electromagnet will attract an armature to open or close the switch. Because this can control (by opening or closing) another, much higher-power, circuit, it is in a broad sense a form of electrical amplifier. This made a practical electric telegraph possible. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon’s design, which used loosely coiled, uninsulated wire. He also discovered the property of [[self inductance]] independently of Michael Faraday.
[[File:International Morse Code.svg|right|thumb|180px|Chart of the [[Morse code]] letters and numerals.]]
* 1836 &amp;mdash; [[David Alter|Dr. David Alter]] invents and demonstrates to witnesses the first American electric telegraph in Elderton, Pennsylvania. In a later interview in the book, ''Biographical and Historical Cyclopedia of Indiana and Armstrong Counties'' he states: "I may say that there is no connection at all between the telegraph of Morse and others and that of myself...Professor Morse most probably never heard of me or my Elderton telegraph." In '''1840''' he invents an electric buggy, forerunner of the automobile. His inventions also include an electric clock and a short-range type of telephone, forerunner to Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He is also credited with the origins of Spectrum Analysis by his idea that every element has its own emission spectrum, and an expansion of spectrum analysis to include the optical properties of gases.
* 1837 &amp;mdash; [[Samuel Morse]] develops an alternative electrical telegraph design capable of transmitting long distances over poor quality wire. He and his assistant [[Alfred Vail]] develop the [[Morse code]] signaling alphabet. In '''1838''' Morse successfully tested the device at the Speedwell Ironworks near [[Morristown, New Jersey]], and publicly demonstrated it to a scientific committee at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. The first electric telegram using this device was sent by Morse on 24 May, '''1844''' from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., bearing the message "[[Book of Numbers|What hath God wrought]]?"
* 1838 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] uses Volta's battery to discover [[cathode ray]]s.
* 1839 &amp;mdash; [[Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] observes the [[photoelectric effect]] with an electrode in a conductive solution exposed to light.
* 1840 &amp;mdash; [[James Prescott Joule]] formulates [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]] (sometimes called the Joule-Lenz law) quantifying the amount of heat produced in a circuit as proportional to the product of the time duration, the resistance, and the square of the current passing through it.
* 1845 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] discovers that light propagation in a material can be influenced by external [[magnetic field]]s ([[Faraday effect]])
* 1849 &amp;mdash; [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Jean-Bernard Foucault]] measure the speed of light to be about 298,000&amp;nbsp;km/s

* 1861 &amp;mdash; the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|first transcontinental telegraph system]] spans North America by connecting an existing network in the eastern United States to a small network in California by a link between Omaha and Carson City via Salt Lake City. The slower Pony Express system ceased operation a month later.
* 1864 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his papers on a dynamical theory of the [[electromagnetic field]]
* 1865 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his landmark paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]], in which [[Maxwell's equations]] demonstrated that electric and [[magnetism|magnetic]] forces are two complementary aspects of [[electromagnetism]]. He shows that the associated complementary electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetism travel through space, in the form of waves, at a constant velocity of 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. He also proposes that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and that waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments. Using available data, he obtains a velocity of 310,740,000&amp;nbsp;m/s and states "This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other [[radiation]]s if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws."

While the earlier inventors had produced electric lighting in lab conditions, Edison concentrated on commercial application and was able to sell the concept to homes and businesses by mass-producing relatively long-lasting light bulbs and creating a complete system for the generation and distribution of electricity.
* 1879 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Stefan|Jožef Stefan]] discovers the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law|Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law]] of a [[black body]] and uses it to calculate the first sensible value of the temperature of the Sun's surface to be 5700 [[Kelvin|K]]

* 1888 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz|Heinrich Hertz]] demonstrates the existence of electromagnetic waves by building an apparatus that produced and detected UHF radio waves (or microwaves in the UHF region). He also found that radio waves could be transmitted through different types of materials and were reflected by others, the key to [[radar]]. His experiments explain [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], and [[velocity]] of electromagnetic waves.

* 1904 &amp;mdash; [[John Ambrose Fleming]] invents the [[thermionic]] [[diode]], the first electronic [[vacuum tube]], which had practical use in early [[radio receivers]].
* 1905 &amp;mdash; [[Albert Einstein]] proposes the [[Special Relativity|Theory of Special Relativity]], in which he rejects the existence of the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] as unnecessary for explaining the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Instead, Einstein asserts ''as a [[postulate]]'' that the speed of light is constant in all [[inertial|inertial frames of reference]], and goes on to demonstrate a number of revolutionary (and highly counter-intuitive) consequences, including [[time dilation]], [[length contraction]], the [[relativity of simultaneity]], the [[relativistic mass|dependence of mass on velocity]], and the [[mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].
* 1905 &amp;mdash; Einstein explains the [[photoelectric effect]] by extending Planck's idea of light quanta, or [[photons]], to the absorption and emission of [[photoelectrons]].  Einstein would later receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery, which launched the [[quantum mechanics|quantum revolution]] in physics.
* 1911 &amp;mdash; [[Superconductivity]] is discovered by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who was studying the resistivity of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures using the recently discovered liquid helium as a refrigerant.

Idzio's publications shine light on previously unknown or undocumented aspects of the activities of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]], the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]].

Idzio is thought to be one of the experts in Ukrainian history of the 9th-13th century, early Slavic culture, Celtic culture on Ukrainian territory, that the concept of the three brotherly Slavic tribes are a myth perpetrated by Soviet historians, that the Galician-Volynian State was also a myth of Soviet scholars which was much vaster than originally thought. Idzio search the archives of Moscow for the huge amount of materials taken out of Ukraine dealing with aspects of Ukrainian history.

Other topics where he has produced monographs include such topics as "The Ukrainian diaspora in Russia", [[Ivan Franko]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], [[Lesia Ukrainka]], Hryhory Skovoroda, the development of religious thought in Ukraine.

'''Wachtang Djobadze''' ({{lang-ka|ვახტანგ ჯობაძე}}) (March 8, 1917 – February 10, 2007) was a [[Georgians|Georgian]] [[art historian]] and [[Professor]] at the [[California State University, Los Angeles]]. During the [[Soviet Union]], he lived as an émigré in the [[United States]], and was the only Georgian scholar to have opportunity to travel to [[Turkey]] where a number of medieval Georgian churches and monasteries lay in ruins in the historical [[Tao-Klarjeti]] region and [[Antioch]]. He studied and described these monuments in several works, including ''Materials for the Study of Georgian Monasteries in the Western Environs of Antioch on the Orontes'' (1976), ''Archeological Investigations in the Region West of Antioch On-The-Orontes'' (Stuttgart : Steiner-Verlag-Wiesbaden-GmbH, 1986), ''Early Medieval Georgian Monasteries in Historic Tao, Klarjet'i, and Savset'i'' (Stuttgart : Steiner-Verlag-Wiesbaden-GmbH, 1992). In 1981, he discovered ruins of the medieval Georgian [[Gialia Monastery]] in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/MOI/pio/pio.nsf/All/AE9E2250A22AC7F0C225723B00600EB4?OpenDocument Excavations at the Georgian Monastery of Gialia (Yialia)(Pafos)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5020">[[File:Émile Cartailhac Muséum de Toulouse.jpg|right|thumb|Émile Cartailhac]]
'''Émile Cartailhac''' (15 February 1845, [[Marseille]] – 26 November 1921, [[Geneva]]) was a [[France|French]] prehistorian, one of the founding fathers of the studies of the [[cave art]]. He is perhaps best remembered because of his involvement with the [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] paintings.

He got interested in prehistory (studies of which were then just beginning) at a very young age. He made excavations around the [[dolmen]]s in [[Aveyron]], and also in [[Portugal]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. In 1867 he was the supervisor of the prehistory section at a [[International Exposition (1867)|world's fair]] in [[Paris]]. Two years later, he became the chief editor of the revue ''Matériaux pour l'histoire naturelle et primitive de l'homme'' founded by [[Gabriel de Mortillet]]. This position he held until 1887. From 1882 he taught at the university in [[Toulouse]] and in 1897 he was elected a curator of [[Académie des Jeux floraux]]. After changing his opinion about Altamira, he became one of the founders of the studies of the cave art and one of the scientists (together with e. g. [[Henri Breuil]]) who recognised its importance. With Breuil he made the initial survey of the [[Caves of Gargas]] at [[Aventignan]] in the [[Pyrenees]], and where Félix Régnault discovered Gravettian cave art in 1906. He was (together with Breuill and [[Marcellin Boule]]) one of the founders of ''Institut de paléontologie humaine'' in Paris (following a generous donation from [[Albert I, Prince of Monaco|Albert I]]).

== Cartailhac and Altamira ==
[[File:Altamira, bison, museum.JPG|left|thumb|A [[bison]] in Altamira]]
When [[Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola]]'s daughter María discovered the paintings in Altamira and Sautuola, together with professor Vilanova, published their findings in 1880, Cartailhac was one of the leaders of the scientists who, suddenly facing a revolutionary change in the view of the prehistoric man, ridiculed these paintings at the 1880 Prehistorical Congress in [[Lisbon]]. Due to this opinion, the members of the congress did not even visit Altamira. He changed his mind after several other caves with clearly prehistoric paintings had been found and visited the cave with Breuill in 1902. He apologised there to María de Sautuola (her father died in 1888) and promised her to do everything to clear don Marcelino's name (Sautuola had even been accused of forgery). His letter from 9 October 1902 says among other things: "We live in a new world". He also wrote a famous article, ''Mea culpa d'un sceptique'' in which he admitted he was deeply wrong, emphasized the importance of Altamira, accused himself of holding back the progress of his science, and harshly criticised himself for doing an injustice to an honest man and rejecting a thing without any investigation. Today, opinions about this article vary. Kleibl praises it as "one of the finest moments of prehistory" and a "brave article, showing no fear of hurting his" [Cartailhac's] "professional credit",&lt;ref&gt;Kleibl, Josef: Cesta za Adamem, Praha 1978&lt;/ref&gt; while [[David Lewis-Williams|Lewis-Williams]] writes about it as about an opportunist thing used calculatingly for Cartailhac's own benefit when his position was no longer tenable.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, David: ''The Mind in the Cave'', London 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
